AB  - Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is an acute blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes. Acute SJS leads to the acute inflammation of the ocular surface and chronic conjunctivitis. If not properly treated, it causes chronic cicatricial conjunctivitis and cicatricial lid margin abnormalities. Persistent inflammation and ulceration of the ocular surface with cicatricial complications of the lids leads to chronic ocular sequelae, ocular surface damage, and corneal scarring. The destruction of the glands that secrete the tear film leads to a severe form of dry eye that makes the management of chronic SJS difficult. The option that is routinely used for corneal visual rehabilitation, keratoplasty, is best avoided in such cases. We describe the management strategies that are most effective during the acute and chronic stages of SJS. Although treatments for acute SJS involve immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies, amniotic membrane transplantation is also useful. The options for visual rehabilitation in patients with chronic SJS are undergoing radical change. We describe the existing literature regarding the management of SJS and highlight recent advances in the management of this disorder. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rhabdoid meningioma is a rare meningioma variant, classified as WHO grade III. Although this tumor is known for its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, extracranial metastasis is rare. We report the rare case of a 31-year-old patient with rhabdoid meningioma which recurred several times despite gross total resection, radiation therapy, and gamma knife radiosurgery, and the last recurrence was associated with metastases to lungs, lymph node and bone. The patient showed no response to paclitaxel-carboplatin, or vincristine-cyclophosphamide-adriamycin chemotherapy, and succumbed to the disease. Metastases from rhabdoid meningioma prove to be a diagnostic challenge, and treatment for metastatic meningiomas is not optimized, thus necessitating documentation and interdisciplinary consensus on management protocols.

AB  - Kimura disease (KD) is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, primarily seen in young Asian males. The disease is characterized by a triad of painless subcutaneous masses in the head and neck region, blood and tissue eosinophilia, and elevated serum immunoglobulin E levels. We report an unusual case of a 40-year-old woman found to have KD of the breast which presented clinically as carcinoma, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of KD in the breast to be documented in the literature. The patient also had scabies, which may have provided the stimulus for hypersensitivity, which is considered to be the pathogenetic mechanism responsible for development of KD.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of infection, both in hospitalised patients with significant healthcare exposure and in patients without healthcare risk factors. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) are known for their rapid community transmission and propensity to cause aggressive skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia. The distinction between the healthcare-associated (HA)-MRSA and CA-MRSA is gradually fading owing to the acquisition of multiple virulence factors and genetic elements. The movement of CA-MRSA strains into the nosocomial setting limits the utility of using clinical risk factors alone to designate community or HA status. Identification of unique genetic characteristics and genotyping are valuable tools for MRSA epidemiological studies. Although the optimum pharmacotherapy for CA-MRSA infections has not been determined, many CA-MRSA strains remain broadly susceptible to several non--lactam antibacterial agents. This review aimed at illuminating the characteristic features of CA-MRSA, virulence factors, changing clinical settings and molecular epidemiology, insurgence into the hospital settings and therapy with drug resistance.

AB  - This clinical decision making hypothesis utilizes the metabolic fulcrum based approach to classify persons with diabetes into three categories: predominantly catabolic, eubolic, and predominantly [maladaptive] anabolic. This systematic arrangement helps define choice of injectable therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with predominant catabolism, may respond better to intensive insulin therapy. Dual action insulin, including premixed insulin and I Deg Asp (insulin degludec aspart), may be an acceptable alternative. Uncomplicated, eumetabolic patients with type 2 diabetes may use any of the various drugs available. Patients classified as having maladaptive anabolism may benefit from a GLP1RA. If this does not suffice, a GLP1RA + basal insulin combination may be effective.

AB  - Lipohypertrophy is an important insulin injection site reaction, which has clinically significant sequelae, including a greater risk of glycaemic variability and higher insulin dose requirement. This article describes the prevention of lipohypertrophy, using the concept of levels of prevention. It enumerates methods of primordial, primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary prevention of lipohypertrophy. Focus on patient education, site rotation, avoidance of needle reuse, and dose titration when shifting from injection in lipohypertrophic lesions to normal subcutaneous tissue, helps minimize the development and impact of lipohypertrophy.

AB  - Pediatric interventional radiology (PIR) comprises a range of minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that are performed using image guidance. PIR has emerged as an essential adjunct to various surgical and medical conditions. Over the years, technology has undergone dramatic and continuous evolution, making this speciality grow. In this review, the authors will discuss various vascular interventional procedures undertaken in pediatric patients. It is challenging for the interventional radiologist to accomplish a successful interventional procedure. There are many vascular interventional radiology procedures which are being performed and have changed the way the diseases are managed. Some of the procedures are life saving and have become the treatment of choice in those patients. The future is indeed bright for the practice and practitioners of pediatric vascular and non-vascular interventions. As more and more of the procedures that are currently being performed in adults get gradually adapted for use in the pediatric population, it may be possible to perform safe and successful interventions in many of the pediatric vascular lesions that are otherwise being referred for surgery.

AB  - Pediatric interventional radiology (PIR), which includes variety of procedures done under image guidance has emerged as an essential adjunct to various surgical and medical conditions, plays a significant role in the delivery of safe and effective care by reducing surgical risks, decreasing the length of hospital stay and reducing costs. The application of interventional techniques in children has been delayed over years as compared to adults due to lack of special hardwares/equipments, lack of adequately trained physicians and also the lack of awareness among the pediatric practitioners. This situation is gradually changing now owing to the advancements in technology. In this review, authors will discuss various non-vascular interventional procedures undertaken in pediatric patients.

AB  - The disease profile in the Indian population provides a unique opportunity for studying the host microbiome interaction in both infectious (amebiasis) and autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from a similar environment and genetic background. Analysis of fecal samples from untreated amebic liver abscess (ALA) patients, Entamoeba histolytica (Eh)-negative and -positive asymptomatic individuals, and pus samples from naive ALA patients revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus in asymptomatic individuals (Eh +ve) and ALA patients. Two anaerobic genera, namely Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus, were detected in naive ALA pus samples. Analysis of fecal samples from amoebic colitis patients showed a significant decline in population of Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides and leptum subgroup, Lactobacillus, Campylobacter, and Eubacterium, whereas a significant increase in Bifidobacterium was observed. Mucosa-associated bacterial flora analysis from IBD patients and healthy controls revealed a significant difference in concentration of bacteria among predominating and subdominating genera between ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and controls. In contrast to the mucosal studies, we found a significant increase in lactobacilli population in fecal samples of active UC patients. Another study revealed a significant decrease of Clostridium coccoides and leptum clusters in fecal samples of active UC patients along with decreased concentrations of fecal SCFAs, especially of n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, and acetate. We therefore found similar perturbations in gut microbiome in both infectious and autoimmune diseases, indicating inflammation to be the major driver for changes in gut microbiome.

AB  - This paper provides an up-to-date review of obesity and lower limb osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a major global cause of disability, with the knee being the most frequently affected joint. There is a proven association between obesity and knee OA, and obesity is suggested to be the main modifiable risk factor. Obese patients (Body Mass Index, BMI, over 30 kg/m(2)) are more likely to require total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The global prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980; by 2025, 47% of UK men and 36% of women are forecast to be obese. This rising global burden is a key factor in the growing rise in the use of TKA. It is therefore important to appreciate the outcomes of surgery in patients with end-stage OA and a high BMI.
   This review found that while OA is felt to contribute to weight gain, it is unclear whether TKA facilitates weight reduction. Surgery in obese patients is more technically challenging. This is reflected in the evidence, which suggests higher rates of short- to medium-term complications following TKA, including wound infection and medical complications, resulting in longer hospital stay, and potentially higher rates of malalignment, dislocation, and early revision. However, despite slower initial recovery and possibly lower functional scores and implant survival in the longer term, obese patients can still benefit from TKA in terms of improved function, quality of life and satisfaction.
   In conclusion, despite higher risks and more uncertain outcomes of surgery, higher BMI in itself should not be a contraindication to TKA; instead, each patient's individual circumstances should be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type I Chiari malformation (CMI) is a rare complication of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage that is usually reported after lumbar drain or lumboperitoneal shunt placement. It usually remains asymptomatic; however, even if it becomes symptomatic, symptoms are usually mild. There are only a few reports of acute foramen magnum syndrome following continuous lumbar CSF drainage, and acute foramen magnum syndrome after a single diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) has not been previously reported. We encountered this catastrophic complication in one of our patient.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old woman with a large supratentorial meningioma and associated asymptomatic CMI presented with holocranial headache. She underwent successful and uneventful excision of the tumor. However, she developed quadriplegia and respiratory arrest 48 hours following a diagnostic LP performed on postoperative day 9. She underwent urgent posterior fossa decompression after magnetic resonance imaging showed increased tonsillar impaction and swelling along with cervicomedullary compression. Postoperatively, she steadily improved and regained normal power after 3 months. Retrospective quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a small posterior fossa.
   CONCLUSIONS: The association of intracranial tumors and lumbar CSF drainage with CMI is uncommon. The documentation of a small posterior fossa signifies the importance of both developmental (small posterior fossa) and acquired (intracranial tumor/lumbar CSF drainage) factors in pathogenesis of CMI. Although the extreme rarity of acute deterioration following a single LP does not warrant LP to be contraindicated in such patients, documentation of resolution of CMI with postoperative MRI before performing lumbar CSF drainage (whether therapeutic or diagnostic), might be helpful in avoiding this rare complication.

AB  - Background and purpose: Stroke is a multi-factorial disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this case-control study was to determine the association between Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase G894T (rs1799983) gene polymorphism and susceptibility to ischemic stroke (IS) in North Indian population.Methods: In this present case-control study, genotyping was performed by using Polymerase chain reaction - Restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method for 250 IS patients and 250 age and sex matched controls. PCR results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Frequency distribution of genotypes and alleles were compared between cases and controls using conditional logistic regression.Results: Hypertension, Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Low Socioeconomic Status and Family History of Stroke were found to be independent risk factors for IS. Mean age of cases and controls were 52.8312.59 and 50.97 +/- 12.70years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between eNOS G894T (rs1799983) polymorphism and risk of IS [OR=1.57; 95%CI 1.05-2.37; p=0.028] under dominant model. Based on Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification, an independent association of large vessel disease (LVD) was observed with the risk of IS under the dominant [OR=2.09; 95% CI 1.17-3.75; p=0.01] and recessive [4.09 95% CI 1.06-15.68; p=0.04] models. All the observed genotype frequencies were in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both cases and controls.Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest that polymorphism in G894T position of eNOS gene might be a risk factor for IS mainly for LVD stroke subtype in North Indian population. Further large prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background. Survival of myeloma patients has improved considerably in the past decade. However, limited data are available on their long-term outcome. We analysed the data of 225 consecutive patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) at our centre.
   Methods. Between April 1990 and December 2013, a total of 225 patients with multiple myeloma (median age 53 years, range 27-67 years, 69.3% men) underwent ASCT. High-dose melphalan 200 mg/m(2) was used for conditioning. Before transplant, the patients received induction therapy with novel agents (thalidomide and dexamethasone, or lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone); or vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone; or alkylating agents (vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide and prednisolone; or melphalan and prednisolone). The response to transplant was evaluated using the European Bone Marrow Transplant criteria, and an intention-to-treat analysis was done.
   Results. Four-fifths (79.6%) of our patients had Durie Salmon Stage (DSS) IIIA and nearly a quarter (24%) of them had International Stage III disease. Before the transplant, 80.4% of patients had chemosensitive disease. The median interval from diagnosis to transplant was 10 months (range 2-128 months). Following ASCT, 197 (87.5%) patients responded. Complete response was obtained in 54.7%, very good partial response in 19% and partial response in 13.8%. At a median follow-up of 90 months (range 18-266 months), the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 32 and 85.5 months, respectively. The estimated PFS and OS at 10 years were 29.7% and 43.6%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the presence of extramedullary disease (HR 3.05, p < 0.001), and ISS III (HR 0.50, p < 0.02) predicted inferior OS. Extramedullary disease at diagnosis (HR 1.585, p < 0.03), and more than one regimen pre-transplant (HR 0.53, p < 0.02) predicted an inferior PFS. Complete response was a predictor of superior OS and PFS (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion. Complete response following ASCT is associated with good long-term outcome. Alternative treatment strategies are needed to improve results in patients who fail to achieve CR post-transplant and in those with high-risk disease.

AB  - The management of locally advanced cervix cancer has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decade. Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) (with cisplatin alone or in combination) is currently the standard treatment approach. CCRT results in a 5-year overall survival rate of 66% and a disease-free survival of 58%. About 30-40% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer fail to achieve complete response to CCRT; alternative approaches are needed to improve the outcome for such patients. Weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin for 4-6 weeks as dose-dense chemotherapy prior to CCRT could be one such potential approach. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy after CCRT in patients with positive lymph nodes, larger tumor volume and stage III-IVA disease needs further exploration. Adjuvant chemotherapy is also being investigated for early-stage (stages IA2, IB1 or IIA) cervical cancer with presence of risk factors such as lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space invasion and invasion depth of more than 10 mm, microscopic parametrial invasion, non-squamous histology and positive surgical margins. For patients with early-stage disease (IA2-IIA), short-course chemotherapy prior to surgery is associated with an improved outcome in many studies. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by fertility preservation surgery is feasible in carefully selected young patients with bulky stage IB1 disease. Recently, a number of molecular pathways have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. Bevacizumab - an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor - is associated with improved survival in patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer. Whether bevacizumab and other similar novel agents targeting molecular pathways could be used in front-line treatment along with cytotoxic chemotherapy is likely to be an area of research in future studies.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disorder, with increased risk of developing benign and malignant tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). However, the synchronous presence of multiple GIT stromal tumors and duodenal submucosal somatostatinoma, like in this 50-year-old female NF-1 patient, is very rare. She presented with hematemesis, malena, along with multiple neurofibromas all over the body. Thorough radiological and peroperative work-up revealed multiple ulcerated submucosal and serosal nodules in the proximal small intestine. Histological work-up revealed diagnosis of a duodenal submucosal somatostatinoma with multifocal serosal gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This case is being reported to highlight the rare coincidence of multiple GIT tumors in an NF-1 patient.

AB  - Aims: This study aims to evaluate the use of ultra-wide field (UWF) angiography in patients with Eales disease (ED). Settings and Design: Prospective observational case series in tertiary eye care center. Subjects and Methods: This study involved 17 patients diagnosed with ED, who underwent UWF fluorescein angiography. The angiograms were analyzed to look for additional information as compared to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study seven standard field. The impact of this information in the management of patients was analyzed. Results: 24 eyes of 17 patients with mean age of 26.3 years were diagnosed with ED and underwent UWF angiography. UWF fluorescein angiography was helpful in the documentation of peripheral retinal changes (in 67% of eyes), exact localization of capillary nonperfusion (CNP) (in 54% of eyes), and in determination of vascular involvement (in 21% of eyes). In 33% of eyes, immediate treatment plan changed because of changes picked up on UWF angiography. Conclusions: UWF angiography helped in the better documentation, exact quantification, and location of CNP areas and better determination of disease activity. UWF imaging may play an important part in the management of patients with ED.

AB  - Background: Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bilateral, symmetrical, noninflammatory corneal clouding (edema) present at birth or shortly thereafter. This study reports on an unusual delayed presentation of CHED with compound heterozygous SLC4A11 mutations. Materials and Methods: A 45-year-old female, presenting with bilateral decreased vision since childhood that deteriorated in the last 5 years, was evaluated to rule out trauma, viral illness, chemical injury, glaucoma, and corneal endothelial dystrophies. Tear sample was sent for herpes simplex viral (HSV) antigen testing. Genomic DNA from peripheral blood was screened for mutations in all exons of SLC4A11 by direct sequencing. Full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty was done and corneal button was sent for histopathological examination. Results: Slit-lamp findings revealed bilateral diffuse corneal edema and left eye spheroidal degeneration with scarring. Increased corneal thickness (762 mu m and 854 mu m in the right and left eyes, respectively), normal intraocular pressure (12 mmHg and 16 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively), inconclusive confocal scan, and specular microscopy, near normal tear film parameters, were the other clinical features. HSV-polymerase chain reaction was negative. Histopathological examination revealed markedly thickened Descemet's membrane with subepithelial spheroidal degeneration. SLC4A11 screening showed a novel variant p.Ser415Asn, reported mutation p.Cys386Arg and two polymorphisms, all in the heterozygous state and not identified in 100 controls. Conclusions: The study shows, for the first time, compound heterozygous SLC4A11 mutations impair protein function leading to delayed onset of the disease.

AB  - The advent of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has led to a paradigm shift in the management of advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. The key to success of these therapies lies in the precise identification of their molecular targets, i.e. sensitizing EGFR mutations. The variations in the prevalence of these mutations among different ethnicities necessitate regional studies for a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the disease and clinical decision-making. This is even more relevant for countries like India where genetic heterogeneity is a rule. Here, we make an attempt to review the epidemiology of EGFR mutations in India versus other Asian countries and the West. We also review the clinical experience with EGFR TKIs and suggest the way forward in a resource-limited setting. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate retinal neuropathy in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) with multifocal electroretinograph (mfERG), and to evaluate the simultaneous impact of retinal neuropathy and vasculopathy on visual acuity in subtypes of DME.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, controlled, investigative study conducted at a tertiary eye care center of Northern India included 79 eyes of 50 treatment-naive patients with DME (Group 1), 94 eyes of 50 diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy (Group 2), and 100 eyes of 100 normal volunteers as controls. Comprehensive ocular evaluation along with mfERG and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed for all patients. N1 and P1 mfERG waveforms in the two central-most rings of macula were evaluated for amplitudes and implicit time. OCT was used to sub-classify types of DME and evaluate macular thickness, ellipsoid zone (EZ), and external limiting membrane (ELM) disruption. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) relative to other variables was the primary outcome measure. The three groups were compared for all the parameters inclusive of OCT and mfERG patterns. Further, OCT subtypes of DME were analyzed for mfERG waveform patterns.
   RESULTS: All mfERG values were significantly lower in Group 1 and Group 2 as compared to Group 3 (P < .05). BCVA strongly correlated with central macular thickness, EZ, and ELM disruption scores in Group 1 (P = .001), but correlated modestly with mfERG waveform amplitudes in Group 1 patients with intact EZ and ELM only. BCVA correlated with mfERG amplitudes in patients with neurosensory detachment, but not in those with cystoid macular edema.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neural changes set in before the clinical changes related to vasculopathy manifest in diabetic patients. Neuroretinopathy in patients with DME affects all retinal layers symmetrically in early stages, but impacts the middle retinal layers severely in advanced disease form. BCVA correlates with electrophysiological changes till the time morphological features are visible when stronger correlation is seen with anatomical disruption.

AB  - Background In general, older patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) are felt to have lower recovery potential following surgery due to increased degenerative pathology, comorbidities, reduced physiological reserves and age-related changes to the spinal cord. This study aims to determine whether age truly is an independent predictor of surgical outcome and to provide evidence to guide practice and decision-making.
   Methods A total of 479 patients with DCM were prospectively enrolled in the CSM-International study at 16 centres. Our sample was divided into a younger group (< 65 years) and an elderly (>= 65 years) group. A mixed model analytic approach was used to evaluate differences in the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA), Nurick, Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores between groups. We first created an unadjusted model between age and surgical outcome and then developed two adjusted models that accounted for variations in (1) baseline characteristics and (2) both baseline and surgical factors.
   Results Of the 479 patients, 360 (75.16%) were < 65 years and 119 (24.84%) were >= 65 years. Elderly patients had a worse preoperative health status (p< 0.0001) and were functionally more severe (p< 0.0001). The majority of younger patients (64.96%) underwent anterior surgery, whereas the preferred approach in the elderly group was posterior (58.62%, p< 0.0001). Elderly patients had a greater number of decompressed levels than younger patients (p< 0.0001). At 24 months after surgery, younger patients achieved a higher postoperative mJOA (p< 0.0001) and a lower Nurick score (p< 0.0001) than elderly patients. After adjustments for patient and surgical characteristics, these differences in postoperative outcome scores decreased but remained significant.
   Conclusions Older age is an independent predictor of functional status in patients with DCM. However, patients over 65 with DCM still achieve functionally significant improvement after surgical decompression.

AB  - Statin plays a major role in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Inconsistent findings in the studies have been observed toward the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) using higher dose of statin. To examine this issue, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the association between higher dose of various statins and risk of ICH among patients with CVD. Literature was searched for studies published before June 10, 2015, using electronic database 'PubMed', 'EMBASE', and 'Google Scholar' as well as from many trial databases. The following search terms were used: 'Statin therapy' AND 'Cardiovascular Disease', AND 'Dose' AND 'Intracerebral hemorrhage', AND 'Randomized Controlled Trials' AND 'High Dose Statin'. High dose of statins was defined as atorvastatin 80 mg, simvastatin 80 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg per day. Fixed-effect model was used to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) if heterogeneity was <50%; otherwise, random-effect model was used. Begg's funnel plot was used to assess the publication bias. Seven RCTs involving 31,099 subjects receiving high-dose statin and 31,105 subjects receiving placebo were analyzed in our meta-analysis. A significant risk of ICH was observed in subjects with higher dose of statin (RR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.16-2.01; P = 0.002). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between the two groups (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.86-1.06; P = 0.36). No publication bias was observed through Begg's funnel plot. Higher dose of statins was found to be associated with the risk of ICH. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background Childhood injuries, especially the unintentional category of injuries, occur most commonly in the environment inside a child's home. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the presence of home hazards for childhood injuries in households in an urban resettlement colony in New Delhi.
   Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in an urban resettlement colony in Delhi. A hazards assessment tool was used to check the presence of hazards in the houses.
   Results A total of 225 households were included. It was seen that121 (53.7%) had a cooking stove within the reach of the child, and 190 (84.3%) had the gas pipe within reach. Fire hazard was seen in 84% of houses. About 78% of households did not have locked storage for chemicals.
   Conclusion The study revealed a significant burden of hazards for childhood injuries within their own homes, thus emphasizing the need for injury prevention interventions to reduce the number of hazards.

AB  - Background: Obesity is known to increase asthma risk and severity. Increased levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, are associated with mitochondrial toxicity, asthma, and metabolic syndrome. IL-4 upregulates the expression of protein arginine methyltransferases, which are essential for ADMA formation. Importantly, cross-talk between IL-4, ADMA, and mitochondrial dysfunction could explain how obesity and IL-4 can synergize to exacerbate allergic inflammation.
   Objective: We sought to investigate how IL-4, a key asthma-associated cytokine, can influenceADMA-related effects on lungs.
   Methods: BEAS2B (bronchial epithelial) cells were treated with IL-4 followed by ADMA and investigated for oxo-nitrative stress and resultant mitochondrial toxicity after 48 hours by using flow cytometry, confocal imaging, immunoblotting, and fluorimetric assays.
   Results: IL-4-induced mitotoxicity in BEAS2B cells was significantly higher in the presence of exogenous ADMA. IL-4 treatment led to proteolytic degradation of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2, which catabolizes ADMA. IL-4 pretreatment was associated with increased intracellular ADMA accumulation and increased ADMA-induced mitotoxicity. Airway epithelial cells treated with IL-4 followed by ADMA showed exaggerated oxo-nitrative stress and potent induction of the cellular hypoxic response, despite normoxic conditions. The hypoxic response was associated with reduced mitochondrial function but was reversible by overexpression of the mitochondrial biogenesis factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A.
   Conclusion: We conclude that IL-4 promotes intracellular ADMA accumulation, leading to mitochondrial loss through oxo-nitrative stress and hypoxic response. This provides a novel understanding of how obesity, with high ADMA levels, and asthma, with high IL-4 levels, might potentiate each other and highlights the potential of mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics in obese subjects with asthma.

AB  - A two-year-old child was hit by a car outside his home and was immediately taken to hospital. There were no external injuries present over the body except two small abrasions on the occipital region of head. A computed tomography scan of the head was performed which revealed no cranio-cerebral injury. He was discharged from the hospital within few hours apparently well. The child was absolutely asymptomatic for a week, after which he suddenly died while playing at home. Autopsy revealed left ventricular free wall rupture and pericardial haematoma. This case report discusses the rare incidence of delayed cardiac rupture due to blunt trauma resulting in haemorrhagic tamponade in an asymptomatic child.

AB  - Objectives: Opioids such as morphine form the cornerstone in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, opioids also produce serious side effects such as tolerance. Fosaprepitant is a substance P (SP) receptor antagonist, which is used for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. SP is an important neuropeptide mediating transmission of pain at the spinal level. Thus, it was hypothesized that combining morphine with fosaprepitant would increase the antinociceptive effect of morphine. The objectives were to evaluate the effect of fosaprepitant on morphine-induced antinociception in rats and to investigate its mechanism of action.
   Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with morphine (10 mg/kg twice daily) and/or fosaprepitant (30 mg/kg once daily) for 7 days. Pain threshold was assessed by the hot plate test. Expression of SP and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the spinal cords of these rats was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
   Results: Morphine administration resulted in an antinociceptive effect compared to the control group (day 1 and to a lesser extent on day 4). The decreased antinociception despite continued morphine treatment indicated development of tolerance. Co-administration of fosaprepitant attenuated tolerance to morphine (days 1 and 3) and increased the antinociceptive effect compared to control group (days 1-4). Expression of SP was increased in the morphine + fosaprepitant group.
   Conclusions: The results show that fosaprepitant attenuates the development of tolerance to morphine and thereby, increases the antinociceptive effect. This is likely linked to decreased release of SP from presynaptic terminals.

AB  - Extrapancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are rare tumors, which bear morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features similar to those of pancreatic counterparts. SPN occurs primarily in adolescent girls and young women. It is considered to be a malignant neoplasm with low-grade biology. Ovarian SPNs are uncommon, have benign morphology, usually limited to the ovary and local surgical excision is curative. We report an unusual case of SPN of right ovary with extraovarian spread and metastases to lymph nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second documented case of extragonadal spread of ovarian SPN.

AB  - Traumatic injuries, especially in maxillofacial region, not only lead to physical debilitation but also cause severe psychological distress in the affected individuals. Complete cosmetic and functional rehabilitation of such patients is a challenging task and thus requires a strategic treatment planning and a multidisciplinary team to execute the treatment. This patient report presents a patient who suffered with a severe glass cut injury leading to massive avulsion of face involving forehead, nose, upper lip, and anterior teeth. Patient was rehabilitated with a combined surgical and prosthetic approach, which involved flap repositioning in forehead, nasal and lip regions and an implant-supported nasal prosthesis to replace missing nose. Missing anterior teeth were replaced with fixed dental prostheses.

AB  - This study aims to establish a simplified molecular classification of glioblastomas (GBMs) based on molecular genetic alterations. GBM cases (n-114) were evaluated for IDH-1 and TP53 mutation by Sanger sequencing, PDGFRA and EGFR amplification by FISH, NF1 and YKL40 expression by qRT-PCR. Subsequently they were classified into four subgroups: classical like (CL), proneural like (PN), mesenchymal like (MES) and neural like (NEU). CL subtype was most frequent (39 %), followed by PN (32 %) and MES (20 %) subtypes. PN subtype had significantly younger age at presentation and longest survival (median PFS-82.5 weeks; 1 and 2 years OS-90.6 and 71.3 %). Other three subgroups had equally poor prognosis and hence, clubbed together as non-proneural (Non-PN) (median PFS-39 weeks; 1 and 2 years OS-66 and 0 %). Hence, we recommended this relatively easy method of subclassifying GBMs into PN and Non-PN which are statistically different in prognosis (both OS and PFS on uni and multivariate analysis). Although evaluation of six molecular alterations for identifying these two subgroups is still cumbersome, we propose segregation of PN subtype alone based on assessment of IDH1, TP53 and PDGFRA status, which is relatively easy and may be amenable to routine practice.

AB  - All-trans-retinoic acid plays a central role in mucosal immunity, where it promotes its synthesis by upregulating CD103 expression on dendritic cells, induces gut tropic (alpha 4 beta 7(+) and CCR9(+)) T cells, and inhibits Th1/Th17 differentiation. Recently, murine studies have highlighted the proinflammatory role of retinoic acid in maintaining inflammation under a variety of pathologic conditions. However, as a result of limited human data, we investigated the effect of retinoic acid on human dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cell responses in the presence of polarizing (Th1/Th9/Th17) and inflammatory (LPS-induced dendritic cells) conditions. We report a novel role of retinoic acid in an inflammatory setup, where retinoic acid-primed dendritic cells (retinoic acid-monocyte-derived dendritic cells) up-regulated CCR9(+)T cells, which were observed to express high levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of Th1/Th17 conditions. Retinoic acid-monocytederived dendritic cells, under Th17 conditions, also favored the induction of IL-17(+) T cells. Furthermore, in the presence of TGF-beta 1 and IL-4, retinoic acid-monocyte-derived dendritic cells inhibited IL-9 and induced IFN-gamma expression on T cells. Experiments with naive CD4(+) T cells, activated in the presence of Th1/Th17 conditions and absence of DCs, indicated that retinoic acid inhibited IFN-gamma and IL-17 expression on T cells. These data revealed that in the face of inflammatory conditions, retinoic acid, in contrast from its anti-inflammatory role, could maintain or aggravate the intestinal inflammation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) enables tumor reduction and conservative surgery. It is proposed in some studies that there may be an alteration in the hormonal receptor (HR) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2)/neu immune-expression following NACT. AIMS: To study the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her-2/neu receptor before and after NACT in LABC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HR and Her-2/neu status were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on 100 core needle biopsy of primary tumors and surgical specimens after receiving NACT (NACT group); fifty patients without NACT served as non-NACT group, and discordance was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In the NACT group, discordance of 17%, 13%, and 11% was noted in ER, PR, and Her-2/neu status, while in non-NACT group, discordance seen in ER, PR, and Her-2/neu was 8%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant alteration in ER and Her-2/neu status from the core biopsy to the treated resected tumor in the study group. As these changes may impact treatment, HR and Her-2/neu expression reanalysis in final surgical specimens is recommended.

AB  - Radiotherapy (RT) is a powerful tool for the palliation of the symptoms of advanced cancer, although access to it is limited or absent in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). There are multiple factors contributing to this, including assumptions about the economic feasibility of RT in LMICs, the logical challenges of building capacity to deliver it in those regions, and the lack of political support to drive change of this kind. It is encouraging that the problem of RT access has begun to be included in the global discourse on cancer control and that palliative care and RT have been incorporated into national cancer control plans in some LMICs. Further, RT twinning programs involving high-and low-resource settings have been established to improve knowledge transfer and exchange. However, without large-scale action, the consequences of limited access to RT in LMICs will become dire. The number of new cancer cases around the world is expected to double by 2030, with twice as many deaths occurring in LMICs as in high-income countries (HICs). A sustained and coordinated effort involving research, education, and advocacy is required to engage global institutions, universities, health care providers, policymakers, and private industry in the urgent need to build RT capacity and delivery in LMICs.

AB  - Objective To compare body iron stores in late preterm and term small for gestational age (SGA) infants with gestation matched appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) infants at birth and at 2 mo of age.
   Methods In this prospective observational study, live births of 34-42 wk gestation and SGA (<10th centile for GA) were enrolled along with gestation matched AGA (10th-90th centile for GA) infants. Infants' blood samples were taken within 2 h of delivery, and repeated at 60 +/- 7 d of life. Primary outcome was serum ferritin at birth and 60 d of age. Secondary outcomes were hematocrit at birth and 60 d and need for transfusion until 60 d of life.
   Results A total of 37 SGA (gestation 37.2 +/- 1.9 wk, birth weight 1861 +/- 401 g) and 30 AGA infants (gestation 37.3 +/- 1.9 wk, birth weight 2607 +/- 405 g) were enrolled in the study. There was no difference in the serum ferritin between AGA and SGA infants at birth {median [IQR]: 254.0 [214.3-293.8] vs. 259.7 [217.8-301.5] mu g/L; p = 0.85} or 60 d of life {147.2 [101.4-193.0] vs. 155.0 [106.6-203.6] mu g/L; p = 0.81}. Mean hematocrit was 55.5 +/- 9.6 vs. 52.4 +/- 5.0 at birth (p = 0.10) and 32.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 31.6 +/- 3.8 at 60 d (p = 0.77) in SGA and AGA infants respectively. No infant required blood transfusion during the study period.
   Conclusions Iron stores of late preterm and term SGA infants are comparable to term AGA infants at birth and 2 mo of age. Recommendations on iron supplementation to these infants need to be formulated through appropriately designed randomized trials.

AB  - The aim was to retrospectively estimate the prevalence of calcinosis in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and to identify risk factors associated with development of calcinosis in these patients. Retrospective chart review of 39 children diagnosed with JDM between 2004 and 2015 in a tertiary care hospital was done. Patients were divided into two groups, depending on the presence or absence of calcinosis, and the two groups were compared with respect to demographic, clinical, laboratory and therapeutic characteristics. Calcinosis developed in nine (23.1 %) patients. Delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment, prolonged duration of disease, the presence of joint contractures and cardiac involvement were significantly associated with increased frequency of calcinosis. Six out of nine (66.7 %) patients with calcinosis received alendronate therapy, out of which four showed partial reduction in calcinosis. In one case, surgical removal of tumorous clumps was done. Calcinosis remains a common complication of JDM. We found an association between calcinosis and delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment, prolonged duration of disease and cardiac involvement. Our study suggests that alendronate may be beneficial in management of calcinosis of JDM.

AB  - Background & objectives: Though newer antiepileptic drugs are considered safer than conventional antiepileptics, the effects of lamotrigine, levetiracetam and topiramate on neurobehavioural functions are yet to be established. This study evaluated neurobehavioural parameters and oxidative stress markers in brain tissue of rats treated with lamotrigine, levetiracetam and topiramate compared to sodium valproate.
   Methods: Five groups of male Wistar rats were treated respectively with normal saline (control), sodium valproate (370 mg/kg), lamotrigine (50 mg/kg), levetiracetam (310 mg/kg) and topiramate (100 mg/kg) for 45 days. Neurobehavioural parameters were assessed using elevated plus maze (EPM), actophotometer, rotarod, passive avoidance and Morris water maze (MWM) at baseline and at the end of treatment. Oxidative stress parameters [ malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)] were estimated in rat brain at the end of treatment.
   Results: Valproate and lamotrigine showed no significant effect on learning and memory in passive avoidance and MWM tests. However, levetiracetam and topiramate reduced retention memory significantly as compared to control (P<0.01) and lamotrigine (P<0.05) groups. Performances on EPM, rotarod and actophotometer were not significantly different between the groups. In comparison to control group, MDA was higher in the levetiracetam and topiramate (360.9 and 345.9 nmol/g of homogenized brain tissue, respectively) groups. GSH and SOD activity were significantly reduced by valproate and levetiracetam treatment. Lamotrigine did not induce significant oxidative stress.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Long-term and therapeutic dose treatment with levetiracetam and topiramate significantly impaired learning and memory, which was not seen with valproate and lamotrigine in rats. Levetiracetam, topiramate and valproate augmented oxidative stress, whereas lamotrigine has little effect on it. These antiepileptic drugs are used in clinical practice, hence pharmaco-vigilance studies are required to evaluate their safety profile.

AB  - Persistent truncus arteriosus is a rare congenital cardiac disease with variable presentation. The exact preoperative diagnosis and delineation of anatomy are very important because the optimal timing and procedure for truncus arteriosus repair are decided on the basis of the morphological characteristics. Moreover, the presence of associated anomalies influences the surgical outcome and mortality in these patients. Dual-source computed tomographic evaluation with three-dimensional post-processing is highly valuable for delineating its precise morphology and to identify and characterize the associated anomalies. Also depiction of the precise aortic arch morphology and simultaneous evaluation of the airway are very useful in treatment planning. This pictorial review provides an overview of the imaging spectrum of truncus arteriosus and various associated anomalies as seen on dual-source computed tomography.

AB  - Endoscopic pituitary surgery is useful in all micro- and macro-pituitary adenomas including those with suprasellar and cavernous sinus extension. The endoscope provides a panoramic close-up, a multi-angled view with excellent illumination and magnification, permitting complete excision of the tumor with preservation of normal pituitary. However, surgeons need to learn altogether different skills unique to endoscopy and the learning curve is steep. The learning curve can be shortened by proper selection of cases, gradual transition from the microscopic to the endoscopic approach, adequate sphenoethmoidal recess widening, identification of important landmarks during each stage of surgery, and use of neuronavigation. Results and long term outcomes can be improved with bimanual dynamic dissection and sequential tumor excision, preservation of normal pituitary, avoidance of arachnoidal tear and use of extended approach for tumors with large suprasellar extension. The gradual transition from microscopic to endoscopic approach, adherence to step by step technique and learning 'tips and tricks' of the endoscopic pituitary surgery reduce complications.

AB  - A novel nano-biocomposite scaffold was fabricated in bead form by applying simple foaming method, using a combination of natural polymers-chitosan, gelatin, alginate and a bioceramic-nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp). This approach of combining nHAp with natural polymers to fabricate the composite scaffold, can provide good mechanical strength and biological property mimicking natural bone. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) images of the nano-biocomposite scaffold revealed the presence of interconnected pores, mostly spread over the whole surface of the scaffold. The nHAp particulates have covered the surface of the composite matrix and made the surface of the scaffold rougher. The scaffold has a porosity of 82% with a mean pore size of 112 +/- 19.0 mu m. Swelling and degradation studies of the scaffold showed that the scaffold possesses excellent properties of hydrophilicity and biodegradability. Short term mechanical testing of the scaffold does not reveal any rupturing after agitation under physiological conditions, which is an indicative of good mechanical stability of the scaffold. In vitro cell culture studies by seeding osteoblast cells over the composite scaffold showed good cell viability, proliferation rate, adhesion and maintenance of osteoblastic phenotype as indicated by MTT assay, ESEM of cell-scaffold construct, histological staining and gene expression studies, respectively. Thus, it could be stated that the nano-biocomposite scaffold of chitosan-gelatin-alginate-nHAp has the paramount importance for applications in bone tissue-engineering in future regenerative therapies.

AB  - Background: Pulsed corticosteroids have been used successfully for the management of pemphigus. However, prolonged use of glucocorticoids may be associated with adverse effects and some patients show a poor response to conventional therapy. Biologics have shown a promising role in such cases; however, there is limited data from the Indian subcontinent. Objective: The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of rituximab in pemphigus. The secondary objective was to measure the cumulative doses of corticosteroids required for these patients. Methods: We undertook a retrospective review of records of 25 pemphigus patients (pemphigus vulgaris: 21, pemphigus foliaceus: 4) who had received rituximab infusion (rheumatoid arthritis protocol in 21 patients, modified in 4). Oral prednisolone was administered in dosages up to 0.5 mg/kg of body weight and tapered over the next 3-4 months according to the disease activity. However, other immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine were continued for one year after clinical remission was achieved. Results: Complete remission was observed in 22 (88%) patients. The mean time to disease control and complete remission was 1.10 and 4.36 months, respectively. Four (16%) patients experienced relapse after a mean duration of 11.75 months. The mean total dose of oral steroids administered was equivalent to 3535.64 mg of prednisolone. Exacerbation of disease was noted in two patients after the first dose of rituximab and infectious complications, pneumonia and cellulitis, developed in one patient each. Limitations: A small sample size, the retrospective nature of the study and unavailability of follow-up anti-desmoglein autoantibodies levels were limitations. Conclusion: Rituximab is an effective agent in the treatment of pemphigus. The use of rituximab enabled use of a lower initial dose of oral prednisolone in pemphigus and hence reduced its total cumulative dose. Severe side effects were rare.

AB  - Surgery is an established and increasingly utilized treatment option in medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Many psychiatric problems are known to complicate in the postoperative period. Most studies have a follow-up period of less than 24 months. We report the cases of three patients who developed severe psychiatric problems in the late postoperative period after successful temporal lobectomy for refractory epilepsy - Psychosis, major depression with psychosis, and severe anxiety disorder, respectively. None of the patients had past or family history of psychiatric disease. All three patients had undergone anterior temporal lobectomy on the right side for intractable epilepsy. They remained absolutely seizure-free after surgery. We conclude that psychiatric morbidity may arise de novo long after temporal lobectomy. This association between temporal lobectomy for epilepsy and late onset psychiatric morbidity should be carefully studied. Mechanisms underlying this late complication require deeper understanding of the effects of epilepsy surgery.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the long-term outcome of epithelial peeling and conjunctival replacement as a primary procedure in dysfunctional filtering blebs, without excising the bleb.
   Materials and Methods: A prospective, observational case series involving 34 consecutive eyes, having prior operated trabeculectomy with a dysfunctional filtering bleb, that met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed for at least 12 months. The bleb epithelium was peeled off and replaced with the adjacent conjunctiva, without bleb excision. Patients were reviewed at 1 week, 1 and 3 months postoperatively, and thereafter every 6 months for best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), applanation tonometry, bleb morphology and leaks, the lens status, glaucoma medications, and any complications. ASOCT was performed preoperatively and at the last review. Complete success (primary outcome) was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) > 6 and < 18 mm Hg without any additional antiglaucoma medications at the last follow-up.
   Results: The average age of the patients was 36.6 +/- 20.7 years. The average time of follow-up was 23.9 +/- 6.1 months (range, 13 to 40 mo). The mean preoperative IOP was 5.8 +/- 4.2 mm Hg. Post-operatively, the IOP at 24 months was 12.6 +/- 3.9 mm Hg (P < 0.0001). The bleb characteristics were graded according to the Indiana Bleb Appearance Grading Scale (IBAGS), which showed significant results in terms of the height (H), the vascularity (V), and Seidel (S) (P < 0.0001). The preoperative and the postoperative BCVAs in logMAR were 0.51 +/- 0.26 and 0.37 +/- 0.21 (P = 0.0001), respectively. Complete success was noted in 31/34 eyes (91.18%) and qualified success was noted in 3 eyes (8.82%). One patient developed a mild ptosis after bleb revision.
   Conclusions: Epithelial peeling of the bleb with replacement by advancement, without bleb excision, maintains bleb function and resolves bleb dysfunction in the long term.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO, EC 1.11.1.7) is a member of the mammalian heme peroxidase family which also includes thyroid peroxidase (TPO). These two enzymes have a sequence homology of 76%. The structure of LPO is known but not that of TPO. In order to determine the mode of binding of antithyroid drugs to thyroid peroxidase, we have determined the crystal structure of LPO complexed with an antithyroid drug, methimazole (MMZ) at 1.97 angstrom resolution. LPO was isolated from caprine colostrum, purified to homogeneity and crystallized with 20% poly(ethylene glycol)-3350. Crystals of LPO were soaked in a reservoir solution containing MMZ. The structure determination showed the presence of two crystallo-graphically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Both molecules contained one molecule of MMZ, but with different orientations. MMZ was held tightly between the heme moiety on one side and the hydrophobic parts of the side chains of Arg255, Glu258, and Leu262 on the opposite side. The back of the cleft contained the side chains of Gln105 and His109 which also interacted with MMZ. In both orientations, MMZ had identical buried areas and formed a similar number of interactions. It appears that the molecules of MMZ can enter the substrate-binding channel of LPO in two opposite orientations. But once they reach the distal heme pocket, their orientations are frozen due to equally tight packing of MMZ in both orientations. This is a novel example of an inhibitor binding to an enzyme with two orientations at the same site with nearly equal occupancies.

AB  - Background Mutations in known genes for inherited forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) account for <30% of familial PD (FPD) implying that more causal gene(s) remain to be identified. We attempted to discover the putative causal variant in an Indian family with autosomal-recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (ARJP), tested negative for mutations in PARK2, PINK1 and DJ1.
   Methods Whole exomes of two affected siblings were sequenced. Variants prioritised were screened for segregation with disease in the family by targeted sequencing. Gene thus identified was screened for index/additional exonic mutations, if any, in an independent PD cohort by PCR sequencing. Variants observed were functionally validated in differentiated PC12 cells.
   Results A novel homozygous frameshift mutation, c.89_90insGTCGCCCC in exon 1 of podocalyxin-like gene (PODXL, 7q32-33), resulting in loss of protein, segregated with disease in the family. Mutant allele was absent in 186 healthy controls screened by PCR sequencing and in control exomes available in the laboratory and public databases. Screening of additional 212 sporadic and 68 FPD cases identified three novel heterozygous missense variants namely c.1285C>A, c.1118G>A and c.881G>A in three unrelated cases. Significant differences in neurite branching and length (p<0.0001) were observed in PC12 cells with wild-type and mutant constructs.
   Conclusions Based on the genetic and functional evidence in this study and literature support on the role of PODXL in neural development, a novel frameshift mutation in PODXL seems to be the likely cause of ARJP in this family. This is the first report suggesting the possible role of a neurodevelopmental pathway in PD aetiology.

AB  - The positive outcomes of the transplantation of fetal neural tissue in adult rat models of a variety of neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease, in the 1970s, and its translation to humans in the 1980s, raised great hopes for patients suffering from these incurable disorders. This resulted in a frantic research globally to find more suitable, reliable, and ethically acceptable alternatives. The discovery of adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and more recently, the induced pluripotent cells further raised our expectations. The useful functional recovery in animal models using these cell transplantation techniques coupled with the desperate needs of such patients prompted many surgeons to "jump from the rat-to-man" without scientifically establishing a proof of their utility. Each new development claimed to overcome the limitations, shortcomings, safety, and other technical problems associated with the earlier technique, yet newer difficulties prevented evidence-based acceptance of their clinical use. However, thousands of patients across the globe have received these therapies without a scientifically acceptable proof of their reliability. The present review is an attempt to summarize the current status of cell therapy for neurological disorders.

AB  - Background: Signet ring cell feature in lung adenocarcinoma is no longer considered a distinct subtype, but as a cytologic change that may occur in association with multiple histological patterns. Cases with signet ring cells show a strong association with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene fusions and solid pattern.
   Methods: The cytomorphological findings of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with signet ring features (PASRF) was studied. Cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma which showed presence of signet ring cells either on cytology or histology were included in the study.
   Results: Out of 218 pulmonary adenocarcinomas diagnosed during the study period, 11 cases showed presence of signet ring cells (11/218). Out of the 11 cases, 7 had paired histology and cytology available, while the remaining 4 did not have a corresponding cytology sample. Majority of the cases (6/11) showed signet ring cells in more than 90% of the tumor area. All cases showed solid growth pattern. TTF-1 was positive in all the cases. Immunopositivity for ALK was seen in seven cases. The cytology smears showed single cells and clusters of signet ring cells, with either intracytoplasmic mucin vacuole and eccentric nucleus or histiocyte-like finely vacuolated cytoplasm with round nucleus and prominent nucleoli, the latter resembling alveolar macrophages.
   Conclusion: PASRF is commonly associated with a solid histologic pattern. Cases with predominant histiocyte-like pattern may be misdiagnosed on cytology; hence a high index of suspi-cion is required for an accurate diagnosis. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic and research technique widely used in clinical research. We describe here a novel and facile synthesis of a bisconjugated triazaspirodecanone moiety using 'click chemistry' as a key step in the synthesis of a triazole based macrocyclic MRI contrast agent. A bivalent approach has been applied to conjugate two triazole rings and triazaspirodecanone moieties across a four carbon spaced linker which is finally conjugated to DO3A to yield the desired MRI contrast agent, DO3A-bis(triazole-triazaspirodecanone), in an overall yield of 70%. All the intermediates and the final compounds have been characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry. In vitro experiments include cytotoxicity (MTT assay) and relaxivity studies. The potentiometric titration of a gadolinium loaded complex displayed strong selectivity for Gd3+ over physiological metal ions such as Zn2+ and Cu2+. IC50 values obtained from the MTT assay indicate the suitability of the synthesized conjugate as a safe diagnostic agent. The longitudinal relaxivity of DO3A-bis(triazole-triazaspirodecanone) was found to be 18.6 mM(-1) s(-1), which shows that the synthesized conjugate is a suitable MRI contrast agent.

AB  - Enteric fever due to Salmonella Paratyphi A (SPA) is a global problem occurring as outbreaks at times. An unusual SPA (2,12:a:-) variety durazzo has been reported rarely. We report an outbreak of enteric fever due to this variety affecting 43 individuals. The blood samples grew unusual mucoid, lactose non-fermenting colonies with atypical biochemical reactions in sugar fermentation and amino acid decarboxylation. Isolates had sensitivity to ceftriaxone, chloramphenical, cotrimoxazole, intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and resistance to ampicillin and nalidixic acid. Identification was confirmed as SPA (2,12:a:-) at the National Salmonella Centre.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the risk factors associated with development of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in patients undergoing different types of cataract surgery.
   Methods: Records of 200 patients presenting with pseudophakic retinal detachment (PRD) between January 2012 and July 2013 at a tertiary care center were reviewed. Duration and type of cataract surgery (phacoemulsification, extracapsular cataract extraction [ECCE], and small-incision cataract surgery [SICS]) and history of YAG capsulotomy with risk factors were recorded. Presence or absence of these risk factors was analyzed and their association with type of cataract surgery was evaluated.
   Results: Of these 200 patients, 137 were male and 63 were female. The mean age of the patients was 55.19 +/- 12.60 years and mean duration of cataract surgery to diagnosis of RRD was 8.64 +/- 5.15 months. Most patients underwent phacoemulsification (45%), followed by ECCE (31.5%) and SICS (23.5%). Most of the patients with PRD had complicated cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) in sulcus in 63%, anterior chamber IOL in 3%, and aphakia in 0.5%. There was no difference among the 3 types of surgery performed in mean presenting visual acuity, duration between cataract surgery and YAG capsulotomy, or number of posterior chamber IOLs. Incidence of posterior capsular rent (p = 0.02) and presence of vitreous in anterior chamber (p = 0.01) were significantly higher for patients with retinal detachment (RD) who underwent SICS.
   Conclusions: Many risk factors are associated with RD development after cataract surgery. More stringent efforts at improving the quality of cataract surgical training are likely to help in reducing the risk of PRD.

AB  - ObjectiveRadioimmunotherapy targeting CD20 receptors in lymphoma using radiolabeled chimeric antibodies may lead to better therapeutic responses than cold anti-CD20 antibodies. This study aimed to assess the biodistribution and present reasonable estimates of normal organ doses, including red marrow using Lu-177-DOTA-rituximab.Materials and methodsPatients with relapsed/refractory CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were recruited into this prospective study. In-house labeling of Lu-177-DOTA-rituximab was performed and administered after quality assurance. Rituximab (375mg/m(2)), followed by 50mCi (1850MBq) of Lu-177-DOTA-rituximab was administered as a slow intravenous infusion and emission images were acquired. Regions of interest were drawn for kidney, liver, heart, bladder, spleen, and tumor lesions on both anterior and posterior images. Internal dose estimation was performed using OLINDA v1.0 software.ResultsThe mean age of the 10 patients (eight men and two women) was 5213 years. The uptake of radiolabeled antibody was visualized within 30min of administration in the liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, and bladder. The coefficient of determination (R-2) was greater than 0.95 for organs and the whole body in all patients. The effective half-life of radioimmunoconjugate was 100 +/- 28h (42-126h). The critical organ in our study was the red marrow. The average total body dose, effective dose, and effective dose equivalent calculated in all 10 patients were 0.13 +/- 0.02, 0.15 +/- 0.03, and 0.22 +/- 0.04mGy/MBq, respectively.ConclusionThere may be considerable interindividual differences in absorbed doses of organs and generalization or extrapolation of doses in the clinical setting at present is not feasible with Lu-177-DOTA-rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. Patient-specific dosimetry is thus recommended to eliminate the variations and reduce the possibility of dose-limiting toxicity.

AB  - Seabuckthorn (SBT) pulp oil obtained from the fruits of seabuckthorn Fippophae rhamnoides L. (Elaeagnaceae)] has been used traditionally for its medicinal and nutritional properties. However, its role in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury of myocardium in rats has not been elucidated so far. The present study reports the cardioprotective effect of SBT pulp oil in IR-induced model of myocardial infarction in rats and underlying mechanism mediating activation of Akt/eNOS signaling pathway. Male albino Wistar rats were orally administered SBT pulp oil (5, 10, and 20 ml/kg/day) or saline for 30 days. On the day 31, ischemia was induced by one-stage ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min. SBT pulp oil pretreatment at the dose of 20 ml/kg observed to stabilize cardiac function and myocardial antioxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and inhibited lipid peroxidation evidenced by reduced malondialdehyde levels as compared to IR-control group. SBT pulp oil also improved hemodynamic and contractile function and decreased tumor necrosis factor and activities of myocyte injury marker enzymes; lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-MB. Additionally, a remarkable rise in expression of pAkt-eNOS, BcI-2 and decline in expression of IKK beta/NF-kappa B and Bax was observed in the myocardium. The histopathological and ultrastructural salvage of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of SBT pulp oil. Based on findings, it can be concluded that SBT pulp oil protects against myocardial IR injury mediating favorable modulation of Akt-eNOS and IKK beta/NF-kappa B expression.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the largest causes of death worldwide yet the traditional risk factors, although useful in identifying people at high risk, lack the desired predictive accuracy. Techniques like quantitative plasma proteomics holds immense potential to identify newer markers and this study (conducted in three phases) was aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins in stable CAD patients. In the first (discovery) phase, plasma from CAD cases (angiographically proven) and controls were subjected to iTRAQ based proteomic analysis. Proteins found to be differentially expressed were then validated in the second and third (verification and validation) phases in larger number of (n = 546) samples. After multivariate logistic regression adjusting for confounding factors (age, diet, etc.), four proteins involved in the reverse cholesterol pathway (Apo A1, ApoA4, Apo C1 and albumin) along with diabetes and hypertension were found to be significantly associated with CAD and could account for approximately 88% of the cases as revealed by ROC analysis. The maximum odds ratio was found to be 6.70 for albumin (p < 0.0001), followed by Apo AI (5.07, p < 0.0001), Apo CI (4.03, p = 0.001), and Apo AIV (2.63, p = 0.003). Down-regulation of apolipoproteins and albumin implicates the impairment of reverse cholesterol pathway in CAD.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is one of the most devastating childhood onset neurodegenerative disease affecting multiple organs in the course of progression. FRDA is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction due to deficit in a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Identification of disease-specific biomarker for monitoring the severity remains to be a challenging topic. This study was aimed to identify whether circulating cell-free nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in blood plasma can be a potential biomarker for FRDA. Clinical information was assessed using International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale and the disease was confirmed using Long-range PCR for GM repeat expansion within the gene encoding frataxin. The frataxin expression was measured using Western blot. Plasma nDNA and mtDNA levels were quantified by Multiplex real-time PCR. The major observation is that the levels of nDNA found to be increased, whereas mtDNA levels were reduced significantly in the plasma of FRDA patients (n = 21) as compared to healthy controls (n = 21). Further, plasma mtDNA levels showed high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (76%) in distinguishing from healthy controls with optimal cutoff indicated at 4.1 x 10(5) GE/mL. Interestingly, a small group of follow-up patients (n = 9) on intervention with, a nutrient supplement, omega-3 fatty acid (a known enhancer of mitochondrial metabolism) displayed a significant improvement in the levels of plasma mtDNA, supporting our hypothesis that plasma mtDNA can be a potential monitoring or prognosis biomarker for FRDA.

AB  - Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy is a common microvascular complication of long-standing diabetes. Several complex interconnecting biochemical pathways are activated in response to hyperglycemia. These pathways culminate into proinflammatory and angiogenic effects that bring about structural and functional damage to the retinal vasculature. Since Zingiber officinale (ginger) is known for its anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties, we investigated the effects of its extract standardized to 5% 6-gingerol, the major active constituent of ginger, in attenuating retinal microvascular changes in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.
   Methods: Diabetic rats were treated orally with the vehicle or the ginger extract (75 mg/kg/day) over a period of 24 weeks along with regular monitoring of bodyweight and blood glucose and weekly fundus photography. At the end of the 24-week treatment, the retinas were isolated for histopathological examination under a light microscope, transmission electron microscopy, and determination of the retinal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.
   Results: Oral administration of the ginger extract resulted in significant reduction of hyperglycemia, the diameter of the retinal vessels, and vascular basement membrane thickness. Improvement in the architecture of the retinal vasculature was associated with significantly reduced expression of NF-kappa B and reduced activity of TNF-alpha and VEGF in the retinal tissue in the ginger extract-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group.
   Conclusions: The current study showed that ginger extract containing 5% of 6-gingerol attenuates the retinal microvascular changes in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes through anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic actions. Although precise molecular targets remain to be determined, 6-gingerol seems to be a potential candidate for further investigation.

AB  - Oral vaccination is a safe, cost effective and non-invasive method suitable for mass immunization. We fabricated nanoparticle (NP) with 14kd polycaprolactone (PCL) entrapping hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) stabilized with Pluronics (R) F127 and used it as oral delivery vehicle. We evaluated its efficacy for specific antibody production and compared with parenteral routes of immunization in mice. We found a superior antibody response with a higher titer of anti-HBsAg antibody till 2 months following single oral administration compared to other routes of immunization and conventional alum-based HBsAg vaccine. The NPs with the antigen were found in the macrophages in small intestinal villi, peripheral lymph nodes and other reticulo-endothelial organs 2 months after oral administration. This study suggests the efficacy of the current nanocarrier system for efficient antigen presentation disseminated in peripheral lymphoid tissues following oral administration with a prolonged antibody response, which can minimize the requirement of booster dose.

AB  - A nanocomposite reservoir-type hydrogel dressing of poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) was fabricated by a freeze-thaw method and loaded with silver-nanoparticle-coated chitosan wafers (Ag-CHWs). The Ag-CHWs were synthesized by a sonication technique with silver nitrate (AgNO3) and chitosan powder. Scanning electron microscopy images showed silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a size range of 10 +/- 4nm on the surface of the chitosan wafers, and the antibacterial efficacy (minimum inhibitory concentration) of the Ag-CHWs was measured against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 mu g/mL), Staphylococcus aureus, (30 mu g/mL) and Escherichia coli (32 mu g/mL). The antimicrobial PVA hydrogel showed an improved tensile strength (approximate to 0.28 MPa) and gel content (approximate to 92%) in comparison with the blank hydrogels. Full-thickness-excision wound studies of the nanocomposite dressing on Wistar rats revealed enhanced wound contraction, improved inflammation response, re-epithelization rate, neoangiogenesis, and granulation tissue formation in comparison to the control group. A flexible, biocompatible, nanocomposite reservoir dressing not only established the chitosan as a stabilizer but also proved the efficacious and safe utility of AgNPs toward chronic wound management.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of implementing World Health Organization (WHO) low birth weight (LBW) feeding guidelines in First Referral Level health facilities in India.
   Methods This was a before-and-after study conducted at two First Referral Level health facilities in India. In the pre and post implementation periods of 4 mo each, the authors compared knowledge and skills of health care providers (HCPs) with regard to feeding of LBW infants using multiple choice and short answer questions and objective structured clinical examinations. The authors also enrolled in the two periods, separate cohorts of LBW infants along with their mothers at birth, and followed them till 2 wk of age or death/discharge. Quality of care received by the infants was assessed at 24-48 h and at discharge/2 wk using pre-determined parameters based on which quality scores were assigned by experienced neonatologists. Knowledge and skills of the mothers were also assessed at these time points through semi structured questionnaires and observation checklists. Guidelines were implemented using specially prepared training material through seminars, workshops, refresher courses and on-job support.
   Results Overall knowledge (62 +/- 16 vs. 75 +/- 15, n = 55; p < 0.01) and skill scores (298 +/- 37 vs. 348 +/- 52, p < 0.05) of HCPs improved. Correct knowledge increased among the mothers at the time of discharge (7.1 % vs. 63.4 %; p < 0.01). However, there was no improvement in maternal feeding skills at either 24-48 h or at discharge and key feeding practices remained unchanged. Though there was increased uptake of kangaroo mother care (0 vs. 21.9 %; p < 0.01) and alternate methods of feeding (15.9 % vs. 31.7 %; p = 0.03) by discharge/14 d, there was no significant improvement in overall quality of care of LBW infants (4.8 % vs. 6.7 %; p = 0.55).
   Conclusions For the Guidelines to be fully effective, additional efforts on part of HCPs/additional staff and efforts to promote generic early feeding practices in addition to LBW focused guidelines would be required.

AB  - Garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone is extracted from the rind of the fruit of Garcinia indica, a plant found extensively in tropical regions. Its ability to inhibit tumour growth has been demonstrated in certain cancers. In this study, we evaluated the potential anti-tumour effects of garcinol on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Three OSCC cell lines (SCC-4, SCC-9 and SCC-25) were treated with garcinol for 48 h and its effect on growth and proliferation, clonogenic survival, cell cycle and apoptosis was studied by MTT, clonogenic assay, propidium iodide (PI) staining and annexin-V binding assay, respectively. The alteration in expression of NF-kappa B and COX-2 was studied by western blot analysis and that of VEGF by ELISA. Garcinol treatment significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the growth and proliferation and colony formation of OSCC cells with a concomitant induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. It did not show toxic effect on normal cells. It significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the expression of NK-kappa B and COX-2 expression in treated cells as compared to untreated controls besides inhibiting VEGF expression. It appears that garcinol exerts anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, cell-cycle regulatory and anti-angiogenic effects on oral cancer cells through inhibition of NF-kappa B and COX-2. Thus, garcinol may be developed as a potential chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - We propose an innovative strategy of nanoparticle-mediated-peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) employing PLGA-nanoparticles together with anti-beta-hCG antibodies that can protect kidneys from radiation damage while simultaneously enhancing its tumor targeting and cytotoxic ability for somatostatin receptor (SSR) positive tumors.
   PEG-coated-Lu-177-DOTATATE-PLGA-nanoparticles (PEG-LuD-NP) were formulated and characterized. In vitro toxicity of these particles was tested on human glioblastoma cell line U87MG over a radiation dose range of 19-78 Gy, using MTT assay and flow cytometry. To further enhance cytotoxicity and test the feasibility of active tumor targeting, apoptosis-inducing anti-beta-hCG monoclonal antibodies were employed in vitro, after confirming expression of beta-hCG on U87MG. In vivo tumor targeting ability of these particles, in comparison to uncoated particles and un-encapsulated Lu-177-DOTATATE, was assessed by intravenous administration in tumor-induced wistar rats. Rats were first imaged in a gamma camera followed by euthanasia for organ extraction and counting in gamma counter.
   The particles were spherical in shape with mean diameter of 300 nm. Highest cytotoxicity that could be achieved with PEG-LuD-NP, on radio-resistant U87MG cells, was 35.8 % due to complex cellular response triggered by ionizing radiation. Interestingly, synergistic action of antibodies and PEG-LuD-NP doubled the cytotoxicity (80 %). PEG-LuD-NP showed the highest tumor uptake (4.3 +/- 0.46 % ID/g) as compared to Lu-177-DOTATATE (3.5 +/- 0.31 %) and uncoated-Lu-177-DOTATATE-nanoparticles (3.4 +/- 0.35 %) in tumor-inoculated wistar rats (p < 0.001). Renal uptake/retention was decreased 3-4 folds with these particles, resulting in the highest tumor-to-kidney ratio (8.58; p < 0.01) while tumor-to-liver and tumor-to-bone ratios were comparable to un-encapsulated-drug.
   Nanocarrier-mediated-PRRT is an effective way of targeting SSR positive tumors for enhanced cytoxicity and reduced renal radiation dose associated with conventional PRRT. To our knowledge of literature, this is the first study to establish in vitro and in vivo efficacy profile of nanoparticles in PRRT providing a stepping-stone for undergoing and future research endeavors in the direction of abating associated radiation concerns of radionuclide therapy and may offer a paradigm shift in PRRT strategy.

AB  - Plasma cell myeloma is a multifocal plasma cell neoplasm associated with increased monoclonal protein in serum and/or urine. Pleural effusions in patients with myeloma are uncommon ( 6 %). However, effusions due to direct infiltration of the pleura by plasma cells ( myelomatous pleural effusion) are extremely rare (<1 %) and usually seen with IgA myeloma. The diagnosis of such cases requires pleural fluid cytology, electrophoresis or pleural biopsy. We present a case of myelomatous pleural effusion diagnosed using flow cytometry immunophenotyping in addition to the pleural fluid cytology. A 45 year old female was diagnosed as plasma cell myeloma ( IgG kappa) in 2007. She received multiple lines of therapy during the course of her treatment including thalidomide, dexamethasone, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and doxorubicin based regimens. However, the patient had progressive extramedullary disease and developed pleural effusion in 2014. Cytological examination of the pleural fluid showed degenerative changes. Few preserved areas showed mononuclear cells including morphologically abnormal plasma cells. Immunophenotyping of these cells by flow cytometry revealed a pattern indicating neoplastic plasma cells. There was expression of CD38, CD138, and CD56, with absence of CD19, CD10 and CD45. This confirmed the diagnosis of myelomatous pleural effusion. Subsequently, the patient was offered a dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin based regimen but, she declined further treatment and succumbed to her disease 3 months later. Myelomatous pleural effusion is a rare complication of plasma cell myeloma. Flow cytometry can be used as an adjunctive technique in its diagnosis particularly in cases with equivocal cytology and electrophoresis findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after conventional brilliant blue (BB) assisted macular hole (MH) surgery versus BB selective staining using whole blood (WB) in MH surgery.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty eyes with stage 4 idiopathic MH with a clear media were randomly divided into two equal groups. Group A eyes underwent sequential intraoperative use of autologous heparinized WB followed by BB dye for staining internal limiting membrane, whereas eyes in group B were subjected to conventional BB staining. Clinical examination and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was done preoperatively and postoperatively up to 6 months.
   RESULTS: Mean global RNFL thickness and mean temporal RNFL thickness decreased in both groups postoperatively, but the reduction in RNFL thickness in group B was greater than group A at all postoperative visits (P < .05).
   CONCLUSION: BB toxicity may be responsible for reduction of RNFL thickness and WB appears to protect RNFL against dye toxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In India, approx. 70% of the adolescent girls are anaemic (haemolgobin <120 g/l). The present study was a supervised randomised double-blind clinical trial conducted among adolescent girls (11-18 years) to assess and compare the impact of weekly iron folic acid (IFA) supplementation with or without vitamin B12 on reduction in the prevalence of anaemia and on blood/serum levels of haemoglobin, serum ferritin, folic acid and vitamin B12.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Community-based randomized controlled trial was carried out in Kirti Nagar slums of West Delhi. A total of 446 mild (100-119 g/l) and moderate (70-99 g/l) anaemic volunteer adolescent girls were identified and randomised into two groups. Weekly supervised supplementation was given for 26 weeks: Group A (n = 222): iron (100 mg), folic acid (500 mcg) and placebo; Group B (n = 224): iron (100 mg), folic acid (500 mcg) and cyanocobalamin (500 mcg for 6 weeks and 15 mcg for 20 weeks). Haemoglobin, serum ferritin, folic acid and vitamin B12 levels were assessed at baseline and after intervention. A total of 373 subjects completed 26 weeks of supplementation successfully.
   RESULTS: The mean haemoglobin increased from 106.7 +/- 11.2 g/l and 108.9 +/- 8.91 g/l in Group A and Group B at baseline to 116.4 +/- 10.8 g/l (P < 0.001) and 116.5 +/- 10.26 g/l (P < 0.001) at post-intervention, respectively, with the reduction in the prevalence of anaemia by 35.9% in Group A and 39.7% in Group B (P > 0.05). A total of 63.3% participants had deficient vitamin B12 levels (<203 pg/ml) at baseline, which reduced to 40.4% after intervention with cyanocobalamin, whereas no change was observed in vitamin B12 status in the other group. Significant reduction (P = 0.01) in the prevalence of serum ferritin deficiency (<15 ng/ml) was observed in the group supplemented with vitamin B12 (from 36.5 to 6.4%) as compared with the other group supplemented with only IFA (from 39.1 to 15.2%).
   CONCLUSIONS: IFA supplementation with or without vitamin B12 is an effective measure to cure anaemia. Although addition of vitamin B12 had similar impact on improving haemoglobin status as IFA alone, it resulted in better ferritin status. Hence, more multi-centre studies with a longer duration of supplementation or higher dose of vitamin B12 may be undertaken to assess the possible impact of vitamin B12 on improving haemoglobin levels in the population.

AB  - One of the major reasons for laparoscopy not having gained popularity for repair of groin hernia is the perceived steep learning curve. This study was conducted to assess the learning curve and to predict the number of cases required for a surgeon to become proficient in laparoscopic groin hernia repair, by comparing two laparoscopic surgeons. The learning curve evaluation parameters included operative time, conversions, intraoperative complications and postoperative complications, and these were compared between the senior and the junior surgeon. One hundred thirty-eight cases were performed by the senior surgeon, and 63 cases by the junior surgeon. Both were comparable in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications. Using the moving average method, minimum of 13 laparoscopic hernia repairs are required to reach at par the operating time of an experienced surgeon. For total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair, the number of cases was 14; and for transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair, this number was 13.

AB  - Background: The treatment practices for vitamin D deficiency rickets are highly variable. Though a single intramuscular (IM) megadose of vitamin D is economical, and ensures good compliance, it poses the risk of hypervitaminosis D. This observational study was conducted to assess the duration of effect and safety of single IM megadose of cholecalciferol in the treatment of vitamin D deficiency rickets.
   Methods: Children younger than 14 years with rickets were enrolled. Baseline investigations included radiograph of wrists and estimation of serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25(OH) vitamin D and parathormone (PTH) levels. All children received a single IM megadose of vitamin D3. Biochemical parameters were re-evaluated at 1.5, 3 and 6 months after the megadose and the values were compared to the baseline.
   Results: We enrolled 21 children, out of which nine remained under active follow-up till 6 months. Radiological evidence of rickets was present in all 21 children, 14 had hypocalcemia at the time of presentation. After IM cholecalciferol megadose, median 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] level remained significantly more than the baseline till 6 months after the megadose. At 1.5 months after the vitamin D megadose, three (30%) of the children were found to develop toxic levels of vitamin D (>150 ng/mL), although none had hypercalcemia or any clinical manifestation of vitamin D toxicity. At 3 months and 6 months after the megadose, 25(OH)D levels remained in the sufficient range (20-100 ng/mL) in seven out of the eight children who came for follow-up.
   Conclusions: A single IM megadose of vitamin D may be effective in significantly increasing the 25(OH)D levels for at least 6 months in children with rickets, but elevation of 25(OH)D to toxic range raises concern regarding its safety.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;16)(p11;q13) is a distinct clinical and morphological entity with poor prognosis, which is characterized by a high frequency of extramedullary involvement, most commonly leukemia cutis;association with therapy related AML; frequent coagulopathy and morphologic features overlapping acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL). Herein, we present a case of 47 year-old post-menopausal woman developing secondary AML with t(8;16)(p11;q13) after 1 year of completion of therapy for breast carcinoma. Blasts were granulated with few showing clefted nucleus resembling promyelocytes and immnuophenotyping showed high side scatter with MPO positivity and CD 34 and HLA-DR negativity. In view of promyelocyte like morphology and immunophenotyping of blasts, possibility of APL was considered but, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PML-RAR alpha fusion transcript came out to be negative. Conventional cytogenetics showed t(8;16)(p11;q13). So, we should keep possibility of t(8;16) (p11;q13) in therapy related acute myeloid leukemia in patient showing clinical and morphological features of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

AB  - Background & objectives: Mutation of nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene in the absence of FLT3-ITD (FMS related tyrosine kinase 3 - internal tandem duplications) mutation carries a good prognosis in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). NPM1, a multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, gets trapped in the cytoplasm when mutated. Immunohistochemical (IHC) demonstration of its aberrant cytoplasmic location (NPMc+) has been suggested as a simple substitute for the standard screening molecular method. This study was aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of IHC on formalin fixed bone marrow biopsies in comparison with the reference molecular method (allele specific oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction; ASO-PCR) to predict NPM1 mutation status in AML patients.
   Methods: NPM protein IHC was performed using mouse anti-NPM monoclonal antibody on 35 paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies of patients with primary AML of any French-American-British (FAB) subtype. Results of IHC were compared with those of ASO-PCR.
   Results: Of the 35 AML patients, 21 (60%) were positive for NPM1 exon 12 gene mutation by ASO-PCR, 19 (90.47%) of these 21 were NPMc+. Thirteen of the 35 patients were negative by both the methods. One NPMc+ patient was not detected by ASO-PCR. IHC had a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 93 per cent, respectively, compared to the molecular screening gold standard.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Mutation of NPM1 determined by the widely available and inexpensive IHC agrees closely with results of the standard molecular methods. Thus, technically and financially not well endowed laboratories can provide the prognostically and potentially therapeutically important information on NPM1 mutation using IHC.

AB  - Background: Glucose requirement in neonates during surgery and the impact of glucose supplementation on neonatal metabolism remain unclear.
   Aim: This study was designed to identify an appropriate perioperative fluid regimen in neonates which maintains carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis.
   Methods: Forty-five neonates undergoing primary repair of a trachea-esophageal fistula were randomly allocated into three groups. During surgery, the neonates received either 1% dextrose in Ringer lactate (RL) (group D1) at 10 ml.kg(-1).h(-1), or 2% dextrose in RL (group D2) at 10 ml.kg(-1).h(-1), or 10% dextrose in N/5 saline at 4 ml.kg(-1).h(-1) and replacement fluid with 6 ml.kg(-1).h(-1) of RL (group D4). Glucose homeostasis, electrolyte balance, acid-base status, and endocrine and metabolic parameters were compared among the groups during the perioperative period.
   Results: Blood glucose increased in all the three groups at the end of surgery, with no significant difference in blood glucose and incidence of hyperglycemia (BG > 150 mg.dl(-1)) among them. At 24 h after surgery, blood glucose and incidence of hyperglycemia was significantly higher in Group D1 compared to Group D4. Base excess, bicarbonate, lactate, and pH showed a significant fall in Group D1. There was no significant difference in serum-free fatty acids, serum beta-hydroxy butyrate, and serum cortisol in three groups. At the end of surgery, serum insulin was significantly lower and glucagon : insulin (G : I) ratio was higher in Group D1 compared to Group D4.
   Conclusions: All three solutions, when infused at 10 ml.kg(-1).h(-1), are equally effective in maintaining glucose homeostasis, but 1% dextrose-containing fluid promotes catabolism, insulin resistance, rebound hyperglycemia, and acidosis. Therefore, 2-4% dextrose-containing fluids is more suitable compared to 1% dextrose-containing fluids for use during major neonatal surgeries requiring average fluid infusion rate of 10 ml.kg(-1).h(-1).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gliosarcomas are rare, extremely high-grade, bimorphous malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Intraventricular location is extremely rare, and only a few case reports exist in the literature. The aim of our study is to review clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features of this unique oncological entity and report this rare case of primary cystic intraventricular gliosarcoma (IVGS) with a mural nodule.
   METHODS: A 23-year-old man had a 6-month history of headache and a single episode of generalized seizure. Examination revealed grade 1 papilledema. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic lesion with a mural nodule located within the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle, which exhibited an intense enhancement of the nodule with patchy rim enhancement of the wall on gadolinium administration. The patient underwent right parietal craniotomy and gross total excision of the tumor.
   RESULTS: Postoperative computed tomography of the brain showed evidence of complete tumor excision. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. Histopathologic analysis revealed malignant tumor comprising both glial and mesenchymal components suggestive of gliosarcoma.
   CONCLUSION: Primary IVGS is an extremely rare malignancy, with only 9 cases reported in the literature, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lateral ventricular tumors.

KW  - VLA
AB  - Mastalgia is the commonest affliction of mammary gland among ladies of the reproductive age group. Since etiopathogenesis and therapy are different for cyclical and noncyclical pain, it is imperative to ascertain the exact type correctly. This is usually done in the breast clinics by advising the patient to fill a pain diary over a period of 2 months over two menstrual cycles. The Cardiff pain chart records the severity of pain in the form of a triangle for mild to moderate pain and a square for severe pain. Moreover, Cardiff pain chart does not allow a patient to record the severity of pain on days of menses, as she has to put the letter "P" in the box. These problems have been resolved in the new breast pain chart. In the new pain chart, the lady records pain severity in the form of visual linear analogue scale score on every day of menstrual cycle. She enters her menstrual experience on a separate part of chart, which allows us to visualize the full month's pain severity in an uncluttered way.

AB  - Smith-Magenis syndrome is a well delineated microdeletion syndrome with characteristic facial and behavioral phenotype. With the availability of the multi-targeted molecular cytogenetic techniques like Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification and cytogenetic microarray, the cases are diagnosed even without clinical suspicion. Here, the authors present clinical features of nine Indian cases of Smith-Magenis syndrome. Characteristic facial phenotype including tented upper lip, broad forehead, midface hypoplasia, short philtrum and upslant of palpebral fissure is obvious in the photographs. The behavioral variations were seen in some of the cases but were not the presenting features. The characteristic facial phenotype can be an important clinical guide to the diagnosis.

AB  - The present analysis studied the demographic data and treatment outcomes of young patients with rectal cancer (aged < 35). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.4 years. The 1- and 3-year PFS rates were 66.5% and 42.0%, respectively. On univariate analysis, Karnofsky performance status and histologic type were significant prognostic factors for PFS.
   Background: Carcinoma of the rectum is the fourth most common cancer in the world. The peak age of diagnosis is around the seventh decade. Rectal cancer presenting in those < 35 years old are very peculiar in that they present with adverse histologic features and more advanced stage compared with rectal cancer presenting in older patients. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the patient records of young patients with rectal cancer (aged < 35 years) treated in our unit at the All India Institute from 2007 to 2013. Results: A total of 60 young patients with rectal cancer were registered in our unit during the study period. A family history of cancer was present in 3 patients. The median age at presentation was 27.5 years (range, 15-34 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. Of the 60 patients, 52 (86.6%) presented with advanced-stage disease (stage III and IV). Mucinous, signet, papillary, and other poor-risk histologic features were seen in 33 patients (55%). The treatment intention was radical for 50 patients (83.3%). The median follow-up period was 7.3 months. Eighteen patients had documented disease progression. Distant metastasis was the most common type of failure, seen in 14 of 18 patients (77%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.4 years. The 1-and 3-year PFS rates were 66.5% and 42.0%, respectively. On univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status and histologic type were significant prognostic factors for PFS. Conclusion: A greater proportion of poor histologic subtypes was found among young patients with rectal cancer. The high incidence of poor histologic subtypes confers a poor prognosis in these patients.

AB  - Transient albuminuria induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in mice through engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is widely studied as a partial model for some forms of human nephrotic syndrome (NS). In addition to TLRs, CD80 has been shown to be essential for PAMP-mediated albuminuria. However, the mechanistic relationships between TLRs, CD80 and albuminuria remain unclear. Here, we show that albuminuria and CD80-uria induced in mice by many TLR ligands are dependent on the expression of TLRs and their downstream signalling intermediate MyD88 exclusively in hematopoietic cells and, conversely, on CD80 expression exclusively in non-hematopoietic cells. TNF alpha is crucial for TLR-mediated albuminuria and CD80-uria, and induces CD80 expression in cultured renal podocytes. IL-10 from hematopoietic cells ameliorates TNF alpha production, albuminuria and CD80-uria but does not prevent TNF alpha-mediated induction of podocyte CD80 expression. Chitohexaose, a small molecule originally of parasite origin, mediates TLR4-dependent anti-inflammatory responses, and blocks TLR-mediated albuminuria and CD80-uria through IL-10. Thus, TNF alpha is a prominent mediator of renal CD80 induction and resultant albuminuria in this model, and small molecules modulating TLR-mediated inflammatory activation might have contributory or adjunct therapeutic potential in some contexts of NS development.

AB  - Background: Leprosy often heals with residual skin lesions after completion of treatment. WHO recommends fixed duration multidrug therapy (MDT) irrespective of whether lesions clear or persist after treatment. Patients with residual lesions are often unsatisfied and may undergo repeat biopsy and re-treatment. This study was conducted to compare the clinicohistopathological features in paucibacillary leprosy before and after MDT from September 2012 to February 2014.
   Methods: Sixty-one untreated cases of paucibacillary leprosy were investigated and given standard WHO paucibacillary-MDT for 6 months. Scoring of clinical activity was done; histopathological activity was graded according to granuloma fraction. Forty-four patients who completed the treatment were subjected to post-treatment biopsy. Clinical response to therapy was graded as active, resolving and inactive and histopathological changes were compared in all patients.
   Results: Among the 44 patients, the lesions were inactive, resolving and active in 39% (17/44), 39% (17/44) and 23% (10/44) of patients, respectively. Histologically, disease was inactive, resolving and active in 30% (13/44), 9% (4/44) and 61% (27/44). But histomorphological features suggesting regression: loose granulomas (59%, 26/44); lymphocyte predominance (66%, 29/44); vacuolar change in epithelioid cell cytoplasm (59%, 26/44), were statistically significant in post-treatment compared to pre-treatment.
   Conclusions: Although histological resolution is slower than clinical resolution, qualitative histomorphological changes in correlation with clinical inactivity can offer a fair suggestion to the clinician to terminate therapy.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a potential treatment in treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there is no consensus about the exact site of stimulation for rTMS. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) offers a potential technique in deciding the site of stimulation. The present study was conducted to assess the difference in outcome of brain SPECT assisted rTMS versus standard protocol of twenty sessions of high frequency rTMS as add on treatment in 20 patients with treatment resistant MDD, given over a period of 4 weeks. Thirteen subjects (group I) received high frequency rTMS over an area of hypoperfusion in the prefrontal cortex, as identified on SPECT, whereas 7 subjects (group II) were administered rTMS in the left dorsoslateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) area. Improvement was monitored using standardized instruments. Patients in the group I showed a significantly better response compared to those in the group II. In group I, 46% of the subjects were responders on MADRS, 38% on BDI and 77% on CGI. The parallel figures of responders in Group II were 0% on MADRS, 14% on BDI and 43% on CGI. There were no remitters in the study. No significant untoward side effects were noticed. The study had limitations of a small sample size and non-controlled design, and all the subjects were also receiving the standard antidepressant therapy.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a medical as well as obstetric challenge, which needs person-centered management. The timing of delivery of women with GDM is discussed by various obstetric professional bodies. We highlight pertinent medical, obstetric, and psychosocial factors which may influence the timing of delivery in women with GDM. This commentary proposes a person-centered approach to decide the delivery timing in GDM and supports shared decision-making based upon the individual's biopsychosocial characteristics and environmental factors.

AB  - Selection of appropriate housekeeping-genes as reference is important in mRNA expression-related experiments. It is more important in diabetes since hyperglycemia per se can influence expression of housekeeping-genes. RNA expression of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, beta-actin and 18S-ribosomal-RNA, Hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT), Tyrosine-3-monooxygenase/tryptophan (YHWAZ), beta 2-microglobin (beta 2M), TATA-binding-protein (TBP), and Ubiquitin C and cytochrome1 (CYC1) assessed in circulating-lymphocytes-(PBMC) of patients with type-1-diabetes and healthy controls. The stability ('M' value < 1.02) and number of housekeeping-genes required for normalization in qRT-PCR were determined by 'ge-norm software.' Vitamin-D-receptor (VDR) was used as a target gene. All the nine genes tested had sufficient 'M' value in diabetes and healthy controls. However, housekeeping-genes indicated a relatively higher stability of expression in healthy controls in comparison to diabetes. Use of single housekeeping-genes brought gross variation in the calculation of VDR-mRNA copies. The ge-norm software suggested geometric mean of five housekeeping-genes for ideal normalization in diabetes (CYC1, beta-actin, YHWAZ, HPRT, and beta 2M) and only three in controls (CYC1, beta-actin, and TBP). HbA1c did not correlate with expression of any of the nine housekeeping-genes. Thus, geometric mean of CYC1, beta-actin, YHWAZ, HPRT, and beta 2M needs to be used for ideal normalization of mRNA in type-1-diabetes. Similar studies are required in other population.

AB  - BACKGROUND Pulsed dye lasers have revolutionized treatment of port-wine stains (PWS). The authors' previous study with a 585-nm/0.45-millisecond pulsed dye laser (PDL) showed 25% to 75% improvement in 60% of facial PWS.
   METHODS The authors analyzed data on facial PWS treated with a 595-nm tunable PDL in Indian patients. Response was assessed subjectively on a scale of 21 to 5 (Investigator Global Assessment) by comparing pretreatment and posttreatment photographs. Patients' perception of change in PWS was also noted on a visual analog scale from 0 to 10 (Patient Global Assessment). Side effects were recorded.
   RESULTS A total of 74 flat and 24 hypertrophic PWS in skin Types IV and V with a median lesion size of 56 cm(2) and 102 cm(2), respectively, and color ranging from pink to purple were treated. They underwent a mean of 7.3 and 8.5 sessions (range: 4-10 session), respectively. A mean lightening of 54% in flat and 40% in hypertrophic PWS was observed. After 10 treatments, 46.6% of flat PWS cases showed > 75% lightening and an equal number had 25% to 75% improvement. A > 75% improvement was observed in 12.5% of hypertrophic PWS with 75% of cases showing between 25% to 75% improvement. No significant side effects were noted.
   CONCLUSION The 595-nm tunable PDL produced moderate response with no significant side effects.

AB  - Objective: To study gender differences in insulin and C-peptide concentrations at birth using cord blood collection. Subjects and methods: This study was conducted in a maternity hospital, in Jammu province of Jammu and Kashmir, India. All women with pregnancy who were hospitalized for delivery were followed. All pregnant ladies who had no medical condition affecting insulin levels, as per history and routine antenatal blood testing, were included in the study. The test for cord plasma insulin and C-peptide was done in 60 (30 males) full-term (>= 37 completed weeks) normal delivery babies within 4 hours of the collection of samples using the electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) on Roche elecsys module immunoassay analyzer. Weight of the babies was taken immediately after birth using digital scales. Results: Cord plasma insulin and C-peptide measured in EDTA were compared between boys and girls and also related to birth weight. Girls were lighter (2,830 +/- 37 vs. 3,236 +/- 46 g; p = < 0.001) but had higher cord insulin (16.48 +/- 4.88 vs. 10.53 +/- 4.04 mu U/mL; p = < 0.001), and C-peptide (2.47 +/- 0.66 vs. 0.834 +/- 0.26 ng/mL; p = < 0.001) concentrations than newborn boys. Conclusion: Female newborn babies have higher cord plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations than male newborns, despite being smaller, suggesting intrinsic insulin resistance in girls.

AB  - Introduction: The differentiation between septic and aseptic loosening of prosthetic hip joint is a major challenge for the clinician. This study assessed and compared the diagnostic accuracy of F-18-flouro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET/CT) with F-18-fluoride PET/CT for diagnosis of infection in the painful hip prosthesis.
   Methods: In this prospective study, we included the patients with painful hip prostheses with radiological or clinical suspicion of loosening, those who had given the written consent and scheduled for clinical and diagnostic evaluation before revision arthroplasty. To rule out the nature of loosening (septic vs. aseptic), all the patients underwent F-18-Fluoride PET/CT and F-18-FDG PET/CT. The reference standard for periprosthetic infection was based on histopathology and/or microbial culture and/or intraoperative findings.
   Results: We prospectively evaluated 42 patients of hip prostheses before revision arthroplasty. Visual and semi-quantitative analysis of both the positron emission tomography (PET) images was done and the results were compared with a reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV) and accuracy of F-18-FDG PET/CT were 93.7%, 92.3%, 88.2%, 96% and 92.8% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of F-18-fluoride PET/CT were 75%, 96.1%, 92.3%, 86% and 88.1% respectively. FDG PET/CT has higher sensitivity, NPV and accuracy as compared to compared to Fluoride PET/CT and comparable specificity and PPV.
   Conclusions: Fluoride PET/CT had shown slightly higher specificity than FDG-PET/CT, but the overall diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in periprosthetic infection is optimal in routine clinical practice and better than fluoride PET/CT.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the efficacy of oral antibiotics in under five children with pneumonia and chest indrawing.
   Methods: We included controlled clinical trials (randomized or quasi randomized) that compared the efficacy of oral antibiotics versus parenteral antibiotics for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with chest-indrawing (severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization's guidelines) in children below 60 months of age. Data were extracted and managed using RevMan software. Main outcome variables were: treatment failure rate, relapse rate, death rate, need for hospitalization, and severe adverse effects.
   Results: We identified four randomized controlled trials involving 4400 children who were diagnosed to have severe pneumonia but were feeding well and not hypoxic. Baseline characteristics of children in the two treatment arms (oral and parenteral antibiotics) were similar. In two studies, oral antibiotics were administered on an ambulatory basis, while in two, oral antibiotics were used in hospitalized children. Failure rate in children receiving oral antibiotics was 13% (288/2208) while that in children receiving parenteral antibiotics was 13.8% (302/2183) (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78, 1.11). Failure rates were not affected by the type of oral antibiotic, or presence of wheeze. Relapse rates, hospitalization or serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.
   Conclusion: Children with tachypnea with chest-indrawing without signs/symptoms of very severe pneumonia may be treated with oral antibiotics.

AB  - The high mobility group box 1 protein has been identified as a key player in chromatin homeostasis including transcription regulation, recombination, repair, and chromatin remodeling. Emerging findings indicate HMGB1 protein over expression in nearly all types of human cancers and inflammatory disorders. Thus it is considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating various malignancies. We screened the promoter region of hmgb1 gene and selected a positive regulatory element of 25 base pair duplex (25RY) (-165 to -183) as a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention. The molecular interaction of actinomycin (ACT) with the regulatory region of hmgb1 gene was characterized by spectroscopic, calorimetric and molecular docking studies. The hypochromic and bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum, stabilization of 25RY duplex against thermal denaturation, perturbation of CD spectrum of duplex and enhancement of fluorescence intensity of actinomycin indicate strong binding of actinomycin to the hmgb1 promoter region (25RY). The energetics was characterized to be endothermic and entropy driven. All these results are in good agreement with in silico investigation that suggest minor groove binding with effective intercalation at GC bases of actinomycin to 25RY. This study identifies hmgb1 gene promoter region a potential target for the anticancer therapautiucs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for occurrence of intra-operative complications during phacoemulsification performed by residents. One hundred fifty patients with cataract who underwent phacoemulsification by residents, with an experience of five or more phacoemulsification surgery, at a tertiary care centre were included in this study. The pre-operative data of these patients were collected from the hospital records. Surgeons were interviewed immediately after the surgery regarding the surgeon experience, phacoemulsification technique, machine factors, and intra-operative complications. Statistical analysis was done to determine pre-operative and intra-operative risk factors. The overall surgical complication rate in resident-performed phacoemulsification was 37 % of which major and minor complications were 21 and 16 %, respectively. Success in terms of placement of intraocular lens in capsular bag was 84 %. The most common major and minor complications found were posterior capsular tear and irregular capsulorhexis, respectively. Systemic and ocular features of patients as well as type of machine (longitudinal versus torsional longitudinal) had no significant association in terms of complication rate. Increase in success rate was seen with increase in semester and number of surgeries performed. Patient factors including general physical condition, systemic diseases, and anatomical factors do not influence success in resident-performed phacoemulsification. With increase in semester of residents, there is a significant decrease in intra-operative complications. Minor complications in the beginning of case lead to increase in major complications later on during the case and decrease in success rate by junior-semester residents.

AB  - Aplastic anemia (AA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder, if untreated, is associated with very high mortality. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the standard of care for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients those who are younger than 40 years of age. The development of secondary malignancies in post-BMT setting for AA is a rare, however, well documented phenomenon. Among the secondary malignancies, development of acute myeloid leukemia is even rarer entity. Here we report a case of acute myeloid leukemia following human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in a case of SAA. The patient achieved complete remission (CR) following chemotherapy and in CR1, a second HLA matched PBSCT from a different donor was offered. The patient is presently in remission at day +180 post-PBSCT.

AB  - Background: Circulating DNA and RNA is an important prognostic tool for noninvasive malignant disease detection and in disease prognosis. Study aimed to evaluate the possible prognostic role of HER2 (-3444C/T) promoter polymorphism and its mRNA expression in Lung adenocarcinoma patients using circulating DNA and RNA.
   Methods: One hundred newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma patients and 100 age and sex matched healthy controls were included and allele specific (AS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for genotyping and expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. Overall survival of patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method.
   Results: We observed a statistically significant difference in the frequency of HER2 CC, CT, and CT genotype among lung adenocarcinoma cases vs. healthy controls (P=0.001). Compared to the CC genotype, OR 2.51 (1.4-4.51), 5.97 (1.17-30.41) and RR 1.56 (1.17-2.07), 2.83 (0.82-9.73) for heterozygous CT and homozygous TT genotypes suggesting possible dominant effect on risk of lung adenocarcinoma. Cases with CC genotype showed 9.29 fold increased mRNA expression while cases with heterozygous CT and homozygous TT genotype showed 16.26, 16.72 fold increased mRNA expression (P<0.0001). We observed 13.92 fold increased HER2mRNA expression Lung adenocarcinoma patients. Patients in different TNM stages showed significant difference in HER2 mRNA expression which was found to be significantly associated (P<0.0001). Patients with distant metastases and without distant metastases had 17.44 and 11.16 fold increased HER2 mRNA expression was also found to be significantly associated (P<0.0001). It was also observed that patients with pleural effusion and without pleural effusion showed significant difference in HER2 mRNA expression (P=0.03). We also analysed patients with CC, TT, CT (P=0.02) and CT + TT (P=0.008) genotype showed 15.8, 7.9, 9.5 and 7.9 months of overall median survival time and found to be significantly associated, respectively. Patients with >13 and <= 13 fold increased HER mRNA expression also showed 7.9 and 11.5 months of overall median survival time was also found to be significantly associated (P=0.01).
   Conclusions: Our work provides evidence that circulating DNA and RNA may be a potential prognostic tool in Lung adenocarcinoma patients. Promoter polymorphism of HER2 (-3444C/T) gene had significant impact on higher HER2 mRNA expression could be a predictive factor for patients' worse overall survival and metastatic behaviour.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) in prediction of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients.
   Thirty-two patients (23 males, 57.5 +/- 12.1 years) were prospectively included. Equilibrium radionuclide angiography and clinical evaluation were performed before and 3 months after CRT implantation. Standard deviation of left ventricle mean phase angle (SD LVmPA) and difference between LV and right ventricle mPA (LV-RVmPA) expressed in degrees (A degrees) were used to quantify left intraventricular synchrony and interventricular synchrony, respectively. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was also evaluated. At the baseline, mean NYHA class was 3.3 +/- 0.5, LVEF 22.5 +/- 5.6%, mean QRS duration 150.3 +/- 18.2 ms, SD LVmPA 43.5 +/- 18A degrees, and LV-RVmPA 30.4 +/- 15.6A degrees. At 3-month follow-up, 22 patients responded to CRT with improvement in NYHA class a parts per thousand yen1 and EF > 5%. Responders had significantly larger SD LVmPA (51.2 +/- 13.9 vs. 26.5 +/- 14A degrees) and LV-RVmPA (35.8 +/- 13.7 vs. 18.4 +/- 13A degrees) than non-responders. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated 95% sensitivity and 80% specificity at a cut-off value of 30A degrees for SD LVmPA, and 81% sensitivity and 80% specificity at a cut-off value of 23A degrees for LV-RVmPA in prediction of response to CRT.
   Baseline SD LVmPA and LV-RVmPA derived from ERNA are useful for prediction of response to CRT in non-ischaemic DCM patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess the perioperative complications and functional midterm outcomes after pyeloplasty for poorly functioning kidneys due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent pyeloplasty for primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction in very poorly functioning kidneys in terms of split renal function of <= 20% or estimated glomerular filteration rate of <= 20 mL/minute. Perioperative complications and postoperative outcomes in terms of symptomatic improvement and functional stabilization or recovery were assessed.
   RESULTS A total of 32 patients with estimated glomerular filteration rate <= 20 mL/minute or split function <= 20% underwent pyeloplasty since January 2010. All patients were followed for a mean period of 26.8 months and none required reintervention for obstructive drainage, deteriorating function, or intractable pain. One patient had persistent pain requiring analgesics and overall success rate (defined as nonobstructive pattern, no deterioration in split function, and no persistent symptoms) was 93.7%. Thirteen patients (40.6%) showed significant improvement in renal function (>5% over preoperative), and in all except 1 (3.1%) case there was no further deterioration of function.
   CONCLUSION Pyeloplasty provides high rates of morphological and functional success even in very poorly functioning renal units. There is a possibility of functional recovery in one-third of patients, and in most of the rest, there is no further deterioration.

AB  - Conclusion A cochlear re-implantation procedure is undesirable; however, the cochlear implant surgeon may have to perform a re-implantation procedure occasionally for various reasons. Following standard techniques, implant performance comparable with primary implantation may be achieved. Objective To study the causes and outcomes of cochlear re-implantation in an Asian Indian population. Study design Retrospective analysis of clinical charts over an 18-year period with prospective follow-up of patients. Methods The charts of 534 patients, who underwent cochlear implant, at an Otorhinolaryngology institutional Centre, from January 1997 to January 2015 were studied. Of these, the charts of 18 patients who underwent cochlear re-implantation were studied. The causes and audiological and speech outcomes were analysed. Results Eighteen patients (3.4%) underwent cochlear re-implantation for various reasons. The commonest indication was device failure in seven patients (39%), followed by electrode extrusion in five (28%), trauma in three (11%), electrode migration in two (11%) and improper electrode placement in one (6%) patient. The audiological performance tests and speech tests either remained the same or improved from those achieved for patients undergoing primary implantation, in 87% patients.

AB  - The precise biological function of human dipeptidyl peptidase III (hDPP III) is poorly understood. Using luciferase reporter constructs responsive to change in Ca2+ and/or cAMP and Fura 2-AM fluorometric assay, we show a significant decrease in intracellular Ca2+ following hDPP III overexpression and angiotensin II stimulation in angiotensin II type 1 receptor (G-protein coupled receptor, GPCR) expressing HEK293T cells. Silencing the expression of hDPP III by siRNA reversed the effect of hDPP III overexpression with a concomitant increase in Ca2+. These results, for the first time, show involvement of hDPP III in GPCR dependent Ca2+ regulation in HEK293T cells.

AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP III) is an emerging biomarker of human cancers. Expression, specificity, and function of human DPP III (hDPP III) mRNA variant I (V-I), II (V-II), and III (V-III) are poorly understood. Here, we investigated expression of these variants in multiple human tumor derived cell lines. DNA sequencing revealed concurrent expression of hDPP III V-I and V-II in U87MG (glioblastoma), SCC4 (squamous cell carcinoma), SiHa (carcinoma of uterus) cells. In SKOV1 cells, a cell line derived from ovarian carcinoma where a positive correlation between histological aggressiveness of the malignancy and hDPP III expression has previously been established, only V-II could be detected. Human DPP III V-III, which lacks an in-frame coding sequence, could not be detected in any of these cell lines. 5' untranslated region (UTR) of hDPP III V-II contains nucleotides GCA (-12 to -10 bp) upstream to the translation initiator codon (AUG). These nucleotides are absent from V-I and V-III, however, both V-I and V-II encode for the same hDPP III protein isoform-I. In vitro transcription coupled translation assay using hDPP III V-I and V-II expression vectors which contained full length V-I and V-II cDNA including the variable 5' UTR cloned under T7 promoter, respectively revealed a comparable translational efficiency for both the variants, abrogating involvement of nucleotides GCA (-12 to -10 bp) in translation of the variants. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate concurrent expression in multiple tumor derived cell lines and a comparable in vitro translational efficiency for hDPP III V-I and II.

AB  - Background: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates is crucial for the effective treatment of tuberculosis. Data on DST patterns in Mtb isolates in childhood tuberculosis are scanty.
   Aims: To determine drug resistance patterns in Mtb isolates from a paediatric TB cohort in North India.
   Methods: 403 children aged 6 months to 14 years with probable intrathoracic tuberculosis were enrolled prospectively. All were treatment-naive. 802 ambulatory-induced sputa (IS) and 787 gastric aspirate (GA) samples were cultured in BACTEC-MGIT960 system, and DST of the Mtb isolates was undertaken using the automated BACTEC-MGIT960 SIRE kit.
   Results: Of the 403 children, 147 (36.4%) were culture-confirmed: 132 (89.8%) isolates were Mtb and 15 (10.2%) non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Five Mtb isolates were contaminated and the remaining 127 were subjected to in-vitro drug susceptibility testing against streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol. Twenty-six (20.47%) isolates were resistant to one or more drugs, seven (5.5%) were resistant to rifampicin singly or in combination, and 11 (8.7%) were resistant to isoniazid singly or in combination. Mono-resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was detected in four (3.1%), one (0.8%), four (3.1%) and two (1.6%), respectively. Five children (3.9%) had MDR-TB; 101 (79.9%) children had Mtb isolates which were sensitive to all four drugs.
   Conclusions: The rifampicin and isoniazid resistance rates were much higher than those in the adult TB population in India.

AB  - Background: Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) is an uncommon thyroid malignancy with biological behaviour intermediate between well-differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. The cytological diagnosis of PDTC is often difficult as a result of a lack of well-established cytomorphological features and a considerable degree of morphological overlap with other commoner thyroid neoplasms.
   Objective: To review the cytomorphological features of PDTC with the aim of highlighting salient diagnostic morphological features and differential diagnostic problems.
   Methods: Seven cases of histologically proven PDTC with available aspiration cytology smears were reviewed for the presence of distinguishing cytomorphological features.
   Results: The architectural arrangement of tumour cells was the most important diagnostic parameter. Cellular nests, three-dimensional clusters dyscohesive aggregates and singly dispersed cells in the background were present in all cases. A unique 'garlanded appearance', owing to the peripheral orientation of nuclei within the tumour cell clusters, was noted (71.4%) along with the presence of basement membrane-like material (71.4%). Transgressing vessels (85.7%) and endothelial wrapping of cell clusters (71.4%) were also noted. Interestingly, most cases lacked necrosis and mitotic activity that are included in the histological diagnostic criteria for PDTC.
   Conclusion: Although PDTC has considerable cytomorphological overlap with well-differentiated thyroid tumours, this present study highlights certain cytomorphological features that may suggest the correct preoperative diagnosis, important for the appropriate management.

Bone marrow examination is carried out to rule out leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or aplastic anemia. However, in most cases, clinical diagnosis is not altered after the bone marrow reports. Hence, this present study was carried out to evaluate the justification for bone marrow examination in the setting of isolated thrombocytopenia. All patients presenting to the hematology OPD with isolated thrombocytopenia and suspected diagnosis of ITP, between October 2011 and April 2013, were included in the study. Data was collected from bone marrow reports and outpatient records. A total of 353 cases were found. 319 cases had features of typical ITP and the rest had some form of organomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow examination in all cases revealed normal hematopoietic elements and prominence of megakaryocytes including juvenile forms with no novel diagnosis in any patient. Routine use of bone marrow examination in the diagnostic workup of isolated thrombocytopenia is not required in our center even if steroids are planned as a first line therapy. However, a detailed history, thorough examination with complete hemogram and peripheral smear examination are essential.

AB  - Chikungunya virus, a small (about 60-70nm diameter), spherical, enveloped, positive, single stranded RNA virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. After a short period of incubation (3-5 days) symptoms like fever with joint pains and others start appearing. After a gap of 20 years, this virus re-emerged during 2006-2008 in India causing a major outbreak of CHIKV in India. This study was conducted subsequent to the major outbreak in order to evaluate the proportion of chikungunya virus infection in children with suggestive symptoms at three geographical locations of India. Lineage of circulating strains and changes in the E1 structural polypeptide were also determined. Blood samples were collected (in Sodium citrate vacutainer tubes) during 1st June 2009 to 31st May 2010 from children (age 018 years) suspected to have chikungunya infection, that is, those who presented with sudden onset of fever and/or joint pain, myalgia, and headache from three regions of India, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubli and Sawai Mansingh Medical College (SMS) in Jaipur. Detection of CHIKV antibodies in all acute-phase patient plasma samples was done by IgM ELISA and for samples within 5 days of fever, a one-step RT-PCR was carried out on a block thermo-cycler targeting 294bp region of E1 gene that codes for the viral envelope protein. Comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences from few positive samples of two regions was done with African S-27 reference strain using BioEdit. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 6 by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model. Out of the 723 acute phase samples tested from three geographical locations of India, Chikungunya virus infection was detected in 249/723 (34.44%) subjects by either IgM Elisa (180/723) or RT-PCR (69/412). RT-PCR was employed in samples collected from children with 5 days of fever. Maximum positive cases were from KIMS center, Hubli. Seasonally, positivity varied with number of enrolled cases at KIMS and SMS. Joint pain was significantly associated with CHIKV positivity (P=0.0156). Presence/absence of certain clinical features varied with age (P<0.05). Sequence analysis revealed four amino acid changes. Phylogenetic analysis with partial sequences of E1 gene from KIMS (n=12) and SMS (n=5) showed that the study isolates clustered with Indian Ocean Lineage strains (IOL) of East, Central and South African (ECSA) type. Evaluation of chikungunya virus infection in children from India during 2009-2010 showed high proportion of CHIKV infection in Southern region of India compared to Northern region. The circulating CHIKV strains were of Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) group within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) genotype. However few amino acid changes were observed in E1 polypeptide with reference to African strain S-27 (AF369024). Further studies are needed to know the implications of these changes in vector-pathogen compatibility and host-pathogen interactivity. As a whole, this study highlighted the proportion of CHIKV cases, lineage of causative strain and evolutionary pattern of circulating strain in terms of amino acid changes in the structural protein.

AB  - An embedded system for ultrasound scanner working at high frame rates of 1000 fps is presented. Data processing engine is in a Laptop interfacing with the scanner over Ethernet Interface. High frame rate is achieved by Multi-line transmission. The major challenge is to collect enormous amount of scanner data and process in the processing engine. Moving window algorithm, critical window capture and inter-frame compression methods for reducing the data rates is presented. Moving window algorithm is used to extract the necessary data to analyze the inter-frame movements across successive frames. One image frame is divided into several windows say 16 and in a multi frame period, only one window is send and remaining windows are discarded. This window is moved multi frame to multi frame. This data is super imposed on a complete frame data. The frame to frame variations is calculated window by window. This embedded system logic implementation is in FPGA's. Since all crystal excitation is used for achieving high frame rates, parallel receive beamforming is performed using matrix inversion principle. This low cost architecture is useful for telemedicine applications in remote areas of developing countries.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in many parts of India. Rarely, it may be complicated by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) that has varied presentation and course. We describe two cases of VL complicated by HLH that were markedly different in clinical presentation, course and management. First case presented with Fever of unknown origin whereas second case had fever with severe bleeding manifestations. VL was diagnosed by bone marrow aspiration and serum rk39 immunodiagnostic test respectively in these cases. HLH was diagnosed by HLH 2004 diagnostic criteria. VL was treated by intravenous amphotericin B in both cases. HLH was managed by treating primary disease in the first case whereas steroid was given for management in the second case. High index of suspicion is crucial for early diagnosis of HLH to reduce morbidity and mortality.

AB  - In India, half of the annual 200,000 road traffic deaths occur in hospitals, but the exact in-hospital trauma mortality rate remains unknown. A research consortium of universities, with a mandate to reduce trauma mortality, measured the baseline 30-day in-hospital mortality rate.
   Between September 2013 and February 2015, trained data collectors collected on-admission demographic, physiological vital signs, and health service performance indicators (time of injury to admission, investigation, or intervention) on all patients with traumatic injuries admitted to four public university hospitals in three Indian megacities.
   Of the 11,202 hospitalized trauma patients, 21.4 % died within 30 days of hospitalization. The median age was 30 years for survivors and 37 years for non-survivors. The on-admission systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score was near-normal in survivors, but was significantly lower in non-survivors and associated with both early and late mortality (p = 0.001). In the absence of a trauma system, there were process-of-care delays from injury to reaching and being examined, investigated, or operated in the hospital.
   Using a multi-institutional Indian registry, this study is the first to systematically document that the 30-day in-hospital trauma mortality was twice that found in similar registries from high-income countries. Physiological scoring of on-admission vitals was clinically useful to predict mortality. More research is needed to understand the causes of high mortality and time delays in the process of delivering trauma care in India, which has no prehospital or trauma system.

AB  - High Sensitivity NaLi2PO4:Ce3+ optically stimulated luminescence dosimetry (OSLD) phosphor material was prepared by a simple solid state diffusion method. The material was characterized by XRD to confirm its formation in a single phase. Comparison of the experimental data with that of the data available in the literature (JCPDF # 80-2110) shows formation of a single orthorhombic phase, with the space group Pmnb (62). Study on the particle size effect shows that particle size in the range 50-150 Lim is more suitable for the continuous wave-optically stimulated luminescence (CW-OSL) dosimetry. Dosimetric properties of the phosphor material (particle size 50-150 mu m) using CW-OSL technique for blue light stimulation (lambda approximate to 470 nm) show that it is highly sensitive (similar to 6 times more sensitive than the commercially available Al2O3:C phosphor) in the linear dose range. The phosphor has found to have all the other good dosimetric characteristics, such as, easy method of synthesis, tissue equivalence, i.e., low-Z material (Z(eff) similar to 10.8), low fading (similar to 25% in 20 days), wide range of dose response (3 mGy-500 Gy), easy optical bleaching for its reuse, excellent reusability, etc., which make it useful for OSL dosimetry of high-energy radiations. Another advantage of this OSLD phosphor is that its dosimetric TL glow peak does not fade much on taking OSL and thus it could also be used as TLD phosphor for re-estimating doses in case of any doubts.

KW  - Illness severity
KW  - Outcome
AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill children, and to study its association with parathyroid response, severity of illness and clinical outcomes.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: Medical Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care centre of Northern India.
   Participants: 154 children in-patients: August 2011-January 2013.
   Main outcome measures: Vitamin D deficient children were (serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D <20 mu g/mL) divided into "parathyroid-responder" [serum parathyroid hormone >65 pg/mL with 25(OH)D<20 mu g/mL and/or calcium corrected for albumin <8.5 mg/dL] and "non parathyroid-responder." Illness severity was assessed by Pediatric Index of Mortality-2 (PIM-2) score at admission. Biochemical parameters, illness severity scores and clinical outcomes were compared between parathyroid responders and non-parathyroid -responders.
   Results: Vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia were observed in 125 (83.1%) and 91 (59%) children, respectively at admission. There were no differences in illness severity score at admission, mortality rate and length of stay between vitamin D deficient children and 19.8% of non-vitamin D-deficient children. Among Vitamin D-deficient children, parathyroid -responders had higher PIM-2 score at admission compared to non-parathyroid responder [12.8 (7.4,20.6) vs. 6.5 (2.5,12.2), P=0.01]. However, there were no differences in other clinical outcomes between two groups.
   Conclusion: Critically ill children have high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroid gland response secondary to hypocalcemia or vitamin D defiency is impaired in critical illness.

AB  - Background
   Results of endovascular interventions in hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction (HVOTO) have been reported from limited studies. Treatment outcomes and prognostic scores need further validation.
   Aim
   To evaluate treatment outcomes and prognostic scores for hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction in an Indian population.
   Methods
   Consecutive patients with hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction diagnosed at a tertiary centre were included. Technical success and clinical response after endovascular interventional therapy were documented. Predictors of survival were assessed with Cox-proportional model. A new score was derived from the factors significant on multivariate analysis and compared with Child-Turcotte-Pugh, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), Rotterdam prognostic index (PI) and Budd-Chiari syndrome-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (BCS-TIPSS) PI.
   Results
   Three hundred and thirty-four patients (56.6% males), median age 24 (3-62) years were included. Hepatic vein was the commonest site of block-isolated hepatic vonous block in 48%, combined hepatic venous-inferior vena cava block in 46%. Endovascular interventional therapy was performed in 233/334 (70%) with 90% technical success. Clinical response was complete in 166 (71.2%), partial in 58 (24.9%) and no response in nine (3.9%). Majority of cases with HV block did not require TIPSS and could be treated with angioplasty (with/without stenting). On Cox-proportional multivariate analysis, Child class C and response to intervention were independent predictors of outcome and used to derive the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction score. The 5-year survival was 92% (95% CI, 81-97%) for score 3, 79% (95%CI, 63-88%) for score <= 3 and >4, and 39% (95% CI, 21-57%) for score >4. The performance of AIIMS hepatic venous outflow obstruction score was superior to other prognostic indices.
   Conclusions
   Advanced Child class and no response to intervention are associated with poor outcomes. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction score predicts survival better than other prognostic scores.

AB  - Aneurysm of a major aortopulmonary collateral artery (MAPCA) is quite rare. Aneurysmally dilated MAPCA may be complicated with rupture and massive hemoptysis leading to sudden death. Possible pathophysiology for aneurysm formation is persistent high pressure state in collateral circulation. High index of suspicion is necessary to avoid catastrophic complications as the amount of hemoptysis does not correlate with disease severity and etiology. We present a case of large ruptured aneurysm of a MAPCA presenting with massive haemoptysis in a patient of cyanotic congenital heart disease which was salvaged by endovascular deployment of vascular plug.

AB  - Background & objectives: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common disorder in critically ill patients and is associated with high mortality. There is a paucity of literature on this condition from developing countries. This prospective observational study was designed to find out the aetiology, outcomes and predictors of mortality in ARDS.
   Methods: Sixty four consecutive patients who satisfied American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition of ARDS from medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India, were enrolled in the study. Demographic, biochemical and ventilatory variables were recorded for each patient. Baseline measurements of serum interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), procalcitonin (PCT) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were performed.
   Results: Common causes of ARDS included pneumonia [44/64 (68.7%)], malaria [9/64 (14.1%)] and sepsis [8/64 (12.5%]. Eight of the 64 (12.5%) patients had ARDS due to viral pneumonia. The 28-day mortality was 36/64 (56.2%). Independent predictors of mortality included non-pulmonary organ failure, [Hazard ratio (HR) 7.65; 95% CI 0.98-59.7, P=0.05], Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) [HR 2.36; 95% CI 1.14-4.85, P=0.02] and peak pressure (P-peak) [HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.00-1.30, P = 0.04] at admission.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Bacterial and viral pneumonia, malaria and tuberculosis resulted in ARDS in a considerable number of patients. Independent predictors of mortality included non-pulmonary organ failure, SAPS II score and P-peak at baseline. Elevated levels of biomarkers such as TNF-alpha, PCT and hsCRP at admission might help in identifying patients at a higher risk of mortality.

AB  - To evaluate the functional efficacy of an iridotomy in primary angle closure (PAC) eyes by measuring IOP responses to provocative tests before and after iridotomy.
   Prospective cohort study.
   50 consecutive adult patients, 40-60 years of age, having primary angle closure.
   Clinical examination, perimetry, biometry and ultrasound biomicroscopy of the angle were done. A darkroom prone provocative test (DRPPT), a mydriatic test and a Valsalva maneuver were performed before and after the iridotomy.
   IOP change in response to the provocative tests before and after iridotomy, and correlation with baseline parameters.
   IOP at baseline and after iridotomy was 14.4 +/- 2.7 mmHg and 14.3 +/- 2.6 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.)83. There was no significant change on diurnal phasing before and after an iridotomy (p = 0.)11. The mean IOP rise was 5.9 +/- 3.7 mmHg on the DRPPT, 4.3 +/- 3.5 mmHg on the Mydriatic test and 9.1 +/- 4.9 mmHg on the Valsalva maneuver, and was reduced significantly to 3.2 +/- 2.1 mmHg, 2.3 +/- 1.8 and 6.4 +/- 3.5, respectively(p < 0.001 for all tests). The decrease in pupillary block component for all 50 eyes was 46.5 % for the mydriatic test, 45.8 % for the DRPPT and 29.7 % for the Valsalva maneuver. PAC eyes positive on the DRPPT and mydriatic test prior to an iridotomy became negative after laser iridotomy in 75.9 and 84.6 % eyes, respectively, but on the Valsalva maneuver, only 23.8 % became negative. After iridotomy, eyes that continued to be positive on the mydriatic test had a significantly thicker lens (p = 0.02), decreased TCPD (p = 0.014) and narrower trabecular-iris angle (p = 0.048). On the DRPPT, they had a thicker lens (p = 0.03), shorter iris thickness (p = 0.025) and TCPD (p = 0.032), and on the Valsalva maneuver, they had a narrower scleral-ciliary process angle (SCPA; p = 0.019) and shorter TCPD (p = 0.015).
   This comprehensive functional evaluation of laser iridotomy in early PAC eyes showed a significant reduction in the pupillary block component of IOP response to provocative testing, possibly decreasing IOP fluctuations over time. An iridotomy does not, however, significantly change mean IOP or diurnal phasing of IOP in PAC eyes. Eyes with a very narrow angle or a thick lens may continue to have angle closure due to other pathomechanisms for angle closure.

AB  - Background and AimCeliac disease (CD) is emerging in Asia. While a few population-based studies from Asia have reported a prevalence of CD from 0.1% to 1.3%, the exact prevalence of CD in Asia is not known. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of CD in Asia.
   MethodsOn search of literature, we found 1213 articles, of which 18 articles were included. Diagnosis of CD was based on European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines.
   ResultsPooled sero-prevalence of CD in Asia was 1.6% in 47873 individuals based on positive anti-tissue transglutaminase and/or anti-endomysial antibodies. Pooled prevalence of biopsy proven CD in Asia was 0.5% in 43955 individuals. The prevalence of CD among women was higher than in men (0.5% vs 0.4%, P=0.04). The pooled prevalence of CD was 0.3% in Iran, 0.5% in Turkey, 0.6% in India, and 0.7% in Israel. The pooled prevalence of CD was significantly higher in Israel and India as compared with that in Iran.
   ConclusionsCeliac disease is not uncommon in Asia, and the sero-prevalence and prevalence of CD in Asia are 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively. The prevalence of CD varies with gender and geographic location. There is a need for population-based prevalence studies in many Asian countries to properly estimate the burden of CD in Asia.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical profile of medicolegal cases (MLCs) presenting to the eye casualty in a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of records. The cases were grouped according to the Ocular Trauma Classification Group classification system. Results: Out of 188 MLCs, 164 (87.2%) were male. Mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 31.6 (+/- 12.7) years. Age ranged from 7 to 75 years. Twenty-six (13.8%) patients had bilateral involvement. The fist was the most common mode of injury, which was seen in 109 (58%) cases. A total of 27 (14.3%) patients had associated extraocular injury. No evidence of ocular or orbital trauma (malingering) could be found in 13 (7%) patients. Mechanical trauma was present in 169 (90%) patients with injury to globe in 129 (69%) patients and injury to lid or orbit without damage to the globe in 40 (21%) patients. Chemical injury was observed in 6 (3%) patients. Closed globe injury (CGI) was seen in 116 eyes and open globe injury (OGI) was noted in 29 eyes. The most common type of injury, zone, pupil, and grade of injury in CGI were Type A or contusion (79%), Zone I (72%), Pupil B (absence of relative afferent pupillary defect) in 95%, and Grade A [visual acuity (VA) >= 20/40] in 68% of the eyes, respectively. The most common type of injury, zone, pupil, and grade of injury in OGI were Type B or penetrating (48%), Zone II (38%), Pupil B (59%), and Grade D (VA 4/200-light perception) (42%), respectively. Conclusions: The most common form and mode of ocular injury in MLC were closed globe injury and fist, respectively. The most common type of injury in CGI and OGI was contusion and penetrating injury, respectively.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to identify the clinical and etiological profile of uveitis at the apex institute for eye care in India. This is a prospective, prevalence study. 980 consecutive patients with uveitis referred to uvea clinic, Dr. RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences (Ophthalmology division, All India Institute of Medical Sciences). Demographic data of each patient were noted and a thorough ocular examination including slit lamp examination and dilated fundus evaluation was carried out. OCT and fluorescein angiography were undertaken whenever indicated. Uveitis was classified based on the anatomic location of inflammation (IUSG classification). Relevant serological and radiological investigations were obtained based on systemic symptomatology, and if the uveitis was recurrent (even in the absence of systemic symptoms). The presence of a systemic disease was confirmed by obtaining an internist consultation. The main outcome measures include pattern of uveitis according to anatomical classification and the etiology. Out of 980 patients with uveitis, 413 (42.14 %) patients had anterior uveitis, 131 (13.36 %) had intermediate uveitis, 165 (16.83 %) had posterior uveitis, 91 (9.2 %) had panuveitis, 47 (4.7 %) had retinal vasculitis, 22 (2.24 %) had scleritis, 17 (1.7 %) had masquerade syndromes, 8 (0.8 %) had keratouveitis, 22 (2.24 %) had sclerokeratouveitis, 19 (1.9 %) had endophthalmitis and 45 (4.5 %) had other causes of inflammation including trauma and intraocular surgery. Out of all uveitic patients definite etiological correlation could be made out in 225 (23 %) patients; thus 77 % were categorised as idiopathic. Only 9 % of all patients were found to have uveitis with an infectious etiology. Amongst infectious causes of uveitis tuberculosis was the leading cause, accounting for sixty percent of all infectious uveitis (approximately 5 % of overall uveitis). Non-infectious uveitis etiology accounted for more than 90 % of all cases with ankylosing spondylitis being the most common followed by sarcoidosis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Amongst known uveitic syndromes serpiginous like choroidopathy was the most common and was followed by acute posterior placoid pigmented epitheliopathy and Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis. Infection, including tuberculosis, is an infrequent cause of uveitis in the study population. Multicentric, collaborative efforts are required to improve levels of clinical evidence and evolve consensus in establishing stringent guidelines for labelling uveitis as being of infectious etiology.

AB  - Objective: To study the effect of a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in overweight and obese persons.
   Design and setting: Nonrandomized, single-arm interventional study conducted from August 2012 to March 2015 at Integral Health Clinic, Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Participants: Overweight (body-mass index [BMI], 23-24.9 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI, >= 25 kg/m(2)) persons (n = 279) aged 20-60 years.
   Intervention: Pretested yoga-based lifestyle intervention, including asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), relaxation techniques, lectures, group support, nutrition awareness program, and individualized advice.
   Outcome measures: Primary outcome measure was HRQOL, measured by using short version of World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures were anthropometric variables, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, lipid profile, and fasting glucose. A subgroup analysis according to sex was also performed.
   Results: The overall quality of life and health improved after short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention in overweight and obese persons. Physical, psychological and environmental domain scores significantly increased from baseline to day 10, and efficacy was noted in both male and female subgroups. After 10 days of intervention, the following also decreased significantly: body weight, BMI, total body fat, waist and hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and fasting glucose.
   Conclusion: A short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention had a positive effect on HRQOL in overweight and obese persons.

AB  - Background In 2013, an estimated 2.8 million newborns died and 2.7 million were stillborn. A much greater number suffer from long term impairment associated with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and perinatal or infectious causes. With the approaching deadline for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2015, there was a need to set the new research priorities on newborns and stillbirth with a focus not only on survival but also on health, growth and development. We therefore carried out a systematic exercise to set newborn health research priorities for 2013-2025.
   Methods We used adapted Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) methods for this prioritization exercise. We identified and approached the 200 most productive researchers and 400 program experts, and 132 of them submitted research questions online. These were collated into a set of 205 research questions, sent for scoring to the 600 identified experts, and were assessed and scored by 91 experts.
   Results Nine out of top ten identified priorities were in the domain of research on improving delivery of known interventions, with simplified neonatal resuscitation program and clinical algorithms and improved skills of community health workers leading the list. The top 10 priorities in the domain of development were led by ideas on improved Kangaroo Mother Care at community level, how to improve the accuracy of diagnosis by community health workers, and perinatal audits. The 10 leading priorities for discovery research focused on stable surfactant with novel modes of administration for preterm babies, ability to diagnose fetal distress and novel tocolytic agents to delay or stop preterm labour.
   Conclusion These findings will assist both donors and researchers in supporting and conducting research to close the knowledge gaps for reducing neonatal mortality, morbidity and long term impairment. WHO, SNL and other partners will work to generate interest among key national stakeholders, governments, NGOs, and research institutes in these priorities, while encouraging research funders to support them. We will track research funding, relevant requests for proposals and trial registers to monitor if the priorities identified by this exercise are being addressed

AB  - The present review describes the current status of multiplex quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays developed and used globally for detection and subtyping of hepatitis viruses in body fluids. Several studies have reported the use of multiplex qPCR for the detection of hepatitis viruses, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). In addition, multiplex qPCR has also been developed for genotyping HBV, HCV, and HEV subtypes. Although a single step multiplex qPCR assay for all six hepatitis viruses, i.e., A to G viruses, is not yet reported, it may be available in the near future as the technologies continue to advance. All studies use a conserved region of the viral genome as the basis of amplification and hydrolysis probes as the preferred chemistries for improved detection. Based on a standard plot prepared using varying concentrations of template and the observed threshold cycle value, it is possible to determine the linear dynamic range and to calculate an exact copy number of virus in the specimen. Advantages of multiplex qPCR assay over singleplex or other molecular techniques in samples from patients with co-infection include fast results, low cost, and a single step investigation process.

AB  - Introduction
   Overweight and obesity are a public health problem in India not only in adults but also in children. The authors sought to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in school-going children of 6-17 years of age and examine its demographic and dietary correlates in context of their urban-rural status and socio-economic status.
   Methods
   In this cross-sectional survey height and weight were measured in 1266 school children in government and private schools of urban and rural areas. Dietary assessment was done using single day 24-hour dietary recall method. The data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 19) and WHO AnthroPlus Software. Factorial ANOVA was used for testing interaction within and between subgroups for continuous variables and Chi-square test was used for categorical variables.
   Results
   It was found that the overall prevalence of overweight was 15.6% of which 5.4% were obese, with maximum prevalence in boys attending urban private schools. The mean caloric intake in the study population with 24-hour dietary recall method was 1558.2 kilocalories (SD: 428 kilocalories).
   Conclusion
   Overweight and obesity is a significant problem in school-going children. Higher socio-economic status continues to remain an important driver of this epidemic in the younger generation and affects demographic and dietary determinants of this problem.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   The development of neutralizing anti-factor VIII alloantibodies (inhibitors) in patients with severe hemophilia A may depend on the concentrate used for replacement therapy.
   METHODS
   We conducted a randomized trial to assess the incidence of factor VIII inhibitors among patients treated with plasma-derived factor VIII containing von Willebrand factor or recombinant factor VIII. Patients who met the eligibility criteria (male sex, age <6 years, severe hemophilia A, and no previous treatment with any factor VIII concentrate or only minimal treatment with blood components) were included from 42 sites.
   RESULTS
   Of 303 patients screened, 264 underwent randomization and 251 were analyzed. Inhibitors developed in 76 patients, 50 of whom had high-titer inhibitors (>= 5 Bethesda units). Inhibitors developed in 29 of the 125 patients treated with plasma-derived factor VIII (20 patients had high-titer inhibitors) and in 47 of the 126 patients treated with recombinant factor VIII (30 patients had high-titer inhibitors). The cumulative incidence of all inhibitors was 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.4 to 35.2) with plasma-derived factor VIII and 44.5% (95% CI, 34.7 to 54.3) with recombinant factor VIII; the cumulative incidence of high-titer inhibitors was 18.6% (95% CI, 11.2 to 26.0) and 28.4% (95% CI, 19.6 to 37.2), respectively. In Cox regression models for the primary end point of all inhibitors, recombinant factor VIII was associated with an 87% higher incidence than plasma-derived factor VIII (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96). This association did not change in multivariable analysis. For high-titer inhibitors, the hazard ratio was 1.69 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.98). When the analysis was restricted to recombinant factor VIII products other than second-generation full-length recombinant factor VIII, effect estimates remained similar for all inhibitors (hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.97) and high-titer inhibitors (hazard ratio, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.11 to 6.00).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Patients treated with plasma-derived factor VIII containing von Willebrand factor had a lower incidence of inhibitors than those treated with recombinant factor VIII.

AB  - Machine learning techniques such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to detect fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL) in a mixed population of healthy and diseased individuals in an Indian population. The occurrence of elevated FBGL was estimated in a non-invasive manner from the status of an individual's salivary electrochemical parameters such as pH, redox potential, conductivity and concentration of sodium, potassium and calcium ions. The samples were obtained from 175 randomly selected volunteers comprising half healthy and half diabetic patients. The models were trained using 70 % of the total data, and tested upon the remaining set. For each algorithm, data points were cross-validated by randomly shuffling them three times prior to implementing the model. The performance of the machine learning technique was reported in terms of four statistically significant parameters-accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F1 score. SVM using RBF kernel showed the best performance for classifying high FBGLs with approximately 85 % accuracy, 84 % precision, 85 % sensitivity and 85 % F1 score. This study has been approved by the ethical committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India with the reference number: IEC/NP-278/01-08-2014, RP-29/2014.

AB  - The role of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the diagnosis of breast cancer and its association with molecular biomarkers was investigated in 259 patients with breast cancer, 67 with benign pathology, and 54 healthy volunteers using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 1.5 T. In 59 breast cancer patients, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCEMRI) was also acquired. Mean ADC of malignant lesions was significantly lower (1.02 +/- 0.17x10(-3)mm(2)/s) compared to benign (1.57 +/- 0.26x10(-3)mm(2)/s) and healthy (1.78 +/- 0.13x10(-3)mm(2)/s) breast tissues. A cutoff ADC value of 1.23x10(-3)mm(2)/s (sensitivity 92.5%; specificity 91.1%; area under the curve 0.96) to differentiate malignant from benign diseases was arrived by receiver operating curve analysis. In 10/59 breast cancer patients, indeterminate DCE curve was seen, while their ADC value was indicative of malignancy, implying the potential of the addition of DWI in increasing the specificity of DCEMRI data. Further, the association of ADC with tumor volume, stage, hormonal receptors [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor (HER2)], and menopausal status was investigated. A significant difference was seen in tumor volume between breast cancer patients of stages IIA and IIIA, IIB and IIIA, and IIB and III (B + C), respectively (P < 0.05). Patients with early breast cancer (n = 52) had significantly lower ADC and tumor volume than those with locally advanced breast cancer (n = 207). No association was found in ADC and tumor volume with the menopausal status. Breast cancers with ER-, PR-, and triple-negative (TN) status showed a significantly larger tumor volume compared to ER+, PR+, and non-triple-negative (nTN) cancers, respectively. Also, TN tumors showed a significantly higher ADC compared to ER+, PR+, and nTN cancers. Patients with ER-and TN cancers were younger than those with ER+ and nTN cancers. The present study demonstrated that ADC may increase the diagnostic specificity of DCEMRI and be useful for treatment management in clinical setting. Additionally, it provides an insight into characterization of molecular types of breast cancer and may serve as an indicator of metabolic reprograming underlying tumor proliferation.

TI  - Keratoglobus: a close entity to megalophthalmos
T2  - SPRINGERPLUS
AB  - Background: Keratoglobus closely resembles buphthalmos and anterior megalophthalmos.
   Findings: A 45-year-old man presented with gradually progressive, painless, diminution of vision in both eyes since childhood. On examination, visual acuity of right (RE) and left eye (LE) was 20/60 and 2/20 respectively. Clinical pictures of the patient are shown in panel A, B, C, D. Keratometry values were 46.47/47.94 D at 42/132 degrees in RE and 46.90/47.23 D at 174/84 degrees in LE, signifying steep, ectatic cornea. Axial lengths, anterior chamber depth and corneal thickness in RE/LE was 23.53/27.12 mm, 5.18/4.48 mm and 413/420 mu m respectively. Iridodonesis was noted in left eye. Retinal evaluation of LE revealed retinal detachment (RD) with posterior staphyloma due to high myopia, hereas RE was within normal limits. Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. Final diagnosis was keratoglobus with LE myopic RD. The patient improved to 20/30 in right eye with no improvement in LE with scleral contact lens.
   Conclusion: Keratoglobus, Megalophthalmos and Buphthalmos are exceedingly close entities and it is very essential to make correct diagnosis, as management options differ significantly for all three diseases.

AB  - Background IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is known to have an aggressive course in Asians. There is a paucity of data regarding the Oxford classification pattern of Indian patients with IgAN. This study aims to characterize the clinical and histopathologic profile of these patients. Methods All patients diagnosed to have primary IgAN by kidney biopsy in the nephrology department from July 2009 to July 2014 were included in this study. All kidney biopsies were reviewed and the MEST score was assigned as per the Oxford classification. The clinical features and Oxford classification score of patients were characterized. Results Nephrotic range proteinuria (NRP) (65/103, 63.1%) with or without edema was the commonest presentation. 67.0% patients had eGFR 60 mL/min and 16.5% patients had eGFR <30 mL/min. Of the 103 patients, 80 (77.7%) had M1, 10 (9.7%) had E1, 45 (43.7%) had S1 and 41 (39.8%) had T1/T2 lesions by the Oxford criteria and 11 (10.7%) patients had crescents. 62 patients had eGFR 30 mL/min and follow up for at least 6 months (median -17.7 (6-65.1) months) of whom 52(83.9%) had received ACEi/ARBs and 38 (61.3%) had received immunosuppression. 11/62 (17.7%) patients developed renal worsening in this period of which 7 (11.3%) developed end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Conclusion Indian patients with primary IgA nephropathy have a unique profile. They commonly present with nephrotic range proteinuria. A significant proportion of these patients have normal renal function despite heavy proteinuria. Mesangial proliferative lesions are predominant with a paucity of endocapillary proliferation and crescents compared to other Asian populations. Immunosuppressive use is more common in Indian patients.

AB  - Background: Phenytoin, mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme system, has a narrow therapeutic index and may have adverse effects due to inter-individual variation in the dose requirement and genetic polymorphisms. This cross-sectional study was done to study the prevalence of cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 polymorphisms in Indian epileptic children and to see the effect of polymorphisms on serum levels in epileptic children on phenytoin monotherapy.
   Methods: We studied 89 epileptic children of North Indian population, randomly selected, to see the genotypic and allelic frequency of CYP2C9 and its association with drug levels on phenytoin monotherapy. Analysis was done using STATA 9 Software. The results were analyzed as prevalence at 95 % C.I. (Confidence Interval). The difference in mean phenytoin serum levels between wild and mutant alleles was tested using Student's T test for independent samples. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: CYP2C9*1, *2 & *3 allelic frequencies were 85.4, 4.5 and 10.1 % respectively. CYP2C9*3 allelic group showed significantly higher serum phenytoin levels compared to the wild variants (P = 0.009). There was no statistically significant difference in the dose received (P = 0.12) and side effects of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 genotypes (P = 0.442 and 0.597 respectively) when compared with wild variant.
   Conclusion: CYP2C9*3 is more common than *2 in the present study. All the polymorphisms demonstrated in our study were heterozygous with no homozygosity. Serum phenytoin levels are higher in polymorphic groups (*3) which suggest their poor metabolizing nature. Genotyping may help to avoid toxicity and concentration-dependent adverse effects.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by different species of protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. It is a major health problem yet neglected tropical diseases, with approximately 350 million people worldwide at risk and more than 1.5 million infections occurring each year. Leishmaniasis has different clinical manifestations, including visceral (VL or kala-azar), cutaneous (CL), mucocutaneous (MCL), diffuse cutaneous (DCL) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Currently, the only mean to treat and control leishmaniasis is by rational medications and vector control. However, the number of available drugs is limited and even these are either exorbitantly priced, have toxic side effects or prove ineffective due to the emergence of resistant strains. On the other hand, the vector control methods are not so efficient. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing a safe, effective, and affordable vaccine for the prevention of leishmaniasis. Although in recent years a large body of researchers has concentrated their efforts on this issue, yet only three vaccine candidates have gone for clinical trial, until date. These are: (i) killed vaccine in Brazil for human immunotherapy; (ii) live attenuated vaccine for humans in Uzbekistan; and (iii) second-generation vaccine for dog prophylaxis in Brazil. Nevertheless, there are at least half a dozen vaccine candidates in the pipeline. One can expect that, in the near future, the understanding of the whole genome of Leishmania spp. will expand the vaccine discovery and strategies that may provide novel vaccines. The present review focuses on the development and the status of various vaccines and potential vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis.

AB  - The gut microbiome has varied impact on the wellbeing of humans. It is influenced by different factors such as age, dietary habits, socio-economic status, geographic location, and genetic makeup of individuals. For devising microbiome-based therapies, it is crucial to identify population specific features of the gut microbiome. Indian population is one of the most ethnically, culturally, and geographically diverse, but the gut microbiome features remain largely unknown. The present study describes gut microbial communities of healthy Indian subjects and compares it with the microbiota from other populations. Based on large differences in alpha diversity indices, abundance of 11 bacterial phyla and individual specific OTUs, we report inter-individual variations in gut microbial communities of these subjects. While the gut microbiome of Indians is different from that of Americans, it shared high similarity to individuals from the Indian subcontinent i.e., Bangladeshi. Distinctive feature of Indian gut microbiota is the predominance of genus Prevotella and Megasphaera. Further, when compared with other non-human primates, it appears that Indians share more OTUs with omnivorous mammals. Our metagenomic imputation indicates higher potential for glycan biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism in these subjects. Our study indicates urgent need of identification of population specific microbiome biomarkers of Indian subpopulations to have more holistic view of the Indian gut microbiome and its health implications.

AB  - Rhamnolipid-biosurfactants are known to be produced by the genus Pseudomonas, however recent literature reported that rhamnolipids (RLs) are distributed among diverse microbial genera. To integrate the evolutionary implications of rhamnosyl transferase among various groups of microorganisms, a comprehensive comparative motif analysis was performed amongst bacterial producers. Findings on new RL-producing microorganism is helpful from a biotechnological perspective and to replace infective P. aeruginosa strains which ultimately ensure industrially safe production of RLs. Halotolerant biosurfactants are required for efficient bioremediation of marine oil spills. An insight on the exploitation of marine microbes as the potential source of RL biosurfactants is highlighted in the present review. An economic production process, solid-state fermentation using agro-industrial and industrial waste would increase the scope of biosurfactants commercialization. Potential and prospective applications of RL-biosurfactants including hydrocarbon bioremediation, heavy metal removal, antibiofilm activity/biofilm disruption and greener synthesis of nanoparticles are highlighted in this review.

AB  - BackgroundParathyroid carcinoma is extremely rare. Correct preoperative and even histopathological diagnosis may be difficult owing to the deceptively bland cytoarchitectural features, especially when presenting with localized disease. Recurrence/metastases developing years later then make the malignant nature obvious.
   Methods and ResultsWe present here an unusual case of a 32-year-old patient with carcinoma of the left upper parathyroid gland, initially diagnosed as parathyroid adenoma, treated with endoscopic left parathyroidectomy, and later developing subcutaneous metastatic nodules over the medial end of the right clavicle and right anterior chest wall, followed by a right breast deposit. The recurrences, especially subcutaneous ones, were probably secondary to tumor seeding along the track of insertion of the endoscope.
   ConclusionInvolvement of subcutaneous tissue and the breast in parathyroid carcinoma is extremely rare. The case is being reported for its uniqueness along with a discussion of possible appropriate course of management, which may have averted the aggressive clinical course of the disease.

AB  - Although a recent clinical trial (BEST TRIP) demonstrated no improvement in outcomes with invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (ICPM) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), its generalizability has been called into question. In several global settings ICPM is not the standard of care and is used at the discretion of the attending neurosurgeon. Our objective was to determine the impact of ICPM on mortality and 6-month functional outcomes following severe TBI. The setting was a referral trauma center with 36 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 300-600 TBI admissions per year. During a 2-year period data were prospectively entered into a severe TBI registry. Patients with severe TBI aged >12 years meeting Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) criteria for ICPM were included in the study. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and poor 6-month functional outcome defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score of 3 or lower. A propensity score based analysis incorporating known predictors of outcome in TBI was utilized to examine the impact of ICPM on outcomes. Of 1345 patients meeting study criteria 497 (37%) underwent ICPM. In-hospital mortality was 35% (471/1345). Of 454 patients for whom 6-month outcome was available, 161 (35%) suffered a poor functional outcome. Following propensity score analysis ICPM use was associated with an 8% (p = 0.002) decrease in mortality but no significant effect (p = 0.2) on functional outcome. The use of ICPM following severe TBI was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. Further clinical trials of ICPM in TBI may be warranted.

AB  - Given the involvement of telomerase activation and dysregulated metabolism in glioma progression, the connection between these two critical players was investigated. Pharmacological inhibition of human Telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) by Costunolide induced glioma cell apoptosis in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Costunolide induced an ROS-dependent increase in p53 abrogated telomerase activity. Costunolide decreased Nrf2 level; and ectopic Nrf2 expression decreased Costunolide-induced ROS generation. While TERT knock-down abrogated Nrf2 levels, overexpression of Nrf2 increased TERT expression. Inhibition of hTERT either by Costunolide, or by siRNA or dominant-negative hTERT (DN-hTERT) abrogated (i) expression of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and Transketolase (TKT)-two major nodes in the pentose phosphate (PPP) pathway; and (ii) phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS). hTERT knock-down decreased TKT activity and increased glycogen accumulation. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of TKT elevated glycogen accumulation. Coherent with the in vitro findings, Costunolide reduced tumor burden in heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. Costunolide-treated tumors exhibited diminished TKT activity, heightened glycogen accumulation, and increased senescence. Importantly, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient tumors bearing TERT promoter mutations (C228T and C250T) known to be associated with increased telomerase activity; exhibited elevated Nrf2 and TKT expression and decreased glycogen accumulation. Taken together, our findings highlight the previously unknown (i) role of telomerase in the regulation of PPP and glycogen accumulation and (ii) the involvement of Nrf2-TERT loop in maintaining oxidative defense responses in glioma cells.

AB  - Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculous with substantial mortality. In May 2015, 54 researchers from 10 countries met in Da Lat, Vietnam, to discuss advances in TBM. Among the attendees were researchers involved in pivotal studies on the use of Xpert MTB/Rif for TBM diagnosis. Attendees discussed the 2014World Health Organization strong recommendation favoring the use of Xpert "in preference to conventional microscopy and culture as the initial diagnostic test for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) if the sample volume is low or if additional specimens cannot be obtained to make a quick diagnosis." Attendees were concerned that the limitations of Xpert testing for TBM are not emphasized. Clear guidance is needed for the investigational pathway for TBM, including recommendations on the diagnostic package of investigations, which does not stop with Xpert testing. Second, emphasis on the large CSF volumes (ideally 8-10 mL) needed for Xpert testing is required. Guidelines should also emphasize that TBM is a medical emergency and early treatment reduces mortality.

AB  - Genetic variation in DNA repair genes can modulate DNA repair capacity and may be related to the risk of cancer. The human papillomavirus is considered to be a necessary but not sufficient cause for cervical cancer and, therefore, other factors contribute to the carcinogenesis. A hereditary component for this neoplasia has been reported. Evaluation of the association of six polymorphisms was carried out in the following DNA repair genes: XRCC1 (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln), ERCC1 (Asp118Asp), ERCC2 (Lys751Gln), and ERCC4 (Arg415Gln). The cases (n=110) included 65 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 45 squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). Controls (n=68) were recruited from among women without cervical abnormalities. Genotypes were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing. A positive association was observed between the polymorphisms of XRCC1 genes, that is, in codons 194 [P=0.001, odds ratio (OR)=20.1, 95% confidence interval (CI)=5.9-68.8], 280 (P=0.001, OR=5.4, 95% CI=2.3-12.6), and 399 (P=0.008, OR=4.2, 95% CI=1.5-12.1) and cervical cancer. SIL patients also showed a significant association with codon 194 (P=0.012, OR=3.8, 95% CI=1.3-10.6), but not with 280 (P=0.35) and 399 (P=0.81). A positive correlation was also found in ERCC4 Gln415Gln in both SCCs and SILs (P=0.001, OR=21.3, 95% CI=7.1-64.0 and P=0.001, OR=7.8, 95% CI=2.9-20.9, respectively). For ERCC2 Gln751Gln, the association was significant for both SCCs (P=0.001, OR=10.1, 95% CI=2.6-37.9) and SILs (P=0.001, OR=8.9, 95% CI=2.8-28.3). However, the risk of SCC did not appear to differ significantly among individuals with the ERCC1 Asp118Asp genotype (P=0.404). For SILs, it appeared to be a protective genotype (95% CI=0.1-0.7). This study indicates that variant types of DNA repair genes play an important role in modifying individual susceptibility to SCC. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To describe four cases of intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) during penetrating keratoplasty and to review the literature.
   Methods: Cases with intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty over 3-year period were reviewed. The parameters evaluated were ocular and systemic risk factors, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. A review of literature of intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty was also conducted.
   Results: Of the 543 cases that underwent penetrating keratoplasty for optical indications during the study period, four cases developed intraoperative SCH, which is an incidence of 0.73%. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurred in the following cases: failed pediatric graft, donor eye in a case of contralateral autokeratoplasty, Marfan syndrome with aphakic bullous keratopathy who had undergone multiple ocular surgeries, and a case of healed keratitis with corneoiridic scar. The mean age, axial length, and intraocular pressure were 32.7522.17 years (range, 4-57 years), 23.29 +/- 2.12 mm (range, 20.38-25.2 mm), and 16.25 +/- 3.86 mm Hg (range, 16-20 mm Hg), respectively. Postoperatively, two eyes had a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of counting fingers. The third case had BCVA of light perception (LP), and fourth eye had no LP.
   Conclusion: The visual outcomes in cases of open-sky penetrating keratoplasty with SCH continue to be abysmally poor. The importance of thoroughly informing the patient about this complication cannot be underrated.

AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are the causative agents of severe sight-threatening infection of the cornea. This study was designed to characterize the genotype of 20 Acanthamoeba spp. isolates obtained from corneal scrapings of 183 suspected Acanthamoeba keratitis patients reporting to the Outpatient Department/Casualty Services of Dr R. P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India during the period 2011-2015. Corneal scrapings were inoculated onto 2 % non-nutrient agar plates overlaid with Escherichia coli and incubated at 30 degrees C for 15 days. Amongst 183 suspected Acanthamoeba keratitis patients, 29 were found culture-positive for Acanthamoeba spp. out of which 20 samples were established in axenic culture for molecular analysis. DNA was isolated and PCR assay was performed for the amplification of the diagnostic fragment 3 (DF3) (similar to 280 bp) region of the 18S rRNA gene from axenic culture of 20 Acanthamoeba spp. isolates. Rns genotyping was performed on the basis of variation in nucleotide sequences of the DF3 region of the 18S rRNA gene. In the phylogenetic analysis, 16 of the 20 isolates were found to be of prevalent genotype T4, two were of genotype T10 and the remaining two isolates were of unassigned genotypes. Hence, it was concluded that genotype T4 was found as the most predominant genotype involved in Acanthamoeba keratitis infections. Genotype T10, which had not been reported from India, was detected for the first time in two patients. Two isolates were found to be unique, which shared <95 % homology with all the known genotypes (T1-T20) of Acanthamoeba spp.

AB  - Background. Globally, more than 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression. Elderly persons are more vulnerable to depression. We conducted this study to estimate the prevalence of depression, and to study the association of depression with sociodemographic and clinical variables among elderly persons in a rural community.
   Methods. We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study among 395 randomly selected elderly persons aged 60 years and above in a rural area of Ballabgarh, Haryana, India. The participants were screened by using the Geriatric Depression Scale, and diagnosis was confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Multivariate analysis was done for Independent predictors of depression.
   Results. The prevalence of depression was 11.4% (95% Cl 8.6%-14.9%). Living in a nuclear family (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.98, 95% Cl 3.40-23.71), lack of physical activity (AOR 4.95, 95% Cl 2.00-12.27), whole-time involvement in household work (AOR 4.47, 95% Cl 1.18-16.93), presence of two or more chronic diseases (AOR 4.45, 95% Cl 1.60-12.35), having no role in family decision-making (AOR 2.77, 95% Cl 1.19-6.42), sleep problems in past one year (AOR 2.97, 95% Cl 1.32-6.69) and bilateral hearing impairment (AOR 4.00, 95% Cl 1.80-8.88) were factors associated with depression in elderly persons.
   Conclusions. Depression is common among elderly persons in rural areas. Individuals providing healthcare to elderly persons need to be trained to identify depression and take appropriate action; elderly persons with chronic diseases and hearing impairment deserve special attention.

AB  - Hypoxia is a salient feature of most solid tumors and plays a central role in tumor progression owing to its multiple contributions to therapeutic resistance, metastasis, angiogenesis and stemness properties. Reports exist in literature about hypoxia increasing sternness characteristics and invasiveness potential of malignant cells. In order to delineate molecular crosstalk among factors driving glioma progression, we used knockdown and overexpression strategies. We have demonstrated that U87MG and A172 glioma cells inherently have a subset of cells with high migratory potential due to migration-inducing Mena transcripts. These cells also have elevated stemness markers (Sox-2 and Oct-4). There was a significant increase of number in this subset of migratory cells on exposure to hypoxia with corresponding elevation (over 1000 fold) in migration-inducing Mena transcripts. We were able to demonstrate that a HIF-2 alpha-Sox-2/Oct-4-Mena (INV) axis that is strongly activated in hypoxia and markedly increases the migratory potential of the cells. Such cells also formed tumor spheres with greater efficiency. We have correlated our in-vitro results with human glioblastoma samples and found that hypoxia, invasiveness and sternness markers correlated well in native tumor samples. This study identifies a novel signaling mechanism mediated by HIF-2 alpha in regulating invasiveness and stemness characteristics, suggesting that under hypoxic conditions, some tumor cells acquire more migratory potential by increased Pan Mena and Mena INV expression as a consequence of this HIF-2 alpha mediated increase in Oct-4 and Sox-2. These properties would help the cells to form a new nidus after local invasion or metastasis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND:Corpus callosotomy is a palliative procedure especially for Lennox-Gastaut semiology without localization with drop attacks.OBJECTIVE:To describe endoscopic-assisted complete corpus callosotomy combined with anterior, hippocampal, and posterior commissurotomy.METHODS:Patients with drug refractory epilepsy having drop attacks as the predominant seizure type, bilateral abnormalities on imaging, and moderate to severe mental retardation were included. All underwent a complete workup (including magnetic resonance imaging).RESULTS:Patients (n = 16, mean age 11.4 6.4 years, range 6-19 years) had a mean seizure frequency of 24.5 19.8/days (range 1-60) and a mean intelligence quotient of 25.23 10.71. All had syndromic diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with the following etiologies: hypoxic insult (10), lissencephaly (2), bilateral band heterotropia (2), and microgyria and pachygyria (2). Surgery included complete callosotomy and the section of anterior and posterior commissure by microscopic approach through a mini craniotomy (11) and endoscopic-assisted approach (5). Complications included meningitis (1), hyperammonemic encephalopathy (2), and acute transient disconnection (5). There was no mortality or long-term morbidity. Mean follow-up was 18 4.7 months (range 16-27 months). Drop attacks stopped in all. Seizure frequency/duration decreased >90% in 10 patients and >50% in 5 patients, and increased in 1 patient. All patients attained presurgical functional levels in 3 to 6 months. Child behavior checklist scores showed no deterioration. Parental questionnaires reported 90% satisfaction attributed to the control of drop attacks. The series was compared retrospectively with an age/sex-matched cohort (where a callosotomy only was performed), and showed better outcome for drop attacks (P < .003).CONCLUSION:This preliminary study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of complete callosotomy with anterior, hippocampal, and posterior commissurotomy in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (drop attacks) with moderate to severe mental retardation.ABBREVIATIONS:AC, anterior commissureACT, anterior commissurotomyCBCL, child behavior check listCC, corpus callosotomyHC, hippocampal commissureHCT, hippocampal commissurotomyIQ, intelligence quotientPC, posterior commissurePCT, posterior commissurotomy

AB  - Pisciculture by using composite effluent of Kolkata city is a common indigenous practice in East Calcutta Wetlands (ECW), a Ramsar site in India. Apprehension over the consequences of heavy metal pollution through this practice led to the present study to examine metal accumulation related histological changes in gill and liver tissues of Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cultivated in the wastewater fed fishponds of ECW if any. Further, induction of metallothionein, in liver tissues of the same fish was also studied. Concentration of metals (chromium(Cr), manganese(Mn), Iron(Fe), Copper(Cu), Zinc(Zn) and lead(Pb)) were evaluated and found higher in both water and bottom sediment of the wastewater fed fishponds. In fish, liver was the major site for accumulation of metals with a metal profile of Fe > Cu > Zn > Mn > Cr > Pb. Microscopic studies including optical, scanning electron microscopic (SEM), transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and atomic force microscopic (AFM) studies showed considerable changes. Higher expression of metallothionein was found in the liver of contaminated fish hepatocytes through flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immuno-gold labelling (IEM). It is assumed that chronic exposure of different metal complexes lead to tissue-specific changes in organisms which may also reflect their potential to adapt survival strategies.

AB  - Background: Proteins present in the latex of Calotropis procera have been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effect and to afford protection in various disease models. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of high molecular weight protein sub-fraction (LP PI) of latex of C. procera in ameliorating joint inflammation and hyperalgesia in a preclinical model of arthritis. Materials and Methods: Monoarthritis was induced in rats by intra-articular injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) and the effect of two doses of LP PI (5 and 25 mg/kg) and diclofenac (5 mg/kg) was evaluated on joint swelling, stair climbing ability, motility, and dorsal flexion pain on day 3. The rats were sacrificed on day 3 to measure tissue levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Evaluation of joint histology was also made. Results: Intra-articular injection of FCA produced joint swelling and difficulty in stair climbing ability, motility, and pain on flexion of the joint as revealed by scores obtained for these functional parameters. LP PI produced a dose-dependent decrease in joint swelling and improved joint functions. Arthritic rats also revealed altered oxidative homeostasis where joint tissue GSH levels were decreased and TBARS levels were increased as compared to normal rats. The levels of these oxidative stress markers were near normal in arthritic rats treated with LP PI. Moreover, treatment with LP PI also maintained the structural integrity of the joint. The protective effect of LP PI was comparable to the standard anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac. Conclusion: The findings of the present study show that LP PI fraction comprising high molecular weight proteins could be used for the alleviation of arthritic symptoms.

AB  - In-vitro immunofluorescent assays/imaging are routinely used methods of detecting antigens. The ability to perform ocular angiography to study the choroidal and retinal vasculature in real time provides us with a unique opportunity to perform real time in-vivo immunofluorescent imaging. This unique combination of in-vivo immunofluorescent imaging and live imaging of choroidal and retinal circulation can help detect antigens of infective organisms in-vivo to diagnose causative infective aetiology in cases of choroiditis/retinitis. The following paper describes the basic designing of such an imaging platform. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To study the perinatal survival and procedure-related (PR)complications after intrauterine transfusions in red cell alloimmunization.
   Prospective data of 102 women with Rh-alloimmunized pregnancy undergoing intrauterine intravascular transfusion for fetal anemia, from January 2011 to October 2014 were analyzed. Main outcome measures were perinatal survival and procedure-related (PR) complications.
   A total of 303 intrauterine transfusions were performed in 102 women. Of 102 fetuses, 22 were hydropic at first transfusion. The mean period of gestation and hematocrit at first transfusion was 26.9 +/- A 3.3 weeks (range 19.7-33.8 weeks) and 17 +/- A 7.82 % (range 5.7-30 %), respectively. Average number of transfusions was 2.97 (range 1-7) per patient. Overall survival was 93 % and mean period of gestation at delivery was 34.5 +/- A 1.94 (range 28.3-37.4) weeks. Mean hematocrit at delivery was 36.9 +/- A 8.77 % (range 10-66 %). Fetal death occurred in four cases (3PR), neonatal death occurred in three cases (2PR). Emergency cesarean delivery after transfusion was performed in four pregnancies. The total PR complication rate was 2.97 %, resulting in overall PR loss in 1.65 % per procedure.
   Our results compare favorably with other studies published in the literature. Intravascular transfusion is a safe procedure improving perinatal survival in fetuses with anemia due to Rh-alloimmunization.

AB  - Array-based profiling studies have shown implication of aberrant gene expression patterns in epileptogenesis. We have performed transcriptome analysis of hippocampal tissues resected from patients with MTLE-HS using RNAseq approach. Healthy tissues from tumour margins obtained during tumour surgeries were used as non-epileptic controls. RNA sequencing was performed using standard protocols on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Differential gene expression analysis of the RNAseq data revealed 56 significantly regulated genes in MTLE patients. Gene cluster analysis identified 3 important hubs of genes mostly linked to, neuroinflammation and innate immunity, synaptic transmission and neuronal network modulation which are supportive of intrinsic severity hypothesis of pharmacoresistance. This study identified various genes like FN1 which is central in our analysis, NEUROD6, RELN, TGF beta R2, NLRP1, SCRT1, CSNK2B, SCN1B, CABP1, KIF5A and antisense RNAs like AQP4-AS1 and KIRREL3-AS2 providing important insight into the understanding of the pathophysiology or genomic basis of drug refractory epilepsy due to MTS.

AB  - Background: In children, migraine with or without aura is a common entity, however variants like recurrent painful optic neuropathy (RPON) is rarely encountered.
   Case result: A 9 year old boy presented with headache for 1 week and restricted movements and drooping in both eyes for last 3 days. On examination he had bilateral ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. History of migrainous headache was present in the patient as well as his mother. His MRI brain with venogram, serum autoimmune markers, serum and urine toxicology screen and repetitive nerve stimulation test were normal. He received intravenous pulse followed by oral steroids for 6 weeks and was started on antimigraine prophylaxis. Eighteen months since the attack, he has improved completely with mild asymmetric mydriasis persisting.
   Discussion and conclusion: This may represent first attack of RPON in a child with migraine. Rarely this may herald the onset of migraine as well, index of suspicion should be high as it is a diagnosis of exclusion and a treatable entity. (C) 2015 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - Earlier data on the relationship of 25 hydroxyvitamins (25OHD) levels with various components of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been conflicting. We studied 122 normal body mass index (BMI) women with PCOS (cases) and 46 age and BMI-matched healthy women (controls) and assessed the impact of serum 25OHD levels on clinical, biochemical and insulin sensitivity parameters in these lean Indian women with PCOS. The mean age and BMI of the cases and controls were comparable. Mean serum 25OHD levels respectively were 10.1 +/- 9.9 and 7.9 +/- 6.8ng/ml with 87.7% and 91.1% vitamin D (VD) deficient. No significant correlation was noted between 25OHD levels and clinical, biochemical and insulin sensitivity parameters except with the total testosterone levels (p=0.007). Also, no significant difference in these parameters was observed once the PCOS women were stratified into various subgroups based on the serum 25OHD levels. We conclude that VD deficiency being common in normal BMI Indian women with or without PCOS does not seem to alter the metabolic phenotype in these women.

AB  - AIM: Intracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms are an extremely rare cause of spontaneous epistaxis, with a few documented cases. The management of such cases is challenging due to the relative anatomical inaccessibility of the bleeding point. The aim of the present study was to acquaint the readers with this rare type of aneurysm presenting with epistaxis and to report our experience of treating cases of severe epistaxis due to internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms.
   MATERIAL and METHODS: Data of 4 patients with ICA aneurysms presenting with epistaxis from June 2011 to July 2013 was retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 16 to 62 years. Duration of epistaxis ranged from 3 months to 3 years. Two patients had severe epistaxis following transnasal biopsy. Two patients had a history of trauma. Two patients developed hemodynamically instability. All the patients were managed with trapping of the aneurysm. Complete exclusion of aneurysm from circulation was achieved in all the patients.
   CONCLUSION: ICA aneurysms can rarely present as life-endangering epistaxis. In patients presenting with a history of craniocerebral trauma, traumatic pseudoaneurysm must be considered as a differential diagnosis. Trapping of the aneurysm is a good option if there is good cross circulation.

AB  - Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare tumour of the sino-nasal tract. One-third cases present with intracranial extension. However, treatment options are limited for such cases.
   We herein report a case with large intracranial extension treated with Induction chemotherapy, de-bulking surgery, and image guided intensity modulated radiotherapy.
   The patient was treated with IGIMRT technique to a dose of 64 Gy in 32 fractions. Cone bean CT verification was done twice a week to eliminate set up error. The patient achieved complete resolution of the disease and was disease free 6 months after completion of treatment.
   IGIMRT even after a de-bulking surgery may help to achieve long-term disease control for patients with large intracranial extension with minimal morbidity.

AB  - We examined the effect of early intensive care unit (ICU) adherence to 2007 Brain Trauma Foundation Guideline indicators after traumatic brain injury (TBI) on inpatient mortality at a level 1 trauma center in India (Jay Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center [JPNATC]) and Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in U.S. among adults older than 18 years with severe TBI. At each site, ICU Guideline adherence in first 72 hours for 17 indicators was determined and expressed as a percentage. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. JPNATC and HMC Guideline adherence rates were 74.9% [11.0] and 71.6%(SD +/- 10.4), and overall in-hospital mortality was 24% and 27%, respectively. At JPNATC, less than 65% ICU Guideline adherence was associated with higher inpatient mortality (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.33) and an increase in ICU Guideline adherence rate by 1% was associated with a 3% lower in-hospital mortality (aRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99). Among patients discharged with a GOS score of 2-4 at JPNATC, 67% improved at 12 months (R-2 = 0.991; P < 0.01; 99% follow-up rate) compared with discharge, but 35%, 25%, and 14% of patients discharged with a GOS score of 3-5 deteriorated at 3, 6, and 12 months to a lower GOS at home. Achieving early ICU adherence to guideline indicators was feasible and associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality at JPNATC. Although the intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring rates varied, in-hospitals deaths were similar between the two institutions. Although long-term outcomes generally improved, patients discharged with favorable GOS score often deteriorated at home.

AB  - An elderly woman with subarachanoid hemorrhage presented to our interventional neuroradiology suite for coil embolization of multiple intracranial aneurysms. The patient had difficult vascular access for the passage of microcatheter; hence, the embolization procedure was carried out with direct puncture of the left common carotid artery. During the procedure, the patient developed thromboembolism which was treated by administration of an antiplatelet agent, abciximab. At the end of procedure, she developed airway compromise due to extension of a local neck hematoma into the superior mediastinum. The management issues in such a scenario have been discussed.

KW  - DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY

AB  - Background & objectives: Biopsy of palpable breast masses can be performed manually by palpation guidance or under imaging guidance. Based on retrospective studies, image guided biopsy is considered more accurate than palpation guided breast biopsy; however, these techniques have not been compared prospectively. We conducted this prospective study to verify the superiority and determine the size of beneficial effect of image guided biopsy over palpation guided biopsy.
   Methods: Over a period of 18 months, 36 patients each with palpable breast masses were randomized into palpation guided and image guided breast biopsy arms. Ultrasound was used for image guidance in 33 patients and mammographic (stereotactic) guidance in three patients. All biopsies were performed using 14 gauge automated core biopsy needles. Inconclusive, suspicious or imaging-histologic discordant biopsies were repeated.
   Results: Malignancy was found in 30 of 36 women in palpation guided biopsy arm and 27 of 36 women in image guided biopsy arm. Palpation guided biopsy had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 46.7, 100, 100, 27.3 per cent, respectively, for diagnosing breast cancer. Nineteen of 36 women (52.8%) required repeat biopsy because of inadequate samples (7 of 19), suspicious findings (2 of 19) or imaging-histologic discordance (10 of 19). On repeat biopsy, malignancy was found in all cases of imaging-histologic discordance. Image guided biopsy had 96.3 per cent sensitivity and 100 per cent specificity. There was no case of inadequate sample or imaging-histologic discordance with image guided biopsy.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our results showed that in palpable breast masses, image guided biopsy was superior to palpation guided biopsy in terms of sensitivity, false negative rate and repeat biopsy rates.

KW  - MARKER
AB  - Background: Napsin A is frequently used to classify a tumor of unknown origin as lung primary. Recent studies have shown that Napsin A positivity occurs in adenocarcinomas of non-pulmonary origin such as renal cell carcinomas, endometrial carcinomas, and clear cell carcinomas of ovary. Nonspecific reactivity has been reported with polyclonal Napsin A antibody. On the basis of an index case of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ALK-DLBCL) expressing Napsin A, which was misdiagnosed as poorly differentiated carcinoma of pulmonary origin, we studied Napsin A expression in our archived cases of ALK-DLBCL.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 3 cases of ALK-DLBCL were studied for Napsin A immunohistochemistry along with typical immunophenotypic profile of these cases. Archived paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and cytology aspiration smears were used for morphologic interpretation and immunohistochemistry. Rabbit monoclonal Napsin A antibody has been used.
   Results and Conclusions: All 3 cases were positive for Napsin A exhibiting strong cytoplasmic positivity. To the best of our knowledge, expression of monoclonal Napsin A in lymphomas has never been reported. ALK-DLBCL should be considered in the differential diagnosis when evaluating a Napsin A-positive tumor of poorly differentiated morphology and of unknown primary. As Napsin A has not been described in the lymphoid tissue development, the significance of Napsin A positivity in hematolymphoid neoplasms is unknown and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. It is associated with a high rate of distant tumor spread and consequent mortality. Unlike retinoblastoma, for which treatment advances over the last few decades have resulted in a dramatic improvement in survival, outcomes for patients with uveal melanoma remain unchanged. Despite improvement in local control of this tumor, roughly 50% of patients develop metastatic disease within 15 years. Delays in diagnosis and marked vascularity of this tumor may underlie that situation. Tumor size, location, histopathologic appearance, cytogenetic abnormalities, and molecular profiling are used in prognostication. The revised 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) manual has presented new information that may improve that process as well. Herein, we review current knowledge on uveal melanoma. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Medulloblastoma (MB) is composed of four molecular subgroups viz. WNT, SHH, groups 3 and 4, identified using various high-throughput methods. Translation of this molecular data into pathologist-friendly techniques that would be applicable in laboratories all over the world is a major challenge. Ninety-two MBs were analyzed using a panel of 10 IHC markers, real-time PCR for mRNA and miRNA expression, and FISH for MYC amplification. -catenin, GAB1 and YAP1 were the only IHC markers of utility in classification of MBs into three subgroups viz. WNT (9.8%), SHH (45.6%) and non-WNT/SHH (44.6%). mRNA expression could further classify some non-WNT/SHH tumors into groups 3 and 4. This, however, was dependent on integrity of RNA extracted from FFPE tissue. MYC amplification was seen in 20% of non-WNT/SHH cases and was associated with the worst prognosis. For routine diagnostic practice, we recommend classification of MBs into three subgroups: WNT, SHH and non-WNT/SHH, with supplementation by prognostic markers like MYC for non-WNT/SHH tumors. Using this panel, we propose a new three-tier risk stratification system for MBs. Molecular subgrouping with this limited panel is rapid, economical, works well on FFPE tissue and is reliable as it correlates significantly with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival.

   Cross-sectional
   Seven schools across Delhi, India.
   2010 school girls, aged 6-17 years
   Anthropometric measurement and pubertal staging was performed for all subjects. Menarche was recorded by 'status quo' method. Body mass index was used to define overweight/obesity. Serum gonadotropins and serum estradiol were measured in every sixth participant.
   Age at thelarche and menarche-analyzed for entire cohort and stratified based on body mass index.
   Median (95% CI) ages of thelarche, pubarche and menarche were 10.8 (10.7-10.9) y, 11.0. y (10.8-11.2) y and 12.4 y (12.2-12.5) y. Overweight/obese girls showed six months earlier onset of thelarche and menarche than those with normal BMI (P < 0.05). Serum gonadotropins did not vary significantly in overweight/obese subjects.
   The study provides the normative data for pubertal growth in Indian girls. Pubertal onset occurs earlier in overweight and obese girls.

AB  - Background. Inflammatory leg nodules are a diagnostically challenging group of dermatoses 'th limited tools for diagnosis. Considerable overlapping patterns exist despite their distinct clinical and histological features. We attempted to understand if undertaking investigations and studying the clinical course and treatment response can help in differentiating these dermatoses.
   Methods. Forty-three patients presenting with inflammatory leg nodules underwent a series of investigations apart from histopathology. The patients were treated as per the final histological diagnosis and observed for response to treatment and followed up to evaluate the clinical course.
   Results. There was considerable overlap in the investigations done among various dermatoses. These included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Mantoux test and anti-streptolysin-O (ASLO) titres in the majority of patients while a few had abnormal findings on chest X-ray, CT scan of the chest and doppler ultrasonography of the legs. About 86% of patients with erythema nodosum, 50% with erythema induratum, 57% with cutaneous medium vessel vasculitis and 93% with unclassified panniculitis responded to non-steroidal non-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone or had spontaneously resolved with only post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Other patients required specific treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents.
   Conclusions. There is considerable overlap in dermatoses manifesting as Inflammatory leg nodules on investigations, treatment received and response to treatment. To categorize them better into distinct entities, this group of dermatoses may require long-term follow-up of the clinical course and response to treatment, repeated Investigations especially histopathology during different phases of evolution and progression of disease.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a novel technique to release sticking haptic of a single-piece hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) using irrigation-aspiration (I/A) probe.
   Methods: In our technique, the I/A probe is introduced into the anterior chamber on Visco mode. Using the aspiration port of the I/A probe, the sticking haptic is held at its tip and suction force is built up until occlusion is noted. Then the haptic is nudged towards the center of the IOL along its curve. After the haptic is free from optic, the suction is released.
   Results: Several techniques have been described to release the sticking haptic such as squeezing the haptic at the site where it sticks to the IOL or using Sinskey hook for releasing the adhesion. These techniques require extra manipulation of the IOL by introduction of surgical instruments. In our technique, we used the I/A probe itself for separating the sticky haptic successfully.
   Conclusions: This technique allows separation of sticking haptic without any extra instrumentation, thus reducing intraocular maneuvering and total surgery time.

AB  - Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by replication in a combined total of 10,503 PACG cases and 29,567 controls drawn from 24 countries across Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. We observed significant evidence of disease association at five new genetic loci upon meta-analysis of all patient collections. These loci are at EPDR1 rs3816415 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, P = 5.94 x 10(-15)), CHAT rs1258267 (OR = 1.22, P = 2.85 x 10(-16)), GLIS3 rs736893 (OR = 1.18, P = 1.43 x 10(-14)), FERMT2 rs7494379 (OR = 1.14, P = 3.43 x 10(-11)), and DPM2-FAM102A rs3739821 (OR = 1.15, P = 8.32 x 10(-12)). We also confirmed significant association at three previously described loci (P < 5 x 10(-8) for each sentinel SNP at PLEKHA7, COL11A1, and PCMTD1-ST18)(1), providing new insights into the biology of PACG.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare late radiation toxicities in patients with carcinoma of cervix treated with pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) vs. high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary radiotherapy (ICRT).
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between July 2010 to April 2012, 37 patients with Stage (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009) squamous cell carcinoma of cervix were randomized to receive either HDR (7 Gy each in three fractions, repeated weekly) or PDR (70 cGy hourly pulses for 39 hours, total 27 Gy) ICRT after external beam radiotherapy. Late rectal and bladder toxicities were assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria, and vaginal toxicity was graded as per common terminology criteria for adverse events. Overall survival and disease-free survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.
   RESULTS; Nineteen patients received HDR and 18 received PDR ICRT with median followup 34 and 29 months, respectively. In HDR vs. PDR arm, late rectal toxicities grade >= 2 (16.7% vs. 21.1%, p = 1.000), grade >= 3 (10.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.486), late bladder toxicities grade >= 2 (10.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.486), and late vaginal toxicities grade >= 2 (15,8% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.604) were not statistically different. For HDR and PDR ICRT groups, 4-year disease-free survival was 67.1% vs. 71.8% (p = 0.195) and overall survival was 77% vs. 75% (p = 0.322), respectively.
   CONCLUSION: In this small group of patients, there were fewer events in form of late radiation toxicities in PDR arm, although statistically not significant. Further studies are required to define role of PDR compared to HDR ICRT in cervical carcinoma. (C) 2016 American Brachytherapy Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms occur mostly as a result of inflammation and trauma. Owing to high risk of rupture, they require early treatment to prevent lethal complications. Knowledge of the various approaches of embolization of pseudoaneurysms and different embolic materials used in the management of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms is essential for successful and safe embolization. We review and illustrate the endovascular, percutaneous and endoscopic ultrasound techniques used in the treatment of visceral artery pseudoaneurysm and briefly discuss the embolic materials and their benefits and risks.

AB  - Mycotic keratitis is a major cause of corneal blindness, especially in tropical and subtropical countries. The prognosis is markedly worse compared to bacterial keratitis. Delayed diagnosis and scarcity of effective antifungal agents are the major factors for poor outcome. Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made to rapidly diagnose cases with mycotic keratitis and increase the efficacy of treatment. This review article discusses the recent advances in diagnosis and management of mycotic keratitis with a brief discussion on rare and emerging organisms. A MEDLINE search was carried out for articles in English language, with the keywords, mycotic keratitis, fungal keratitis, emerging or atypical fungal pathogens in mycotic keratitis, investigations in mycotic keratitis, polymerase chain reaction in mycotic keratitis, confocal microscopy, treatment of mycotic keratitis, newer therapy for mycotic keratitis. All relevant articles were included in this review. Considering the limited studies available on newer diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in mycotic keratitis, case series as well as case reports were also included if felt important.

AB  - SETTING: Co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may lead to inadequate plasma concentrations of anti-tuberculosis drugs in children with tuberculosis (TB).
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the influence of HIV infection on the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol in children.
   DESIGN: Prospective drug estimation study in two cohorts of children: HIV-infected (n = 24) and non HIV-infected (n=32) with TB. Dosages used were based on earlier World Health Organization recommendations. All four drugs were estimated simultaneously using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.
   RESULTS: The HIV-TB co-infected children had a mean age of 105.9 months (standard deviation 43.1); there were 10 girls (41.7%). The maximum plasma concentration (C-max), time taken to achieve C-max, area under curve from 0-4 h and 2 h concentrations of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and pyrazinamide (PZA) were not affected by the HIV status of the children. Ethambutol (EMB) concentrations were lower in HIV TB co-infected children. Inadequate 2 h concentrations of INH, RMP and EMB were found in the majority of the children in both groups. PZA concentrations were adequate in almost all children. Younger age and lower dose were associated with lower 2 h concentrations of INH and RMP.
   CONCLUSION: Inadequate concentrations of INH, RMP and EMB in both HIV-TB-infected and non HIV-infected children provide support for the recently revised recommended doses of INH and RMP. EMB levels were lower in HIV-infected children; however, more studies are needed to validate this observation.

AB  - Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), a common cause of respiratory failure in neonates, is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effects of administration of (a) surfactant either as lung lavage (SLL) or bolus surfactant (BS) and (b) antibiotics on mortality and severe morbidities in neonates with MAS. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHOLIS and CABI using sensitive search strategies. We included eight studies on use of surfactant and three studies on use of antibiotics. Neither SLL nor BS reduced the risk of mortality in neonates with MAS (relative risk (RR) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 1.57; and RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.66, respectively). Both SLL and BS reduced the duration of hospital stay (mean difference -2.0, 95% CI -3.66 to -0.34; and RR -4.68, 95% CI -7.11 to -2.24 days, respectively) and duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference -1.31, 95% CI -1.91 to -0.72; and mean difference 5.4, 95% CI -9.76 to - 1.03 days). Neonates who received BS needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) less often than the controls (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.91). Use of antibiotics for MAS did not result in significant reduction in the risk of mortality, sepsis or duration of hospital stay. Surfactant administration either as SLL or BS for MAS was found to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay; BS also reduced the need for ECMO. Administration of antibiotics did not show any significant clinical benefits in neonates with MAS and no evidence of sepsis. Given the limited number of studies and small number of neonates enrolled, there is an urgent need to generate more evidence on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these two treatment modalities before recommending them in routine clinical practice.

AB  - Disease progression in HIV-1 infected children is faster than in adults. Less than 5% of the infected children maintain stable CD4 counts beyond 7 years of infection and are termed long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs). Delineating the host immune response in antiretroviral naive (ART) and treated HIV-1 infected children at different disease stages will help in understanding the immunopathogenesis of the disease.A total of 79 asymptomatic, perinatally HIV-1 infected children (50 ART naive and 29 ART treated) and 8 seronegative donors were recruited in this study. T- and B-cell activation PCR arrays were performed from the cDNA, using total RNA extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 14 HIV-1 infected children at different stages of the disease. The differentially expressed genes were identified. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed for the (interleukin-8) IL-8 gene and its transcriptional mediators, that is, SHP2, GRB2, and IL-8R (IL-8 receptor/CXCR1). Plasma levels of IL-8 were measured by flow cytometry.Gene array data revealed a higher expression of IL-8 in the ART naive HIV-1 infected progressors and in ART nonresponders than LTNPs and ART responders, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a significant higher expression of IL-8 (P<0.001), its receptor CXCR1 (P=0.03) and the upstream signaling molecule SHP2 (P=0.04) in the progressors versus LTNPs. Plasma levels of IL-8 were significantly higher in progressors versus LTNPs (P<0.001), and ART nonresponders versus ART responders (P<0.001). A significant negative correlation of plasma levels of IL-8 with CD4 counts (cells/L) was observed in HIV-1 infected ART naive subjects (r=-0.488; P<0.001), while the IL-8 levels positively correlated with viral load in the ART treated children (r=0.5494; P<0.001). ART naive progressors on follow up demonstrated a significant reduction in the mRNA expression (P=0.05) and plasma levels of IL-8 (P=0.05) post 6 months of ART initiation suggesting the beneficial role of ART therapy in reducing inflammation in infected children.Our data suggest that IL-8 may serve as a potential prognostic marker in adjunct with CD4 counts to monitor disease progression in the HIV-1 infected children and the efficacy of ART.

AB  - Background: Research is still going on for detecting the earliest glucose homeostasis derangements in individuals, which is crucial for the prevention of glucose intolerance. This cross-sectional study analyzes different insulin response patterns during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and their implications on glycemia in normoglycemic individuals. Subjects and Methods: The sample frame was the Offspring of Individuals with Diabetes Study database. All participants underwent OGTT. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, and 120min for measurement of insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels. Normal glucose tolerant individuals were selected for analysis. Results: Four hundred fifty subjects (mean age, 25 years) were included and divided into two groups according to timing of plasma insulin peaking during OGTT: Group 1, peaking at 30min; and Group 2, peaking at 60 or 120min. Body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance were comparable between the groups; however, Group 2 showed a significantly higher 60- and 120-min glucose level and lower disposition index. Based on the magnitude of the insulin levels, Group 1 was subdivided into Group N (normal pattern) and Group E (exaggerated pattern) with a 30-min insulin cutoff of 74U/mL (Group E, 74U/mL). Group 2 was subdivided into Group DL (delayed and limited pattern; 60-min insulin <73.0U/mL and 120-min insulin <80.0U/mL) and Group DE (delayed and exaggerated pattern; 60-min insulin 73.0U/mL or 120-min insulin 80.0U/mL). Group DE showed a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) of glucose compared with the other groups and had a lower disposition index and high-density lipoprotein levels. Group DL had significantly lower insulin resistance and BMI compared with Group E but showed a similar AUC of glucose. Conclusions: A delayed insulin pattern was associated with higher postprandial glucose levels. Individuals with delayed and exaggerated insulin secretion may have a higher risk for glucose intolerance.

AB  - The bilobal lactoferrin is an approximately 76 kDa glycoprotein. It sequesters two Fe3+ ions together with two CO32- ions. The C-terminal half (residues, Tyr342-Arg689, C-lobe) of bovine lactoferrin (BLF) (residues Ala1-Arg689) was prepared by limited proteolysis using trypsin. Both C-lobe and intact BLF were saturated to 100%. Both of them retained up to nearly 85% of iron at pH 6.5. At pH 5.0, C-lobe retained 75% of iron whereas intact protein could retain only slightly more than 60%. At pH 4.0 both contained 25% iron and at pH 2.0 they were left with iron concentration of only 10%. The structure of iron saturated C-lobe was determined at 2.79 angstrom resolution and refined to R-cryst and R-free factors of 0.205 and 0.273, respectively. The structure contains two crystallographically independent molecules, A and B. They were found to have identical structures with an r.m.s. shift of 0.5 angstrom for their C-alpha atoms. A high solvent content of 66% was observed in the crystals. The average value of an overall B-factor was 68.0 angstrom(2). The distance of 2.9 angstrom observed for the coordination bond between Fe3+ ion and N-e2 of His595 appeared to be considerably longer than the normally observed values of 1.9-2.2 angstrom. This indicated that the coordination bond involving His595 may be absent. Other coordination distances were observed in the range of 2.1-2.3 angstrom. Based on the present structure of iron saturated C-lobe, it may be stated that His595 is the first residue to dissociate from ferric ion when the pH is lowered. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - To study MAMLD1 gene polymorphisms, serum LH and testosterone levels amongst Indian children with isolated hypospadias (IH) and controls.
   Screening of the MAMLD1 gene was performed by PCR sequencing method in 100 Indian children aged 0-12 years presenting with IH and 100 controls. LH and testosterone hormone levels were also assessed (categorized in four age-wise groups).
   IH subjects had significantly higher incidence of MAMLD1 polymorphism as compared to controls (33 vs 15 %, p = 0.01). Of various genomic variants identified in this study, the noteworthy novel ones were missense mutation P299A and single nucleotide polymorphism c.2960C > T in 3' UTR of Exon 7. While p 299A was found to cause protein structural instability consequent to amino acid change, eighty percent subjects with c.2960C > T in 3' UTR of Exon 7 (corresponding to newly discovered currently non-validated exon 11) were found to have lower testosterone levels when compared with their age group mean. IH showed statistically higher incidence of c.2960C > T in comparison to controls (22 vs 10 %, p value 0.046) and about 2.5-folds higher risk of this anomaly.
   Occurrence of MAMDL1 gene polymorphisms, specially of c.2960C > T in 3' UTR of its exon 7 is associated with a higher risk of IH in Indian children, probably by lowering androgenic levels.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine application to the umbilical cord in neonates. We searched MEDLINE and other electronic databases, and included all RCTs that evaluated the effect of single or multiple chlorhexidine cord applications on the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and/or the incidence of systemic sepsis and omphalitis. A total of six RCTs four community-based cluster RCTs and two hospital-based trials were included in the review. Of the four cluster RCTs, three were conducted in South Asia in settings with high rates of home births (>92%) while the fourth, available only as an abstract, was conducted in Africa. Pooled analysis by the 'intention-to-treat' principle showed a significant reduction in NMR after chlorhexidine application (four studies; relative risk (RR) 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.95; fixed effects (FE) model). On subgroup analysis, only multiple applications showed a significant effect (four studies; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99) whereas a single application did not (one study; RR 0.86; 0.73 to 1.02). Similarly, only the community-based trials showed a significant reduction in NMR (three studies; RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95), while the hospital-based study did not find any effect (RR 0.11; 0.01 to 2.03). Since all the studies were conducted in high-NMR settings (>= 30 per 1000 live births), we could not determine the effect in settings with low NMRs. Only one study a hospital-based trial from India reported the incidence of neonatal sepsis; it did not find a significant reduction in any sepsis (RR 0.67;95% CI 0.35 to 1.28). Pooled analysis of community-based studies revealed significant reduction in the risk of omphalitis in infants who received the intervention (four studies; RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81). The hospital-based trial had no instances of omphalitis in either of the two groups. Chlorhexidine application delayed the time to cord separation (four studies; mean difference 2.11 days; 95% CI 2.07 to 2.15; FE model). Chlorhexidine application to the cord reduces the risk of neonatal mortality and omphalitis in infants born at home in high-NMR settings. Routine chlorhexidine application, preferably daily for 7 to 10 days after birth, should therefore be recommended in these infants. Given the paucity of evidence, there is presently no justification for recommending this intervention in infants born in health facilities and/or low-NMR settings.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the burden of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) and the effect of vitamin K prophylaxis on the incidence of VKDB. We searched MEDLINE and other electronic databases, and included all observational studies including population surveys as well as randomized controlled trials (RCT). The median (interquartile range) burden of late VKDB was 35 (10.5 to 80) per 100 000 live births in infants who had not received prophylaxis at birth; the burden was much higher in low- and middle-income countries as compared with high-income countries-80 (72 to 80) vs 8.8 (5.8 to 17.8) per 100 000 live births. Two randomized trials evaluated the effect of intramuscular (IM) prophylaxis on the risk of classical VKDB. Although one trial reported a significant reduction in the incidence of any bleeding (relative risk (RR). 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.96) and moderate to severe bleeding (RR 0.19, 0.08 to 0.46; number needed to treat (NNT) 74, 47 to 177), the other trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of secondary bleeding after circumcision in male neonates (RR 0.18, CI 0.08 to 0.42; NNT 9, 6 to 15). No RCTs evaluated the effect of vitamin K prophylaxis on late VKDB. Data from four surveillance studies indicate that the use of IM/subcutaneous vitamin K prophylaxis could significantly reduce the risk of late VKDB when compared with no prophylaxis (pooled RR 0.02; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.10). When compared with IM prophylaxis, a single oral dose of vitamin K increased the risk of VKDB (RR 24.5; 95% CI 7.4 to 81.0) but multiple oral doses did not (RR 3.64; CI 0.82 to 16.3). There is low-quality evidence from observational studies that routine IM administration of 1 mg of vitamin K at birth reduces the incidence of late VKDB during infancy. Given the high risk of mortality and morbidity in infants with late VKDB, it seems appropriate to administer IM vitamin K prophylaxis to all neonates at birth. Future studies should compare the efficacy and safety of multiple oral doses with IM vitamin K and also evaluate the optimal dose of vitamin K in preterm neonates.

AB  - Surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) has been shown to reduce mortality and air leaks in preterm neonates from high-income countries (HICs). The safety and efficacy of SRT in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been systematically evaluated. The major objectives of this review were to assess the (1) efficacy and, safety, and (2) feasibility and cost effectiveness of SRT in LMIC settings. We searched the following databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE and WHOLIS using the search, terms 'surfactant' OR 'pulmonary surfactant'. Both experimental and observational studies that enrolled preterm neonates with or at-risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and required surfactant (animal-derived or synthetic) were included. A total of 38 relevant studies were found; almost all were from level-3 neonatal units. Pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 22 observational studies showed a significant reduction in mortality at the last available time point in neonates who received SRT (relative risk (RR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.79). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of air leaks (five studies; RR 0.51; 0.29 to 0.90). One RCT and twelve observational studies reported the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with contrasting results; while the RCT and most before-after/cohort studies showed a significant reduction or no effect, the majority of the case-control studies demonstrated significantly higher odds of receiving SRT in neonates who developed BPD. Two studies one RCT and one observational found no difference in the proportion of neonates developing pulmonary hemorrhage, while another observational study reported a higher incidence in those receiving SRT. The failure rate of the intubate-surfactant-extubate (InSurE) technique requiring mechanical ventilation or referral varied from 34 to 45% in four case-series. No study reported on the cost effectiveness of SRT. Available evidence suggests that SRT is effective, safe and feasible in level-3 neonatal units and has the potential to reduce neonatal mortality and air leaks in low-resource settings as well. However, there is a need to generate more evidence on the cost effectiveness of SRT and its effect on BPD in LMIC settings.

AB  - About 99% of neonatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. There is a paucity of information on the exact timing of neonatal deaths in these settings. The objective of this review was to determine the timing of overall and cause-specific neonatal deaths in developing country settings. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHOLIS and CABI using sensitive search strategies. Searches were limited to studies involving humans published in the last 10 years. A total of 22 studies were included in the review. Pooled results indicate that about 62% of the total neonatal deaths occurred during the first 3 days of life; the first day alone accounted for two-thirds. Almost all asphyxia-related and the majority of prematurity- and malformation-related deaths occurred in the first week of life (98%, 83% and 78%, respectively). Only one-half of sepsis-related deaths occurred in the first week while one-quarter occurred in each of the second and third to fourth weeks of life. The distribution of both overall and cause-specific mortality did not differ greatly between Asia and Africa. The first 3 days after birth account for about 30% of under five child deaths. The first week of life accounts for most of asphyxia-, prematurity- and malformation -related mortality and one-half of sepsis-related deaths.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY

KW  - 4TH
AB  - Surgical management of complete third nerve paralysis is a challenge. While several techniques have been described over the years, they result in less than satisfactory outcomes with residual deviations in primary gaze or postoperative drifts. One of the described techniques for management of oculomotor palsy has been medial transposition of the lateral rectus muscle which provides a good surgical alternative but often can result in undercorrection. We describe a modification of the existing technique of medial transposition of the split lateral rectus by force augmentation through the use of equatorial fixation sutures resulting in an improved outcome in primary gaze alignment. The modified technique involves splitting of the lateral rectus into two halves followed by transposing the superior half from below the superior oblique and superior rectus and inferior half from below the inferior oblique and inferior rectus to attach them at the superior and inferior edge of the medial rectus insertion, respectively. This is followed by placing non-absorbable sutures to fix each split belly of the transposed muscles to the sclera at the equator adjacent to the medial rectus such that the split muscles lie nearly parallel to the medial rectus till the equator before reflecting away. These sutures augment the force of the transposed muscles by redirecting the force vectors in the direction of action of the medial rectus. Satisfactory postoperative primary gaze alignment was achieved in three cases of complete third nerve paralysis.

AB  - Aim: To estimate the prevalence of visual impairment (VI) due to uncorrected refractive error (URE) and to assess the barriers to utilization of services in the adult urban population of Delhi. Materials and Methods: A population-based rapid assessment of VI was conducted among people aged 40 years and above in 24 randomly selected clusters of East Delhi district. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) was assessed in each eye using Snellen's "E" chart. Pinhole examination was done if PVA was <20/60 in either eye and ocular examination to ascertain the cause of VI. Barriers to utilization of services for refractive error were recorded with questionnaires. Results: Of 2421 individuals enumerated, 2331 (96%) individuals were examined. Females were 50.7% among them. The mean age of all examined subjects was 51.32 +/- 10.5 years (standard deviation). VI in either eye due to URE was present in 275 individuals (11.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.5-13.1). URE was identified as the most common cause (53.4%) of VI. The overall prevalence of VI due to URE in the study population was 6.1% (95% CI: 5.1-7.0). The elder population as well as females were more likely to have VI due to URE (odds ratio [OR] = 12.3; P < 0.001 and OR = 1.5; P < 0.02). Lack of felt need was the most common reported barrier (31.5%). Conclusions: The prevalence of VI due to URE among the urban adult population of Delhi is still high despite the availability of abundant eye care facilities. The majority of reported barriers are related to human behavior and attitude toward the refractive error. Understanding these aspects will help in planning appropriate strategies to eliminate VI due to URE.

AB  - Background & objectives: Mutations in fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor have significant role in assessing outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Data for FLT3 surface expression in relation to FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) status and outcome are not available from India. The objective of the current study was to investigate adult patients with AML for FLT3 expression and FLT3 ITD mutation, and their association with long-term outcome.
   Methods: Total 51 consecutive de novo AML patients aged 18-60 yr were enrolled in the study. FLT3 ITD was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); flowcytometry and qPCR (Taqman probe chemistry) were used for assessment of FLT3 protein and transcript, respectively. Kaplan Meier curves were obtained for survival analysis followed by log rank test.
   Results: FLT3 ITD was present in eight (16%) patients. Complete remission was achieved in 33 (64.6%) patients. At 57.3 months, event free survival (EFS) was 26.9 +/- 6.3 per cent, disease free survival (DFS) 52.0 +/- 9.2 per cent, and overall survival event (OS) 34.5 +/- 7.4 per cent. FLT3 surface expression was positive (>20%) by flow-cytometry in 38 (88%) of the 51 patients. FLT3 surface expression and transcripts were not associated with FLT3 ITD status. FLT3 expression was significantly associated with inferior EFS (P=0.026) and OS (P=0.018) in those who were negative for FLT3 ITD.
   Interpretation & conclusions: This study evaluated FLT3 ITD mutation along with FLT3 expression in AML patients, and associated with survival. Negative impact of FLT3 surface expression on survival was observed in AML patients who were FLT3 ITD negative.

AB  - Purpose To determine whether radiographic measurements derived from standard computed tomography (CT) evaluation can be used to predict likelihood of a peri-operative lateral femoral wall fracture in AO/OTA 31-A2 pertrochanteric fractures treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS).
   Methods Fifty-one patients with AO/OTA 31-A2 classified pertrochanteric fractures were evaluated using a pre-operative CT scan of the pelvis with both hips. Dimensions of the lateral wall were calculated for each patient using four parameters: (1) height of the lateral wall above the vastus ridge; (2) circumference of the lateral wall 2 cm below the vastus ridge at an angle of 135 degrees; this circumference was further divided into an anterior, lateral and posterior component; (3) cortical thickness at the centre of the lateral component of the lateral wall; and (4) cortical index. All patients were treated with a 135 degrees DHS. Postoperative radiographs were assessed for lateral femoral wall fracture.
   Results Patients with a lateral wall fracture (17/51) had a smaller circumference (4.47 cm vs 5.44 cm p value<0.001) as well as a lower height of the lateral femoral wall (1.37 cm vs 2.21 p value<0.001). Analysis of the three components of the circumference revealed a significant difference for the anterior component only and not for the lateral and posterior components. There was no statistical difference in the cortical thickness or cortical index in the two groups. The cutoff values for height of the lateral wall and anterior component were calculated using ROC curves and found to be 1.68 cm (AUC 0.918) and 2.10 cm (AUC 0.851) respectively.
   Conclusion AO/OTA 31-A2 pertrochanteric fractures with a lateral wall height of >1.68 cm and an anterior component of >2.10 cm in circumference are not likely to sustain a lateral wall fracture when treated with a DHS.

AB  - Background & objectives: Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) are relatively uncommon, accounting for 2-3 per cent of primary brain tumours. Majority of these are diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) occurring both in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. We undertook this study to classify PCNSL into germinal centre (GC) and non-germinal centre (NGC) type based on Hans classification and to find the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in pathogenesis both by conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH).
   Methods: The consecutive cases of PCNSL during a 10 years period were analysed by IHC for CD45, CD20, CD3, B-cell lymphoma 2 and 6 (Bcl-2 and Bcl-6), B-cell specific octamer binding protein-1 (BOB-1), multiple myeloma oncogene-1 (MUM-1), EBV latent-membrane protein 1 (LMP-1), cyclin-D1, CD10, CD5 and CD23, as well as by CISH for EBV.
   Results: During a period of 10 years, 65 PCNSL were diagnosed which comprised 0.69 per cent (65/9476) of all intracranial tumours. The mean age of presentation was 49 yr with sex ratio (M:F) of 1.4:1. Most common location was supratentorial region with predominant involvement of frontal lobe. Single lesions were seen in 38 (58.4%) and multifocal lesions in 27 (41.5%) patients. None of the patients were immunocompromised. All cases were B cell immunophenotype and were DLBCL except one case of follicular lymphoma. According to Hans classification, majority of them were NGC (n=51, 79.6%) and 13 (20.3%) were GC type. Bcl-2 expression was noted in 34 (52.3%) tumours. EBV was positive in three (4.6%) cases; two were detected both by IHC and CISH and one case by CISH only.
   Interpretation & conclusions: In Indian population, PCNSL occurs mainly in immunocompetent patients, and a decade earlier than in western population. Immunophenotyping revealed that all cases were DLBCL with predominance of NGC type. No prognostic difference was seen between GC and NGC DLBCL. Association of EBV was rare and this virus was possibly not involved in the pathogenesis of PCNSL in immunocompetent individuals. CISH was an easy, economical and less cumbersome method for detection of EBV in PCNSL.

AB  - Background & objectives: Insidious symptomatology, late clinical presentation and poor prognosis of oesophageal cancer (EC) highlight the pressing need for novel non-invasive biomarkers for early tumour diagnosis and better prognosis. The present study was carried out to evaluate the clinical significance of circulating and tissue miR-144 expression in oesophageal cancer.
   Methods: Clinical significance of miR-144 expression was evaluated in preneoplastic (12) and neoplastic (35) oesophageal cancer tissues as well as matched distant non-malignant tissues using real-time PCR (qPCR). Circulating levels of miR-144 were also analyzed in serum samples of EC patients as well as normal individuals to determine the diagnostic potential of miR-144. Further, targets of miR-144 were predicted using bioinformatic tools and their gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned.
   Results: Real-time PCR analysis revealed significant upregulation of miR-144 in 29 of 35 (83%) EC tissues as compared to matched distant non-malignant tissues (P=0.010). All the dysplastic tissues showed upregulation of miR-144 as compared to their matched distant non-malignant tissues. Relative levels of circulating miR-144 in serum significantly distinguished EC patients from normal controls (P= 0.015; AUC = 0.731) with high sensitivity of 94.7 per cent. Bioinformatically predicted target, PUR-aplha (PURA) was found to be significantly (P= 0.018) downregulated in 81 per cent (26/32) EC patients and its expression was found to be significantly and negatively correlated with miR-144 expression at mRNA level.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed significant upregulation of miR-144 in serum samples of EC patients indicating its potential as minimally invasive marker. Further studies need to be done to understand the role of miR-144 in the pathogenesis of EC.

AB  - Retinoblastoma still represents a challenge for pediatric tumors. Mitochondria have been implicated in tumor progression, cell differentiation, and apoptotic pathways. Electron microscopy allows the study of mitochondrial morphology and it is still debated in human retinoblastoma. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological parameters were recorded in 17 enucleated retinoblastoma specimens. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to study tumor characteristics and the extent of invasion in ocular structures. The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the mitochondrial morphology in human retinoblastoma by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). There was a male preponderance in our study. Ages ranged from 2 to 78 months. Histopathological analysis revealed that 15 (88.2 %) tumors were poorly differentiated retinoblastomas. Massive choroidal invasion was the most frequent histopathological high-risk factor among the others. Histopathological high-risk factors were found in 7/17 (41.1 %) cases. Tumor samples of all patients were examined by means of TEM. All cases showed tumor cells with high nucleocytoplasmic ratio. Poorly differentiated retinoblastoma cases showed fewer mitochondria, scant cytoplasm, disorganized organelles (mitochondria), and necrosis, whereas well-differentiated retinoblastomas had larger number of mitochondria and more organized organelles. However, there was no significant difference in mitochondrial changes between invasive and noninvasive tumors. Our study observed that cristolysis and swollen mitochondria were more frequent in retinoblastoma tumors. Understanding the structural and functional characteristics of mitochondria in retinoblastoma might be essential for the design of future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background: Tobacco control is an important strategy to reduce the disease burden caused by several noncommunicable diseases. An in-depth understanding of the sociodemographic variations in tobacco use is an important step in achieving effective tobacco control.
   Aims: We aimed to estimate the age-standardized prevalence of any tobacco use and dual tobacco use and determine their association with sociodemographic variables in six countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Timor Leste) of the WHO South-East Asia Region.
   Methods: The main outcome variables "any tobacco use" and "current dual use" were created from the latest available Demographic and Health Surveys data for each country. The prevalence estimates were weighted using sample weights and age standardized using the WHO standard population. Associations between the sociodemographic variables and tobacco use were calculated by performing multivariable logistic regression analysis. Analyses were performed in Stata 12 using "svyset" and "svy" commands.
   Results: The highest prevalence of any tobacco use among men was in Indonesia (76.4%) and among women in Nepal (15.7%). Also, Nepal had the highest prevalence of dual tobacco use in both men (17.9%) and women (1.5%). With regard to sociodemographic determinants, despite the inter-country variations, any and dual tobacco use were significantly associated with age, higher education, greater wealth, rural residence, and ever-married marital status. The poor and uneducated had a higher odds ratio for these practices.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of dual tobacco use and its underlying socioeconomic disparities should be taken into account for the planning of tobacco control activities in the region.
   Implications: The dual tobacco use phenomenon is being increasingly recognized as a distinct entity in the fight against tobacco addiction. When compared with single product users, dual users have a greater risk of developing tobacco related diseases and are less likely to quit their habits. However, this phenomenon has not been studied adequately in the South-East Asia region. In this context, this study has provided a detailed and comprehensive view of dual tobacco use and its sociodemographic determinants in six countries of the region. This study recommends that tobacco control interventions should be targeted specifically at the disadvantaged sections of the society, such as the poor and the uneducated, who are more likely to engage in "dual" as well as "any" tobacco use. This study could prove as an important reference and tool for policy making in the South-East Asia region.

AB  - Neurosurgery is one of the most technically demanding medical professions that warrants a high level of expertise. In the present context of competitive medical practice, high societal expectations regarding quality of patient care and medicolegal and financial constraints, there are fewer opportunities for a trainee to achieve competency in standard neurosurgical, microsurgical, and operative techniques. Practice on simulation models like cadavers has been a trend since antiquity; however, recent development of newer models with their strategic modifications has given simulation education a new dimension. It has allowed trainees to acquire and improve surgical skills and knowledge in specifically fabricated and controlled settings with no risk to real patients. Simulation also offers the opportunity for deliberate practice and repetition unlimited number of times so that psychomotor skills can be automated. There is ever-growing evidence showing the positive impact of simulation on resident training in various areas of health care. Advances in computer technology and imaging, development of sophisticated virtual reality simulators with haptic feedback and the recent addition of three-dimensional printing technology, have opened a wide arena for the development of high-fidelity patient-specific models to complement current neurosurgical training. Simulation training in neurosurgery in India is still elementary since its inception at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. A structured modular training program has been developed which is yet to be implemented at a multi-institutional level. Stringent efforts are needed to establish a uniform resident training curriculum where simulators can be used to complement current neurosurgical training.

We present the case of a 50-year-old man with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, with rising thyroglobulin level and negative whole-body radioiodine scan after total thyroidectomy. Considering the limited treatment options available, it was decided to perform Ga-68-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT scan. It revealed intense radiotracer uptake in mediastinal and left supraclavicular lymph nodes, brain metastases, bilateral lung nodules, and skeletal sites. Patient also underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT. It demonstrated similar findings; however, the number of lesions detected in brain was less compared with Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the (1) feasibility and efficacy and (2) safety and cost effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE and WHOLIS-up to December 2014 and included all studies that enrolled neonates requiring CPAP therapy for any indication. We did not find any randomized trials from LMICs that have evaluated the efficacy of CPAP therapy. Pooled analysis of four observational studies showed 66% reduction in in-hospital mortality following CPAP in preterm neonates (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.82). One study reported 50% reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation following the introduction of bubble CPAP (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.66). The proportion of neonates who failed CPAP and required mechanical ventilation varied from 20 to 40% (eight studies). The incidence of air leaks varied from 0 to 7.2% (nine studies). One study reported a significant reduction in the cost of surfactant usage with the introduction of CPAP. Available evidence suggests that CPAP is a safe and effective mode of therapy in preterm neonates with respiratory distress in LMICs. It reduces the in-hospital mortality and the need for ventilation thereby minimizing the need for up-transfer to a referral hospital. But given the overall paucity of studies and the low quality evidence underscores the need for large high-quality studies on the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of CPAP therapy in these settings.

AB  - Overexpression of domains of a human protein using recombinant DNA technology has been challenging because individual domains intend to accumulate as non-soluble aggregate when expressed separately. Studies on identifying right sequences for a domain to be able to fold independently may help understand the folding pattern and underlying protein-engineering events to isolate the functional domains of a protein. In this report, individual domains of prostate cancer related biomarkers; MSMB and PSA were overexpressed in bacterial system and purified in their folded forms using affinity chromatography. The western blotting experiment using domain specific antibodies further confirmed these proteins. The designed nucleotide sequences domains were truncated using fold index software and folding were predicted by phyre2 and I-TASSER software. Other parameters were optimized for their overexpression and purification using Co-NTA affinity chromatography. Purified domains of each protein showed secondary structures such as alpha + beta type for PSA, alpha/beta and beta type for the each domains of PSA and MSMB respectively. This is the first report on producing PSA and MSMB individual domains in functional folded forms. This study may help produce the folded domain of many such proteins to be used for better diagnostic purpose.

AB  - The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effect of home visits by trained community health workers (CHWs) to successfully identify newborns and young infants (up to 59 days of age) with serious illness and improve care seeking from a health facility. The authors searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE. Abstracts of all articles were read by two authors independently and relevant articles selected. Data were extracted in a pretested questionnaire by two authors independently. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager software. A meta-analysis of included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out. Pooled estimates (risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of the evaluated outcome measures were calculated by the generic inverse variance method. Seven articles were identified for inclusion in the review. None of them compared the diagnosis of serious illness in young infants by health workers to a 'gold standard' diagnosis. Three studies were available for evaluating the ability of CHWs to identify seriously ill young infants/signs of serious illness. These studies suggest that sensitivity to identify serious illness ranged from 33.3 to 90.5% and specificity from 75.61 to 98.4%. For the outcome of improved care seeking from a health facility, after pooling the data from six RCTs with 4760 subjects in the intervention and 4398 subjects in the control arm, there was a significant improvement in care seeking in the home visit arm (RR=1.35; 95% CI=1.15 to 1.58). Moderate quality evidence indicated that home visits by trained CHWs were associated with improved care seeking for sick young infants from health facilities by appropriate health care providers in resource-limited settings. However, there is a lack of data regarding successful identification of serious illness. Evidence from validation studies supports the implementation of home visits by trained CHWs for improving outcomes in sick newborns and young infants in resource-limited areas. Further well-designed studies evaluating the effect of home visits by CHWs on successful identification of seriously ill newborns and young infants should include verification by a 'gold standard'.

AB  - Objective To assess the impact of corneal disease on vision-related quality of life (VR-QoL) in a rural North Indian population.
   Design Cross-sectional, population-based study.
   Methods The Corneal Opacity Rural Epidemiological (CORE) study included 12 899 participants from 25 randomly selected clusters of rural Gurgaon, Haryana, India, with the primary objective of determining the prevalence of corneal disease in the general population during July 2011 to January 2013. VR-QoL was assessed through Indian Vision Function questionnaire (IND-VFQ-33) in adult participants (aged >= 18 years) detected with corneal opacity and equal number of healthy controls (no ocular pathology with visual acuity of 6/6 binocularly) selected from the same clusters. Scores of the three subscales of IND-VFQ-33 (vision-specific mobility, psychosocial impact and visual symptoms) were computed, analysed and compared separately across various groups.
   Results Overall, 12 113 participants of all ages underwent detailed ophthalmic examination and VR-QoL was assessed in 435 cases with corneal disease and 435 controls without any ophthalmic disease. The diseased population had significantly higher scores and hence poorer VR-QoL across all three domains of vision function (scores of 28 vs 22; 6 vs 5 and 14 vs 9, respectively; p<0.0001) and the scores were inversely related with the level of visual impairment in patients with corneal disease. Patients with unilateral corneal disease also had poorer VR-QoL scores as compared with healthy controls (p<0.0001).
   Conclusions VR-QoL is impaired in patients with corneal disease, more so in patients with corneal blindness. This is the first population-based study to document VR-QoL through IND-VFQ-33 in the Indian population with corneal disease.

AB  - Background: Medial sphenoid wing meningiomas are medially located tumors on the sphenoid wing with attachment over the anterior clinoid process. They represent a distinct entity. These medial sphenoid wing meningiomas present a more difficult problem for the neurosurgeons because in a majority of cases, they involve the anterior visual pathways and arteries of the anterior circulation and may invade the cavernous sinus (CS). Higher morbidity, mortality and recurrence rates have been observed in these tumors compared with meningiomas in other locations. The rate of recurrence for medial sphenoid wing meningiomas is reported as being one of the highest amongst intracranial meningiomas.
   Material and Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed 78 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of medial sphenoid wing meningioma who were operated in our department from January 2008 to December 2012.
   Results: These patients, having a meningioma of the medial sphenoid ridge, were divided into two types depending on the involvement of CS. Diplopia, internal carotid artery encasement, and postoperative visual deterioration were more common in Type 2 tumors. Similarly, extent of resection and postoperative morbidity were greater in Type 2 patients.
   Conclusions: CS invasion confers an added risk to the surgical morbidity and outcomes. However, with proper surgical techniques, optimum outcomes can be achieved and overall surgical results at our center are found to be comparable to that of the current literature.

AB  - Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remain major causes of heart failure, stroke and death among African women and children, despite being preventable and imminently treatable. From 21 to 22 February 2015, the Social Cluster of the Africa Union Commission (AUC) hosted a consultation with RHD experts convened by the Pan-African Society of Cardiology (PASCAR) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to develop a 'roadmap' of key actions that need to be taken by governments to eliminate ARF and eradicate RHD in Africa.
   Seven priority areas for action were adopted: (1) create prospective disease registers at sentinel sites in affected countries to measure disease burden and track progress towards the reduction of mortality by 25% by the year 2025, (2) ensure an adequate supply of high-quality benzathine penicillin for the primary and secondary prevention of ARF/RHD, (3) improve access to reproductive health services for women with RHD and other non-communicable diseases (NCD), (4) decentralise technical expertise and technology for diagnosing and managing ARF and RHD (including ultrasound of the heart), (5) establish national and regional centres of excellence for essential cardiac surgery for the treatment of affected patients and training of cardiovascular practitioners of the future, (6) initiate national multi-sectoral RHD programmes within NCD control programmes of affected countries, and (7) foster international partnerships with multinational organsations for resource mobilisation, monitoring and evaluation of the programme to end RHD in Africa.
   This Addis Ababa communique has since been endorsed by African Union heads of state, and plans are underway to implement the roadmap in order to end ARF and RHD in Africa in our lifetime.

AB  - Trimethylamine (TMA) is a tertiary amine with a characteristic fishy odour. It is synthesised from dietary constituents, including choline, L-carnitine, betaine and lecithin by the action of microbial enzymes during both healthy and diseased conditions in humans. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a disease typified by its association with the characteristic fishy odour because of decreased TMA metabolism and excessive TMA excretion. Besides TMAU, a number of other diseases are associated with abnormal levels of TMA, including renal disorders, cancer, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. Aside from its role in pathobiology, TMA is a precursor of trimethylamine-N-oxide that has been associated with an increased risk of athero-thrombogenesis. Additionally, TMA is a major air pollutant originating from vehicular exhaust, food waste and animal husbandry industry. The adverse effects of TMA need to be monitored given its ubiquitous presence in air and easy absorption through human skin. In this review, we highlight multifaceted attributes of TMA with an emphasis on its physiological, pathological and environmental impacts. We propose a clinical surveillance of human TMA levels that can fully assess its role as a potential marker of microbial dysbiosis-based diseases.

AB  - AGE-RAGE interaction mediated oxidative stress and inflammation is the key mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in diabetes. Inhibition of AGE-RAGE axis by several PPAR-gamma agonists has shown positive results in ameliorating cardio-metabolic disease conditions. Chrysin, a natural flavonoid has shown to possess PPAR-gamma agonist activity along with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of chrysin in isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in diabetic rats. In male albino Wistar rats, diabetes was induced by single injection of streptozotocin (70 mg/kg, i.p.). After confirmation of the diabetes, rats were treated with vehicle (1.5 mL/kg, p.o.), chrysin (60 mg/kg, p.o.) or PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 28 days. Simultaneously, on 27th and 28th day myocardial injury was induced by isoproterenol (85 mg/kg, s.c.). Chrysin significantly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction as reflected by improved MAP, +/- LVdP/dtmax and LVEDP in diabetic rats. This improvement was associated with increased PPAR-gamma expression and reduced RAGE expression in diabetic rats. Chrysin significantly decreased inflammation through inhibiting NF-kappa Bp65/IKK-beta expression and TNF-alpha level. Additionally, chrysin significantly reduced apoptosis as indicated by augmented Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax and caspase-3 expressions. Furthermore, chrysin inhibited nitro-oxidative stress by normalizing the alteration in 8-OHdG, GSH, TBARS, NO and CAT levels and Nox4, MnSOD, eNOS and NT expressions. Co-administration of GW9662 significantly blunted the chrysin mediated cardioprotective effect as there was increase in oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis markers. Chrysin significantly ameliorated isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in diabetic rats via PPAR-gamma activation and inhibition of AGE-RAGE mediated oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have now become the leading cause of mortality in India. A quarter of all mortality is attributable to CVD. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are the predominant causes and are responsible for >80% of CVD deaths. The Global Burden of Disease study estimate of age-standardized CVD death rate of 272 per 100 000 population in India is higher than the global average of 235 per 100 000 population. Some aspects of the CVD epidemic in India are particular causes of concern, including its accelerated buildup, the early age of disease onset in the population, and the high case fatality rate. In India, the epidemiological transition from predominantly infectious disease conditions to noncommunicable diseases has occurred over a rather brief period of time. Premature mortality in terms of years of life lost because of CVD in India increased by 59%, from 23.2 million (1990) to 37 million (2010). Despite wide heterogeneity in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors across different regions, CVD has emerged as the leading cause of death in all parts of India, including poorer states and rural areas. The progression of the epidemic is characterized by the reversal of socioeconomic gradients; tobacco use and low fruit and vegetable intake have become more prevalent among those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition, individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds frequently do not receive optimal therapy, leading to poorer outcomes. Countering the epidemic requires the development of strategies such as the formulation and effective implementation of evidence-based policy, reinforcement of health systems, and emphasis on prevention, early detection, and treatment with the use of both conventional and innovative techniques. Several ongoing community-based studies are testing these strategies.

AB  - Children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have impaired focus on goal-relevant signals and fail to suppress goal-irrelevant distractions. To address both these issues, we developed a novel neuroplasticity-based training program that adaptively trains the resolution of challenging sensory signals and the suppression of progressively more challenging distractions. We evaluated this sensory signal-to-noise resolution training in a small sample, global mental health study in Indian children with ADHD. The children trained for 30 h over 6 months in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Training completers showed steady and significant improvements in ADHD-associated behaviors from baseline to post training relative to controls, and benefits sustained in a 6-month follow-up. Post-training cognitive assessments showed significant positive results for response inhibition and Stroop interference tests in training completers vs controls, while measures of sustained attention and short-term memory showed nonsignificant improvement trends. Further, training-driven improvements in distractor suppression correlated with the improved ADHD symptoms. This initial study suggests utility of signal-to-noise resolution training for children with ADHD; it emphasizes the need for further research on this intervention and substantially informs the design of a larger trial.

AB  - Background: Road traffic accident accounts for 70 % to 80 % of the blunt cardiac injury. The true incidence varies in the literature due to non-uniform criteria for diagnosis.
   Case Presentation: Here, we describe the case of a young male presenting after blunt chest injury and hemodynamic instability. Initially, the patient had frequent episodes of arrhythmias and hypotension due to cardiac injury per se. However, he was stabilized by day 2. Subsequently, patient developed cellulitis followed by septic shock and succumbed to cellulitis on day 5 of injury.
   Conclusion: Sepsis is difficult to be diagnosed and treated in the presence of cardiac injury. Myocardial depression has been found in sepsis, which contributes as an added comorbidity in an already compromised heart function. Sepsis also interferes with the diagnosis and follow-up of progress of blunt cardiac injury.

AB  - Mangiferin, a xanthone glycoside isolated from leaves of Mangifera indica (Anacardiaceae) is known to modulate many biological targets in inflammation and oxidative stress. The present study was designed to investigate whether mangiferin exerts protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and possible role of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPKs) and Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathways in its cardioprotection. Male albino Wistar rats were treated with mangiferin (40 mg/kg, i.p.) for 15 days. At the end of the treatment protocol, rats were subjected to IR injury consisting of 45 min ischemia followed by 1 h reperfusion. IR-control rats caused significant cardiac dysfunction, increased serum cardiac injury markers, lipid peroxidation and a significant decrease in tissue antioxidants as compared to sham group. Histopathological examination of IR rats revealed myocardial necrosis, edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells. However, pretreatment with mangiferin significantly restored myocardial oxidant-antioxidant status, maintained membrane integrity, and attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, pro-apoptotic proteins and TGF-beta. Furthermore, mangiferin significantly reduced the phosphorylation of p38, and JNK and enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These results suggest that mangiferin protects against myocardial IR injury by modulating MAPK mediated inflammation and apoptosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: This study was designed with objective to study pain response of infants to change in sequence of administration of Hepatitis B and DTwP vaccines.
   Methods: This was a randomized parallel control trial. The study was carried out in the immunization clinic of the Department of Pediatrics, LLRM Medical College, Meerut. One hundred and thirty healthy term infants up to 4 months of age were injected either DTwP vaccine first or Hepatitis B vaccine first, followed one minute later by the other vaccine.
   Result: Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups. The mean (SD) of AUC of MFCS and NIPS was significantly more in DF group as compared to HF group (for MFCS 25.5 +/- 5.4 versus 22.5 +/- 5.5, p < 0.01; for NIPS 31.77 +/- 5.5 versus 27.64 +/- 6.9, p < 0.01). Similarly mean (SD) of AUC of Heart rate and saturation of oxygen showed significant variation in DF group as compared to HF group (for heart rate 591.6 +/- 55 versus 559.6 +/- 49, p < 0.01; for SpO(2) 326.4 +/- 12 versus 335 +/- 8, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: These results showed that infant experienced lesser pain when Hepatitis B was administered first than when DTwP vaccine was given first. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Underweight and severe and morbid obesity are associated with highly elevated risks of adverse health outcomes. We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries.
   Methods We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories (<18.5 kg/m(2) [underweight], 18.5 kg/m(2) to <20 kg/m(2), 20 kg/m(2) to <25 kg/m(2), 25 kg/m(2) to <30 kg/m(2), 30 kg/m(2) to <35 kg/m(2), 35 kg/m(2) to <40 kg/m(2), = 40 kg/m(2) [morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions. We calculated the posterior probability of meeting the target of halting by 2025 the rise in obesity at its 2010 levels, if post-2000 trends continue.
   Findings We used 1698 population-based data sources, with more than 19.2 million adult participants (9.9 million men and 9.3 million women) in 186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made. Global age-standardised mean BMI increased from 21.7 kg/m(2) (95% credible interval 21.3-22.1) in 1975 to 24.2 kg/m(2) (24.0-24.4) in 2014 in men, and from 22.1 kg/m(2) (21.7-22.5) in 1975 to 24.4 kg/m(2) (24.2-24.6) in 2014 in women. Regional mean BMIs in 2014 for men ranged from 21.4 kg/m(2) in central Africa and south Asia to 29.2 kg/m(2) (28.6-29.8) in Polynesia and Micronesia; for women the range was from 21.8 kg/m(2) (21.4-22.3) in south Asia to 32.2 kg/m(2) (31.5-32.8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Over these four decades, age-standardised global prevalence of underweight decreased from 13.8% (10.5-17.4) to 8.8% (7.4-10.3) in men and from 14.6% (11.6-17.9) to 9.7% (8.3-11.1) in women. South Asia had the highest prevalence of underweight in 2014, 23.4% (17.8-29.2) in men and 24.0% (18.9-29.3) in women. Age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 3.2% (2.4-4.1) in 1975 to 10.8% (9.7-12.0) in 2014 in men, and from 6.4% (5.1-7.8) to 14.9% (13.6-16.1) in women. 2.3% (2.0-2.7) of the world's men and 5.0% (4.4-5.6) of women were severely obese (ie, have BMI = 35 kg/m(2)). Globally, prevalence of morbid obesity was 0.64% (0.46-0.86) in men and 1.6% (1.3-1.9) in women.
   Interpretation If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global obesity target is virtually zero. Rather, if these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18% in men and surpass 21% in women; severe obesity will surpass 6% in men and 9% in women. Nonetheless, underweight remains prevalent in the world's poorest regions, especially in south Asia. Copyright (C) NCD Risk Factor Collaboration.

AB  - Background Antibiograms often act as a reference guide for empirical selection of antibiotics. Hospital-wide antibiograms constructed on the basis of cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility data from diverse patient groups can often be misleading. In order to show the significance of age- and location-stratified antibiograms, this study compared hospital-wide antibiograms with stratified antibiograms for the clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods Stratified antibiograms were created on the basis of patient age (<18 years, 18-50 years, >50 years) and location (inpatient or outpatient) using all 2011, 2012 and 2013 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa isolates. Susceptibility rates were compared among cumulative and stratified antibiograms using non-parametric inferential statistics. Results The hospital-wide antibiogram under-estimated susceptibility rates in adult patients isolates (age group=18-50 years) and over-estimated susceptibility rates in isolates from the paediatric patients and elderly. Paediatric isolates were found to be less susceptible to amikacin and imipenem, whereas isolates from elderly patients >50 years were less susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Statistically significant difference was seen in the susceptibility rates of OPD and IPD isolates of P. aeruginosa in the case of the paediatric age group. Susceptibility rates for all drugs were lower for isolates from inpatients than from outpatients. Conclusion Age and location associated differences in susceptibility rates have the potential to influence empirical antibiotic selection, which was shown in stratified antibiograms of P. aeruginosa that is obscured by hospital-wide antibiograms.

AB  - The objective of this article is to provide an illustrative tutorial highlighting the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging to detect the spectrum of manifestations in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. FDG PET/CT is a powerful tool for making an early diagnosis; it allows higher diagnostic confidence with regard to lesions, measuring the extent of disease (staging) and assessing disease activity, and is consequently useful for evaluating the response to therapy in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

TI  - Angiomyomatous hamartoma of lymph nodes: Clinicopathological study of 6 cases with review of literature
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY
KW  - Angiomyomatous hamartoma

KW  - inguinal lymph node
AB  - Angiomyomatous hamartoma (AMH) is a rare disease with predisposition for inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. Histologically, it is characterized by replacement of lymph nodal parenchyma with irregularly distributed thick walled blood vessels, haphazardly arranged smooth muscle cells, variable amount of fat and fibrous tissue in a sclerotic lymphatic stroma. Few cases have also been reported in popliteal and sub - mandibular location. The exact pathogenesis is still not known. Although this entity is very rare, its recognition is important in discriminating it from other benign and malignant vascular lesions of lymph nodes.

AB  - An aging population is an important demographic issue in India. The knowledge base about kidney diseases among the elderly Indians is inadequate. We aim to delineate the clinical profile and spectrum of biopsy-proven kidney disease in elderly patients.
   Records of all elderly patients (a parts per thousand yen60 years) who had undergone kidney biopsy in the nephrology department from January 2010 to December 2014 were reviewed. Their clinical details and laboratory investigations at the time of biopsy were noted. Details of kidney biopsy were recorded from their biopsy reports.
   In total, 1728 patients underwent kidney biopsy during this period and 124 were elderly (7.2 %). Their mean age was 64.9 +/- A 4.9 years, and they were predominantly males (63.7 %). Mean serum creatinine was 3.0 +/- A 2.8 mg/dl, proteinuria was 4.0 +/- A 2.7 g/day, and 39.5 % had microscopic hematuria. The most common indications for biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (NS)-39.5 % and acute kidney injury/rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (AKI/RPGN)-24.2 %. Another 8.1 % patients had NS with AKI. MN (39.0 %) was the chief cause of NS, and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) (28.2 %) was the leading cause of AKI/RPGN. MN, pauci-immune crescentic GN and acute on chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (A/CTIN) and acute tubular injury (ATI) were more common in the elderly, while MCD, FSGS, IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis were more frequent in the younger patients. 68.5 % of the elderly patients biopsied were diagnosed with a renal disease which was potentially amenable to specific treatment.
   The spectrum of biopsy-proven kidney disease in the elderly Indians seen in our tertiary care hospital varies from the younger population. Kidney biopsy provides useful information with therapeutic and prognostic implications in these patients. The percentage of elderly patients among the total biopsied population is low in India, and these patients present late with renal dysfunction. Prospective studies are needed to assess the outcome of the commonly seen kidney diseases in elderly patients.

AB  - Ocular drug delivery by conventional routes of administration does not maintain therapeutic drug concentrations in the target tissues for a long duration because of various anatomical and physiological barriers. Treatment of diseases of the posterior segment of the eye requires novel drug delivery systems that can overcome these barriers for efficacious delivery, provide controlled release for the treatment of chronic diseases, and increase patient's and doctor's convenience to reduce the dosing frequency and associated side effects. Thereby, an increasing number of sustained-release drug delivery devices using different mechanisms have been developed. This article discusses various current and future sustained-release drug delivery systems for the posterior segment disorders.

AB  - Short stature has been reported in pediatric cancer survivors. Data on retinoblastoma survivors are limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the height in retinoblastoma survivors.
   The recorded height was compared with median height for age and sex as per the Indian Academy of Pediatrics. Z-score less than -2 was considered short statured.
   Thirty percent of the survivors were short statured. The mean height was shorter than the mean 50th percentile height (119.7 +/- A 14.8 vs 128.7 +/- A 15 cm, p < 0.001). Previous chemotherapy showed a trend toward association (p = 0.09).
   Short stature affects a significant number of retinoblastoma survivors.

AB  - Introduction: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most common occupationally acquired infections amongst the healthcare workers (HCWs) with critically ill patients attending the emergency department being the most common source of occupationally acquired infections. Therefore, the present study was conducted at a 165 bedded level-1 trauma centre of India to ascertain the seroprevalence rate of HIV, HBV and HCV; and thus the risk associated with the occupational exposure in a busy emergency setting of the developing world. Methodology: A retrospective, 7 years study (2007-2013) was carried out at the JPNA Trauma Centre of the 2,500 bedded All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Records of all patients whose serum samples were sent to the laboratory for viral markers testing were obtained and those falling in the red area were included. Results: A total of 11,630 patients were received in the red area; and samples from 7,650 patients were sent for testing. Seropositivity of HIV, HBV and HCV in these samples was 0.28%, 3.4% and 0.9% respectively. The number of samples received was lesser than the total number of patients received in the red area. Conclusion: Adopting Standard Precautions (SP) can be used as an easy method to decrease the risk of occupationally acquired infections.

AB  - Surgery is an important component of treatment in cancer patients. However, surgical stress, anesthesia, and perioperative analgesia interfere with the host immune defense mechanisms and may contribute to metastatic dissemination of malignant tumors and cancer progression. Little is known about the effects of anesthesia on tumor recurrence. In vivo studies and clinical data show some evidence that regional anesthesia is beneficial for cancer patients as it may decrease the risk of metastasis. This short review summarizes the clinical data on the possible association between anesthesia, perioperative analgesia, and the risk of cancer recurrence. Most of the clinical reports are based on retrospective studies, and properly designed prospective trials including a sufficient number of patients is required to reveal the interaction of various anesthetic drugs and methods and cancer progression.

AB  - Background: It has been noted that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the ischemic preconditioning (IPC)-mediated cardioprotection. Diabetes is a downregulator of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), resulting in low expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by which NO level get reduced. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of ANP in attenuated cardioprotective effect of IPC in the diabetic rat heart.
   Methods: The heart was isolated from the diabetic rat and mounted on Langendorff's apparatus, subjected to 30-min ischemia and 120-min reperfusion. IPC was mediated by four cycles of 5-min ischemia and 5-min reperfusion. The infarct size was estimated using triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain, and coronary effluent was analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase-MB release to assess the degree of myocardial injury. The cardiac release of NO was estimated indirectly by measuring the release of nitrite in coronary effluent.
   Results: IPC-mediated cardioprotection was significantly attenuated in the diabetic rat as compared with the normal rat. Perfusion of ANP (0.1 mu M/L) in the diabetic rat heart significantly restored the attenuated cardioprotective effect of IPC and also increased the release of NO. However, this observed cardioprotection was significantly attenuated by perfusion of N-nitro L-arginine methyl ester, an eNOS inhibitor (100 mu M/L) noted in terms of increase in myocardial infarct size, release of lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase-MB, and also decreases in release of NO.
   Conclusions: Thus, it is suggested that ANP restores the attenuated cardioprotective effect in the diabetic heart which may be due to increase in the expression of eNOS and subsequent increase in the activity of NO. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plasticity or neuronal plasticity is a unique and adaptive feature of nervous system which allows neurons to reorganize their interactions in response to an intrinsic or extrinsic stimulation and shapes the formation and maintenance of a functional neuronal circuit. Synaptic plasticity is the most important form of neural plasticity and plays critical role during the development allowing the formation of precise neural connectivity via the process of pruning. In the sensory systems-auditory and visual, this process is heavily dependent on the external cues perceived during the development. Environmental enrichment paradigms in an activity-dependent manner result in early maturation of the synapses and more efficient trans-synaptic signaling or communication flow. This has been extensively observed in the avian auditory system. On the other hand, stimuli results in negative effect can cause alterations in the synaptic connectivity and strength resulting in various developmental brain disorders including autism, fragile X syndrome and rett syndrome. In this review we discuss the role of different forms of activity (spontaneous or environmental) during the development of the nervous system in modifying synaptic plasticity necessary for shaping the adult brain. Also, we try to explore various factors (molecular, genetic and epigenetic) involved in altering the synaptic plasticity in positive and negative way.

AB  - Fusarium species are ubiquitously present in environment and are well known as human pathogens with high mortality rate in immunocompromised patients. We report here two cases where immunocompromised patients developed fatal bloodstream infections by this organism. Isolates were further identified by ITS1 region sequencing which confirmed them as Fusarium solani. Antifungal susceptibility testing was done following CLSI M38-A2 guidelines to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin. Both patients had a fatal outcome and expired of septic shock. Therefore, identification up to species level is of utmost importance as that helps in directing the management of the patient thereby leading to a favourable outcome.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to compare the myocardial perfusion defects in patients with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and right ventricular apex (RVA) pacing on stress-rest Tc-99m-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography.Patients and methodsA total of 31 patients with permanent pacemakers (RVOT: 16 and RVA: 15) underwent stress-rest Tc-99m-tetrofosmin involving a 1-day protocol. All patients underwent 1-day low-dose stress-gated and high-dose rest-gated Tc-99m-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography imaging.ResultsFixed perfusion defects were noted in 13 (42%) of 31 patients. Two (13%) patients of the RVOT group and 11 (69%) patients of the RVA group showed fixed perfusion defects (P=0.003). The fixed perfusion defects were located in the anteroapical, anteroseptal, and apical in the RVOT pacing group and in the apical, distal anteroseptal, inferoapical, distal anterior, and distal inferoseptal in the RVA pacing group. On univariate analysis, the incidence of perfusion defects was significantly associated with apical pacing, longer pQRS duration, and higher percentage of ventricular pacing. On multivariate analysis, the site of pacemaker insertion was found to be the most important pacemaker parameter determining the incidence of perfusion defects. Importantly, the duration of postpacemaker implantation did not show any significant relation to the incidence of perfusion defects.ConclusionFixed perfusion abnormalities are observed in patients with pacemakers and are independent of duration of time since implantation. RVOT pacing is associated with fewer incidences of myocardial perfusion abnormalities compared with RVA pacing.

AB  - Aim: This study is focused on GABRG2 gene sequence variations in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). The GABA A receptor is a heteropentameric receptor and alpha-1 beta-2 gamma-2 subunits combination is most abundant and present in almost all regions of the brain. The gamma-2 subunit (GABRG2) gene mutations have been reported in different epilepsy pathologies. In the present study we have looked for GABRG2 gene sequence variations in patients with mTLE. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients (12 females and eight males, age 4.6-38 years) with MTLE were recruited for this investigation. Patients were recommended for epilepsy surgery after all clinical investigations as per the epilepsy protocol. Ethnically matched glioma or meningioma patients were considered as nonepileptic controls. During temporal lobectomy of amygdalohippocampectomy, hippocampal brain tissue samples were resected guided by intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) activity. All 11 exons of GABRG2 gene with their flanking intronic regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened by DNA sequencing analysis for sequence variations. Statistical Analysis Used: Comparison of allele frequencies between patient and control groups was determined using a chi(2) test. Results and Conclusions: Total five DNA sequence variations were identified, three in exonic regions (c.643A > G, rs211035), (c.T > A, rs424740), and (c.C > T, rs418210) and two in intronic regions (c. 751 + 41A > G, rs211034) and (c. 751 + 52G > A, rs 34281163). Allele frequencies of variants identified in this study did not differ between patients and normal controls. Thus, we conclude that GABRG2 gene may not be playing significant role in the development of epilepsy or as a susceptibility gene in patients with MTLE in Indian population.

AB  - Wounds associated with injuries such as burns can produce moderate to severe pain. Besides causing distress to the patient, unrelieved pain could delay healing owing to stress-related problems. Thus, pain needs to be treated as early as possible after injury. It was hypothesised that local treatment of wounds with appropriate analgesic drugs could attenuate pain. HOE 140, a bradykinin receptor antagonist, reduced acute inflammatory pain in rats after intrawound administration. In this study, the analgesic effect of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was investigated in a similar hind-paw incision model in rats. An extremely small quantity (10 mu l) of 100% DMSO was administered into the incision site just before closure of the wound. It persistently attenuated guarding behaviour in rats over a period of 3 days without affecting thermal hyperalgesia or allodynia. Accumulated evidence indicates that guarding is equivalent to pain at rest in humans. The possible mechanisms of the analgesic effect could be inhibition of C group of peripheral nerve fibres or even free radical scavenging. Healing of the wound was found to be normal at the end of the study period. In conclusion, DMSO could be useful in the treatment of acute pain resulting from tissue injuries such as burns.

AB  - Cn-AMP2 is an antimicrobial peptide derived from liquid endosperm of coconut (Cocos nucifera). It consists of 11 amino acid residues and predicted to have high propensity for -sheet formation that disposes this peptide to be amyloidogenic. In the present study, we have examined the amyloidogenic propensities of Cn-AMP2 in silico and then tested the predictions under in vitro conditions. The in silico study revealed that the peptide possesses high amyloidogenic propensity comparable with A. Upon solubilisation and agitation in aqueous buffer, Cn-AMP2 forms visible aggregates that display bathochromic shift in the Congo red absorbance spectra, strong increase in thioflavin T fluorescence and fibrillar morphology under transmission electron microscopy. All these properties are typical of an amyloid fibril derived from various proteins/peptides including A. Copyright (c) 2016 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Peritoneal dialysis patients have high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The underlying mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunction remains unclear. Large arterial stiffness in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients leads to increase in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and decrease in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Impairment in baroreflex function could be attributed to the alteration in mechanical properties of large vessels due to arterial remodeling observed in these patients. The present study was designed to study the association of BRS and PWV in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
   42 CKD patients (21-without dialysis and 21-on PD) and 25 healthy controls were recruited in this study. BRS was determined by spontaneous sequence method. Short-term heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) were assessed using power spectrum analysis of RR intervals and systolic blood pressure by time domain and frequency domain analysis. Arterial stiffness indices were assessed by carotid-femoral PWV using Sphygmocor Vx device (AtCor Medical, Australia).
   CKD patients had significantly high PWV and low BRS as compared to healthy controls. PWV had a significant negative correlation with BRS in CKD patients (Spearman r = -0.7049, P < 0.0001; BRS-Systolic BP). On subgroup analysis, PWV was higher with lower BRS in CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis (CKD-PD) as compared to those not on dialysis (CKD-ND). Negative relationship between PWV and BRS was found in both the groups. In addition, BRS was found to have a positive correlation with HRV in CKD patients as well as both the subgroups.
   Reduction in BRS is strongly associated with increase in PWV in PD patients. Large arterial stiffness probably explains this simultaneous impairment in baroreflex functioning and increase in pulse wave velocity observed in these patients. CKD patients are characterized by poor hemodynamic profile (low BRS, high PWV, and low HRV), and peritoneal dialysis patients had further worsened profile as compared to non-dialysis group.

AB  - Objective: To describe the food environment in rural villages and an urban slum setting in India with reference to commercially available unbranded packaged snacks and street foods sold by vendors, and to analyze the type and quantity of fat in these foods.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Two low-income villages in Haryana and an urban slum in Delhi.
   Participants: Street vendors (n = 44) were surveyed and the nutritional content of snacks (n = 49) sold by vendors was analyzed.
   Main Outcome Measures: Vendors' awareness and perception of fats and oils, as well as the type of snacks sold, along with the content and quality of fat present in the snacks.
   Analysis: Descriptive statistics of vendor survey and gas chromatography to measure fatty acid content in snacks.
   Results: A variety of snacks were sold, including those in unlabeled transparent packages and open glass jars. Mean fat content in snacks was 28.8 g per 100-g serving in rural settings and 29.6 g per 100-g serving in urban settings. Sampled oils contained high levels of saturated fats (25% to 69% total fatty acids) and trans fats (0.1% to 30% of total fatty acids).
   Conclusions and Implications: Interventions need to target the manufacturers of oils and fats used in freshly prepared products to improve the quality of foods available in the food environment of low-socioeconomic groups in India.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to study the relationship of morphometric vertebral fractures with bone mineral density (BMD) in Indian women older than 50 yr. Four hundred fifteen healthy Indian women older than 50 yr (mean age: 62.8 yr) underwent lateral X-rays of the lumbar and thoracic spine. Genant's semiquantitative method was used to diagnose and classify morphometric vertebral fractures. BMD was measured by DXA at lumbar spine and total hip. Recruited subjects underwent anthropometric, biochemical, and hormonal evaluation. Vertebral fractures were present in 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.5, 20.8) subjects. Prevalence of osteoporosis based on BMD was 35.7%. By adding those with prevalent fractures, the number of women requiring therapy for osteoporosis would increase to 46.5%. The BMD measured at femur neck, total hip, and lumbar spine (L1eL4) was not found to be lower in women with vertebral fractures as compared with those without fractures. BMD was not found to be lower in women with vertebral fractures as compared with those without fractures. Significant number of additional subjects with BMD in the normal or osteopenic range become eligible for osteoporosis treatment when presence of vertebral fracture is used as an independent indication for such treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Previous anthropometry-based studies have suggested that in Indian newborns fat mass is conserved at the expense of lean tissue. This study was undertaken to assess the body composition of Indian newborns and to evaluate its relation with parents' anthropometry, birth weight and early postnatal weight gain.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Body composition of healthy term singleton newborns was assessed by the deuterium dilution method in the second week of life. Anthropometry was carried out at birth and on the day of study.
   RESULTS: Data from 127 babies were analyzed. Birth weight was 2969 +/- 383 g. Body composition was assessed at a mean age of 12.7 +/- 3.1 days. Fat and fat-free mass were 354 +/- 246 and 2764 +/- 402 g, respectively, and fat mass percentage (FM%) was 11.3 +/- 7.3%. Birth weight and fat-free mass were higher among boys, but no gender difference was noted in FM%. Birth weight was positively correlated with fat as well as fat-free mass but not FM%. FM% showed positive correlation with gain in weight from birth to the day of assessment.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study from India to report body composition in newborns using deuterium dilution. FM% was comparable to that reported for Western populations for babies of similar age. Our results suggest that the percentage of fat and fat-free mass is relatively constant over the range of birth weights included in this study, and greater weight gain during early postnatal period results in greater increase in FM%.

AB  - One of the major endpoints to be considered while choosing glucose-lowering therapy is their impact on cardiovascular outcomes. As a corollary, the cardiovascular health assessment of a person with diabetes informs the choice of glucose-lowering treatment. The clinical aspects included in this bidirectional relationship are described in this review as the cardiovascular phenotype. Vital signs, cardiac autonomic function, myocardial health and coronary status influence, and are influenced by, choice of glucose-lowering therapy. Such therapy also has an impact on cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial health. These aspects should be considered while planning treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - While the current emphasis on patient-centered, or person-centered care, is welcome, it should not neglect the health and rights of persons who serve the patient. The diabetes care professional is an equally important part of diabetes praxis. Her/His health determines the quality of diabetes care offered to the person with diabetes. Here we highlight two specific professional hazards faced by diabetes care professionals, i.e., needle stick injuries and compassion fatigue. These complications can easily be prevented or managed easily, provided attention is paid to them.

AB  - 6-Gingerol, a potent nutraceutical, has been shown to have antitumor activity in different tumors, although its mechanism of action is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated antitumor activities of 6-gingerol on human oral (SCC4, KB) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines with or without wortmannin, rapamycin, and cisplatin. Tumor cell proliferation was observed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium, inner salt assay, cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide labeling and flow cytometry, apoptosis by Annexin-V binding assay, and caspase activity by chemiluminescence assay. 6-Gingerol showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity in all three cell lines. Combinations of 6-gingerol with wortmannin and cisplatin showed additive effects, while with rapamycin, it showed 50% cytotoxicity that was equivalent to IC50 of 6-gingerol alone. Treatment with 6-gingerol resulted in G2-phase arrest in KB and HeLa cells and S-phase arrest in SCC4 cells. 6-Gingerol, wortmannin, and rapamycin treatment showed almost two-fold higher expression of caspase 3 in all cell lines. The results imply that 6-gingerol either alone or in combination with PI-3K inhibitor and cisplatin may provide better therapeutic effects in oral and cervical carcinoma. Thus, 6-gingerol appears to be a safe and potent chemotherapeutic/chemopreventive compound acting through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in human oral and cervical tumor cells.

AB  - Objective: This study focused on whether primary cultures of ovarian cancer (OC) cells established from ascites can be used to evaluate response to chemotherapeutic agents and if curcumin could enhance the efficacy of these agents. Materials and Methods: We established five primary cultures of ascitic cells from OC patients and treated them with curcumin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel singly and in combinations. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry. Results: There was a wide variation in the response of individual primary cultures to treatment with the chemotherapeutic agents. Curcumin by itself was as good as carboplatin or paclitaxel in inducing apoptosis in the primary OC cells. Curcumin was not able to affect the carboplatin mediated cell killing. However, a combination of curcumin and paclitaxel was additive and was equally effective as a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. A combination of curcumin carboplatin, and paclitaxel was also found to be additive and, in fact, turned out to be the best combination that gave the highest percentage of apoptosis in vitro. Conclusion: This study highlights the fact that primary cultures of OC cells can be used to detect response to chemotherapeutic agents and help to individualize the treatment offered to OC patients.

AB  - Cataract surgery in eyes with microcornea is associated with frequent complications such as corneal edema, posterior capsular rent, and risk of unplanned aphakia. We describe an improved surgical technique for the creation of surgical incisions during phacoemulsification in eyes with cataract associated with microcornea. A retrospective analysis of eight patients (8 eyes) operated at our center was undertaken. The mean age of the patients was 29.5 +/- 10.9 years. All eyes were operated using the scleral pocket incision for phacoemulsification. This scleral pocket incision was tangential to the limbus and created approximately 2.5 mm behind limbus through which phacoemulsification probe was inserted. Because of the posterior placement of incision, the anterior chamber crowding was minimized. There was no incidence of port-site peripheral corneal edema. Fifty percent eyes developed transient central corneal edema, the intraocular lens in bag was implanted in 5/8 eyes, and none developed Descemet's membrane detachment. Mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 1.85 +/- 0.38 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) to 1.26 +/- 0.70 LogMAR postoperatively (P = 0.01; paired t-test). Posterior incision placement during phacoemulsification in microcornea helps achieve favorable postoperative outcomes in contrast to outcomes using clear corneal approach described in literature.

AB  - Our purpose is to comprehensively review the state of the art with regard to Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), with particular attention to improving the management of associated ocular surface complications. SJS and TEN are two ends of a spectrum of immune-mediated disease, characterized in the acute phase by a febrile illness followed by skin and mucous membrane necrosis and detachment. Part I of this review focused on the systemic aspects of SJS/TEN and was published in the January 2016 issue of this journal. The purpose of Part II is to summarize the ocular manifestations and their management through all phases of SJS/TEN, from acute to chronic. We hope this effort will assist ophthalmologists in their management of SJS/TEN, so that patients with this complex and debilitating disease receive the best possible care and experience the most optimal outcomes in their vision and quality of life.

TI  - Extraanatomic Bypass to Supraceliac Abdominal Aorta for Complex Thoracic Aortic Obstruction
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
KW  - COARCTATION
AB  - Background. The standard surgical treatment of coarctation of the aorta is through a left posterolateral thoracotomy. However, when a concomitant cardiac procedure is required or the conventional approach is not possible or is hazardous, extraanatomic bypass to the supraceliac abdominal aorta may be advantageous. We discuss our technique and report the long-term results.
   Methods. Between January 1986 and January 2015, 25 patients (16 males, 9 females) underwent extra anatomic bypass to the supraceliac abdominal aorta for various lesions of the arch and the descending thoracic aorta. Extraanatomic bypass to the supraceliac abdominal aorta was performed for patients in whom balloon dilatation was not feasible due to associated arch hypoplasia (n = 9), long-segment thoracic aorta narrowing due to nonspecific aortoarteritis (n = 3), or isolated long segment coarctation of the aorta (n = 3). Patients who needed concomitant cardiac procedures, such as aortic valve replacement (n = 4), ascending aortic aneurysm repair (n = 2), or coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 1), and in whom balloon dilatation had failed, also underwent extraanatomic bypass to the supraceliac abdominal aorta. Extraanatomic bypass was also performed in 3 patients with recurrent coarctation after surgical repair and in whom balloon dilation was not feasible or unsuccessful.
   Results. There were no early or late deaths. The peak to-peak gradients between the upper limb and the lower limb decreased from 59.3 +/- 16.3 mm Hg to 2.0 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). The mean follow-up was 96.6 +/- 92.6 months (range, 1 to 240 months; median, 54 months). Doppler interrogation of the lower limb arterial system after a mean follow-up of 86.4 +/- 85.2 months showed an unobstructed flow pattern. The ankle-brachial pressure index improved from a preoperative value of 0.60 +/- 0.07 to 1.04 +/- 0.11 (p < 0.0001). Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly compared with preoperative values (153.9 +/- 18.9 vs 122.8 +/- 10.2, p < 0.0001). Three patients continued to receive antihypertensive medication due to persistent mild hypertension.
   Conclusions. Extraanatomic bypass to the supraceliac abdominal aorta provides effective palliation for complex aortic obstructions. It is easy and quick to perform, avoids fatal complications, and is well tolerated in all age groups. (C) 2016 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons

AB  - Purpose Nuclear cardiology is widely used to diagnose coronary artery disease and to guide patient management, but data on current practices, radiation dose-related best practices, and radiation doses are scarce. To address these issues, the IAEA conducted a worldwide study of nuclear cardiology practice. We present the European subanalysis.
   Methods In March 2013, the IAEA invited laboratories across the world to document all SPECT and PET studies performed in one week. The data included age, gender, weight, radiopharmaceuticals, injected activities, camera type, positioning, hardware and software. Radiation effective dose was calculated for each patient. A quality score was defined for each laboratory as the number followed of eight predefined best practices with a bearing on radiation exposure (range of quality score 0 - 8). The participating European countries were assigned to regions (North, East, South, and West). Comparisons were performed between the four European regions and between Europe and the rest-of-the-world (RoW).
   Results Data on 2,381 European patients undergoing nuclear cardiology procedures in 102 laboratories in 27 countries were collected. A cardiac SPECT study was performed in 97.9 % of the patients, and a PET study in 2.1 %. The average effective dose of SPECT was 8.0 +/- 3.4 mSv (RoW 11.4 +/- 4.3 mSv; P < 0.001) and of PET was 2.6 +/- 1.5 mSv (RoW 3.8 +/- 2.5 mSv; P < 0.001). The mean effective doses of SPECT and PET differed between European regions (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). The mean quality score was 6.2 +/- 1.2, which was higher than the RoW score (5.0 +/- 1.1; P < 0.001). Adherence to best practices did not differ significantly among the European regions (range 6 to 6.4; P = 0.73). Of the best practices, stress-only imaging and weight-adjusted dosing were the least commonly used.
   Conclusion In Europe, the mean effective dose from nuclear cardiology is lower and the average quality score is higher than in the RoW. There is regional variation in effective dose in relation to the best practice quality score. A possible reason for the differences between Europe and the RoW could be the safety culture fostered by actions under the Euratom directives and the implementation of diagnostic reference levels. Stress-only imaging and weight-adjusted activity might be targets for optimization of European nuclear cardiology practice.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in comparison with intravenous iron sucrose (ISC) in the treatment of anemia due to abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted between April 2013 and May 2014 in patients older than 18 years of age presenting at a hospital in New Delhi, India, with anemia due to AUB. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with intravenous FCM or ISC. The primary outcome, increase in hemoglobin above baseline, was monitored over a 12-week period. Patients completing the full treatment and follow-up protocol were included in the analyses. Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment allocations. Results: Overall, 30 patients were assigned to each group. Increases in mean hemoglobin levels from baseline were significantly higher in the FCM group at 6 weeks (P = 0.005). At 12 weeks, there was no significant difference in hemoglobin increase from baseline between the two groups (P = 0.11). Adverse events were similar between both treatment groups. Conclusion: Treatment with FCM resulted in a rapid increase in hemoglobin levels in patients with anemia due to AUB, with similar increases in hemoglobin over a 12-week period.

AB  - Evaluation of ultraviolet B index (UVBI) and its impact on vitamin D synthesis is important. We observed the maximum UVBI between 11 am and 1 pm. There was no increase in serum 25(OH)D levels following sun exposure during winter as the UVBI was significantly low, emphasizing the need for vitamin D supplementation during these months.
   The amount of vitamin D3 synthesizing UVB irradiation (290-320 nm) reaching the earth's surface at different altitudes and seasons in different parts of India and it's impact on vitamin D synthesis has not been well studied.
   The hourly UVB index (UVBI) from 10 am to 3 pm everyday for 12 months was measured by a solar meter in 4 different zones (North, Northeast, West and South) of the country. To study the impact of sun light exposure on vitamin D synthesis during winter, healthy school children aged 10-15 years were exposed to sunlight for a period of 30 min per day, between 11 am to 12 noon with 10 % body surface area, for 4 weeks. The main outcome measures were serum 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase levels before and after sun exposure.
   The mean UVBI was highest between 11 am and 1 pm throughout the year in all locations. The highest UVBI was recorded from the North zone (4.5 +/- 2.7 mu W/Cm-2), while the least was recorded in the Northeast zone (2.1 +/- 1.2 mu W/Cm-2). UVBI readings in the Northeast zone were consistently low throughout the year, while all the other three zones showed significant seasonal fluctuations.
   Surprisingly, we observed a significant decrease in serum 25(OH)D levels from baseline (6.3 +/- 4.6 to 5.1 +/- 2.7 ng/mL; p < 0.001) despite sun exposure.
   The mean UVBI was highest between 11 am and 1 pm throughout the year in all locations. No increase in the serum 25(OH)D levels was observed following sun exposure in winter, emphasizing the need for vitamin D supplementation during these months.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the utility of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FENO) in the identification of uncontrolled asthma in children on therapy, and to identify its cut-off value for determining asthma control.
   Methods: 207 children (age 5-15 y) with physician-diagnosed asthma on therapy with at least 12 months follow up were enrolled. Spirometry and FENO measurements were performed. Asthma control was assessed as per GINA guidelines. Sensitivity and specificity of various cut-off values of FENO (15 ppb, 20 ppb, 25 ppb, 30 ppb) for identification of status of control of asthma were calculated.
   Results: 156 (75%) children had uncontrolled or partly controlled asthma and 51 children were assessed to have controlled asthma. Median (IQR) FENO in children with controlled and uncontrolled asthma was 16 (11-23) ppb and 13 (11-25) ppb, respectively (P=0.26). No FENO cut-off had a reasonable combination of sensitivity and specificity to discriminate between controlled and uncontrolled asthma.
   Conclusion: FENO, in itself, does not have good discriminatory value in assessment of controlled and uncontrolled asthma in children on asthma therapy.

AB  - Background : Sclerosing mesenteric panniculitis (SMP) is an idiopathic chronic fibroinflammatory disorder of the intra-abdominal fat.
   Case presentation : Herein, we report a case of SMP, involving the omentum, mesentery and peri-colic fat in a 18 year old male, who presented with significant and recurrent abdominal distension for 4.5 years. Computed tomogram revealed ascites, with nodular and irregular omental thickening and foci of calcification. Non-specific radiological and histological features made an accurate diagnosis extremely difficult. After a thorough work up and exclusion of other differentials, diagnosis of a nodular SMP (Weber Christian disease) was given. After showing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, slow response was noted with cyclophosphamide, followed by rapid symptomatic improvement with mesenterectomy.
   Conclusion : SMP is an uncommon benign mesenteric/ omental inflammation, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. As treatment refractoriness is common, management should be individualized and continued for a long period. Surgical omentectomy may be helpful.

AB  - Sharp foreign bodies in the oesophagus may present as an entirely asymptomatic child with only radiological evidence but require emergent surgical management. Safety pins, razor blades and needles are a few of the commonly ingested sharp objects in developing countries. The open safety pin is a particularly interesting clinical problem, as the management depends on its location and orientation. Many methods and instruments have been used over the years to remove them from the upper digestive tract. We present a novel method using the rigid paediatric bronchoscope and alligator forceps for the extraction of this unusual foreign body from the oesophagus of a 6 year old girl.

AB  - Factor-XI deficiency (FXID) is inherited as autosomal lethal recessive disorder of carrier Holstein-Friesian bulls. A 76 base pair segment insertion into exon 12 in Factor-XI gene causes FXID in cattle. Keeping this in view the present study was conducted to screen breeding bulls of both indigenous and exotic breeds for mutation in Factor-XI gene and to find out the frequency of FXID carrier animals in breeding bulls. A total of 120 bulls of different age group maintained at Frozen Semen Bull Station, India were randomly selected from different cattle breeds to screen presence of FXID syndrome in breeding sires. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood of the selected bulls. PCR parameters were standardized to obtain 244 and 320 bp amplicons. The results showed that 2 Sahiwal bulls out of 120 animals were carrier for FXID. Amplicons of the carrier animals were sequenced and annoted, which confirms a 76 bp insertion in the exon 12. Bleeding and clotting time showed considerable discrepancy in the carrier animals as compared to the normal animals. The findings of relative mRNA expression of Factor XI transcript revealed identical tendency in the carrier. The frequency of carrier animals and mutant allele was 2.5 % and 0.025 respectively. This study recommends for screening of breeding at AI bull centers in the country for FXID. The study also stands a merit for identification of FXID carrier in Bos indicus for the first time.

TI  - Validity of ophthalmology surgical competency assessment rubric for strabismus surgery in resident training
T2  - JOURNAL OF AAPOS
KW  - ALPHA
AB  - The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires US residency programs to assess ophthalmology residents for competency in 6 core areas. Ophthalmic surgical skills are currently part of the ACGME "Patient Care" competency, although some have advocated for a seventh competency, "Surgical Skills." The Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric for Strabismus Surgery in Resident Training (OSCAR:Strabismus) tool was designed to aid in the assessment of surgical skills using procedure specific behavioral anchors. The present study evaluated inter-rater agreement of the OSCAR:Strabismus tool in the assessment of resident performance. OSCAR:Strabismus evaluations of resident surgical strabismus cases were performed by alpha multinational group of faculty strabismus surgeons. Cronbach a statistical analysis of the completed evaluations revealed high inter-rater agreement, indicating the OSCAR:Strabismus is a reliable tool to facilitate assessment of resident strabismus surgical skills.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis in many parts of the world including Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though self-limiting in normal individuals, it results in similar to 30% mortality in infected pregnant women. It has also been reported to cause acute and chronic hepatitis in organ transplant patients. Of the seven viral genotypes, genotype-1 virus infects humans and is a major public health concern in South Asian countries. Sporadic cases of genotype-3 and 4 infection in human and animals such as pigs, deer, mongeese have been reported primarily from industrialized countries. Genotype-5, 6 and 7 viruses are known to infect animals such as wild boar and camel, respectively. Genotype-3 and 4 viruses have been successfully propagated in the laboratory in mammalian cell culture. However, genotype-1 virus replicates poorly in mammalian cell culture and no other efficient model exists to study its life cycle. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes genotype-1 HEV replication by inducing cap-independent, internal initiation mediated translation of a novel viral protein (named ORF4). Importantly, ORF4 expression and stimulatory effect of ER stress inducers on viral replication is specific to genotype-1. ORF4 protein sequence is mostly conserved among genotype-1 HEV isolates and ORF4 specific antibodies were detected in genotype-1 HEV patient serum. ORF4 interacted with multiple viral and host proteins and assembled a protein complex consisting of viral helicase, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), X, host eEF1 alpha 1 (eukaryotic elongation factor 1 isoform-1) and tubulin beta. In association with eEF1 alpha 1, ORF4 stimulated viral RdRp activity. Furthermore, human hepatoma cells that stably express ORF4 or engineered proteasome resistant ORF4 mutant genome permitted enhanced viral replication. These findings reveal a positive role of ER stress in promoting genotype-1 HEV replication and pave the way towards development of an efficient model of the virus.

AB  - Posttranscriptional control of gene expression is important for defining both normal and pathological cellular phenotypes. In vitro, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have recently been shown to play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation; however, the contribution of RBPs to cell specification is not well understood. Here, we determined that the RBP insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) is specifically overexpressed in mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged (MLL-rearranged) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which constitutes a subtype of this malignancy associated with poor prognosis and high risk of relapse. IGF2BP3 was required for the survival of B-ALL cell lines, as knockdown led to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Enforced expression of IGF2BP3 provided murine BM cells with a strong survival advantage, led to proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and skewed hematopoietic development to the B cell/myeloid lineage. Cross-link immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing uncovered the IGF2BP3-regulated transcriptome, which includes oncogenes MYC and CDK6 as direct targets. IGF2BP3 regulated transcripts via targeting elements within 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR), and enforced IGF2BP3 expression in mice resulted in enhanced expression of Myc and Cdk6 in BM. Together, our data suggest that IGF2BP3-mediated targeting of oncogenic transcripts may represent a critical pathogenetic mechanism in MLL-rearranged B-ALL and support IGF2BP3 and its cognate RNA-binding partners as potential therapeutic targets in this disease.

KW  - ADHERENCE
AB  - Context: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious diseases encountered in clinical practice. Emerging resistance of the uropathogens to the antimicrobial agents due to biofilm formation is a matter of concern while treating symptomatic UTI. However, studies comparing different methods for detection of biofilm by uropathogens are scarce. Aims: To compare four different methods for detection of biofilm formation by uropathogens. Settings and Design: Prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Totally 300 isolates from urinary samples were analyzed for biofilm formation by four methods, that is, tissue culture plate (TCP) method, tube method (TM), Congo Red Agar (CRA) method and modified CRA (MCRA) method. Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test was applied when two or more set of variables were compared. P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. Considering TCP to be a gold standard method for our study we calculated other statistical parameters. Results: The rate of biofilm detection was 45.6%, 39.3% and 11% each by TCP, TM, CRA and MCRA methods, respectively. The difference between TCP and only CRA/MCRA was significant, but not that between TCP and TM. There was no difference in the rate of biofilm detection between CRA and MCRA in other isolates, but MCRA is superior to CRA for detection of the staphylococcal biofilm formation. Conclusions: TCP method is the ideal method for detection of bacterial biofilm formation by uropathogens. MCRA method is superior only to CRA for detection of staphylococcal biofilm formation.

AB  - Background: The aim of our study was to compare chronic groin pain and quality of life (QOL) after laparoscopic lightweight (LW) and heavyweight (HW) mesh repair for groin hernia. Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty adult patients with uncomplicated inguinal hernia were randomised into HW mesh group or LW mesh group. Return to activity, chronic groin pain and recurrence rates were assessed. Short form-36 v2 health survey was used for QOL analysis. Results: One hundred and thirty-one completed follow-up of 3 months, 66 in HW mesh group and 65 in LW mesh group. Early post-operative convalescence was better in LW mesh group in terms of early return to walking (P = 0.01) and driving (P = 0.05). The incidence of early post-operative pain, chronic groin pain and QOL and recurrences were comparable. Conclusion: Outcomes following laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair using HW and LW mesh are comparable in the short-term as well as long-term.

AB  - Background: "Dhat syndrome" is believed to be a culture-bound syndrome of the Indian subcontinent. Although many studies have been performed, many have methodological limitations and there is a lack of agreement in many areas.
   Aims: The aim is to study the phenomenology of "Dhat syndrome" in men and to explore the possibility of subtypes within this entity.
   Settings and Design: It is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at a sex and marriage counseling clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Northern India.
   Materials and Methods: An operational definition and assessment instrument for "Dhat syndrome" was developed after taking all concerned stakeholders into account and review of literature. It was applied on 100 patients along with socio-demographic profile, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and Postgraduate Institute Neuroticism Scale.
   Statistical Analysis: For statistical analysis, descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and Pearson's product moment correlations were carried out. Factor analysis and cluster analysis were done to determine the factor structure and subtypes of "Dhat syndrome."
   Results: A diagnostic and assessment instrument for "Dhat syndrome" has been developed and the phenomenology in 100 patients has been described. Both the health beliefs scale and associated symptoms scale demonstrated a three-factor structure. The patients with "Dhat syndrome" could be categorized into three clusters based on severity.
   Conclusions: There appears to be a significant agreement among various stakeholders on the phenomenology of "Dhat syndrome" although some differences exist. "Dhat syndrome" could be subtyped into three clusters based on severity.

AB  - This study aims to analyze expression of EZH2 and DNA-methyltransferases (DNMT1, 3A and 3B) in astrocytic tumors and investigate their link as well as their correlation with survival, especially in GBMs. Expression of EZH2 and DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B) in different grades of astrocytomas (n = 93) was assessed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. GBM-U87MG cell line was used for functional studies. Strong immunopositivity (LI >= 25%) for EZH2, DNMT1 and DNMT3B was detected in 52%, 56% and 64% cases of GBMs respectively, which was significantly higher as compared to Grade cases. Similarly, their median fold change of mRNA expression was also significantly higher in GBMs. There was also a significant positive correlation between DNMT1/DNMT3B and EZH2 mRNA and protein expression, which was in concordance with TCGA data set. Inhibition of DNMTs in cell line by Azacytidine resulted in down-regulation of EZH2, while knock-down of EZH2 by siRNA was not associated with any significant alteration of DNMTs, indicating that EZH2 expression in GBMs is possibly regulated by DNMTs, but not the reverse. Strong immunopositivity for EZH2, DNMT1 and DNMT3B were individually associated with significantly shorter survival and showed no correlation with IDH1 mutation status. In addition, the combination of these 3 markers represented an independent prognostic signature with cases having weak/negative expression of all 3 markers being associated with best prognosis. For the first time, the present study describes an epigenetic prognostic signature in GBMs based on immunohistochemical expression of EZH2, DNMT1 and 3B which can be used easily in routine neuropathology practice.

AB  - Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a rare condition. It can occur after blood transfusion in immune-compromised and occasionally even in immune-competent patients, and is associated with a mortality rate of >90%. The diagnosis of TA-GVHD is often delayed because of its non-specific clinical features. A case of an immune-competent child who developed TA-GVHD is reported here. DNA profiling (short tandem repeat analysis), a technique that has a wide application in forensic medicine, was performed to detect the presence of donor cells in this patient. The findings suggest that more studies are needed with this tool, and the diagnostic potential of using other multiple biological specimens for DNA profiling such as the hair follicle and buccal swab should be evaluated. This is the first case report where the donor's DNA fingerprinting pattern was substantiated from a patient's hair follicle sample. Chimerism was also present in the blood and buccal swab specimens.

AB  - Ependymomas are relatively uncommon gliomas with poor prognosis despite recent advances in neurooncology. Molecular pathogenesis of ependymomas is not extensively studied. Lack of correlation of histological grade with patient outcome has directed attention towards identification of molecular alterations as novel prognostic markers. Recently, 1q gain has emerged as a potential prognostic marker, associated with decreased survival, especially in posterior fossa, high grade tumors. Cases of intracranial ependymomas were retrieved. Tumors were graded using objective criteria to supplement WHO grading. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for 1q gain was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections. Eighty-one intracranial ependymomas were analyzed. Pediatric (76 %) and infratentorial (70 %) ependymomas constituted the majority. 1q gain was seen in 27 cases (33 %), was equally frequent in children (34 %) and adults (32 %), supratentorial (37 %) and infratentorial (32 %) location, grade II (33 %) and III (25 %) tumors. Recurrence was noted in 24 cases and death in 7 cases with 5-year progression-free and overall-survival rates of 37 % and 80 %, respectively. Grade II tumors had a better survival than grade III tumors; histopathological grade was the only prognostically significant marker. 1q gain had no prognostic significance. 1q gain is frequent in ependymomas in Indian patients, seen across all ages, sites and grades, and thus is likely an early event in pathogenesis. The prognostic value of 1q gain, remains uncertain, and multicentric pooling of data is required. A histopathological grading system using objective criteria correlates well with patient outcome and can serve as an economical option for prognostication of ependymomas.

AB  - Background and Purpose Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple-system atrophy of the parkinsonian type (MSA-P) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders that in addition to dysfunction of the motor system also present with features of dysautonomia, frequently manifesting as orthostatic hypotension (OH). The pathophysiology of OH has been proposed to differ between these two disorders. This study investigated the spontaneous and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in Parkinson's disease patients with orthostatic hypotension (PDOH) and multiple system atrophy of Parkinsonian type with orthostatic hypotension in an attempt to differentiate the two disorders.
   Methods Two methods were used for determining the BRS: a spontaneous method (spontaneous BRS) and the reflexive baroreflex gain (cardiovagal BRS) from phases II and IV of the Valsalva maneuver (VM) in PDOH and MSA-P-OH.
   Results The spontaneous BRS (5.04 +/- 0.66 ms/mm Hg vs. 4.78 +/- 0.64 ms/mm Hg, p=0.54) and the cardiovagal BRS from phase II of the VM (0.96 +/- 0.75 ms/mm Hg vs. 1.34 +/- 1.51 ms/mm Hg, p=0.76) did not differ between PDOH and MSA-P-OH, but the cardiovagal BRS from phase IV of the VM (0.03 +/- 0.07 ms/mm Hg vs. 2.86 +/- 2.39 ms/mm Hg, p=0.004) was significantly lower in PDOH.
   Conclusions The cardiovagal BRS from phase IV of the VM has potential for differentiating PDOH and MSA-P-OH, indicating a difference in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the autonomic dysfunction in the two disorders.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH) require variable doses of calcium and 1--(OH)D. The reasons for such variability are not clear. As autoimmune mechanisms may play a role in IH, there is a possibility of coexistent coeliac disease with calcium/vitamin D malabsorption.
   ObjectiveWe assessed the prevalence of coeliac disease and antitissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (anti-tTGAbs) in IH and analysed the effect of a gluten-free diet on calcaemic control.
   MethodA total of 171 patients with IH and 126 healthy controls were screened for anti-tTGAb. IH patients with anti-tTGAb >20RU/ml underwent duodenoscopy and intestinal biopsy; those with biopsy-proven coeliac disease were followed up on a gluten-free diet.
   ResultsEleven of 171 (64%) patients with IH and seven of 126 (56%) controls had anti-tTGAb (P=081). There was no difference in the clinical and biochemical parameters at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up of 7248year (mean serum total calcium=188 +/- 016 vs 182 +/- 036mmol/l, P=052; phosphorus = 181 +/- 017 vs 187 +/- 036mmol/l, P=053) in IH patients with and without anti-tTGAb. Although CaSRAb positivity was comparable in the two groups, IH patients with anti-tTGAb had higher TPOAb positivity (455% vs 128%, P=002). Coeliac disease was diagnosed in only 2/9 patients with IH on biopsy, both of whom showed improved calcaemic control with a gluten-free diet.
   ConclusionThe prevalence of coeliac autoimmunity (64%) and coeliac disease (12%) in patients with IH seems to be similar to that in the general population. Notwithstanding this modest prevalence, it is important to be aware of the potential occurrence of coeliac disease with IH and the beneficial effect of a gluten-free diet on calcium control.

AB  - Limited data are available on the prevalence of genital mycoplasmas and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) among Indian patients with genital tract infections. The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Mycoplasma hominis (MH), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), and CT in patients with genital tract infections. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of UU and MH were also assessed. Endocervical swabs/urethral swabs and first void urine samples of patients (n = 164) were collected. UU and MH were detected by culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MG and CT were identified by PCR. Ureaplasma isolates were further biotyped and serotyped. Antimicrobial susceptibility was done by microbroth dilution method. UU, MH, MG, and CT were detected in 15.2%, 5.4%, 1.2%, and 6% patients, respectively. Ureaplasma parvum serovar 3/14 was the most prevalent. All isolates of UU and MH were uniformly susceptible to doxycycline and josamycin. Routine screening for these pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is warranted to prevent sequel of infections and formulate treatment guidelines.

AB  - Background
   50% of leprosy patients suffer from episodes of Type 1/reversal reactions (RR) and Type 2/Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) reactions which lead to morbidity and nerve damage. CD4(+) subsets of Th17 cells and CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to play a major role in disease associated immunopathology and in stable leprosy as reported by us and others. The aim of our study was to analyze their role in leprosy reactions.
   Methodology and Principle Findings
   Quantitative reverse transcribed PCR (qPCR), flowcytometry and ELISA were used to respectively investigate gene expression, cell phenotypes and supernatant levels of cytokines in antigen stimulated PBMC cultures in patients with stable disease and those undergoing leprosy reactions. Both types of reactions are associated with significant increase of Th17 cells and associated cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-23 and chemokines CCL20, CCL22 as compared to matching stable forms of leprosy. Concurrently patients in reactions show reduction in FOXP3(+) Treg cells as well as reduction in TGF-beta and increase in IL-6. Moreover, expression of many T cell markers, cytokines, chemokines and signaling factors were observed to be increased in RR as compared to ENL reaction patients.
   Conclusions
   Patients with leprosy reactions show an imbalance in Th17 and Treg populations. The reduction in Treg suppressor activity is associated withhigherTh17cell activity. The combined effect of reduced TGF-beta and enhanced IL-6, IL-21 cytokines influence the balance between Th17 or Treg cells in leprosy reactions as reported in the murine models and autoimmune diseases. The increase in Th17 cell associated cytokines may contribute to lesional inflammation.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in multiple disease conditions and accumulating evidence supports that the variation in serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, including deficiency, is under strong genetic control. However, the underlying genetic mechanism associated with vitamin 25(OH)D concentrations is poorly understood. We earlier reported a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and obesity in a Punjabi Sikh diabetic cohort as part of the Asian Indian diabetic heart study (AIDHS). Here we have performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of serum 25(OH)D on 3538 individuals from this Punjabi Sikh population. Our discovery GWAS comprised of 1387 subjects followed by validation of 24 putative SNPs (P < 10(-4)) using an independent replication sample (n = 2151) from the same population by direct genotyping. A novel locus at chromosome 20p11.21 represented by rs2207173 with minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.29, [beta = -0.13, p = 4.47 x 10(-9)] between FOXA2 and SSTR4 was identified to be associated with 25(OH)D levels. Another suggestive association signal at rs11586313 (MAF 0.54) [beta = 0.90; p = 1.36 x 10(-6)] was found within the regulatory region of the IVL gene on chromosome 1q21.3. Additionally, our study replicated 3 of 5 known GWAS genes associated with 25(OH)D concentrations including GC (p = 0.007) and CYP2R1 (p = 0.019) reported in Europeans and the DAB1 (p = 0.003), reported in Hispanics. Identification of novel association signals in biologically plausible regions with 25(OH)D metabolism will provide new molecular insights on genetic drivers of vitamin D status and its implications in health disparities.

AB  - Background and Aim:Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) because of precipitating factors (variceal bleed/infections) identifies cirrhotics at risk for high short-term mortality. Information on ACLF because of acute hepatic insults is lacking. The aim of the study was to evaluate acute hepatic insults in ACLF and their effect on the course and outcome.
   Methods:In a prospective study, 213 consecutive patients of ACLF because of acute hepatic insults were included. Etiology of acute hepatic insult, frequency of silent, and overt chronic liver disease (CLD), organ failure (OF), and outcomes were assessed. Prognostic models such as model for endstage liver disease (MELD), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II), and chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure (CLIF-SOFA) were evaluated.
   Results:Etiologies of acute hepatic insult were hepatitis virus(es)- 81 (38%; HBV-42, HEV-39), continuous alcohol consumption-77 (33.3%), antituberculosis drugs-11 (5.2%), autoimmune hepatitis flare-5(2.3%), cryptogenic-44 (20.7%). The common causes of CLD were alcohol (n=85/40%), HBV(n=52/24%), and cryptogenic(n=50/20%). The MELD, APACHE II, and CLIF-SOFA scores were similar among silent and overt CLD and did not influence outcome. Predominant etiologies of ACLF were hepatitis virus(es) reactivation or superinfection in silent CLD(52/112, 46.4%) and alcohol among overt CLD(43/101, 43%). Independent predictors of mortality included hepatic-encephalopathy (early, HR: 4.01; advanced, HR: 6.10), serum creatinine 1.5mg/dl (HR: 4.53), CLIF-SOFA 8(HR: 1.69), and etiology of acute hepatic insult (alcohol, HR: 4.08; cryptogenic, HR: 3.18). HEV-ACLF had lower mortality (12.8% vs. 33-54% in other etiologies;P<0.001). OF was major determinant of mortality. With increasing number of OF, mortality increased linearly(P=0.001).
   Conclusions:Hepatitis virus(es) and continuous alcohol consumption are important causes of ACLF caused by acute hepatic insults. HEV-ACLF has lower mortality. OF is an important prognostic predictor.

AB  - Background and Aim: To study the rate of wound infections in the post-discharged patient population and to assess the usefulness of post-discharge surveillance. Methods: A prospective surveillance of all the post-discharged trauma patients was done during a period of 6 months. Discharge instructions were given to all the patients regarding identification of the signs and symptoms of wound infections. They were telephonically followed up after a week to enquire about the wound condition and followed up in the outpatient department (OPD). Microbiology culture samples of those showing any signs and symptoms of infections were sent and their antimicrobial therapy, any change in the treatment schedule and the length of their hospital stay were noted. Factors such as wound class, type of surgeries and readmissions were noted. Results: A total of 281 postdischarge patients were enrolled, of which 101 were completely followed up for wound infections. Males were predominant (89%). Of the 101 patients, 42 (41.6%) patients wound showed infection during the intense follow-up in the OPD. However, 59 patients (59/101, 58.4%) showed wound swab culture positivity before discharge. These 42 patients developed signs and symptoms of infection post-discharge; 23 (22.7%) of them had change of antibiotic therapy during the follow-up period due to culture positivity. Acinetobacter sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the predominant organisms isolated in the study. A total of 45 patients (44.5%) had to be readmitted due to wound site infections. Conclusions: Wound infections are common after discharge among trauma patients highlighting the importance of active surveillance and participation of patients.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of using drop application strips on eye drop instillation in glaucoma patients on chronic topical ocular hypotensive therapy.
   Methods: A total of 72 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma with an uncorrected visual acuity of 3/60 or more, self-administering topical antiglaucoma medication for >1 year were evaluated. One eye of each patient was included in the study. Patients were instructed to instill 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose drop in 1 eye. They were then instructed to instill the same drop using the drop application strips.
   Results: Mean age of the patients included in the study was 50.39 +/- 12.04 years. Before assistance of drop application strips, 35 (48.61%) patients placed the drop into the eye without any contact of the dropper nozzle, and, after application of the drop application strips, 66 (91.67%) patients placed the drop in the eye without any contact (P = 0.025). The number of patients putting the first drop of drug into the eye without spilling over the adenexae increased from 30 (41.67%) to 45 (62.5%) after application of the strip (P < 0.001). The mean number of drops instilled to get 1 drop into the eye decreased from 2 +/- 0.95 to 1.56 +/- 0.78 when the drop application strip was used (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Use of a drop application strip causes a significant decrease in contact of the eye drop bottle nozzle with the eyeball and eyelid, decreases the number of drops instilled to get 1 drop into the eye, and is associated with an overall improvement in eye drop instillation.

AB  - Enhancer of Zeste homologue2 (EZH2) is an epigenetic regulator that functions as oncogene in astrocytic tumors, however, EZH2 regulation remains little studied. In this study, we measured EZH2 levels in low (Gr-II,DA) and high grade (Gr-IV,GBM) astrocytic tumors and found significant increased EZH2 transcript level with grade(median DA-8.5, GBM-28.9).However, a different trend was reflected in protein levels, with GBMs showing high EZH2 LI(median-26.5) compared to DA (median 0.3). This difference in correlation of EZH2 protein and RNA levels suggested post-transcriptional regulation of EZH2, likely mediated by miRNAs. We selected eleven miRNAs that strongly predicted to target EZH2 and measured their expression. Three miRNAs (miR-26a-5p,miR27a-3p and miR-498) showed significant correlation with EZH2 protein, suggesting them as regulators of EZH2, however miR-26a-5p levels decreased with grade. ChIP analyses revealed H3K27me3 modifications in miR-26a promoter suggesting feedback loop between EZH2 and miR26a. We further measured six downstream miRNA targets of EZH2 and found significant downregulation of four (miR-181a/b and 200b/c) in GBM. Interestingly, EZH2 associated miRNAs were predicted to target 25 genes in glioma-pathway, suggesting their role in tumor formation or progression. Collectively, our work suggests EZH2 and its miRNA interactors may serve as promising biomarkers for progression of astrocytic tumors and may offer novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate gender-based differences in nuclear cardiology practice globally, with a particular focus on laboratory volume, radiation dose, protocols, and best practices.
   BACKGROUND It is unclear whether gender-based differences exist in radiation exposure for nuclear cardiology procedures.
   METHODS In a large, multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study encompassing 7,911 patients in 65 countries, radiation effective dose was estimated for each examination. Patient-level best practices relating to radiation exposure were compared between genders. Analysis of covariance was used to determine any difference in radiation exposure according to gender, region, and the interaction between gender and region. Linear, logistic, and hierarchical regression models were developed to evaluate gender-based differences in radiation exposure and laboratory adherence to best practices. The study also included the United Nations Gender Inequality Index and Human Development Index as covariates in multivariable models.
   RESULTS The proportion of myocardial perfusion imaging studies performed in women varied among countries; however, there was no significant correlation with the Gender Inequality Index. Globally, mean effective dose for nuclear cardiology procedures was only slightly lower in women (9.6 +/- 4.5 mSv) than in men (10.3 +/- 4.5 mSv; p < 0.001), with a difference of only 0.3 mSv in a multivariable model adjusting for patients' age and weight. Stress-only imaging was performed more frequently in women (12.5% vs. 8.4%; p < 0.001); however, camera-based dose reduction strategies were used less frequently in women (58.6% vs. 65.5%; p < 0.001).
   \CONCLUSIONS Despite significant worldwide variation in best practice use and radiation doses from nuclear cardiology procedures, only small differences were observed between genders worldwide. Regional variations noted in myocardial perfusion imaging use and radiation dose offer potential opportunities to address gender-related differences in delivery of nuclear cardiology care.

AB  - PURPOSE To compare results of retroequatorial recession of horizontal rectus muscles and Hertle-Dell'Osso tenotomy procedure in patients with infantile nystagmus with null in primary position.
   METHODS In this prospective study, 10 subjects years of age with infantile nystagmus with null in primary position were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1 underwent a large retroequatorial recession of the four horizontal rectus muscles; group 2, simple tenotomy and resuturing (Hertle-Dell'Osso procedure) of the four muscles. Patients were evaluated using Snellen and logMAR visual acuity charts, contrast sensitivity testing, color vision testing, stereopsis testing (TNO), and electronystagmography (ENG) for nystagmus waveforms, frequency, amplitude, and intensity.
   RESULTS Group 1 patients showed a trend toward 1-line improvement in their visual acuity for distance on the logMAR and ETDRS charts (P = 0.32); there was no improvement in group 2 patients. Contrast sensitivity improved significantly in both groups (P = 0.03), as did stereopsis (P = 0.02 [group 1], P = 0.04 [group 2]). The amplitude and intensity of nystagmus showed a tendancy to decrease in both the groups in all gazes, although the frequency showed no change in either group. Intergroup variability on all the parameters was not statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS Both retroequatorial recession of horizontal recti and the Hertle-Dell'Osso procedure showed a trend toward reducing ENG amplitude and improved contrast sensitivity and stereopsis in infantile nystagmus with null in primary position.

AB  - Prophylactic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can prevent pulmonary adverse events following upper abdominal surgeries. The present meta-regression evaluates and quantifies the effect of degree/duration of (CPAP) on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary events.
   Medical databases were searched for randomized controlled trials involving adult patients, comparing the outcome in those receiving prophylactic postoperative CPAP versus no CPAP, undergoing high-risk abdominal surgeries. Our meta-analysis evaluated the relationship between the postoperative pulmonary complications and the use of CPAP. Furthermore, meta-regression was used to quantify the effect of cumulative duration and degree of CPAP on the measured outcomes.
   Seventy-three potentially relevant studies were identified, of which 11 had appropriate data, allowing us to compare a total of 362 and 363 patients in CPAP and control groups, respectively. Qualitatively, Odds ratio for CPAP showed protective effect for pneumonia [0.39 (0.19-0.78)], atelectasis [0.51 (0.32-0.80)] and pulmonary complications [0.37 (0.24-0.56)] with zero heterogeneity. For prevention of pulmonary complications, odds ratio was better for continuous than intermittent CPAP. Meta-regression demonstrated a positive correlation between the degree of CPAP and the incidence of pneumonia with a regression coefficient of +0.61 (95 % CI 0.02-1.21, P = 0.048, tau (2) = 0.078, r (2) = 7.87 %). Overall, adverse effects were similar with or without the use of CPAP.
   Prophylactic postoperative use of continuous CPAP significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative pneumonia, atelectasis and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgeries. Quantitatively, increasing the CPAP levels does not necessarily enhance the protective effect against pneumonia. Instead, protective effect diminishes with increasing degree of CPAP.

AB  - Opinions are divided regarding the management of a persistently patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Some of the adverse effects associated with a large hemodynamically significant duct, including prolonged ventilation, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and mortality, indicate that active management of infants with large ductal shunts may sometimes be necessary. Indomethacin and ibuprofen are the two US FDA-approved cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors used for the closure of a ductus in preterm babies. Both these drugs are effective in 70-80 % of extremely low birthweight infants. Treatment with COX inhibitors may be associated with renal impairment, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, NEC, and spontaneous intestinal perforation when given concurrently with steroids, as well as changes in cerebrovascular auto-regulation. Ibuprofen appears to be a better choice for PDA closure, with a better side effect profile and efficacy that equals that of indomethacin. However, long-term outcome studies of ibuprofen are lacking, and prophylactic ibuprofen is ineffective in decreasing severe IVH. The choice of one drug over the other also depends on local availability of both drugs and the intravenous or enteral preparation. The oral preparation of ibuprofen appears as effective as the intravenous preparation. The use of paracetamol to close a hemodynamically significant PDA has increased in recent years. Paracetamol also decreases prostacyclin synthesis; however, unlike COX inhibitors, it does not have a peripheral vaso-constrictive effect and can be given to infants with contraindications to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It appears to have similar efficacy based on limited data available from randomized trials. Until more data are available on efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes, it cannot be recommended as the first choice.

AB  - Background & objectives: Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) increase the length of stay in the hospital and consequently costs as reported from studies done in developed countries. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of HAIs on length of stay and costs of health care in children admitted to Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital in north India.
   Methods: This prospective study was done in the seven bedded PICU of a large multi-specialty tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. A total of 20 children with HAI (cases) and 35 children without HAI (controls), admitted to the PICU during the study period (January 2012 to June 2012), were matched for gender, age, and average severity of illness score. Each patient's length of stay was obtained prospectively. Costs of healthcare were estimated according to traditional and time driven activity based costing methods approach.
   Results: The median extra length of PICU stay for children with HAI (cases), compared with children with no HAI (controls), was seven days (IQR 3-16). The mean total costs of patients with and without HAI were (sic) 2,04,787 (US$ 3,413) and (sic) 56,587 (US$ 943), respectively and the mean difference in the total cost between cases and controls was (sic) 1,48,200 (95% CI 55,716 to 2,40,685, P<0.01).
   Interpretation & conclusions: This study highlights the effect of HAI on costs for PICU patients, especially costs due to prolongation of hospital stay, and suggests the need to develop effective strategies for prevention of HAI to reduce costs of health care.

AB  - IntroductionThe diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) based on morphology is particularly difficult in low-grade MDS. Thus, the role of myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) and other flow cytometric (FCM) parameters in MDS was evaluated.
   MethodsBone marrow aspirates (BMA) collected from 52 patients with unexplained persistent cytopenias were divided into three groups: (i) proven MDS (n = 12) based on morphology and/or cytogenetics; (ii) suspected MDS (n = 6), noncontributory morphology, and cytogenetics; and (iii) non-MDS (n = 34). Sixteen control BMA were studied. Cases were analyzed for MNDA expression (on granulocytes, blasts, monocytes, and lymphocytes) and for seven quantitative parameters: CD34(+) myeloblasts % in nucleated cells, CD34(+) B-cell progenitor% in CD34(+) cells, lymphocyte/myeloblast CD45 MFI ratio, granulocyte/lymphocyte SSC peak channel ratio and the proportion of CD34(+) myeloblasts expressing CD15, CD11b, and CD56. A score of 1 was given to each parameter beyond the cutoff, and score 3 was considered FCM positive.
   ResultsMNDA expression on granulocytes and blasts was significantly lower in proven MDS and suspected MDS vs. non-MDS. Quantitative FCM parameters successfully distinguished MDS and suspected MDS from non-MDS.
   ConclusionMNDA expression is an independent marker for the evaluation of dyspoiesis and may be added to the standard panel for quantitative assessment by FCM.

AB  - We performed a discovery phase of urinary proteomic profile in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and validated selected biomarkers.
   Urinary proteomic profile was performed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation labeling, coupled with liquid chromatography-matrix assisted laser desorption and ionization analysis. Validation of biomarkers apolipoprotein A1, alpha 2 macroglobulin, orosomucoid 2, retinol binding protein 4 and leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein 1 was done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Apolipoprotein A1 levels of < 0.48 A mu g/mg of creatinine-differentiated steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) from first episode nephrotic syndrome, area under curve (AUC) [0.99 (CI 0.9-1.0), 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity] and a value of < 0.24 A mu g/mg of creatinine could differentiate SRNS from frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome/steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome [AUC 0.99 (CI 0.9-1.0), 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity]. Alpha 2 macroglobulin could differentiate children with SRNS-focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) from SRNS-minimal change disease (MCD) at values > 3.3 A mu g/mg of creatinine [AUC 0.84 (CI 0.62-1.0), 90 % sensitivity and 85 % specificity]. Orosomucoid 2 > 1.81 A mu g/mg of creatinine could distinguish SRNS-FSGS from SRNS-MCD [AUC 0.84 (CI 0.62-1.0), sensitivity 90 % and specificity 85.5 %]. RBP 4 value of > 1.54 A mu g/mg of creatinine differentiated SRNS-FSGS from SRNS-MCD [AUC 0.87 (CI 0.68-1.0), sensitivity 90 % and specificity 85.7 %].
   Lower level of apolipoprotein A1 in urine is suggestive of SRNS. Alpha 2 macroglobulin, retinol binding protein 4 and orosomucoid 2 are markers associated with FSGS, with alpha 2 macroglobulin being most predictive.

AB  - Background. Postexcision residual disease in the vidian canal is speculated to contribute to recurrence in juvenile angiofibroma.
   Methods. We composed a prospective cohort of 16 consecutive patients with juvenile angiofibroma (stages IIA-IIIB). The presurgical vidian canal assessment was done by contrast-enhanced CT (1.2 mm collimation). At surgery after complete tumor excision, the vidian canal tissue was sampled for histology. Postexcision drilling of the vidian canal was done in 8 of 15 patients to remove microscopic residual disease, with a 24 to 48 month follow-up period.
   Results. Presurgical radiology indicated ipsilateral vidian canal enlargement (>= 3 mm)/destruction in 13 of 16 patients. Radiologically occult involvement was documented only by histology in another 1 of 16 patients. Postexcision sampling of the vidian canal noted microscopic residual tumor in 3 of 15 patients. No recurrences were noted in 8 cases (0 of 8) with postexcision drilling of the vidian canal and 2 recurrences in 7 cases (2 of 7) with no drilling (p = .20).
   Conclusion. Vidian canal involvement in juvenile angiofibroma is almost universal (14 of 16) and may be occult to CT evaluation. The site may harbor microscopic residual tumor after seemingly complete excision. Surgical attention toward it may reduce recurrences. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose:
   To evaluate the time to donor lenticule apposition in cases of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) using microscope-integrated intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT).
   Methods:
   Thirty eyes of 27 patients planned to undergo Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty were enrolled in this prospective study. In group I (n = 10), continuous intracameral positive pressure was maintained for 8 minutes. In group II (n = 10) and group III (n = 10), external corneal massage was initiated simultaneously with positive intracameral air pressure. The external corneal massage was continued till complete resolution of interface fluid; the positive intracameral pressure was maintained for 8 minutes in group II and for 5 minutes in group III. The host-donor relationship was continuously monitored with the iOCT. The main outcome measure was time to complete donor lenticule apposition.
   Results:
   In group I, the interface fluid persisted after 8 minutes of positive intracameral pressure in all eyes (10/10); hence an external corneal massage was required to achieve optimal donor adherence. In groups II and III, all eyes (20/20) had complete resolution of the interface fluid at the end of 3 minutes. In 100% of the eyes (30/30), the grafts were attached after anterior chamber decompression as seen on the iOCT. In all cases, the donor lenticules were adhered in the postoperative period.
   Conclusions:
   iOCT helps in understanding that the donor lenticule is well apposed within 1 to 3 minutes with the technique of simultaneous positive intracameral pressure and external corneal massage. This knowledge minimizes the waiting time for graft apposition and prevents prolonged intraocular pressure elevation.

AB  - Purpose. To compare blade cultures in surgery for closed fracture using a single or double blade technique to determine whether the current practice of double blade technique is justified.
   Methods. 155 men and 29 women aged 20 to 60 (mean, 35) years who underwent surgery for closed fracture with healthy skin at the incision site were included. Patients were block randomised to the single (n=92) or double (n=92) blade technique. Blades were sent for bacteriological analysis. Outcome measures were early surgical site infection (SSI) within 30 days and cultures from the blades.
   Results. The 2 groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. In the single blade group, 6 surgical blades and 2 control blades showed positive cultures; 4 patients developed SSI, but only one had a positive culture from the surgical blade (with different organism isolated from the wound culture). In the double blade group, 6 skin blades, 7 deep blades, and 0 control blade showed positive culture; only 2 patients had the same bacteria grown from both skin and deep blade. Five patients developed SSI, but only one patient had a positive culture from the deep blade (with different organism isolated from the wound culture). The difference in incidence of culture-positive blade or SSI between the 2 groups was not significant. The relative risk of SSI in the single blade group was 0.8. Positive blade culture was not associated with SSI in the single or double blade group.
   Conclusion. The practice of changing blade following skin incision has no effect on reducing early SSI in surgery for closed fracture in healthy patients with healthy skin.

AB  - Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a malignant round cell tumor arising outside the brain, spinal cord, and sympathetic nervous system. It exhibits a variable degree of neural differentiation characterized by translocation involving EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma region 1) gene.
   ES occurring in urinary bladder is very rare.
   Clinical presentation is similar to transitional- cell carcinoma; however, the 2 entities must be distinguished because the treatment protocols are different.
   ES shows a marked response to chemotherapy.
   Immunohistochemistry plays an important role in differentiating ES from its morphologic mimics, while fluorescence in- situ hybridization analysis for EWSR1 translocation is confirmatory.
   Awareness that this entity can occur in the bladder is essential for an accurate diagnosis and thus appropriate treatment. Dramatic clinical response may occur, as was seen in our case. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The crystal structures of several bacterial response regulators provide insight into the various interdomain molecular interactions potentially involved in maintaining their 'active' or 'inactive' states. However, the requirement of high concentrations of protein, an optimal pH and ionic strength buffers during crystallization may result in a structure somewhat different from that observed in solution. Therefore, functional assessment of the physiological relevance of the crystal structure data is imperative. DevR/DosR dormancy regulator of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) belongs to the NarL subfamily of response regulators. The crystal structure of unphosphorylated DevR revealed that it forms a dimer through the alpha 5/alpha 6 interface. It was proposed that phosphorylation may trigger extensive structural rearrangements in DevR that culminate in the formation of a DNA-binding competent dimeric species via alpha 10-alpha 10 helix interactions. The alpha 10 helix-deleted DevR protein (DevR(Delta alpha 10)) was hyperphosphorylated but defective with respect to in vitro DNA binding. Biophysical characterization reveals that DevR(Delta alpha 10) has an open but less stable conformation. The combined cross-linking and DNA-binding data demonstrate that the alpha 10 helix is essential for the formation and stabilization of the DNA-binding proficient DevR structure in both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states. Genetic studies establish that Mtb strains expressing DevR(Delta alpha 10) are defective with respect to dormancy regulon expression under hypoxia. The present study highlights the indispensable role of the alpha 10 helix in DevR activation and function under hypoxia and establishes the alpha 10-alpha 10 helix interface as a novel target for developing inhibitors against DevR, a key regulator of hypoxia-triggered dormancy.

AB  - Diagnosis of gonorrhoea is an ongoing challenge. The organism is fastidious requiring meticulous collection and transport for successful cultivation. Asymptomatic infections are common which go undetected by conventional methods thereby leading to continued transmission and the risk of complications. The nucleic acid amplification tests, now increasingly used in developed countries, offer improved sensitivity compared to bacterial culture. However, these continue to suffer sequence related problems leading to false positive and false negative results. Further, these cannot be used for generation of data on antibiotic susceptibility because genetic markers of antibiotic resistance to recommended therapies have not been fully characterised. They are unaffordable in a setting like ours where reliance is placed on syndromic approach for sexually transmitted infection (STI) management. The use of syndromic approach has resulted in a considerable decline in the number of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates that have been cultured for diagnostic purposes. Many laboratories formerly doing so are no longer performing culture for gonococci, and the basic skills have been lost. There is a need to not only revive this skill but also adopt newer technologies that can aid in accurate diagnosis in a cost-effective manner. There is room for innovation that can facilitate the development of a point-of-care test for this bacterial STI.

AB  - ObjectiveGallbladder neuroendocrine tumours (GB-NETs) are rare and account for 0.5% of all NETs. GB-NETs have an aggressive behaviour, which depends on the tumour grade. The cytomorphological spectrum of these tumours has never been described in detail. The present study evaluates the cytological features of GB-NETs and grades them according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Furthermore, the expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) has not been investigated previously in GB-NETs, although found in a subset of extrapulmonary NETs.
   MethodsTwenty cases of GB-NET among 875 gallbladder carcinomas diagnosed by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) over a period of nearly 4years were studied. The following parameters were evaluated: architectural pattern, nuclear chromatin, nucleoli, mitoses, necrosis, moulding, apoptosis and smudge cells. Cases were categorized into well-differentiated (grades 1 and 2), small cell carcinoma (SCC) (grade 3) and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma. Nuclear positivity for TTF-1 was considered as positive.
   ResultsMorphologically, tumour cells were mainly arranged in rosettes in the well-differentiated category; sudden anisonucleosis and rare nuclear moulding with or without mitotic figures were other features. Eleven cases of SCC showed prominent nuclear moulding with frequent smudge cells, mitoses, apoptosis and necrosis. Three mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas showed papillary fragments and an acinar arrangement of tumour cells. Four of the nine SCCs in which TTF-1 was evaluated on de-stained smears showed nuclear positivity. Histopathology was available in two SCCs and showed morphology similar to FNAC.
   ConclusionCytology plays an important role in the diagnosis of GB-NETs for appropriate subtype characterization, which is necessary for the prognostication of these tumours. TTF-1 may not be used for the differentiation of gallbladder SCCs from pulmonary SCCs.
   Gallbladder neuroendocrine (GB-NET) tumours are rare. The GB-NETs in this study are categorised according to the WHO 2010 classification and the cytomorphological spectrum is described. Expression of TTF-1 in GB-NETs is also investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The plant Arnica montana is used in folk medicine to alleviate pain, inflammation and swelling of muscles and joints associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of A. montana flower methanol extract (AMME) against both inflammation and oxidative stress in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model.
   RESULTS: Oral administration of AMME was found to reduce clinical signs and improve the histological and radiological status of the hind limb joints. AMME-treated rats had lower expression levels of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-beta, interleukins (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-12) and titer of anti-type II collagen antibody compared with untreated CIA rats. Furthermore, by inhibiting these mediators, AMME also contributed towards the reversal of disturbed antioxidant levels and peroxidative damage.
   CONCLUSION: The alleviation of arthritis in rats was very likely due to the combined action of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, the major constituents identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. The study also shed some light on mechanisms involved in diminution of inflammatory mediators and free radical-generating toxicants and enhancement of the antioxidant armory, thereby preventing further tissue damage, injury and synovial hyperproliferation in arthritis.

AB  - Background
   Association of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and Crohn's disease (CD) has been controversial due to contradictory reports. Therefore, we determined the prevalence of MAP in patients with CD and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and its association with clinical course.
   Methodology
   Blood and intestinal biopsies were taken from 69 CD, 32 ITB patients and 41 patients with haemorrhoidal bleed who served as controls. qPCR targeting of MAP-specific IS900 gene was used to detect the presence of MAP DNA. qPCR results were further validated by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the presence of MAP antigen in biopsy specimens. CD and ITB patients were followed-up for disease course and response to therapy.
   Principal Findings
   The frequency of MAP-specific DNA in biopsies by qPCR was significantly higher in CD patients (23.2%, p = 0.03) as compared to controls (7.3%). No significant difference in intestinal MAP presence was observed between ITB patients (12.5%, p = 0.6) and controls (7.3%). MAP presence in blood of CD patients was 10.1% as compared to 4.9% in controls while no patients with ITB were found to be positive (p = 0.1). Using IHC for detection of MAP antigen, the prevalence of MAP in CD was 2.9%, 12.5% in ITB patients and 2.4% in controls. However, long-term follow-up of the patients revealed no significant associations between clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes with MAP positivity.
   Conclusion
   We report significantly high prevalence of MAP in intestinal biopsies of CD patients. However, the presence of MAP does not affect the disease course and treatment outcomes in either CD or ITB patients.

AB  - With studies indicative of altered drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) under high altitude (HA)-induced hypobaric hypoxia, consideration of better therapeutic approaches has continuously been aimed in research for HA related illness management. DMPK of drugs like ibuprofen may get affected under hypoxia which establishes the requirement of different therapeutic dose regimen to ensure safe and effective therapy at HA. This study examined the effects of the chronic hypobaric hypoxia (CHH) on hepatic DMPK of ibuprofen in rats. Experimental animals were exposed to simulated altitude of 7620 m (similar to 25,000 ft) for CHH exposure (7 or 14 days) in decompression chamber and administered with ibuprofen (80 mg/kg, body weight, p.o.). Results demonstrated that CHH significantly altered PK variables of ibuprofen and activities of both phase-I and II hepatic metabolic enzymes as compared to the animals under normoxic conditions. Hepatic histopathological observations also revealed marked alterations. Increase in pro-inflammatory cytokinesichemokines viz. IL-1 beta, IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha exhibited close relevance with diminished CYP2C9 expression under CHH. Moreover, the down -regulated CYP2C9 level further supported the underlying mechanism for reduced metabolism of ibuprofen and as a result, increased retention of parent drug in the system. Increased mean retention time, Vd, T-1/2 of ibuprofen, and decreased AUC, C-max and clearance during CHH further strengthened the present findings. In conclusion, CHH exposure significantly affects hepatic DMPK of ibuprofen, which may further influence the usual therapeutic dose-regimen. Further, there is requirement of human studies to evaluate their susceptibility toward hypobaric hypoxia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Differentiation between intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) is challenging in geographical regions where both these diseases are prevalent. There is a need of biomarkers for differentiation between these two disorders. Colonic biopsies from inflamed mucosa of treatment-naive patients with ITB, CD and controls were used for analysis. Protein extracted from biopsies was digested with trypsin and resulting peptides were labeled with iTRAQ reagents. The peptides were subsequently analyzed using LC-MS/MS for identification and quantification. Gene ontology annotation for proteins was analyzed in PANTHER. Validation experiments were done for six differentially expressed proteins using immunohistochemistry. 533 proteins were identified and 241 proteins were quantified from 5 sets of iTRAQ experiments. While 63 were differentially expressed in colonic mucosa of patients with CD and ITB in at least one set of iTRAQ experiment, 11 proteins were differentially expressed in more than one set of experiments. Six proteins used for validation using immunohistochemistry in a larger cohort of patients; none of them however was differentially expressed in patients with ITB and CD. There are differentially expressed proteins in tissue proteome of CD and ITB. Further experiments are required using a larger cohort of homogeneous tissue samples.

AB  - Objectives
   Hypertension is characterized by systemic high blood pressure and is the most common and important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that the circulating levels of certain inflammatorymarkers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interlukin-6 (IL-6), c-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor suppressor protein-53 (p53) are upregulated and are independently associated with essential hypertension. However, mechanism of increase in the levels of HSP70 protein is not clear. No such studies are reported in the blood circulation of patients with essential hypertension. In the present study, we investigated the expression of circulating HSP70 at mRNA and protein levels and its relationship with other inflammatory markers in patients with essential hypertension.
   Materials and Methods
   We recruited 132 patients with essential hypertension and 132 normal controls from similar socio-economic-geographical background. The expression of HSP70 at mRNA levels was determined by Real Time PCR and at protein levels by indirect Elisa and Western Blot techniques.
   Results
   We found a significantly higher expression of HSP70 gene expression (approximately 6.45 fold, P < 0.0001) in hypertensive patients as compared to healthy controls. A significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the protein expression of HSP70 was also observed in plasma of patients as compared to that of controls.
   Conclusion
   Higher expression of HSP70 is positively correlated with inflammatory markers in patients with essential hypertension and this correlation could play an important role in essential hypertension.

AB  - Objective: Phase three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children (ISAAC) was carried out at various sites in India. The prevalence of asthma symptoms in school children and the effect of environmental tobacco smoke and traffic pollution on the occurrence of asthma were analysed. Methods: Two groups of school children, aged 6-7yr and 13-14yr, participated according to the ISAAC protocol. Schools were randomly selected and responses to the ISAAC questionnaire were recorded. Results: The prevalence of asthma was 5.35% in the 6-7yr age group and 6.05% in the 13-14yr age group. The odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of asthma in children with exposure to mild, moderate and heavy traffic pollution compared with minimal traffic pollution were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.85), 1.71 (95% CI: 1.49, 1.96) and 1.53 (95% CI: 1.31, 1.78), respectively, in the younger group. Similarly, in the older group, they were 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.36), 1.51 (95% CI: 1.31, 1.75) and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.76). Asthma was associated with maternal smoking [6-7yr group: OR=2.72 (2.05, 3.6); 13-14yr group: OR=2.14 (1.72, 2.66)] and paternal smoking [6-7yr group: OR=1.9 (1.70, 2.11); 13-14yr group: OR=1.21 (1.09, 1.34)]. Conclusions: The prevalence of asthma was lower in the 6-7 than the 13-14yr age group. Environmental tobacco smoke and traffic pollution were the factors most strongly associated with asthma in Indian children.

AB  - Background: Remote ischemic preconditioning is a simple therapy that may reduce cardiac and kidney injury. We undertook a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of this therapy on markers of heart and kidney injury after cardiac surgery.
   Methods: Patients at high risk of death within 30 days after cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to undergo remote ischemic preconditioning or a sham procedure after induction of anesthesia. The preconditioning therapy was three 5-minute cycles of thigh ischemia, with 5 minutes of reperfusion between cycles. The sham procedure was identical except that ischemia was not induced. The primary outcome was peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) within 24 hours after surgery (expressed as multiples of the upper limit of normal, with log transformation). The secondary outcome was change in creatinine level within 4 days after surgery (expressed as log-transformed micromoles per litre). Patient-important outcomes were assessed up to 6 months after randomization.
   Results: We randomly assigned 128 patients to remote ischemic preconditioning and 130 to the sham therapy. There were no significant differences in postoperative CK-MB (absolute mean difference 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.36) or creatinine (absolute mean difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.23). Other outcomes did not differ significantly for remote ischemic preconditioning relative to the sham therapy: for myocardial infarction, relative risk (RR) 1.35 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.17); for acute kidney injury, RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.78); for stroke, RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.34 to 3.07); and for death, RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.65 to 3.31).
   Interpretation: Remote ischemic precnditioning did not reduce myocardial or kidney injury during cardiac surgery. This type of therapy is unlikely to substantially improve patient-important outcomes in cardiac surgery.

AB  - Background: There has been an increased emphasis on institutional births, and thus an increasing clinical work load for health care professionals in the recent past. Hence, continuing education, training, ongoing supervision, and mentorship of health care professionals working in these health facilities with easy access to guidelines in a cost effective manner has become a challenging task. With the increased emphasis on institutional births, and an increasing clinical work load, continuing education and training of health care professional managing these health facilities, their ongoing supervision, mentorship, with ready availability of guidelines in a cost effective manner becomes imperative and is a challenging task. Training opportunities can be linked to mobile electronic devices and 'Apps' to improve the care of seriously ill newborn. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative point of care tool-Android based App- 'AIIMS-WHO CC STPs' on the knowledge, skill scores, and satisfaction among Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) physicians managing sick neonates.
   Methods: The baseline knowledge and skill scores of pediatricians working in SNCUs in the state of Tamil Nadu, India (n = 32) were assessed by 25 multiple choice questions (MCQs) and by five Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) skill stations. The training was conducted in a single-day workshop using the app on four modules followed by post-training assessment of knowledge and skill scores after 3 weeks using the same. The satisfaction was assessed by mixed method approach using Likert's scale and focus group discussion (FGD) after 3 weeks.
   Results: The mean knowledge scores [19.4 (2.6) vs. 10.7 (3.2); maximum marks (MM) 25, mean difference 8.7 (95 % CI 7.6 to 9.9)], and the composite mean skill scores [55.2 (5.8) and 42 (6.2), MM 75, mean difference 13.2 (95 % CI 10.4 to 15.9)] improved after training. The median (IQR) satisfaction score with the course was 4 (4 to 5) (Likert's scale). Focus group discussion revealed that the physicians were overall satisfied using the device. They expressed overall satisfaction on the teaching methodology using wall charts, simulators, and device.
   Conclusion: Training SNCU physicians on Android based App- 'AIIMS-WHO CC STPs' improved their knowledge and skills. This app may have a potential role as a supplement to other modalities in training doctors for improving newborn care.

AB  - Plasmodium vivax is most wide spread and a neglected malaria parasite. There is a lack of information on parasite biology of this species. Genome of this parasite encodes for the largest number of tryptophan-rich proteins belonging to 'Pv-fam-a' family and some of them are potential drug/vaccine targets but their functional role(s) largely remains unexplored. Using bacterial and yeast two hybrid systems, we have identified the interacting partners for two of the P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens called PvTRAg36.6 and PvTRAg56.2. The PvTRAg36.6 interacts with early transcribed membrane protein (ETRAMP) of P. vivax. It is apically localized in merozoites but in early stages it is seen in parasite periphery suggesting its likely involvement in parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) development or maintenance. On the other hand, PvTRAg56.2 interacts with P. vivax merozoite surface protein7 (PvMSP7) and is localized on merozoite surface. Co-localization of PvTRAg56.2 with PvMSP1 and its molecular interaction with PvMSP7 probably suggest that, PvTRAg56.2 is part of MSP-complex, and might assist or stabilize the protein complex at the merozoite surface. In conclusion, the PvTRAg proteins have different sub cellular localizations and specific associated functions during intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle.

AB  - Background: Although the most common cause of neonatal intestinal pseudoobstruction (IP) is Hirschprungs disease, rarely myofibrillar myopathy can cause the same. Case Report: This 31+4/7 male infant at autopsy had marked narrowing of the jejunum (0.9 cm long), and colon (7.0 cm long) markedly narrowed segments of the jejunum and large intestine, were noted respectively. Sections from these segments showed eosinophilic periodic acid Schiff stain and desmin positive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the myocytes. Transmission electron microscopy performed revealed the presence of abnormal granulofilamentous material around the atrophic sarcomeres, subsarcolemmal rod-shaped and globoid fibrillar inclusions in the intestinal, skeletal, and cardiac myocytes, suggesting a myofibrillar myopathy. Conclusion: Pure phenotypic neonatal IP presentation in a myofibrillar myopathy is extremely rare and not reported in the literature. Along with other common causes of neonatal IP, neuromuscular causes should also be investigated.

AB  - Dengue fever is the most important arboviral disease in the tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Delhi, the metropolitan capital state of India, has reported many dengue outbreaks, with the last outbreak occurring in 2013. We have recently reported predominance of dengue virus serotype 2 during 2011-2014 in Delhi. In the present study, we report molecular characterization and evolutionary analysis of dengue serotype 2 viruses which were detected in 2011-2014 in Delhi. Envelope genes of 42 DENV-2 strains were sequenced in the study. All DENV-2 strains grouped within the Cosmopolitan genotype and further clustered into three lineages; Lineage I, II and III. Lineage III replaced lineage I during dengue fever outbreak of 2013. Further, a novel mutation Thr404Ile was detected in the stem region of the envelope protein of a single DENV-2 strain in 2014. Nucleotide substitution rate and time to the most recent common ancestor were determined by molecular clock analysis using Bayesian methods. A change in effective population size of Indian DENV-2 viruses was investigated through Bayesian skyline plot. The study will be a vital road map for investigation of epidemiology and evolutionary pattern of dengue viruses in India.

AB  - Background: The trend in the outcome of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) as a result of evolving management practices is not known.
   Objective: To study and compare the outcomes of patients with AP at a tertiary care academic center over a period of 16 years.
   Methods: In a retrospective study on a prospectively acquired database of patients with AP, we analyzed time trends of severity and mortality of AP. The influence of determinants of severity [APACHE II score, organ failure (OF), infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN)], and management strategy on the actual and predicted mortality was assessed. The actual mortality was adjusted for severity to analyze the severity adjusted mortality at different times as a reflection of management practices over time.
   Results: A total of 1333 patients were studied. The number of patients hospitalized with AP has been increasing over time. The proportion of patients with severe AP also increased from 1997 to 2013 as shown by increasing incidence of organ failure and IPN (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho): OF rho(17) = 0.797, p < 0.01; IPN rho(17) = 0.739, p < 0.001), indicating an increasing referral of sicker patients. Consequently, the overall mortality has been increasing (rho(17) = 0.584; p = 0.014). However, despite increasing severity of AP, the mortality adjusted for OF has decreased significantly (rho(17) = -0.55, p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: Even with increasing proportion of patients with severe AP, there has been a significant decrease in organ failure adjusted mortality due to AP suggesting improved management over years.

AB  - Background Although South Asians experience cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors at an early age, the distribution of CVD risks across the socioeconomic spectrum remains unclear.
   Methods We analysed the 2011 Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia survey data including 16,288 non-pregnant adults (20 years) that are representative of Chennai and Delhi, India, and Karachi, Pakistan. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by highest education (primary schooling, high/secondary schooling, college graduate or greater); wealth tertiles (low, middle, high household assets) and occupation (not working outside home, semi/unskilled, skilled, white-collar work). We estimated age and sex-standardized prevalence of behavioural (daily fruit/vegetables; tobacco use), weight (body mass index; waist-to-height ratio) and metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia; hypo-HDL; and hypertriglyceridaemia) by each SES category.
   Results Across cities, 61.2% and 16.1% completed secondary and college educations, respectively; 52.8% reported not working, 22.9% were unskilled; 21.3% were skilled and 3.1% were white-collar workers. For behavioural risk factors, low fruit/vegetable intake, smoked and smokeless tobacco use were more prevalent in lowest education, wealthy and occupation (for men only) groups compared to higher SES counterparts, while weight-related risks (body mass index 25.0-29.9 and 30kg/m(2); waist-to-height ratio 0.5) were more common in higher educated and wealthy groups, and technical/professional men. For metabolic risks, a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemias was observed in more educated and affluent groups, with unclear patterns across occupation groups.
   Conclusions SES-CVD patterns are heterogeneous, suggesting customized interventions for different SES groups may be warranted. Different behavioural, weight, and metabolic risk factor prevalence patterns across SES indicators may signal on-going epidemiological transition in South Asia.

AB  - Purpose: Ichthyosis is known to have ocular associations such as blepharitis, hypertrophic conjunctivitis, corneal vascularization, ectropion, lagophthalmos, etc. However, no reports of its association with glaucoma are there, to the best of our knowledge. We report a unique case of juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) with lamellar ichthyosis.
   Method: A 16-year-old male child presented with a gradual, painless progressive diminution of vision in both eyes over a period of 3 years. Systemic examination revealed stunted body growth with knock-knees, suggestive of late-onset rickets. Generalized dry scaly lesions with erythema, along with hyperkeratosis of the palms and the soles, suggestive of lamellar ichthyosis were present. On ocular examination, the intraocular pressure was 36 mm Hg; optic nerve head examination revealed a horizontally oval disc with near total cupping in the right eye and total cupping in the left eye, with extensive neuroretinal rim thinning and pallor. Gonioscopy showed wide open angles with prominent iris processes. Screening of JOAG-associated genes (MYOC, NTF4, WDR36, and CYP1B1) and ichthyosis-associated gene (TGM1) was performed by the direct PCR-sequencing method.
   Results: A diagnosis of JOAG with advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy with lamellar ichthyosis and rickets was made. The patient underwent right followed by left eye trabeculectomy with 0.2 mg/dL MMC (for 1 min). Postoperatively, the intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg at 1 week, and 12 to 14 mm Hg at the 6-week, the 3-month, and the 6-month follow-up, and the visual acuity was maintained in the right eye. No mutations in MYOC, NTF4, WDR36, CYP1B1, and TGM1 were observed in the patient and his family.
   Conclusions: An association of glaucoma with ichthyosis should be kept in mind. Therefore, a detailed baseline ocular examination in children with ichthyosis is required, as early detection of glaucoma could prevent irreversible blindness.

AB  - ObjectiveThe mute question is whether patients with DTC of intermediate risk of recurrence, second most common presentation, who were surgically ablated in the first place, ever needed adjuvant RAI therapy? This study exclusively evaluated the long-term outcome in intermediate-risk patients with DTC.
   DesignTwo-arm retrospective cohort study conducted between years 1991 and 2012.
   SettingInstitutional practice.
   PatientsIntermediate-risk DTC patients, with pathologically proven T1/2N1M0, T3 with/without N1 M0 disease, with a minimum follow-up of 12months, were included. Of 254 patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 125 patients were surgically ablated (Gr-I) and 129 patients had significant remnant and/nodal disease (Gr-II). No radioiodine in Gr-I and adjuvant RAI therapy was administered in Gr-II patients.
   MeasurementsBaseline characteristics were compared and overall survival, event-free survival, disease-free survival/overall remission rates and recurrence rates were calculated for both the groups.
   ResultsAll baseline patient characteristics were comparable except 24-h RAIU between two groups. Depending on adjuvant radioiodine therapy outcome, Gr-II patients were subclassified as Gr-IIa (ablated) and Gr-IIb (not ablated). With a median follow-up duration of 103years (range: 1-21years), 12/125 (96%) patients had disease recurrence and 10 (8%) showed persistent disease in Gr-I. In Gr-IIa, 6/102 (59%) patients recurred but only one of them was successfully ablated with I-131, and 5 (49%) had persistent disease. However, in Gr-IIb, 27 patients who failed first-dose adjuvant RAI therapy, 8/27 (296%) showed persistent disease (P=0000). Overall survival was 100%; however, disease-free survival rates were 92% and 90%, in Gr-I and Gr-II, respectively.
   ConclusionIntermediate-risk surgically ablated patients do not need adjuvant RAI therapy and patients who failed to achieve ablation with first dose of I-131 may be dynamically risk stratified as high-risk category and managed aggressively.

AB  - An ependymoma is an uncommon glial tumor, which arises from different parts of the neuroaxis. Considerable variation in presentation and survival in tumors in different locations after an optimum treatment indicates inherent molecular and genetic differences in tumorigenesis between them. A number of genetic aberrations have been identified to distinctly characterize different subgroups of ependymomas that include a posterior fossa tumor, a supratentorial tumor, and a pediatric tumor. These different groups have substantial genetic alterations, and also distinct demography, clinical characteristics, and prognosis. This article is intended to review the diverse molecular and genetic aberrations that may be helpful in prognostication and prediction of survival in patients suffering from an ependymoma.

AB  - Background. The National Family Health Survey-3 (NFHS-3; 2005-06) reports that the prevalence of low birth-weight babies is 22% in India. This old figure is probably an underestimate as this nationwide survey acquired information on birth-weight of only 34% of babies. We aimed to make a fresh estimate of the proportion of low birth-weight babies.
   Methods. A systematic search was done through PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Medline, IndMed, Embase, WHO and Biomed Central databases. Studies published from 2004 to 2014 were included. Study quality was assessed using the adapted Mirza and Jenkins checklist. An 'adjustment' of 24% was applied to the published estimates where data were collected through records or through a combination of records and anthropometry. The adjustment was done to account for the heaping of birth-weight data at 2500 g. Meta analysis using both random and fixed effects model was done to derive an estimate.
   Results. Nineteen studies with 44 133 subjects were included in the review. The pooled estimate for the prevalence of low birth-weight was 27% (95% CI 24%-30%) and the 'adjusted' pooled prevalence was 31% (95% CI 28%-33%). The prevalence in urban and rural areas was 30% (95% CI 23%-38%) and 26% (95% Cl 22%-30%), respectively. Region wise estimates revealed that the prevalence at 33% was comparatively higher in eastern regions (95% CI 29%-37%).
   Conclusion. The pooled prevalence of low birth-weight is higher than that reported by NFHS-3. Updated estimates should be used to guide future interventions and policies.

AB  - Stemming the tide of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide requires a multipronged approach. Although much attention has been paid to disease control measures, there is relatively little consideration of the importance of training the next generation of health-related researchers to play their important role in this global epidemic. The lack of support for early stage investigators in low-and middle-income countries interested in the global NCD field has resulted in inadequate funding opportunities for research, insufficient training in advanced research methodology and data analysis, lack of mentorship in manuscript and grant writing, and meager institutional support for developing, submitting, and administering research applications and awards. To address this unmet need, The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-UnitedHealth Collaborating Centers of Excellence initiative created a Training Subcommittee that coordinated and developed an intensive, mentored health-related research experience for a number of early stage investigators from the 11 Centers of Excellence around the world. We describe the challenges faced by early stage investigators in low-and middle-income countries, the organization and scope of the Training Subcommittee, training activities, early outcomes of the early stage investigators (foreign and domestic) and training materials that have been developed by this program that are available to the public. By investing in the careers of individuals in a supportive global NCD network, we demonstrate the impact that an investment in training individuals from low-and middle-income countries can have on the preferred future of or current efforts to combat NCDs.

AB  - Purpose To report outcome of eyes with recalcitrant and naive eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with intravitreal dexamethasone implants (Ozurdex) injection.
   Methods Retrospective multicenter data analysis of eyes with DME treated with Ozurdex implant and with minimum follow-up of at least one year after the first implant. Data collected included demographic details, history of presenting illness, past treatment history, clinical examination details including visual acuity at presentation, and follow-up with imaging and treatment details. Paired sample t-test was used to measure mean differences between pre- and post-implant values obtained at baseline and last follow-up.
   Results A total of 79 eyes (62 subjects) were included. Sixty-four eyes had been previously treated; 15 eyes were naive. Among the previously treated eyes, mean interval between first Ozurdex injection and any previous treatment was 7.69 +/- 8.2 months. In naive eyes, the visual acuity improved from baseline 0.58 +/- 0.25 to 0.44 +/- 0.33 logMAR at last follow-up (P=0.05). In eyes that had been previously treated, the improvement was from 0.65 +/- 0.34 at baseline to 0.48 +/- 0.35 logMAR (P=0.01). Mean treatment-free interval was 6.5 +/- 4.5 months. Nine eyes were steroid responder with controlled intraocular pressure (IOP), none showed any spike in IOP during the follow-up period.
   Conclusions Ozurdex implant could be a good alternative for recalcitrant as well as naive eyes with DME. The visual gain after initial implant injection was fairly maintained, with additional treatment usually after 6 months in naive eyes. Ozurdex appeared safe even in steroid responders with good control of IOP with antiglaucoma medications.

As low-grade disease may not need active intervention, the ability to identify aggressive cancers on imaging could limit the need for prostate biopsies. We assessed the ability of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in pre-biopsy risk stratification of men with prostate cancer. One hundred and twenty men suspected to have prostate cancer underwent mpMRI (diffusion MRI and MR spectroscopic imaging) prior to biopsy. Twenty-six had cancer and were stratified into three groups based on GS: low grade (GS6), intermediate grade (GS=7) and high grade (GS8). A total of 910 regions of interest (ROIs) from the peripheral zone (PZ, range 25-45) were analyzed from these 26 patients. The metabolite ratio [citrate/(choline+creatine)] and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of voxels were calculated for the PZ regions corresponding to the biopsy cores and compared with histology. The median metabolite ratios for low-grade, intermediate-grade and high-grade cancer were 0.29 (range: 0.16, 0.61), 0.17 (range: 0.13, 0.32) and 0.13 (range: 0.05, 0.23), respectively (p=0.004). The corresponding mean ADCs (x10(-3) mm(2)/s) for low-grade, intermediate-grade and high-grade cancer were 0.99 +/- 0.08, 0.86 +/- 0.11 and 0.69 +/- 0.12, respectively (p<0.0001). The combined ADC and metabolite ratio model showed strong discriminatory ability to differentiate subjects with GS6 from subjects with GS7 with an area under the curve of 94%. These data indicate that pre-biopsy mpMRI may stratify PCa aggressiveness noninvasively. As the recent literature data suggest that men with GS6 cancer may not need radical therapy, our data may help limit the need for biopsy and allow informed decision making for clinical intervention.

AB  - Varicocele-associated male infertility has classically been managed using surgery or assisted reproductive techniques. With increasing evidence of oxidative stress as a pathophysiological factor in varicocele-associated infertility, medical therapy especially antioxidants might become a treatment option with lower risks. We reviewed the existing literature on the role of various medical agents in the management of male infertility attributed to varicoceles. Medical therapy is typically evaluated in three different situations such as (a) comparison of two drugs or one drug with placebo, (b) comparison of drugs versus surgery, and (c) comparison of drugs as adjuvant therapy with surgery versus drug therapy alone. Due to heterogeneity of data and lack of well-conducted studies, there is insufficient data to recommend routine use of medical therapy for men with varicocele-associated infertility and surgery remains the treatment of choice. Pregnancy and live birth rates are usually not reported in most studies and mere improvement in sperm parameters or antioxidant capacity is insufficient to support its routine use. Antioxidant therapy is a potential option due to its theoretical benefit, data from preclinical studies, and lack of major side effects. Adjuvant therapy with antioxidants after surgical repair of varicocele may improve the outcome and is a potential area for further research.

AB  - AIM: The present study aimed to evaluate the microsurgical outcome in post-traumatic peripheral nerve injuries and its correlation with time since injury and the type of the operative procedure performed.
   MATERIAL and METHODS: All the patients admitted to our center with the diagnosis of post-traumatic peripheral nerve injury were included in the study. The data of all patients was retrospectively analysed from the computerized database of our hospital. The time period of the study was from January 2008 to March 2011.
   RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were included in the study. The interval between injury and surgery was 28.8 weeks (range: 1 day -70 weeks). The most common mode of injury was road traffic accidents (39%, n=9). The mean follow up was 24.7 +/- 11.3 months (range 9-45 months). Six (60%) patients had a good outcome. There was no statistically significant correlation between outcome and time since injury or type of operative procedure performed (p > 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: Post-traumatic peripheral nerve injury is a rare form of nerve injury. There is no correlation between the surgical outcome and time since injury. Some of the nerves have a better outcome as compared to others.

AB  - Objectives: Noxious stimuli activate small to medium-sized dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Intense noxious stimuli result in the release of substance P (SP) from the central terminals of these neurons. It binds to the neurokinin type 1 receptor (NK1r) and sensitises the dorsal horn neurons. SP is also released from the peripheral terminals leading to neurogenic inflammation. However, their individual contribution at spinal and peripheral levels to postincisional nociception has not been delineated as yet.
   Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were administered different doses (3-100 mu g) of an NK1r antagonist (L760735) by intrathecal (i.t.) route before hind paw incision. On the basis of its antinociceptive effect on guarding behaviour, the 30 mu g dose was selected for further study. In different sets of animals, this was administered i.t. (postemptive) and intrawound (i.w.). Finally, in another group, drug (30 mu g) was administered through both i.t and i.w. routes. The antinociceptive effect was assessed and compared. Expression of SP was examined in the spinal cord. Intrawound concentration of SP and inflammatory mediators was also evaluated.
   Results: Postemptive i.t. administration significantly attenuated guarding and allodynia. Guarding was alone decreased after i.w. drug treatment. Combined drug administration further attenuated all nociceptive parameters, more so after postemptive treatment. Expression of SP in the spinal cord decreased post incision but increased in the paw tissue. Inflammatory mediators like the nerve growth factor also increased after incision.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, SP acting through the NK1r appears to be an important mediator of nociception, more so at the spinal level. These findings could have clinical relevance.

AB  - Context: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Largely, the prognosis is dependent on the nonmodifiable factors such as severity of the initial injury, Glasgow coma scale score, pupillary response, age, and presence of additional physiological derangements such as hypoxia or hypotension. However, secondary insults continue to take place after the initial injury and resuscitation. The study hypothesis in the present research article was that hypoglycemia is an independent outcome prognosticator in severe traumatic brain injury. The study aimed to assess the role of glucose monitoring in the brain parenchyma as an independent outcome prognosticator and also to study its association with plasma glucose levels.
   Aims: The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship of intracerebral glucose measured by intraparenchymal cerebral microdialysis (CMD), and also to study its relationship with blood glucose levels. We also evaluated the relationship of these values to the outcome of patients.
   Settings and Design: Prospective nonrandomized study conducted at a tertiary care trauma center in India.
   Subjects and Methods: Twenty-five patients with severe TBI, who underwent decompressive craniectomy, were prospectively monitored with CMD catheters. Twenty cases had unilateral catheters placed intraparenchymally (20 mm inside the brain parenchyma to accommodate 10 mm of the semipermeable catheter tip and another 10 mm of extra catheter length). Frontotemporal contusions were noted in 21 cases and an acute subdural hematoma (with/without associated contusions) were noted in 15 cases in the present series. Bilateral CMD catheters were placed during bifrontal decompressive craniectomies in five patients (two patients had peri-contusional catheters placement; these patients had bilateral frontal contusions); while, the remaining 3 patients had a contralateral catheter placement in the normal brain parenchyma [Table 1]. The position of the catheters was confirmed on postoperative computerized tomographic scan carried out in these subjects. However, bilateral catheter placement to compare the difference in cerebral biochemical values of glucose in the penumbric zone as well as the normal brain could not be done in all cases due to cost restraints. The relation between plasma glucose and CMD-measured interstitial brain glucose concentrations, as well as the temporal pattern of CMD glucose was studied for 3-5 days following a decompressive craniectomy using a CMD analyzer at the patient's bedside at 1 hourly intervals.
   Statistical Analysis Used: All data were tabulated in Microsoft Excel 2011 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. To calculate the correlation between plasma and CMD glucose, Pearson's correlation was used with a two-tailed test of significance. Student's t-test was used to calculate the difference in means between the two groups. Significance was assumed at P <= 0.05.
   Results: Fifteen patients (60%) had a good outcome in terms of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 3 months while the rest (10 patients) had a poor GOS at 3 months. There was a significant difference in the incidence of hyperglycemia (random blood sugar >10 mmol/L) between the two groups (P < 0.0001). The difference between the two groups while comparing episodes of hypoglycemia was also significant (P = 0.0026). The good outcome group had fewer episodes of brain hypoglycemia during the presence of systemic hypoglycemia (P = 0.0026). Neither the mean blood glucose values nor the mean cerebral glucose values predicted the outcome at 3 months.
   Conclusions: After decompressive craniectomy in severe TBI, there was a poor correlation between the plasma and CMD glucose concentration. A higher degree of variation was seen in the correlations for individual patients. Neither the mean blood glucose values nor the mean cerebral glucose values predicted the outcome at 3 months. The good outcome group had fewer episodes of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

AB  - Aim: To investigate whether neoadjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy down-stages the tumors and predicts ultimate outcome in patients with advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer.
   Methods: Fifteen patients with stage III and IV cancers received two cycles of intra-arterial cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) at days 1 and 15, infused super-selectively into superior thyroid artery. Interim evaluation using RECIST 1.1 and volumetry was done in all patients at clay 25. Subsequently, the patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy or surgery with radiotherapy. Final evaluation was done in 10 patients.
   Results: At interim evaluation, five patients qualified as responders. Partial response, stable disease and progressive disease rates were 40, 33 and 27%, respectively. At final evaluation, complete response was noted in all patients.
   Conclusions: At interim evaluation, the response rates were lower compared to intravenous neoadjuvant chemotherapy and response to intra-arterial chemotherapy did not predict the ultimate outcome. Thus neoadjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy offers no advantage over concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

AB  - A young patient presented with visual acuity of hand movements only, unrecordable intraocular pressure, and total cataract after trauma 12 months ago. She reported failure to improve with conservative therapy as well as a direct cycloplexy elsewhere. After cleft localization on preoperative gonioscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), and intraoperative gonioscopy, a partial-thickness scleral flap was fashioned at the site of maximum cleft height. Following phacoaspiration, a multipiece intraocular lens was implanted in the sulcus; its haptics aligned to the axis with maximum height of cyclodialysis. A Cionni ring placed in sulcus was sutured to sclera under the flap to provide additional tamponading effect. Postoperative UBM and gonioscopy confirmed cleft closure. Normalization of intraocular pressure was found on repeated follow-ups till 1 year (12 to 14 mm Hg). UBM showed increase in sulcus diameter, and "double indentation sign" on the ciliary body.

AB  - Objective: To comparatively evaluate morphometric features of the optic discs of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), juvenile onset primary open angle glaucoma (JOAG), and adult onset primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT3).
   Methods: Optic discs of previously treated 89 PCG, 136 JOAG, and 139 adult onset POAG patients, were evaluated. One eye of each patient was analyzed in the study. The optic disc characteristics studied included disc area, cup area, rim area, cup depth, cup volume, cup to disc area ratio, horizontal cup to disc ratio, vertical cup to disc ratio, and mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). A regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of age, sex, and disc area on the disc characteristics in the 3 categories of primary glaucomas.
   Results: Mean disc area of PCG, JOAG and POAG eyes was 2.58 +/- 0.75, 2.61 +/- 0.51, and 2.44 +/- 0.58 mm(2), respectively. The cup characteristics that demonstrated significantly greater means among JOAG compared with POAG and PCG eyes, included cup depth (P = 0.001), cup volume (P = 0.024), and cup to disc area ratio (P = 0.049). The mean horizontal cup to disc ratio = 0.73 was greater than mean vertical cup to disc ratio = 0.61 (P = 0.026) among PCG eyes as well as among JOAG eyes (P = 0.001). For POAG, the mean horizontal cup to disc ratio = 0.73 was not different from the mean vertical cup to disc ratio = 0.69 (P = 0.077).
   Conclusions: The optic discs of juvenile onset open angle glaucoma tend to be larger in size than adult onset POAG discs. A 3-dimensional enlargement of the cup is seen among treated JOAG discs compared with POAG and PCG eyes. The greater horizontal cup disc ratio in PCG and JOAG compared with POAG eyes indicates a concentric enlargement of the cup in these patients.

AB  - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) characterized by subcutaneous infiltration of pleomorphic T-cells of the alpha/beta phenotype rarely affects children. Development of hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) leads to a poor prognosis with this otherwise indolent lymphoma. We report a case of SPTCL in a 5-year-old child complicated by HPS treated successfully with combination chemotherapy. We discuss the potential pitfalls in reaching an early diagnosis and challenges in its management. Previously reported cases of SPTCL with HPS in children are briefly reviewed.

AB  - Continuous infusion of vecuronium is a commonly used technique for patients requiring prolonged neuromuscular blockade for mechanical ventilation. As compared with older neuromuscular blocking agents, it confers the advantages of rapid excretion and intermediate duration of action. Prolongation of neuromuscular blockade and muscle weakness are the known complications of continuous vecuronium infusion. This report attempts to describe polyuria, as a hitherto unknown complication of vecuronium infusion, which can occur due to the mannitol present in commercially available preparation of vecuronium bromide.

AB  - Data on treatment outcome and prognostic factors in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are limited in the literature.
   A total of 119 patients with metastatic STS treated between June 2003 and December 2012 were analyzed for treatment outcome and prognostic factors.
   Median age was 37 years (range 2-72 years) with a male to female ratio of 1.5:1. Most common histologic subtypes were synovial sarcoma (36 %) and leiomyosarcoma (16 %). Median tumor size was 12 cm (range 1.6-30 cm). Twenty-four (20 %) patients were treated with multimodality therapy and 80 % patients received systemic chemotherapy alone. At a median follow-up of 10 months (range 1-66 months), the 2-year EFS and OS were 10 and 19 %, respectively, with a median EFS and OS of 6 and 10 months, respectively. Univariate analysis identified albumin a parts per thousand currency sign4 g/dl (p = 0.001), histologic subtypes other than synovial sarcoma (p = 0.02), non-extremity tumors (p = 0.03) and single modality treatment (p = 0.03) as factors predicting poor EFS; however, for OS, hemoglobin a parts per thousand currency sign10 g/dl (p = 0.02), tumor size > 10 cm (p = 0.01) and single modality treatment (p = 0.04) were identified as poor prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis identified only serum albumin a parts per thousand currency sign4 g/dl (p = 0.002, HR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.29-0.75) associated with poor EFS; however, for OS, hemoglobin a parts per thousand currency sign10 g/dl (p = 0.009, HR 0.49, 95 % CI 0.29-0.83), tumor size > 10 cm (p = 0.003, HR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.28-3.47) and single modality treatment (p = 0.01, HR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.25-0.86) emerged as poor prognostic factors.
   Serum albumin, tumor size, hemoglobin and treatment modality affect survival in metastatic STS.

AB  - Background & objectives: Studies have shown that immunohistochemical (IHC) staining using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation specific antibodies, is an easy and cost-effective, screening method compared with molecular techniques. The purpose of present study was to assess the percentage positivity of IHC using EGFR mutation specific antibodies in lung biopsy samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma (ADC).
   Methods: Two hundred and six biopsies of primary lung ADC were subjected to EGFR mutation specific antibodies against del E746-A750 and L858R. Detection of EGFR mutation done by high resolution melting analysis (HRM) was used as gold standard. A concordance was established between molecular and IHC results. Frequency of IHC positivity was assessed.
   Results: Of the 206 patients, 129 were male and 77 were female patients, with a mean age of 54.1 yr. Fifty five (26.6%) patients (36 men; 19 women) showed positivity for IHC of del E746-A750 (33) and L858R (22). HRM results were available in 14 patients which showed EGFR mutations in correspondence with del E746-750 or L858R in 64.2 per cent cases. Positive cases on HRM were further confirmed by DNA sequencing and fragment analysis. Three patients showed exon20 variation. Two cases were negative for mutation. The genotype of del E746-750 mutation was more common than L858R. A concordance was established between molecular mutation and IHC in 85.7 per cent cases.
   Interpretation & conclusions: In this preliminary study from India mutation specific IHC was used for assessment of mutation status of EGFR. Although the number tested was small, a good concordance was observed between molecular EGFR mutation and IHC expression. IHC methodology is a potentially useful tool to guide clinicians for personalized treatment in lung ADC, especially where facilities for molecular analysis are not readily available and for use in small biopsies where material is scant for molecular tests.

AB  - Cardiac catheterization is important in the diagnosis and risk stratification of pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD) in children. Acute vasoreactivity testing provides key information about management, prognosis, therapeutic strategies, and efficacy. Data obtained at cardiac catheterization continue to play an important role in determining the surgical options for children with congenital heart disease and clinical evidence of increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease Task Forces of the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute met to develop a consensus statement regarding indications for, conduct of, acute vasoreactivity testing with, and pitfalls and risks of cardiac catheterization in children with PHVD. This document contains the essentials of those discussions to provide a rationale for the hemodynamic assessment by cardiac catheterization of children with PHVD.

AB  - Pheochromocytoma is a neuroendocrine tumor arising from the adrenal medulla. A number of variants of pheochromocytoma are known; however, pigmented pheochromocytoma is extremely rare, with only few cases reported in literature. We report the cases of two patients with pigmented pheochromocytoma. Case 1 was a 28-year-old female who presented with complaints of breathlessness, palpitations, and anxiety for 5 years, which had worsened over the last 8 months. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed a right suprarenal mass. Case 2 was that of an 18-year-old girl who presented with similar complaints and was diagnosed with hypertension. CT abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. Urinary vanillyl mandelic acid was raised in both patients. Sections examined from all three tumors showed cells arranged in Zellballen pattern, separated by thin fibrovascular septae. Tumor cells showed moderate to marked nuclear pleomorphism in case 1. Mitoses were, however, not seen. There was no evidence of capsular or vascular invasion. Many of the tumor cells showed intracytoplasmic black pigment, which was positive for Fontana-Masson and was bleach-labile, confirming it as melanin. Hemosiderin deposition was also identified. Large areas of hemorrhagic necrosis were seen in case 1. Tumor cells were immunopositive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, while they were negative for HMB-45. Electron microscopy was performed. A final diagnosis of pigmented pheochromocytoma was rendered in both cases. Pigmented pheochromocytoma is a very rare tumor, which needs to be differentiated from other pigmented tumors like malignant melanoma of adrenal gland and pigmented adrenal adenoma. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry help in making this distinction.

AB  - The influence of alpha and beta cells, through glucagon and insulin, on energy metabolism is well known. The insulin:glucagon ratio (IGR) is a frequently discussed entity in the medical literature. However, in recent years, focus has shifted to other pathways and markers of health and disease. This communication revisits the insulin:glucagon bipolar axis and describes the significance of the IGR. It reviews the effects of various glucose-lowering drugs on this ratio, and hypothesizes that the ratio can be used to predict the appropriate choice of drugs for managing diabetes. Drugs which increase the IGR may be beneficial in insulinopenic conditions, while those which decrease IGR may be of help in the setting of hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance.

AB  - Basal insulins are first line injectable therapy by all international guidelines. Basal insulins can be used alone, in combination with metformin, dual or triple oral therapy, glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists, or prandial insulin. However, all basal insulins are not similar. This article proposes objective parameters, and suggests a simple checklist, using history, physical examination, and investigations, to help choose the appropriate preparation, viz degludec, detemir, glargine or NPH insulin, for persons requiring basal insulin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thalamopeduncular gliomas arise at the junction of the thalamus and cerebral peduncle and constitute a subgroup of thalamic gliomas. These are surgically challenging lesions because of close proximity to important neural structures including corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and the thalamus. These tumors usually displace CSTs anterolaterally or extend to the lateral ventricular surface. Such tumors can be removed by either temporal or trans ventricular approaches. However, if CSTs cover the entire lateral surface of tumor and tumor does not extend to the ventricular surface, temporal and transventricular approaches cannot be used because the trajectories of both approaches would pass through normal eloquent structures (CSTs and thalamus), and consequently there would be a very high risk of postoperative neurologic deficits developing.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman presented with contralateral hemiparesis. Radiologic evaluation revealed a right Thalamopeduncular glioma that displaced CSTs laterally and was covered by normal thalamus superiorly. Some CST fibers passed through the tumor, Because both lateral and superior surfaces were covered by eloquent structures, we used an anterior interhemispheric transparaterminal gyrus approach to access the tumor successfully and achieved subtotal excision, The patient had transient neurologic deterioration postoperatively that recovered to preoperative level within 2 weeks.
   CONCLUSIONS: The anterior interhemispheric transparaterminal gyrus approach has not been described previously for accessing brainstem lesions. This approach can be used to access tumors of the cerebral peduncle that displace CSTs laterally and are covered by normal thalamus superiorly. The anterior interhemispheric transparaterminal gyms approach adds to the armamentarium of neurosurgeons for treatment of cerebral peduncular lesions.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a multifunctional pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in inflammation and pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease. As per our knowledge, there is no published study investigating the association between variations within the TGF-beta 1 gene polymorphisms and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the TGF-beta 1 gene (C509T, G800A and T869C) polymorphisms, and their haplotypes with the risk of ICH in North Indian population. 100 ICH patients and 100 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. Genotyping was performed using SNaPshot method. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the strength of association between TGF-beta 1 gene polymorphisms and risk of ICH. Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, low socioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity were found to be associated with the risk of ICH. The distribution of C509T, G800A and T869C genotypes was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) in the ICH and control group. Adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis showed an independent association of TGF-beta 1 G800A (OR 9.07; 95 % CI 2.3-35.6; P = 0.002) and T869C (OR 5.1; 95 % CI 1.9-13.2; P = 0.001) with the risk of ICH under dominant model. Haplotype analysis showed that C509-G800-C869 and C509-A800-C869 haplotypes were significantly associated with the increased risk of ICH. C509T and T869C were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.53, r (2) = 0.23). Our results suggest that TGF-beta 1 (G800A, T869C) gene polymorphisms and their haplotypes are significantly associated with the risk of ICH in North Indian population. Further prospective studies with large sample size are required for independent validation. Our findings could be helpful in identifying individuals at increased risk for developing ICH.

AB  - Background: The preoperative differentiation of aseptic and septic loosening of hip prostheses remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians and many molecular imaging techniques have been evaluated. The objective of current study was to establish the clinical utility of dual phase 18F-fluoride PET/CT (DPFP) in diagnosing implant loosening, differentiation between septic and aseptic loosening and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of DPFP and three-phase bone scan (TPBS).
   Methods: In this prospective study, we evaluated 57 hip components in 45 patients (bilateral prostheses in 12 patients, 45 painful and 12 asymptomatic contralateral hip components) with dual phase fluoride PET/CT and TPBS. Findings of skeletal scintigraphy and PET/CT were evaluated by two expert nuclear medicine physicians, blinded with clinical findings and final diagnosis. The patterns of tracer uptake and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were noted for each joint. The final diagnosis was based on intraoperative findings, histopathological or microbiological examinations.
   Results: Out of twelve non-painful hips, DPFP correctly identified no loosening in 11 hips while TPBS detected in 10 hips. In the remaining 45 hips with radiological proven loosening to rule out sepsis, DPFP had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 75%, 97%, 92%, 88% and 88% respectively while TPBS revealed 81%, 86%, 76%, 89% and 82% respectively. DPFP had shown a higher specificity and PPV as compared to the TPBS in the evaluation of painful hip prostheses. The pattern of tracer uptake may help in the differentiation between the two entities. We also noted a significant difference between SUVmax values of septic and aseptic loosening.
   Conclusions: The results suggested that DPFP has considerable potential in differentiating septic from aseptic loosening of hip prostheses and more specific to rule out sepsis than TPBS. It may be employed before revision arthroplasty to evaluate implant for loosening and sepsis in loosened implant. (C) 2016 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Berberis aristata (Berberidaceae) is an important medicinal plant used in traditional system of medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. The aim of the present study is to scientifically validate the traditional use of BA in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.
   Materials and Methods: Anti-inflammatory and anti-granuloma activity of BA hydroalcoholic extract (BAHE) were evaluated in experimental models, viz., carrageenan-induced paw edema, cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation, and complete Freund's adjuvant-induced stimulation of peritoneal macrophages in rats. Expression of inflammatory mediators, viz., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-10, TNF-R1, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was carried out in serum and peritoneal macrophages to derive the plausible mechanism of BAHE in activated peritoneal macrophages.
   Results: Pretreatment with BAHE produced a dose-dependent reduction (P < 0.01) in carrageenan-induced paw edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma model. BAHE treatment produced significant (P < 0.01) reduction in serum inflammatory cytokine levels as compared to control. Protein expression of pro-inflammatory markers, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-R1, and COX-2, was found to be reduced in stimulated macrophages whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was upregulated in peritoneal macrophages.
   Conclusion: The result of the present study thus demonstrates the anti-inflammatory and anti-granuloma activity of BAHE which may be attributed to its inhibitory activity on macrophage-derived cytokine and mediators.

AB  - Objectives: Access to epilepsy surgery remains a considerable challenge in contemporary healthcare systems. Given the limitations in resources and demand for Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) assessments, information that can be used to expedite the process is of great value. The purpose of this study was to identify variables prior to EMU admission that may be associated with candidacy for prospective epilepsy surgery.
   Methods: This was a prospective study conducted at the Department of Neurology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. We identified two subgroups of patients from 501 drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) patients admitted in EMU of Neurology Department, AIIMS from 2006 onwards following validation of proposed tool in 40 patients. They on subsequent investigations were either cleared or not cleared for epilepsy surgery. A tool consisting of variables likely to predict surgical candidacy in persons with DRE in Indian settings was developed for identification of patients who might benefit from an early epilepsy surgery evaluation.
   Results: Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups for several variables. Non-surgical candidates had non-disabling seizures, seizures improved with a combination of drugs, had little/no AEDs side effects and had near normal or normal scalp EEG and MRI brain.
   Significance: Using the best available evidence, we developed a decision making tool which can provide a comprehensive quick guide for determining candidacy for epilepsy surgery evaluations in resource limited settings. Given the demand for EMU assessments, information that can be used to expedite the process is of value. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a potential for reducing the incidence of breast cancer by modifying or changing the reversible risk factors like dietary modifications, modifications in the sedentary life habits, etc. One of such methods which has gained popularity now is chemoprevention. Many agents have been evaluated in the chemoprevention setting in females with increased risk of breast cancers. Metformin, NSAIDS, Bisphosphonates, and statins were evaluated by various investigators with variable results. One of the agents that have been proven to be beneficial in this setting is the anti-estrogens. A major disadvantage of chemoprevention is that unlike prophylactic mastectomy it can never reduce the risk to near zero although it reduces the risk significantly. Another issue is the compliance as chemoprevention with anti-estrogens will need to be continued for 5 years while surgery is a one-time procedure. Another disadvantage is the possible side effects peculiar to each drug used which may not be a significant concern in prophylactic mastectomy group. All these factors must also be kept in mind and properly explained to the patient before starting chemoprevention using anti-estrogens. Here in this review we intend to look into the large randomized controlled trials to quantify the present status of chemoprevention with anti-estrogens.

AB  - Objective To assess the prevalence of dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy in Indian children receiving non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and to determine the associated risk factors for the same.
   Methods The present cross-sectional study was conducted at a Pediatric Clinic of a tertiary care teaching center in India, from May 2011 through December 2012. HIV infected children aged 5-15 y were enrolled if they did not have any severe disease or hospital admission within last 3 mo or receive any medications known to affect the lipid profile. Eighty-one children were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 6 mo and 16 were receiving no antiretroviral therapy (ART). Participants' sociodemographic, nutritional, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded in addition to anthropometry and evidence of lipodystrophy. Fasting lipid profile, apolipoprotein A1 and B levels were done for all the children.
   Results Among the children on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 38.3 % had dyslipidemia and 80.2 % had lipodystrophy, while 25 % antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive HIV infected children had dyslipidemia. No clinically significant risk factors could be identified that increased the risk of dyslipidemia or lipodystrophy in children on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
   Conclusions There is a high prevalence of dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy in Indian children with HIV infection with an imminent need to establish facilities for testing and treatment of these children for metabolic abnormalities.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to translate and validate the oral health-related quality of life assessment tool named Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) into Hindi language for use in the Indian population.
   MethodologyThe 12-item GOHAI questionnaire was translated into Hindi, back-translated and compared with the original English version. After pilot testing and appropriate changes, the Hindi version was administered to a group of 500 patients visiting the geriatric medicine clinic in All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The questionnaire was re-administered to 29 participants after a gap of minimum 7days. The measures for reliability and validity were also assessed.
   ResultsCronbach's score (0.79) showed excellent internal consistency. Item-scale correlations varied from 0.06 to 0.75. Test-retest correlation on the 29 patients showed excellent results (ranging from 0.748 to 0.946). Lower GOHAI scores were associated with patient's self-perception of nutritional status, perceptive need for prosthesis, number of posterior occluding pair of teeth. Higher GOHAI scores were seen with patients with removable prosthesis than with edentulous or partially edentulous participants. Age group was also found to be a significant factor for GOHAI scores.
   ConclusionThe Hindi version of GOHAI exhibits acceptable validity and reliability and can be used in the elderly Indian population as a measure of oral health-related quality of life.

AB  - Background: Celiac disease, once thought to be uncommon in Asia, is now recognized in Asian nations as well. We investigated the prevalence of celiac disease in first-degree relatives of celiac disease patients followed in our centre.
   Methods: First-degree relatives were screened prospectively for celiac disease using questionnaire-based interview and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. Serology positive first-degree relatives underwent duodenal biopsies. Diagnosis of celiac disease was made based on positive serology and villous abnormality Marsh grade 2 or higher. Human leucocyte antigen DQ2/-DQ8 was also assessed in 127 first-degree relatives.
   Results: 434 first-degree relatives of 176 celiac disease patients were prospectively recruited; 282 were symptomatic (64.9%), 58 were positive for serology (13.3%). Seroprevalence was higher in female than in males (19% vs 8.5%; p = 0.001) and highest in siblings (16.9%) than parents (13.6%) and children (5.9%) of celiac patients (p = 0.055); 87.4% first-degree relatives were human leucocyte antigen-DQ2/-DQ8 positive. Overall prevalence of celiac disease was 10.9% amongst first-degree relatives.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of celiac disease in first-degree relatives of celiac disease patients was 10.9% in our cohort, and 87% had human leucocyte antigen-DQ2 or -DQ8 haplotype. All first-degree relatives of celiac disease patients should be screen for celiac disease even if asymptomatic or with atypical manifestations. (C) 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

AB  - Introduction: High resolution electrophoresis (HRE) and immunofixation (IFX) of serum and urine are integral to the diagnostic work-up of multiple myeloma. Unusual electrophoresis patterns are common and may be misinterpreted. Though primarily the responsibility of the hematopathologist, clinicians who are responsible for managing myelomas may benefit from knowledge of these. In this review article we intend to discuss the patterns and importance of electrophoresis in present day scenario. Methods: Patterns of HRE and IFX seen in our laboratory over the past 15 years were studied. Results: Monoclonal proteins are seen on HRE as sharply defined bands, sometimes two, lying from gamma- to alpha-globulin regions on a background of normal, increased or decreased polyclonal gamma-globulins, showing HRE to be a rapid and dependable method of detecting M-protein in serum or urine. Immunofixation complements HRE and due to its greater sensitivity, is able to pick up small or light chain bands, not apparent on electrophoresis, including biclonal disease even when electrophoresis shows only one M-band. Special features liable to misinterpretation are discussed. Familiarity with the interpretation of the varied patterns seen in health and disease is essential for providing dependable laboratory support in the management of multiple myeloma.

AB  - Background: Immunochromatographic based rk39 antibody detection test became popular for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaiasis (VL) because of high sensitivity, rapidity, easy to interpret, and cost effectiveness. However, false positive result after complete cure of the patients is the major limitation with this test. The aim of the study to access the usefulness of non-invasive samples i.e. urine and saliva by rk39 test for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in comparison to serum.
   Methods: Seventy two clinically suspected VL patients were enrolled in the study among which 61 cases were confirmed as VL and 11 cases were included in the control group. Serum, urine, and saliva samples of all the cases were tested for rk39 dip stick test.
   Results: Urine and saliva both were equally sensitive as serum for the diagnosis kala-azar. In the control group, rk39 antibody test was negative in 10 cases out 11 (91%) with saliva in comparison to 4 cases with serum (36%), thereby found to be more specific.
   Conclusion: Saliva sample found to be highly reliable for the diagnosis of VL cases by rk39 test. The test with saliva sample showed less false positive result in comparison to serum sample, thereby can be used an adjunct with serum sample for the diagnosis of kala-azar in endemic areas.

AB  - We report a case of dystrophic calcification presenting as soft cystic swelling in a patient with juvenile dermatomyositis. A 15-year-old boy with lumbosacral cystic swelling, which was considered a cold abscess clinically, was evaluated for non response to antitubercular therapy. The cystic swelling had liquefied calcium with a well circumscribed calcified wall on imaging, which was subsequently excised.

AB  - Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare aggressive soft tissue sarcoma of young adults, typically arising in the deep soft tissue of lower extremities. Although cytomorphology is characteristic enough for an accurate diagnosis in typical clinical scenarios, problems arise when it occurs in older patients, atypical sites, or in primary evaluation at metastatic sites. A 48-year-old smoker presented with breathlessness and headache for 2 months. Imaging showed a heterogeneous enhancing lesion of 6 cm x 6 cm in right middle lobe of lung, smaller miliary nodules in bilateral lungs, multiple bilateral cerebral lesions, and a mass of 3 cm x 3 cm in the left thigh. Primary lung carcinoma with brain and thigh metastases was the clinical diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration smears of the lung lesion showed cohesive fragments of large cells with a prominent traversing branching capillary network and discohesion at periphery resulting in a pseudo-papillary appearance. Tumor cells had fine granular to vacuolated cytoplasm, frayed borders, and prominent nucleoli. Trucut biopsy from the same showed a tumor arranged in nests composed of large polygonal cells, immunopositive for CD10. Possibility of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was offered. Abdominal imaging was, however, normal. Core biopsy from thigh showed a similar tumor, immunonegative for epithelial markers, with cytoplasmic periodic-acid-schiff positive rhomboid crystals, clinching the final diagnosis of ASPS with lung and brain metastases. There is considerable morphological and immunohistochemical overlap between ASPS and RCC. Bare nuclei on air dried smears, binucleation, metachromatic basement membrane material are subtle pointers toward ASPS. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Human APOBEC3H (A3H) is a member of APOBEC cytidine deaminase family intensively constraining the HIV-1 replication. A3H is known to be polymorphic with different protein stability and anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro. We recently reported that A3H haplotypes composed of two functional polymorphisms, rs139292 (N15del) and rs139297 (G105R), were associated with the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in Japanese. To confirm the association of A3H and HIV-1 infection in another ethnic group, a total of 241 HIV-1-infected Indian individuals and ethnic-matched 286 healthy controls were analyzed for the A3H polymorphisms. The frequency of 15del allele was high in the HIV-1-infected subjects as compared with the controls (0.477 vs 0.402, odds ratio (OR)=1.36, P=0.014). Haplotype analysis showed that the frequencies of 15del-105R was high (0.475 vs 0.400, OR=1.36, permutation P=0.037) in the HIV-1-infected subjects, confirming the association of A3H polymorphisms with the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Studies have suggested that abnormal expression of complement regulatory proteins and cytokines contribute significantly to the path-physiology of rheumatoid arthritis. In this context, Decay accelerating factor (DAF) a complement regulatory protein is gaining increased attention. With the notion that immune effecter mechanisms are all interlinked and circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) should have a role in a systemic disease like rheumatoid arthritis, we studied the modulation and significance of PBMC-DAF and cytokines in RA. Seventy-five RA patients and 75 healthy controls were recruited. Expression of DAF and cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-17A and IL-10) in the PBMCs of patients and controls was determined. Correlations among DAF, cytokines, and disease activity were evaluated by standard statistical methods. The effect of IFN-gamma, IL-17A, and IL-10 on the expression of DAF in patients and controls was studied in vitro. Expression of PBMC-DAF declined in patients both at mRNA and surface level and correlated negatively with the disease activity. Expression of IFN-gamma also declined in patients but correlated positively with DAF and negatively with disease activity. Expression of IL-17A and IL-10 was higher in patients. The levels correlated positively with disease activity and negatively with DAF both in patients and controls. In vitro studies indicated that IFN-gamma up-regulated DAF expression in PBMCs, whereas IL-17A and IL-10 had negative effect on the same. The decline in the PBMC-DAF is a contributing factor in manifestations of RA. Cytokine environment contributes to this decline. These findings brought novel insights into the complement-cytokine axis in the path-physiology of RA.

AB  - Background: In the context of rising obesity in South Asia, it is unclear whether the "South Asian phenotype"(described as high glucose, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high triglycerides at normal ranges of body weight) continues to be disproportionately exhibited by contemporary South Asians relative to other race/ethnic groups.
   Objectives: We assessed the distinctiveness of the South Asian cardiometabolic profile by comparing the prevalence of combined high glucose, high triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (combined dysglycemia and dyslipidemia) in resident South Asians with 4 race/ethnic groups in the United States (Asians, black persons, Hispanics, and white persons) overall and by body mass index (BMI) category.
   Methods: South Asian data were from the 2010 to 2011 Center for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Study, representative of Chennai and New Delhi, India and Karachi, Pakistan. U.S. data were from the 2011 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, representative of the U.S. population. Combined dysglycemia and dyslipidemia was defined as fasting blood glucose >= 126 mg/dl and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio >4. Logistic regression was used to estimate the relative odds and 95% confidence intervals of combined dysglycemia and dyslipidemia associated with each race/ethnic group (referent, U.S. white persons). Models were estimated among adults aged 20 to 79 years by sex and BMI category and accounted for age, education, and tobacco use. Data from 8,448 resident South Asians, 274 U.S. Asians, 404 U.S. black persons, 308 U.S. Hispanics, and 703 U.S. white persons without previously known diabetes were analyzed.
   Results: In the normal body weight range of BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2), the prevalence of combined dysglycemia and dyslipidemia among men and women, respectively, was 33% and 11% in resident South Asians, 15% and 1% in U.S. Asians, 5% and 2% in U.S. black persons, 11% and 2% in U.S. Hispanics, and 8% and 2% in U.S. white persons. Compared with U.S. whites persons, South Asians were more likely to present with combined dysglycemia and dyslipidemia at all categories of BMI for men and at BMI 18.5 to 29.9 for women in adjusted models. The most pronounced difference between South Asians and U.S. white persons was observed at normal weight (adjusted odds ratio: 4.98; 95% confidence interval: 2.46 to 10.07 for men) (adjusted odds ratio: 9.09; 95% confidence interval: 2.48 to 33.29 for women).
   Conclusions: Between 8% and 15% of U.S. men and 1% and 2% of U.S. women of diverse race/ethnic backgrounds exhibited dysglycemia and dyslipidemia at levels of body weight considered "healthy," consistent with the cardiometabolic profile described as the "South Asian Phenotype." Urban South Asians, however, were 5 to 9 times more likely to exhibit dysglycemia and dyslipidemia in the "healthy" BMI range compared with any other U.S. race/ethnic group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ganglingliomas (GG) are benign, primary neoplasms most commonly noted in young adults. Intraventricular location is rare. We report a case of a multicentric intraventricular GG posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and in addition provide a detailed literature review of intraventricular GG.
   METHODS: A 15-year-old girl presented with features of raised intracranial pressure of short duration. Imaging revealed 2 separate lesions situated in the anterior and posterior third ventricle with hydrocephalus. The patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion, followed by excision of lesions in 2 stages, Both specimens revealed features of GG and the patient had an uneventful recovery. For the literature review, only pure intraventricular GG were included and intraventricular extensions of paraventricular/extraventricular GG were not considered. A brief comparison of chnicoradiologic characteristics between Intraventricular and parenchymal GG is provided,
   RESULTS: Including ours, 21 cases were identified. Male/female ratio was 1.3:1. Peak age of occurrence was the third to fourth decade. Features of increased intracranial pressure were the most common presenting features and seizures were noted in one quarter of eases. Gross total resection was achieved in 90% and recurrences and mortality were noted in 10% each.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular GG are rare tumors. Complete surgical excision achieves excellent results. The role of adjuvant therapy is controversial.

AB  - Background: In-hospital care of stroke patients can reduce the risk of death and disability. There is an emerging evidence for the routine use of care pathways (CPs) for acute stroke management. Our aim was to develop evidence-based CPs and test the hypothesis that acute stroke management by CPs is superior to that provided by conventional care. Materials and Methods: An acute stroke CP was designed in accordance with the recent American Stroke Association (ASA)/American Heart Association (AHA) stroke guidelines and the Indian Academy of Neurology (IAN) stroke management guidelines in India. A total of 162 acute stroke patients, who were managed within 72 hours of onset of their symptoms, were enrolled prospectively in two groups-the stroke care pathway (CP) arm (n = 77) and the conventional care (CC) arm (n = 85). The incidence of aspiration pneumonia, complications during the hospital stay, and death or dependency at discharge and at 90 days were among the main outcomes of our study. Results: The CP arm had a lower incidence of aspiration pneumonia (AP) in comparison with the CC arm (6.5% vs. 15.3%, risk ratio [RR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16-1.14, P = 0.062). The CP group had a decreased risk of requirement of mechanical ventilation (7.8% vs. 17.6%, odds ratio [OR] = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.14-1.07, P = 0.05). Barthel and modified Rankin Scale scores were similar in both the groups, but death at 90 days was significantly lesser in the CP arm (7.8% vs. 20%, P = 0.022). This benefit was most prominent in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) subgroup scoring 9-15 (RR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03-0.71). There were no significant differences in the other outcome measures. Conclusion: Stroke CPs reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia, the need for mechanical ventilation, and the risk of death, when assessed at a follow-up of 90 days.

AB  - Catamenial epilepsy (CE) is a commonly observed phenomenon among women with epilepsy, the management of which is both hormonal and non-hormonal. Progesterone therapy has been tried in these patients, as the possible mechanism of CE is withdrawal of progesterone and a higher oestrogen/progesterone ratio in the perimenstrual and periovulatory periods. Here, we describe a 24-year-old lady with multiple seizure types since childhood, which were refractory to adequate antiepileptic drug therapy after menarche with catamenial clustering of seizures. She went on to have several episodes of non-convulsive status epilepticus also with similar periodicity, which would abate only with midazolam infusion, without the need for ventilatory support. She was tried on acetazolamide, progesterone vaginal pessaries, and maximum tolerated doses of antiepileptic medications, but finally responded to intramuscular and oral progesterone, and has been seizure-free for more than a year.

AB  - Tension pneumocephalus is an uncommon and life-threatening neurological condition. It requires emergent and immediate attention to prevent fatal complications. Head injury is the most common cause of tension pneumocephalus. Air can gain access into the cranium either through a fracture involving paranasal sinus or the middle ear cavity or even more rarely in association with a compound depressed fracture of the skull vault. Its management includes simple twist drill and aspiration of intracranial air with or without placement of an under water seal. 100% oxygen should be administered by a non-breatheable mask which hastens the resorption of air. The authors report a series of 4 cases of post-traumatic tension pneumocephalus, highlighting its management, and review the pertinent literature.

AB  - The primary objective was to determine the association between beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene polymorphism (rs1042713, c.46A > G, p.Arg16Gly) and the response to inhaled salbutamol in North Indian children aged 5 to 15 years, with mild to moderate exacerbation of asthma.
   This cross-sectional study was done at a tertiary-care hospital in Northern India from June 2011 to May 2013. 120 children with asthma with mild to moderate exacerbation underwent spirometry at baseline and after administration of three doses of salbutamol. An increase in FEV1 a parts per thousand yen15% was considered as positive response. Blood samples from these children were analysed for ADRB2 polymorphism (p.Arg16Gly). 94 nonasthmatic adult controls were also studied to determine the prevalence of ADRB2 polymorphism.
   In asthmatic children, the frequency of AA, GG, AG genotypes were 24.2%, 24.2% and 51.7% compared to 20.2%, 20.2 % and 59.6%, respectively in the non-asthmatic adults. Salbutamol responsiveness showed no correlation with the studied ADRB2 polymorphism (p= 0.55). A trend towards greater bronchodilator responsiveness amongst AA genotype, compared to GG genotype was observed (Median change in percent predicted FEV1 14.5% and 7.5%, respectively).
   No correlation was found between salbutamol responsiveness and ADRB2 genotype in Northern Indian children with asthma with mild-to moderate exacerbation.

AB  - Background & objectives: Certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as valproic acid (VPA) are known to affect body weight, and lipid profile. However, evidences regarding effects of AEDs on the body composition are deficient. This cross-sectional study compared the body composition and lipid profile among patients with epilepsy on newer and conventional AEDs.
   Methods: The patients with epilepsy (n=109) on treatment with conventional and newer AEDs (levetiracetam, lamotrigine and clobazam) for > 6 months were enrolled. Of these, 70 were on monotherapy: levetiracetam (n=12), VPA (n=16), carbamazepine (n=20) and phenytoin (n=22) and the remaining on polytherapy. Their body composition [body fat mass, lean dry mass (LDM), total body water (TBW), intracellular water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was estimated and biochemical parameters were assessed.
   Results: Levetiracetam group had no significant difference with VPA, carbamazepine, phenytoin and control groups, except low LDM (17.8 +/- 2.4) than VPA groups (20.2 +/- 2.7, P<0.05). In comparison with control, AEDs monotherapy groups had no significant difference, except higher LDM and ECW in VPA group. Among groups based on conventional and newer AEDs, there was no significant difference in body composition parameters except for higher LDM (as % of BW) in conventional AEDs only treated group than control (P<0.01).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The alterations observed in body composition with valproic acid in contrast to other AEDs like levetiracetam, carbamazepine and phenytoin could affect treatment response in epilepsy especially in subjects with already altered body composition status like obese and thin frail patients, which needs to be established by prospective studies (CTRI/2013/05/003701).

AB  - Seminal plasma aids sperm by inhibiting premature capacitation, helping in the intracervical transport and formation of an oviductal sperm reservoir, all of which appear to be important in the fertilization process. Epitopes such as Lewis x and y are known to be present on seminal plasma glycoproteins, which can modulate the maternal immune response. It is suggested by multiple studies that seminal plasma glycoproteins play, largely undiscovered, important roles in the process of fertilization. We have devised a strategy to analyze glycopeptides from a complex, unknown mixture of protease-digested proteins. This analysis provides identification of the glycoproteins, glycosylation sites, glycan compositions, and proposed structures from the original sample. This strategy has been applied to human seminal plasma total glycoproteins. We have elucidated glycan compositions and proposed structures for 243 glycopeptides belonging to 73 Nglycosylation sites on 50 glycoproteins. The majority of the proposed glycan structures were complex type (83%) followed by high-mannose (10%) and then hybrid (7%). Most of the glycoproteins were either sialylated, fucosylated, or both. Many Lewis x/ a and y/b epitopes bearing glycans were found, suggesting immune-modulating epitopes on multiple seminal plasma glycoproteins. The study also shows that large scale N-glycosylation mapping is achievable with current techniques and the depth of the analysis is roughly proportional to the prefractionation and complexity of the sample.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the indications, outcomes and complications of Auro keratoprosthesis (a low-cost design based on type I Boston Keratoprosthesis) in the end-stage corneal disease in a preliminary study.
   Methods In this prospective interventional study, 10 eyes of 10 patients with an end-stage corneal disease underwent implantation of Auro keratoprosthesis with the mean follow-up of 14.5 +/- 2.1 months. The indications included multiple failed grafts (n=7), aphakic bullous keratopathy (n=2) and chemical injury (n=1). The additional intraoperative procedures performed were synechiolysis (n=9), cataractous lens extraction (n=2), Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation (n=1) and vitreoretinal surgery (n=1). Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered postoperatively, and patients were followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and thereafter at monthly intervals. The main outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), retention of prosthesis, complications and need for secondary surgical interventions.
   Results The most common indication for keratoprosthesis implantation was graft failure (7/10, 70%). The postoperative BCVA improved to >= 20/200 in six patients. Nine out of 10 patients had retained keratoprosthesis. The complications seen were inflammatory debris behind keratoprosthesis (n=4), retroprosthetic membrane (n=2), glaucoma (n=4), small (<2 mm) sterile stromal necrosis or erosions at the graft edge (n=3) and microbial keratitis (n=1). Explantation of the keratoprosthesis was performed in one eye due to fungal keratitis.
   Conclusions Auro keratoprosthesis, a low-cost keratoprosthesis, is a viable option in the end-stage corneal disease in this preliminary study. Multicentre studies with long-term follow-up are required to conclusively prove its safety and efficacy.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the adjuvant role of amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in cases of acute ocular Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).
   Design: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.
   Participants: Twenty-five patients (50 eyes) with acute ocular SJS who presented within 4 weeks of onset of symptoms were recruited.
   Methods: The eyes were randomized into 2 groups that underwent either AMT with medical therapy (MT; n = 25) or standard MT alone (n = 25). The patients were evaluated at presentation and during follow-up at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months. The parameters evaluated were the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Schirmer test, tear film breakup time (TBUT), conjunctival congestion, corneal haze, vascularization, conjunctivalization, and limbal stem cell involvement. Lid edema, symblepharon, ankyloblepharon, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis, and metaplastic lashes also were analyzed.
   Main Outcome Measures: Maintenance of BCVA and stable ocular surface.
   Results: At the end of 6 months, the mean BCVA was significantly better in the AMT group (0.068 +/- 0.10 logMAR units) compared with the MT group (0.522 +/- 0.52 logMAR units; P = 0.042). The mean TBUT in the AMT and MT groups was 9.92 +/- 4.1 and 6.96 +/- 4.5 seconds, respectively (P = 0.015). The mean Schirmer test results in the AMT and MT groups were 15.4 +/- 6.3 and 8.64 +/- 5.4 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). Conjunctival congestion persisted in 44% (11/25) in the MT group compared with 4% (1/25) in the AMT group (P = 0.03) at the end of the 6-month follow-up. No case in the AMT group demonstrated corneal haze, limbal stem cell deficiency, symblepharon, ankyloblepharon, or lid-related complications. Among eyes in the MT group, corneal haze occurred in 44% (11/25; P = 0.001), corneal vascularization and conjunctivalization in 24% (6/25; P = 0.03), symblepharon in 16% (4/25; P = 0.12), ankyloblepharon in 4% (1/25; P = 1.00), ectropion and entropion in 8% (2/25; P = 0.47), and trichiasis and metaplastic lashes in 24% (6/25; P = 0.03) eyes.
   Conclusions: Amniotic membrane transplantation is a useful adjunct to conventional MT in maintaining BCVA and a stable ocular surface in cases of acute ocular SJS. Furthermore, the adjunctive use of AMT also helps to prevent intermediate-term ocular cicatricial sequelae. (C) 2016 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Localization of primary tumor in insulinoma is often difficult. We evaluated the role of Ga-68-DOTA-Nal(3)-Octreotide (DOTANOC) PET/CT for localization of primary tumor in patients with clinical and biochemical suspicion of insulinoma.
   METHODS: Data of 35 patients (age: 38.4 +/- 16.5 years) who underwent Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT for clinical and biochemical suspicion of insulinoma (hypoglycemia, raised serum insulin and C-peptide levels) were retrospectively analyzed. PET/CT images were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively (SUV) by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. A definite lesion in pancreas on non contrast CT showing in-creased Ga-68-DOTANOC was taken as positive. In the absence of CT lesion focal Ga-68-DOTANOC uptake in the pancreas more than liver was taken as positive. All patients had also undergone conventional imaging (CIM) (CT/MRI/endosonography) and their reports were retrieved for comparison. Histopathology and/or imaging/clinical/biochemical follow up (minimum 6 months) was used as reference standard.
   RESULTS: The mean serum insulin levels was 51.6 +/- 54 mu tIU/mL and C-peptide level was 6.9 +/- 7.3 ng/mL. Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT was interpreted as positive in 11 patients (31.5%) and negative in 24 (68.5%). PET/CT demonstrated total 16 pancreatic lesions in 11 patients. In two patients it also showed both liver and lymph nodal metastases. Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT was true positive in 8, true negative in 1, false positive in 3 and false negative in 23 patients. Per patient based sensitivity of PET/CT was 25.8% (95% CI: 11.8-44.6), specificity was 25% (95% CI: 0.6-80.5) and accuracy was 25.7%. The mean SUV max of pancreatic lesions was 13.8 +/- 11.1. On comparison no significant difference was seen between CIM and PET/CT on patient based (P=1.00) or lesion based comparison (P=0.790).
   CONCLUSION: 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT has limited utility for localizing the primary tumor in patients with clinical and biochemical suspicion of insulinoma. However, it might be useful for differentiating benign and malignant insulinoma. Further prospective comparative studies are warranted.

AB  - Purpose Sleep disturbances such as insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, restless legs syndrome, habitual snoring, and excessive daytime sleepiness are frequent during pregnancy, and these have been linked to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.
   Methods A prospective observational study was performed in high-risk Indian pregnant women. We used modified Berlin questionnaire (MBQ), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group 2011 criteria, and Epworth sleepiness scale to diagnose various sleep disorders, such as symptomatic OSA, poor sleep quality and insomnia, RLS, and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively, in successive trimesters of pregnancy. Outcome variables of interest were development of gestational hypertension (GH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and cesarean delivery (CS); the Apgar scores; and low birth weight (LBW). The relationship between sleep disorders and outcomes was explored using logistic regression analysis. Results Outcome data were obtained in 209 deliveries. As compared to nonsnorers, women who reported snoring once, twice, and thrice or more had odds ratios for developing GH-4.0 (95 % CI 1.3-11.9), 1.5 (95 % CI 0.5-4.5), and 2.9 (95 % CI 1.0-8.2) and for undergoing CS-5.3 (95 % CI 1.7-16.3), 4.9 (95 % CI 1.8-13.1), and 5.1 (95 % CI 1.9-14.9), respectively. Pregnant women who were persistently positive on MBQ had increased odds for GH and CS.
   Conclusions Snoring and high-risk MBQ in pregnant women are strong risk factors for GH and CS. In view of the significant morbidity and health care costs, simple screening of pregnant women with questionnaires such as MBQ may have clinical utility.

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Approximately three-quarters of people with diabetes live in low-and middle-income countries, and these countries are projected to experience the greatest increase in diabetes burden.
   Objectives: We sought to compare the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes in 3 urban and periurban regions: the Southern Cone of Latin America and Peru, South Asia, and South Africa. In addition, we examined the relationship between diabetes and pre-diabetes with known cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.
   Methods: A total of 26,680 participants (mean age, 47.7 +/- 14.0 years; 45.9% male) were enrolled in 4 sites (Southern Cone of Latin America = 7,524; Peru = 3,601; South Asia = 11,907; South Africa = 1,099). Detailed demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data were collected. Diabetes and pre-diabetes were defined as a fasting plasma glucose >= 126 mg/dl and 100 to 125 mg/dl, respectively. Diabetes control was defined as fasting plasma glucose <130 mg/dl.
   Results: The prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes was 14.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.2% to 14.8%) and 17.8% (95% CI: 17.0% to 18.7%) in the Southern Cone of Latin America, 9.8% (95% CI: 8.8% to 10.9%) and 17.1% (95% CI: 15.9% to 18.5%) in Peru, 19.0% (95% CI: 18.4% to 19.8%) and 24.0% (95% CI: 23.2% to 24.7%) in South Asia, and 13.8% (95% CI: 11.9% to 16.0%) and 9.9% (95% CI: 8.3% to 11.8%) in South Africa. The age-and sex-specific prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes for all countries increased with age (p < 0.001). In the Southern Cone of Latin America, Peru, and South Africa the prevalence of pre-diabetes rose sharply at 35 to 44 years. In South Asia, the sharpest rise in pre-diabetes prevalence occurred younger at 25 to 34 years. The prevalence of diabetes rose sharply at 45 to 54 years in the Southern Cone of Latin America, Peru, and South Africa, and at 35 to 44 years in South Asia. Diabetes and pre-diabetes prevalence increased with body mass index. South Asians had the highest prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes for any body mass index and normal-weight South Asians had a higher prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes than overweight and obese individuals from other regions. Across all regions, only 79.8% of persons with diabetes were aware of their diagnosis, of these only 78.2% were receiving treatment, and only 36.6% were able to attain glycemic control.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes is alarmingly high among urban and periurban populations in Latin America, South Asia, and South Africa. Even more alarming is the propensity for South Asians to develop diabetes and pre-diabetes at a younger age and lower body mass index compared with individuals from other low and middle income countries. It is concerning that one-fifth of all people with diabetes were unaware of their diagnosis and that only two-thirds of those under treatment were able to attain glycemic control. Health systems and policy makers must make concerted efforts to improve diabetes prevention, detection, and control to prevent long-term consequences.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to study the effect of graded doses of citrinin (CIT) on apoptosis and oxidative stress in male Wistar rats till F-1 generation. The animals were divided into four groups comprising 25 males and 25 females each, that is, group I: 1ppm CIT; group II: 3ppm CIT; group III: 5ppm CIT; and group IV was kept as a control. The male and female animals of all the groups were kept separately and were fed basal rations containing the above-mentioned concentrations of CIT for 10weeks. After 10weeks, male and female animals of respective groups were kept for mating (one male/two females). After getting 10 pregnant females, the males were killed. These 10 pregnant females were allowed to give birth to young ones (F-1 generation) naturally which were fed CIT in the above-mentioned doses till the age of 6weeks and then were killed. Apoptosis was analysed in kidneys, liver and testes by DNA ladder pattern, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling assay and Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Besides, tissue oxidative stress was also analysed. It was concluded in the present study that CIT induces its toxic effects till F-1 generation, and apoptosis and oxidative stress both play a very important role in toxicity. The effect of CIT was observed in a dose-dependent manner. However, in kidneys, both the mechanisms (apoptosis and oxidative stress) play their role in inflicting renal damage, while in liver only reactive oxygen species play a major role. Finally, the CIT toxicity did not lead to apoptosis and oxidative stress in male gonads till F-1 generation.

AB  - Background & objectives: Intraosseous (IO) access is an alternative to difficult intravenous (iv) access during emergency clinical situations. Existing IO solutions are expensive, require power supply and trained manpower; limiting their use in resource constrained settings. To address these limitations, a novel IO device has been developed. The objectives of this study were to evaluate functionality and safety of this device in adult human cadavers.
   Methods: The ability of the IO device to penetrate the proximal and/or distal tibia was evaluated in three adult cadavers. Subjective parameters of loss of resistance, stable needle hold, easy needle withdrawal and any damage to the device were evaluated during the study. The insertion time was the objective parameter measured. Four sets of radiographs per insertion confirmed the position of the needle and identified complications.
   Results: A single physician performed 12 IO access procedures using the same device. Penetration of proximal and/or distal tibia was achieved in all instances. It was successful in the first attempt in eight (66.7%) and during second attempt in the remaining. The mean time to insertion was 4.1 +/- 3.1 sec. Appropriate insertion of needle in the intra-medullary space of bone was confirmed with radiological examination in 10 (83.3%) insertions. In two occasions after penetrating the cortical layer of bone, the device overshot the intra-medullary space, as detected by radiological examination. Device got bent during insertion in one instance. There was no evidence of needle breakage or bone fracture. The needle could be withdrawn effortlessly in all instances.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The novel IO device could successfully penetrate the adult cadaver bones in most cases. Further studies are needed to confirm these results on a large sample.

AB  - Dengue virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a causative agent for dengue infection, which manifests with symptoms ranging from mild fever to fatal dengue shock syndrome. The presence of four serotypes, against which immune cross-protection is short-lived and serotype cross-reactive antibodies that might enhance infection, pose a challenge to further investigate the role of virus and immune response in pathogenesis. We evaluated the viral and immunological factors that correlate with severe dengue disease in a cohort of pediatric dengue patients in New Delhi. Severe dengue disease was observed in both primary and secondary infections. Viral load had no association with disease severity but high viral load correlated with prolonged thrombocytopenia and delayed recovery. Severe dengue cases had low Th1 cytokines and a concurrent increase in the inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. A transient increase in CD14(+)CD16(+) intermediate monocytes was observed early in infection. Sorting of monocytes from dengue patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that it is the CD14+ cells, but not the CD16+ or the T or B cells, that were infected with dengue virus and were major producers of IL-10. Using the Boruta algorithm, reduced interferon-alpha levels and enhanced aforementioned pro-inflammatory cytokines were identified as some of the distinctive markers of severe dengue. Furthermore, the reduction in the levels of IL-8 and IL-10 were identified as the most significant markers of recovery from severe disease. Our results provide further insights into the immune response of children to primary and secondary dengue infection and help us to understand the complex interplay between the intrinsic factors in dengue pathogenesis.

AB  - Traumatic brachial plexus injuries are devastating injuries commonly affecting the young population and leading to significant socioeconomic losses to the society. The results of brachial plexus surgery have been severely disappointing in the past. However, several technological advancements and newer surgical techniques, especially the advent of distal nerve transfers over recent years, have led to a paradigm shift in the outcome of patients with these injuries. The best time window for surgery is the first 3 months after injury, and the next best time is the next 3 months. The timing is a crucial factor as the neuromuscular junctions degenerate in 20-24 months. The presence of spontaneous fibrillations in a muscle on electromyography is an indication of denervated yet vital muscle. The restoration of elbow flexion is a priority followed closely by restoration of shoulder abduction and stabilization. The various surgical strategies in brachial plexus injuries should be directed toward accomplishing this goal. The global avulsion injuries have a poor outcome because of very limited source of donors in such types of injury whereas the partial injuries have a remarkable outcome in a majority of cases. This article presents the reader with the guidelines and management algorithms of repair strategy and various surgical approaches utilized in the surgical treatment of brachial plexus injuries.

AB  - Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a well-differentiated form of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with better prognosis. Differences in molecular pathogenesis between the 2 have not been well-characterized. We conducted this study to evaluate immunohistochemical expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins p53, pRb, p16, and p27 in SCC and VC, compare the expression in these 2 neoplasms, and assess if these markers have any diagnostic or prognostic value. Sixty cases of SCC with and without lymph node metastasis and 31 cases of VC were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis for p53, pRb, p16, and p27 was performed and the results were analyzed. SCC was most frequent in tongue (52%), whereas VC in buccal mucosa (81%). Mean age of SCC patients was significantly lower than in VC. Majority of SCCs were in stage III and IV (63%), whereas VCs were in stage I and II (84%). p53 immunopositivity was more frequent in SCC (65%) than in VC (23%) (P <= 0.001). VC had lower p53 as compared with well-differentiated SCC and SCC without lymph node metastasis. No significant difference was seen in pRb, p16, and p27 expression. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year for SCC was 57% whereas it was 80% for VC (P = 0.02). DFS and overall survival of SCC correlated with nodal status and stage; cell-cycle-associated protein expression had no association with DFS. To conclude, p53 immunoexpression differs in SCC and VC, suggesting different pathogenesis, and it may have some utility as an adjunct to morphology to differentiate between the 2. Expression of cell-cycle-associated proteins does not influence survival in SCC.

AB  - Background & objectives: Standard of care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in India is peginterferon and ribavirin (RBV). The response to treatment in real life stetting is unclear. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the demographic profile and assess the virological response and predictors of response in CHC patients.
   Methods: Consecutive patients with CHC were included in this study. Detailed clinical history, risk factors, and predictive factors of response were noted. Patients were treated with peginterferon cab (1.5 mu g/kg/wk) and RBV (12 mg/kg/day) for 6 to 18 months based on response.
   Results: A total of 211 patients were included in the analysis, mean age 40.6 +/- 12.3 yr, 144 (68%) were males and 71 (34%) had compensated cirrhosis. Commonest risk factor for acquiring CHC was previous transfusion and surgery (51%). Genotype 3 (72%) was most common followed by genotype 1 (23%). Overall sustained virologic response (SVR) was 64 per cent [95% CI 57.1%-70.4%]. The SVR was 66.5 per cent [95% C158.34-73.89%] for genotype 3 and 61.2 per cent [95% CI 46.23 to 74.80%] for genotype 1. Non-cirrhotics had better SVR rates compared to cirrhotics (76 vs 41%, P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, BMI >= 23 kg/m(2), HOMA-IR >= 2, compliance (<= 80%), and fibrosis >2 were predictors of low SVR.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Genotype 3 was the commonest HCV genotype. The commonest source of infection was previous transfusion and surgery. SVR rates for genotypes 3 were better than genotype 1 patients. Predictors of non-response were high BMI, insulin resistance, significant fibrosis and inadequate compliance.

AB  - Background: A definition of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is needed for diagnosis and distinguishing CP from other disorders. Previous definitions focused on morphology. Advances in epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology, modeling and other disciplines provide new insights into pathogenesis of CP, and allow CP to be better defined.
   Methods: Expert physician-scientists from the United States, India, Europe and Japan reviewed medical and scientific literature and clinical experiences. Competing views and approaches were debated until a new consensus definition was reached.
   Results: CP has been defined as 'a continuing inflammatory disease of the pancreas, characterized by irreversible morphological change, and typically causing pain and/or permanent loss of function'. Focusing on abnormal morphology makes early diagnosis challenging and excludes inflammation without fibrosis, atrophy, endocrine and exocrine dysfunction, pain syndromes and metaplasia. A new mechanistic definition is proposed-'Chronic pancreatitis is a pathologic fibro-inflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress.' In addition, "Common features of established and advanced CP include pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, duct distortion and strictures, calcifications, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction and dysplasia." This definition recognizes the complex nature of CP, separates risk factors from disease activity markers and disease endpoints, and allows for a rational approach to early diagnosis, classification and prognosis.
   Conclusions: Initial agreement on a mechanistic definition of CP has been reached. This definition should be debated in rebuttals and endorsements, among experts and pancreatic societies until international consensus is reached. Copyright (C) 2016, lAP and EPC.

AB  - Objective: Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) is generally considered a better option than open donor nephrectomy (ODN) as it is associated with better cosmesis, less post-operative pain and faster recovery. Mini-incision donor nephrectomy (MDN) has proven to be an effective and less invasive modification of classic ODN. Our aim was to compare the peri-operative outcomes and quality of life of donors following laparoscopic and mini-incision ODN.
   Methods: One hundred patients, underwent donor nephrectomy using laparoscopic approach (n = 50) or open mini-incision approach (n = 50) over a period of 18 months. Data were entered into a prospective database and analyzed retrospectively.
   Results: The mean operative (skin to skin) time for MDN, 53.9 min (range, 40-75 min), was significantly shorter than the 93.7 min (range, 75-140 min) for LDN. The laparoscopic donors had a longer hospital stay, warm ischemia time and higher operative and post-operative cost. There was no significant difference in the pain scores, graft function, or quality of life between the two groups.
   Conclusions: MDN compares well with the laparoscopic approach in terms of post-operative pain, graft function and quality of life of donors. Significantly less operative time along with the reduced cost makes it a better option in our predominantly lower BMI patient population.

AB  - A 35-year-old man presented with a history of headache, vomiting, and visual blurring of 6 months' duration. Two months after the onset of symptoms, he developed behavioral changes in the form of irrelevant talking. He was then seen at another center where the clinical possibility of tuberculous meningitis was considered. His CSF findings at this time were 4 cells, all lymphocytes, protein 221 mg/dL (2.21 g/L), and glucose 59 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). A noncontrast CT head showed hydrocephalus (figure, B). He was treated with antitubercular treatment (ATT) and oral dexamethasone. He improved transiently but worsened again and presented to us with increasing headaches, recurrent vomiting, deterioration in vision, alteration in behavior, psychosis, and bilateral lower limb weakness of 10 days' duration.

AB  - Abnormal level of Serum Uric Acid (SUA) is an important marker and risk factor for complex diseases including Type 2 Diabetes. Since genetic determinant of uric acid in Indians is totally unexplored, we tried to identify common variants associated with SUA in Indians using Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Association of five known variants in SLC2A9 and SLC22A11 genes with SUA level in 4,834 normoglycemics (1,109 in discovery and 3,725 in validation phase) was revealed with different effect size in Indians compared to other major ethnic population of the world. Combined analysis of 1,077 T2DM subjects (772 in discovery and 305 in validation phase) and normoglycemics revealed additional GWAS signal in ABCG2 gene. Differences in effect sizes of ABCG2 and SLC2A9 gene variants were observed between normoglycemics and T2DM patients. We identified two novel variants near long non-coding RNA genes AL356739.1 and AC064865.1 with nearly genome wide significance level. Meta-analysis and in silico replication in 11,745 individuals from AUSTWIN consortium improved association for rs12206002 in AL356739.1 gene to sub-genome wide association level. Our results extends association of SLC2A9, SLC22A11 and ABCG2 genes with SUA level in Indians and enrich the assemblages of evidence for SUA level and T2DM interrelationship.

AB  - Background
   Newer molecular diagnostics have brought paradigm shift in early diagnosis of tuberculosis [TB]. WHO recommended use of GeneXpert MTB/RIF [Xpert] for Extra-pulmonary [EP] TB; critics have since questioned its efficiency.
   Methods
   The present study was designed to assess the performance of GeneXpert in 761 extra-pulmonary and 384 pulmonary specimens from patients clinically suspected of TB and compare with Phenotypic, Genotypic and Composite reference standards [CRS].
   Results
   Comparison of GeneXpert results to CRS, demonstrated sensitivity of 100% and 90.68%, specificity of 100% and 99.62% for pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples. On comparison with culture, sensitivity for Rifampicin [Rif] resistance detection was 87.5% and 81.82% respectively, while specificity was 100% for both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. On comparison to sequencing of rpoB gene [Rif resistance determining region, RRDR], sensitivity was respectively 93.33% and 90% while specificity was 100% in both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. GeneXpert assay missed 533CCG mutation in one sputum and dual mutation [517 & 519] in one pus sample, detected by sequencing. Sequencing picked dual mutation [529, 530] in a sputum sample sensitive to Rif, demonstrating, not all RRDR mutations lead to resistance.
   Conclusions
   Current study reports observations in a patient care setting in a high burden region, from a large collection of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples and puts to rest questions regarding sensitivity, specificity, detection of infrequent mutations and mutations responsible for low-level Rif resistance by GeneXpert. Improvements in the assay could offer further improvement in sensitivity of detection in different patient samples; nevertheless it may be difficult to improve sensitivity of Rif resistance detection if only one gene is targeted. Assay specificity was high both for TB detection and Rif resistance detection. Despite a few misses, the assay offers major boost to early diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB, in difficult to diagnose pauci-bacillary TB.

AB  - Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are being found to be increasingly useful in viral infections. In hepatitis B infection, antibodies are proven to be useful for passive prophylaxis. The preS1 region (21-47a.a.) of HBV contains the viral hepatocyte-binding domain crucial for its attachment and infection of hepatocytes. Antibodies against this region are neutralizing and are best suited for immune-based neutralization of HBV, especially in view of their not recognizing decoy particles. Anti-preS1 (21-47a.a.) antibodies are present in serum of spontaneously recovered individuals. We generated a phage-displayed scFv library using circulating lymphocytes from these individuals and selected four preS1-peptide specific scFvs with markedly distinct sequences from this library. All the antibodies recognized the blood-derived and recombinant preS1 containing antigens. Each scFv showed a discrete binding signature, interacting with different amino acids within the preS1-peptide region. Ability to prevent binding of the preS1 protein (N-terminus 60a.a.) to HepG2 cells stably expressing hNTCP (HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells), the HBV receptor on human hepatocytes was taken as a surrogate marker for neutralizing capacity. These antibodies inhibited preS1-hepatocyte interaction individually and even better in combination. Such a combination of potentially neutralizing recombinant antibodies with defined specificities could be used for preventing/managing HBV infections, including those by possible escape mutants.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial functions are secondarily disturbed in bulbospinal muscular atrophy (BSMA). This review focuses on the relation between BSMA and the effect of the expanded polyglutamine (poly-Q) androgen receptor (AR) on mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial functions in bulbospinal muscular atrophy (SBMA) are affected on the molecular, clinical, and therapeutic level. On the molecular level there is down-regulation of various nuclear-DNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins by mutant androgen receptor (mAR), colocalization of the mAR with various mitochondrial proteins, association of mAR aggregates with mitochondria resulting in abnormal distribution of mitochondria, mtDNA depletion or multiple mtDNA deletions, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, increase in reactive oxidative species, and activation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway. On the clinical level various mitochondrial disorders mimic SBMA, and on the therapeutic level pioglitazone expresses PPAR-, cyclosporine-A restores mitochondrial membrane potentials, coenzyme-Q and idebenone reduce oxidative stress, and geldanamycin up-regulates protective mitochondrial heat shock proteins. In conclusion, in BSMA mitochondrial dysfunction results from various interactions of elongated poly-Q AR with mitochondria, mitochondrial proteins, nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, causing oxidative stress, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, or activation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway. Additionally, mitochondrial disease may mimic BSMA and therapeutic approaches may depend on modifications of mitochondrial pathways.

AB  - Objective
   Urbanization is an important determinant of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. To determine location-based differences in CVD risk factors in India we performed studies among women in rural, urban-poor and urban middle-class locations.
   Methods
   Population-based cross-sectional studies in rural, urban-poor, and urban-middle class women (35-70y) were performed at multiple sites. We evaluated 6853 women (rural 2616, 5 sites; urban-poor 2008, 4 sites; urban middle-class 2229, 11 sites) for socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric and biochemical risk factors. Descriptive statistics are reported.
   Results
   Mean levels of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), systolic BP, fasting glucose and cholesterol in rural, urban-poor and urban-middle class women showed significantly increasing trends (ANOVA(trend), p < 0.001). Age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes and risk factors among rural, urban-poor and urban-middle class women, respectively was, diabetes (2.2, 9.3, 17.7%), overweight BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) (22.5, 45.6, 57.4%), waist >80 cm (28.3, 63.4, 61.9%), waist >90 cm (8.4, 31.4, 38.2%), waist hip ratio (WHR) >0.8 (60.4, 90.7, 88.5), WHR>0.9 (13.0, 44.3, 56.1%), hypertension (31.6, 48.2, 59.0%) and hypercholesterolemia (13.5, 27.7, 37.4%) (Mantel Haenszel X-2 p(trend) < 0.01). Inverse trend was observed for tobacco use (41.6, 19.6, 9.4%). There was significant association of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with overweight and obesity (adjusted R-2 0.89-0.99).
   Conclusions
   There are significant location based differences in cardiometabolic risk factors in India. The urban-middle class women have the highest risk compared to urban-poor and rural.

AB  - We analyzed the AZFc region of the Y-chromosome for complete (b2/b4) and distinct partial deletions (gr/gr, b1/b3, b2/b3) in 822 infertile and 225 proven fertile men. We observed complete AZFc deletions in 0.97% and partial deletions in 6.20% of the cases. Among partial deletions, the frequency of gr/gr deletions was the highest (5.84%). The comparison of partial deletion data between cases and controls suggested a significant association of the gr/gr deletions with infertility (P = 0.0004); however, the other partial deletions did not correlate with infertility. In cohort analysis, men with gr/gr deletions had a relatively poor sperm count (54.20 +/- 57.45 million/ml) in comparison to those without deletions (72.49 +/- 60.06), though the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.071). Meta-analysis also suggested that gr/gr deletions are significantly associated with male infertility risk (OR = 1.821, 95% CI = 1.39-2.37, p = 0.000). We also performed trial sequential analyses that strengthened the evidence for an overall significant association of gr/gr deletions with the risk of male infertility. Another meta-analysis suggested a significant association of the gr/gr deletions with low sperm count. In conclusion, the gr/gr deletions show a strong correlation with male infertility risk and low sperm count, particularly in the Caucasian populations.

AB  - Purpose: Glaucoma is a common disease often identified by high intraocular pressure, characteristic optic neuropathy and vision loss. It is currently a leading cause of blindness worldwide with no known cure. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma worldwide. It is a multifactorial disease where both genetic as well as environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis.
   Results: Till date, at least 29 genetic loci have been found to be linked to POAG. However, the role of only three underlying genes Myocilin (MYOC), Optineurin (OPTN) and WD repeat Domain 36, (WDR36) is well established. Also, the role of Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1), Glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and Neurotrophin (NTF4) has been fairly identified. Association studies have found that 66 loci with 76 genes associated to POAG till date, but even more studies are required to confirm their role in the disease pathology. Gene mutations in various populations have been identified by genetic studies to establish that about 5% of POAG is currently attributed to single-gene or Mendelian forms of glaucoma and others caused by the combined effects of many genetic and environmental risk factors, each of which do not act alone to cause glaucoma.
   Conclusion: Although the clinical progression of the disease is well defined, the molecular events responsible for glaucoma are poorly understood and thus the etiology of POAG remains a mystery. Despite strong genetic influence in POAG pathogenesis, only a small part of the disease can be explained in terms of genetic aberration. This review is an overview and update on the latest research and progress of genetic studies associated with POAG. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methods: Paired samples, including serum and colonic biopsies, were taken from 33 study subjects (CD, ITB and controls), and total RNA was extracted. Human whole genome gene expression microarray analysis was performed using the Illumina HumanWG-6 BeadChip Kit with six total RNA samples of the three groups in duplicates. Real-time PCR for FOXP3 mRNA expression was analyzed in serum samples and colonic biopsy samples (4-CD, 5-ITB, 4-controls).
   Results: In CD and ITB there was 1.5-fold upregulation of 92 and 382 genes and 1.5-fold downregulation of 91 and 256 genes, respectively. Peroxisome proliferators via the PPAR gamma pathway were most significantly downregulated (P < 0.005) in CD. Additionally, the IL4/5/6 signaling pathways and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway were identified as significantly differentially regulated (P < 0.005) at > 2-fold change. In ITB, the complement activation pathway, specifically the classical pathway, was the most significantly upregulated. FOXP3 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in colonic biopsies obtained from ITB patients as compared with CD cases (4.70 +/- 2.21 vs 1.48 +/- 0.31, P = 0.016).
   Conclusions: FOXP3 mRNA expression in colonic mucosa could be a discriminatory marker between ITB and CD. Upregulation of the complement activation pathway in ITB suggests that pathogenetic mechanisms for ITB are similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis. In CD, downregulation of PPAR gamma was seen in colonic tissue, suggesting that restoration of PPAR gamma-dependent anti-microbial barrier function may be a therapeutic target.

AB  - With the advent of newer techniques for dose reduction coupled with the development of more sensitive detectors, the radiation doses in radiological medical investigation are decreasing. Nevertheless, keeping the tenet in mind that all radiation doses could entail risk, there is a need to develop more sensitive dosimeters capable of measuring low doses. This paper gives the account of the development of a new and sensitive phosphor CaSO4:Dy,Mn and its characterization. The standard production procedure based on the recrystallization method was used to prepare CaSO4:Dy,Mn. The Thermoluminescence (TL) studies were carried out by exposing it with gamma radiation (Cs-137) from 10 mu Gy to 100 Gy. The theoretical studies to determine the number of peaks and kinetic parameters related to the TL glow peaks in CaSO4:Dy,Mn was performed using the Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD) method. Experiments were performed to determine optimum concentration of the dopants Dysprosium (Dy) and Mangnese (Mn) in the host CaSO4 so that maximum sensitivity of the phosphor may be achieved. The optimum dopant concentration turned out to be 0.1 mol%. As there were two dopants Dy and Mn their relative ratio were varied in steps of 0.025 keeping the concentration of total dopant (Dy and Mn) 0.1 mol% always. The maximum TL intensity was seen in the CaSO4:Dy(0.025),Mn(0.075) combination. The TL sensitivity of this phosphor was found to be about 2 and 1.8 times higher than that of popular phosphor CaSO4:Dy and LiF:Mg,Cu,P (TLD-700H) respectively. This new phosphor CaSO4:Dy,Mn showed fading of 11% which is similar to that of the standard phosphor CaSO4:Dy. The paper concludes that the new, highly sensitive TL phosphor CaSO4:Dy,Mn has shown higher sensitivity and hence the potential to replace commonly used CaSO4:Dy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background. With current modalities, cure rates of retinoblastoma are high and hence the number of survivors is increasing. However, data on quality of life (QOL) are minimal. Procedure. We analyzed QOL in 122 retinoblastoma survivors using the PedsQL (TM) 4.0 generic core scale. The self-reported questionnaire was filled by children of more than 5 years of age who had completed treatment for more than 12 months. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions on physical, social, emotional, and school domains on a scale from 0 to 4. This was converted to a scale from 0 to 100, where higher values represented better QOL. The QOL was compared with 50 siblings. Factors predicting the QOL were assessed. Results. The median age of retinoblastoma survivors was 98 months (range 60-247) and 68% were males. Overall QOL was significantly poorer in retinoblastoma survivors as compared with the controls. The emotional health domain of QOL was significantly affected. Difficulties in maintaining friendships and competing were reported in the social health domain. The school health domain showed significantly higher absenteeism. However, the physical health domain, including household work, exercise, and self-care, was similar in both the groups. Lower age at diagnosis (<= 18 months) predicted better QOL (P = 0.05), whereas age at assessment, sex, IRSS stage, and previous surgery and radiotherapy were not predictive of poor QOL. Conclusions. We found a significantly poorer QOL in retinoblastoma survivors with the psychosocial health domain being more affected than the physical domain. Age less than 18 months at diagnosis predicted better QOL. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study was conducted at a tertiary care center in northern India to evaluate the validity of non-invasive transcutaneous hemoglobin estimation in healthy and sick children in comparison to hemoglobin estimation by traditional lab method. A method comparison study was conducted including 150 subjects. Enrolled patients included 80 neonates with average age of 3.9 +/- 2.1 days, and 70 children with average age of 5.8 +/- 2 years. Each population (newborn and children) comprised of almost equal numbers of healthy and critically ill patients with shock. Hemoglobin (Hb) was estimated on enrolment by transcutaneous spectrophotometry (SpHb) and traditional automated lab analyzer (Hb-Lab). Difference between Hb levels by the two methods (called bias) was measured and analyzed using Bland-Altman method. Out of 148 data pairs analyzed, bias between SpHb and Hb-Lab was -1.52 +/- 1.91 g/dl (mean +/- SD). SpHb showed excellent positive correlation with Hb-Lab (r = 0.94 (p < 0.001)) and good visual agreement on Bland-Altman plots. Bias was higher in sick subjects with shock as compared to healthy ones in both neonatal and pediatric population (-2.31 +/- 2.21 g/dl versus -0.77 +/- 1.2 g/dl, respectively).
   Conclusions: SpHb showed good accuracy and correlated well with lab estimated Hb levels in healthy children. However, in children with impaired peripheral perfusion, its diagnostic accuracy was inadequate to justify routine use for quantification of severity of anemia and making transfusion decisions solely on non-invasive estimation of hemoglobin.

AB  - Multicentric osteolysis nodulosis and arthropathy (MONA) is an infrequently described autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by progressive osteolysis and arthropathy. Inactivating mutations in MMP2, encoding matrix metalloproteinase-2, are known to cause this disorder. Fifteen families with mutations in MMP2 have been reported in literature. In this study we screened thirteen individuals from eleven families for MMP2 mutations and identified eight mutations (five novel and three known variants). We characterize the clinical, radiographic and molecular findings in all individuals with molecularly proven MONA from the present cohort and previous reports, and provide a comprehensive review of the MMP2 related disorders.

AB  - Objective To study the clinical presentation and survival among Indian children with retinoblastoma (RB) and to determine factors predictive of poor outcome.
   Methods A retrospective review of children newly diagnosed with RB at a tertiary referral centre was undertaken. Demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were studied.
   Results A total of 600 patients (unilateral 67.6%, bilateral 32.4%) was studied. 61% was boys. The median age at presentation was 29months (18 months vs 36months in bilateral and unilateral cases, respectively, p<0.001). leukocoria was most common (83%), followed by proptosis (17%). Tumours were intraocular in 72.3% and extraocular in 27.7% cases. In the intraocular group, 78% were advanced Group D or E disease. Metastasis to the central nervous system was noted in 15.7% of extraocular cases. A statistically significant difference was seen between intraocular and extraocular groups in the median age (24 months vs 37.5months, p<0.001) and median lag period (2.5 months vs 7months, p<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 83%, 73% and 65% at 1 year, 2 years and 5years, respectively. On univariate analysis, age >2years (p=0.002), lag period >6months (p=0.004) and extraocular stage (p<0.001) were associated with poor outcome. On multivariate analysis, extraocular invasion was predictive of low survival (HR 5.04, p<0.001).
   Conclusions Delayed presentation is a matter of concern. Improving awareness about the early signs and creating facilities for diagnosing and treating RB at the primary and secondary levels of healthcare are required to reduce mortality and morbidity, and lead to improved outcomes that are comparable with the developed nations.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the role of fluorine 18 (F-18)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET-CT) in evaluating various parameters in patients with surgical scar site recurrence in cervical carcinoma.
   Methods: Data of all patients with cervical cancer (n = 329) who underwent PET-CT at our institute between 2005 and 2013 was reviewed. Of these 329 patients, 132 patients who were surgically treated and underwent restaging/follow-up PET-CT were included in the present study for final analysis. Tumor recurrence at the abdominal surgical scar site was looked for. Abnormal uptakes suggestive of active disease at other sites were also noted. Maximum standardized uptake value was measured for all the lesions. Patients with scar site recurrence were taken as cases (n = 6), whereas the remaining patients served as controls (n = 126). Comparison with conventional imaging modalities was made wherever available. Histopathological examination was always sought for.
   Results: The incidence of scar site recurrence after surgery was found to be 4.5% (6/117). A total of 56 of 132 patients had recurrent disease, including 6 patientswith scar site recurrence. All of the patients with scar site recurrence also had recurrent disease at other sites (local, nodal, or distant). Conventional imaging modalities were available in 4 of these 6 patients and detected scar site recurrence in 3 of those 4 patients. In patientswith scar site recurrence, the mean +/- SD time to scar site recurrence was 14.0 +/- 10.9 months (median, 10 months; range, 7-36 months). Significant difference was seen between cases and control for International Federation of Genecology and Oncology stage (P = 0.001) and nodal recurrence (P = 0.007). Additionally, age, nodal recurrence, distant recurrence, and scar site recurrence were significantly associated with death.
   Conclusions: Scar site recurrence carries a poor prognosis, and the incidence is much higher than previously known when PET-CT is used as a modality for its detection.

AB  - Background: There are few data on heart failure (HF) patients from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America.
   Methods: INTER-CHF is a prospective study that enrolled HF patients in 108 centers in 16 countries from 2012 to 2014. Consecutive ambulatory or hospitalized adult patients with HF were enrolled. Baseline data were recorded on sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, HF etiology and treatments. Age-and sex-adjusted results are reported.
   Results: We recruited 5813 HF patients: mean(SE) age = 59(0.2) years, 39% female, 65% outpatients, 31% from rural areas, 26% with HF with preserved ejection fraction, with 1294 from Africa, 2661 from Asia, 1000 from the Middle-East, and 858 from South America. Participants from Africa-closely followed by Asians-were younger, had lower literacy levels, and were less likely to have health or medication insurance or be on beta-blockers compared with participants from other regions, but were most likely to be in NYHA class IV. Participants from South America were older, had higher insurance and literacy levels, and, along with Middle Eastern participants, were more likely to be on beta-blockers, but had the lowest proportion in NYHA IV. Ischemic heart disease was the most common HF etiology in all regions except Africa where hypertensive heart disease was most common.
   Conclusions: INTER-CHF describes significant regional variability in socioeconomic and clinical factors, etiologies and treatments in HF patients from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America. Opportunities exist for improvement in health/medication insurance rates and proportions of patients on beta blockers, particularly in Africa and Asia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background Hematoma expansion is a major predictor of morbidity and mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Both baseline hematoma volume and the CT-angiogram (CTA) spot sign predict hematoma expansion. Because the CTA spot sign may represent foci of active hemorrhage, we hypothesized that patients with smaller baseline hematoma volumes are less likely to be spot sign positive, and therefore less likely to expand.
   Aim We sought to validate our prior finding that small hematomas are unlikely to expand, and to determine the relationship between baseline hematoma volume, spot sign status, and risk of hematoma expansion.
   Methods Data were from the prospective PREDICT ICH study. Patients presenting within 6h of symptom onset with completed baseline CT, CTA, and follow-up CT were included. Baseline hematoma volume was categorized a priori (<3mL, 3-10mL, 10-20mL, >20mL). The primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (6mL, 12.5mL or 33%) and secondary outcomes were early neurological worsening, good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-3), and mortality at 90 days.
   Results Among 315 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, baseline hematoma volume category predicted absolute hematoma expansion (p<0.001), spot sign prevalence (p<0.001), early neurologic worsening (p=0.002), clinical outcome (p<0.001), and mortality (p<0.001). Very small hematomas (<3mL) were unlikely to be spot positive (7.7%), unlikely to expand (2.6%), and were associated with a 73% chance of good clinical outcome. Spot sign appeared to be most predictive of expansion in the 3-10mL baseline hematoma volume category.
   Conclusion Very small hematomas are unlikely to expand and have a low spot sign prevalence. Hemostatic therapy trials may be best targeted at hemorrhages >3mL in volume.

AB  - Background: Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) commonly presents with limb weakness and occasional cranial nerve, respiratory or autonomic involvement. Isolated or predominant bilateral finger drop as presenting feature has never been reported in the pediatric age group.
   Case: A 9 year old boy presented with deformity of both hands for 7 days and leg pain with difficulty in getting up from floor for 3 days. On examination he had bilateral clawing with subtle hip flexor weakness and hyporeflexia. His nerve conduction study revealed motor axonal neuropathy. His serum lead levels and autoimmune markers were within normal limits. His cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed albuminocytological dissociation. He was diagnosed as. GBS and was given intravenous immunoglobulin. He improved completely over next 8 weeks.
   Conclusions: GBS is one of the commonest causes of acquired neuropathy in the tropics. In resource limited setting, where electrophysiological facilities may not be available, identification of finger drop sign may help in correct management.

AB  - Background: Survival of patients with locally advanced carcinoma cervix (LACC) using the current standard of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) has reached a plateau over the last two decades. Loco-regional failure in first two years of treatment completion and distant metastasis in the subsequent years has put the survival curves at a halt. Strategies of induction and adjuvant chemotherapy have yielded little as has any advancement in techniques of delivery of radiation therapy. This article aims at discussing the current existing literature as well as promising novel strategies to enhance radiotherapeutic outcomes in carcinoma of the uterine cervix.
   Methods: The review of English literature included phase I-III trials evaluating either a novel agent, novel application/modifications of an existing treatment regimen or an innovative treatment technique. The studies have been divided in to subsections with summary of most important findings at the end of each section.
   Results: Despite CCRT being the 'gold standard' treatment, several issues like optimum drug combination, schedule of drug delivery, combination with molecular targeted agents etc. remain undefined. Taxane, topoisomerase and gemcitabine based regimen needs to be further explored and compared with cisplatin based CCRT regimen. Several approaches like local delivery of cytotoxic agents, use of nano-medicine with CCRT are appearing on horizon with promises for the future. Therapies need to be designed based on the human papillomavirus titers of the patients and incorporation of radiosensitizers as an effective way of palliation with short course of radiotherapy may further enhance the radiotherapeutic outcomes.
   Conclusions: The results of the studies with novel agents and treatment techniques appear promising. Further research in this arena including incorporation of cost-effectiveness analysis and quality of life issues in future trial designs are warranted.

AB  - Objective: Carcinoma of external auditory canal (EAC) is a rare disease with variable management strategies and prognosis. We aimed to analyze treatment modalities, prognostic factors and survival outcomes in patients of squamous cell carcinoma of EAC treated at our institution.
   Methods: Forty-three patients of squamous cell carcinoma of EAC were analyzed for clinical presentation, stage, surgical procedures and radiotherapy (RT) modalities employed. Steil and McCormick staging system was used for staging of the patients. Progression free survival (PFS) was estimated by the use of Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Log rank test was used to assess the impact of prognostic variables on PFS. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox hazard regression model. p value of <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical analysis.
   Results: Median age was 56 years (range: 12-84 years). Male to female ratio was 31:12. Stage was T1, T2 and T3 in 2, 17 and 18 patients respectively. Sixteen patients underwent surgery. Thirty-six patients received RT (14 received definitive RT, 11 had post-operative RT and 11 had RT with palliative intent). Eight patients (16%) received chemotherapy (5 received concurrent with RT, 2 had adjuvant and I had neo-adjuvant chemotherapy). Nine patients (of 11 patients) achieved a complete response (CR) and 2 achieved a partial response (PR) after surgery plus post-operative RT. Nine patients and 5 patients respectively achieved CR and PR after definitive RT (with or without concurrent chemotherapy). Of the 11 patients who received palliative RT, 2 had very good objective response (>50%) and 7 patients had PR to palliative RT. After a median follow-up of 16 months, median PFS for the entire cohort was 14 months. Two-year PFS rates were 85.7%, 46.9% and 0% for patients treated with surgery and post-operative RT, definitive RT and palliative RT respectively. On univariate analysis, higher stage (p = 0.05) and facial nerve palsy at presentation (p = 0.0008) were significant predictors of inferior PFS.
   Conclusion: Patients with carcinoma of EAC present mostly in advanced stage at our centre. Combined higher stage (T3) and facial nerve palsy at presentation portend poorer outcome. Combined modality treatment with surgery and radiotherapy should be advocated and palliative RT remains a reasonable treatment option in patients with advanced incurable disease.

AB  - A 24-year-old man developed cyclic esotropia following vitreoretinal surgery for retinal detachment in his right eye. He underwent right eye medial rectus recession (6 mm) and lateral rectus resection (8.5 mm) under local anesthesia for the correction of cyclic esotropia. Following surgery, he developed a unique pattern of cyclic strabismus that involved alternation between esotropia and exotropia every 24 hours. To treat this condition, the patient underwent lateral rectus recession (8.5 mm) and medial rectus posterior fixation of medial rectus in the right eye. Following surgery, he was corrected for heterotropia on both esotropic and exotropic days.

AB  - A "congenital retinal macrovessel" (CRM) is an aberrant retinal vessel (frequently a vein) that traverses the central macula and supplies or drains both above and below the horizontal raphe. It is an uncommon entity that is usually disclosed on routine examination and may rarely cause a compromised visual acuity. We describe the case of an adolescent girl who underwent vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage and was found to have a CRM with vascular abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first report of vitreous hemorrhage secondary to a CRM.

AB  - Introduction: IKZFI deletions have been reported with variable frequency in B-ALL. This study was carried out to find the prevalence and profile of IKZFI deletions and their correlation in B-ALL.
   Methods: The untreated B-ALL cases were prospectively analyzed for IKZFI deletions over a period of eleven months using multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The IKZFI deletions were classified into three functional groups dominant negative, haploinsufficiency and others. The response to induction chemotherapy was correlated with the IKZFI deletion status.
   Results: The median age of 101 cases was 7 years (1-67) with 82 pediatric (<18 years) cases. Fifteen cases were positive for BCR-ABL. The IKZFI deletions were detected in 29 (28.7%) cases; 53% BCR-ABL positive, 24% BCR-ABL negative, 47% adult and 24% pediatric cases. Out of the 29 deletions, 19 (66%) were haploinsufficiency, 8 (28%) were dominant negative and 2 others. The IKZFI deleted cases had higher induction failure rates compared to the cases without IKZFI deletions.
   Conclusions: The IKZFI deletions were detected in 28.7% B-ALL patients. These were more common in BCR-ABL positive and adult B-ALL compared to the BCR-ABL negative and pediatric cases, respectively. The haploinsufficiency was commoner than dominant negative IKZFI deletions. IKZFI deletions correlated with higher induction failure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To estimate agreement in diurnal variations of intraocular pressure (IOP) by Tono-Pen (TP) and Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) in glaucoma patients on topical anti-glaucoma medication(s). IOP was measured at every 3 h from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. in 50 eyes of glaucoma patients on topical medication(s). Diurnal fluctuation of IOP by each method was calculated as maximum-minimum IOP in a day. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured by ultrasonic pachymeter. There was good correlation between TP and GAT at all times during a day, minimum, and maximum IOPs during a day (Correlation coefficient, 0.706 at 7 a.m., 0.624 at 10 a.m., 0.682 at 1 p.m., 0.814 at 4 p.m., 0.652 at 7 p.m., 0.572 at 10 p.m., 0.668 minimum IOP, 0.689 maximum IOP). Mean IOPs by TP were always higher than GAT at all times during a day. Bland-Altman plots suggested a close relationship between the two sets of readings, and that this relationship was consistent at different times in a day, in maximum IOPs, minimum IOPs and also in fluctuation of IOPs. Linear regression analysis between the differences of diurnal fluctuation (diurnal fluctuation by GAT-diurnal fluctuation by TP) and CCT showed strong association (R (2) = 0.857, p < 0.001). The mean change in difference of diurnal fluctuation (GAT-TP) for a 10-micron increase in CCT was 0.69 mmHg. TP can be considered a reliable alternative to GAT in glaucoma patients for knowing the diurnal control of IOP; however these two methods should not be used interchangeably. Difference of diurnal fluctuation between two methods is dependent on CCT.

AB  - The chemistry of phthalazine derivatives has been of increasing interest since many of these compounds have found many chemotherapeutic applications. So this study aims to synthesize a library of phthalazine derivatives and to investigate their anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities. Sixteen new phthalazinone derivatives (2a-p) were synthesized and tested for their in vitro antiproliferative and in vivo anti-inflammatory activities. All the synthesized compounds were identified and characterized by IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and MS. Two compounds, 2b and 2i, showed significant anti-inflammatory activity comparable with that of the standard drug etoricoxib in the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model at 3 and 5h, respectively. Three compounds (2h, 2j, and 2g) showed moderate sensitivity toward the renal cancer cell line UO-31.

AB  - BackgroundDespite widespread uses of ketamine, the clinical studies determining its effect on pulmonary blood flow in children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) are lacking. Furthermore, the quantification of pulmonary blood flow is not possible in these patients, because pulmonary artery catheter is contraindicated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in pulmonary blood flow by intra-operative transesophageal echocardiography after ketamine or etomidate administration in children with TOF.
   MethodsEleven children each in the two clinical variants of TOF (group Amoderate to severe cyanosis; group Bmild to minimal cyanosis) undergoing intracardiac repair were prospectively studied after endotracheal intubation. A single bolus dose of ketamine (2mg/kg) and etomidate (0.3mg/kg) was administered in a random order after 15minute interval. Hemodynamic, arterial blood gas, and echocardiographic measurements were obtained at 7 consecutive times (T) points (baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 15minutes after drug administration).
   ResultsKetamine produced a significant reduction in VTI-T (velocity time integrals total of left upper pulmonary vein), RVOT-PG (right ventricular outflow tract peak gradient), and MG (mean gradient) in group A while those in group B had a significant increase in VTI-T, RVOT-PG, and RVOT-MG at time (T1, T2, T4, and T6; P=0.00). This divergent behavior, however, was not observed with etomidate.
   ConclusionEtomidate does not change pulmonary blood flow. However, ketamine produces divergent effects; it increases pulmonary blood flow in children with minimal cyanosis and decreases pulmonary blood flow in children with moderate to severe cyanosis.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the accumulation of clonal population of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). A variety of angiogenic factors, proteases, reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines induce the formation of an extensive and suitable BM microenvironment. Previous studies have established the importance of angiogenic factors, inflammatory molecules and oxidative stress in MM but their interplay and effect on each other are not being taken together.
   Circulatory levels of VEGF, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), IL-6 and TNF-alpha along with the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were investigated in 112 subjects including 62 MM patients and 50 healthy controls. Inter-stage analysis was done to evaluate the association of these molecules with the severity of disease. Pearson correlation was determined to find interrelationship, if any, between these molecules.
   We have observed elevated levels of VEGF, Ang-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha and decreased activity of SOD, GPx in MM patients in comparison to controls. All these molecules also showed a trend with the severity of disease. We have found strong association between these factors upon their correlation and regression analysis.
   This study is a step toward understanding the indepth contribution of angiogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress together in making BM microenvironment suitable for growth, survival and proliferation of malignant plasma cells in MM.

AB  - This study aims at documenting the changes in ventricular tissue velocities, longitudinal strain and electromechanical coupling during the first month of life. During the neonatal period, when the ventricular myocardium is not yet fully maturated, the heart is subjected to significant hemodynamic changes. We studied the ventricular performance of 16 healthy neonates at three time points over the first month of life: on days 2 (IQR [2;2]), 13 [12;14] and 27 [25;29]. We found that systolic and diastolic tissue velocities increased significantly in both left and right ventricle (by 1.2-1.7 times, p < 0.001). Congruently, we found that peak systolic longitudinal strain of the right and left ventricles increased significantly. However, no significant changes in longitudinal strain rate were observed. Finally, QS-intervals shortened during the neonatal period: being measured at 12 points throughout the left ventricle, time to peak systolic velocity decreased on average to 89 % in the second and to 80 % in the fourth week of life (22.3 +/- A 0.2 vs. 19.8 +/- A 0.3 vs. 17.8 +/- A 0.5 ms, r = -0.564, p < 0.001). When comparing opposing walls of the left ventricle, no dyssynchrony in left ventricular contraction was found. In addition to increasing systolic and diastolic tissue velocities during the first month of life, the time to peak systolic contraction shortens in the neonatal heart, which may reflect an increasing efficiency of the excitation-contraction coupling in the maturing myocardium. While there appears to be no dyssynchrony in ventricular contraction, these findings may extend our appreciation of the immature neonatal heart and certain disease states.

TI  - Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery in Phakic Intraocular Lens With Cataract
T2  - JOURNAL OF REFRACTIVE SURGERY
KW  - IMPLANTATION
AB  - PURPOSE: To report two cases of cataract with phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) in situ that underwent femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) along with PIOL explantation.
   METHODS: Case reports.
   RESULTS: The first case had an implantable collamer lens (ICL) in situ. A well-centered, circular femtosecond laser capsulotomy was achieved. Incomplete nucleotomy was noted due to the entrapment of cavitation bubbles beneath the ICL. Postoperative visual acuity was 20/20. The second case had a rigid iris-claw PIOL in situ. Successful femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy and nuclear fragmentation were achieved. The PIOL was disenclavated temporally and displaced inferiorly followed by completion of phacoemulsification. The PIOL was explanted at the end of surgery by enlarging the temporal incision. Postoperative uncorrected visual acuity was 20/32.
   CONCLUSIONS: The femtosecond laser can be used to create a capsulotomy and nuclear fragmentation through both anterior and posterior chamber PIOLs.

AB  - Background & objectives: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by slowly progressive airflow limitaion, chronic lung inflammation and associated systemic manifestations. The objective of this preliminary study was to investigate the levels of high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs CRP) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as markers of systemic inflammation and assessment of systemic vascular reactivity that may play an important role in development of cardiovascular disease in COPD patients.
   Methods: Systemic vascular reactivity was assessed non-invasively by measuring peripheral pulse waveform changes during reactive hyperemia (RH) in 16 COPD patients and 14 controls by photoplethysmography technique (PPG). Parameters measured were pulse wave amplitude (PWA), slope and pulse transit time (PTT). Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and hs CRP were measured as markers of inflammation.
   Results: PWA during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd minutes post release of occlusion were significantly higher than the baseline means in controls, whereas in the patient group there was no significant change in the PWA during any of the observed time periods following release of occlusion, in comparison to the baseline means. Similar results were observed in slope values for patients and controls. Maximum percentage change in PWA during RH with reference to baseline was significantly lower in patients as compared to controls (26.78 +/- 20.19 vs 57.20 +/- 19.80%, P<0.001). Maximum percentage change in slope during RH with reference to baseline was significantly lower in patients as compared to controls (19.77 +/- 10.73 vs 39.25 +/- 13.49%, P<0.001). A vascular tone response as represented by PTT was also impaired in the 3rd minute of RH as compared to baseline mean values in COPD patients only.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed raised hs CRP levels and impaired systemic vascular reactivity in COPD patients. Whether these may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in COPD patients need to be confirmed in future studies with large sample size and appropriate study design.

AB  - Background & objectives: Skin is an established tissue source for cell based therapy. The hair follicle has been introduced later as a tissue source for cell based therapy. The ease of tissue harvest and multipotent nature of the resident stem cells in skin and hair follicle has promoted basic and clinical research in this area. This study was conducted to evaluate skin stem cells (SSCs) and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) as candidate cells appropriate for neuronal and melanocyte lineage differentiation.
   Methods: In this study, SSCs and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) were expanded in vitro by explant culture method and were compared in terms of proliferative potential and stemness; differentiation potential into melanocytes and neuronal lineage.
   Results: SSCs were found to be more proliferative in comparison to HFSCs, however, telomerase activity was more in HFSCs in comparison to SSCs. Capacity to differentiate into two lineages of ectoderm origin (neuronal and melanocyte) was found to be different. HFSCs cells showed more propensities towards melanocyte lineage, whereas SSCs were more inclined towards neuronal lineage.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The study showed that SSCs had differential advantage over the HFSCs for neuronal cell differentiation, whereas, the HFSCs were better source for melanocytic differentiation.

AB  - Background: Anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine and its genetic variations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of various human diseases including stroke. Objective: The aim of this present case-control study was to determine the association between IL-10 -1082G/A (rs1800896) gene polymorphism and risk of stroke in the North Indian population. Methods: Genotyping was carried out by using SNaPshot method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) for 250 ischemic stroke (IS) patients, 250 age-and sex-matched IS free controls, 100 intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients, and 100 age-and sex-matched ICH free controls. IS was classified using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification. Conditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for multiple demographic and risk factor variables was used to calculate the strength of association between IL-10 (-1082G/A) polymorphism and risk of stroke. Results: Conditional logistic regression analysis showed an independent association between IL-10 -1082G/A and risk of IS under a dominant model (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-4.27, P = .003) and an allelic model (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.71-3.63, P < .001). An independent association between IL-10 -1082G/A, under the dominant model (OR = 6.8, 95% CI 2.2-20.7, P < .001) and the allelic model (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.8-6.3, P < .001), and the risk of ICH was also observed. Conclusion: Our results suggest that IL-10 -1082G/A gene polymorphism is an independent risk factor for the risk of IS and ICH in the North Indian population. Our findings indicate that IL-10 -1082G/A polymorphism may be used as a genetic marker for identifying individuals at increased risk of developing stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transorbital penetrating intracranial injuries, though rare, can have serious consequences. Intracranial penetration can be present even if orbital trauma is trivial.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report an unusual case of transorbital penetrating intracranial injury with umbrella wire, sustained while opening an umbrella, leading to internal carotid artery injury and thrombosis. The patient sustained only ipsilateral third nerve palsy that completely recovered during followup.
   CONCLUSION: Trivial orbital injuries can be associated with significant intracranial injury in a neurologically intact patient. This case emphasizes the potentially injury-prone opening mechanism of conventional umbrellas. A high index of suspicion is important while evaluating such patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. To report the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium surveillance data from 40 hospitals (20 cities) in India 2004-2013. methods. Surveillance using US National Healthcare Safety Network's criteria and definitions, and International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium methodology.
   RESULTS. We collected data from 236,700 ICU patients for 970,713 bed-days.
   Pooled device-associated healthcare-associated infection rates for adult and pediatric ICUs were 5.1 central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)/1,000 central line-days, 9.4 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAPs)/1,000 mechanical ventilator-days, and 2.1 catheter-associated urinary tract infections/1,000 urinary catheter-days.
   In neonatal ICUs (NICUs) pooled rates were 36.2 CLABSIs/1,000 central line-days and 1.9 VAPs/1,000 mechanical ventilator-days.
   Extra length of stay in adult and pediatric ICUs was 9.5 for CLABSI, 9.1 for VAP, and 10.0 for catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Extra length of stay in NICUs was 14.7 for CLABSI and 38.7 for VAP.
   Crude extra mortality was 16.3% for CLABSI, 22.7% for VAP, and 6.6% for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adult and pediatric ICUs, and 1.2% for CLABSI and 8.3% for VAP in NICUs.
   Pooled device use ratios were 0.21 for mechanical ventilator, 0.39 for central line, and 0.53 for urinary catheter in adult and pediatric ICUs; and 0.07 for mechanical ventilator and 0.06 for central line in NICUs.
   CONCLUSIONS. Despite a lower device use ratio in our ICUs, our device-associated healthcare-associated infection rates are higher than National Healthcare Safety Network, but lower than International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium Report.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are common worldwide, causing nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication.
   Evidence: A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describe the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence.
   Process: Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus.
   Results: This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts.
   Conclusion: Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of haemoglobin colour strip (HCS-HLL), a digital haemoglobinometer (TrueHb) and a non-invasive device (TouchHb) for screening patients with anaemia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
KW  - SCALE
KW  - VALIDATION
AB  - Aim Estimation of haemoglobin (Hb) remains a challenge, particularly in outreach settings. There is a need to have a simple and cost-effective device to detect anaemia. Three devices (haemoglobin colour scale (HCS)-HLL (Hindustan Lifecare Limited), TrueHb V.1.1, TouchHb Alpha 1.1-non-invasive) have been developed in India recently. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of these tests (index) for the screening of anaemia against haematological autoanalyzer (reference).
   Methods The study was conducted in four medical colleges of India. All consenting adult patients (>18 years of age) undergoing routine investigations were included. Each patient underwent the reference test and at least one index test. Outcome assessors for the index tests were blinded to the results of the reference test. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated using cut-offs proposed by WHO.
   Results A total of 5244 patients underwent the reference test while HCS-HLL, TrueHb and TouchHb tests were conducted on 2745, 2331 and 2874 patients respectively. The positive likelihood ratio of HCS-HLL using capillary blood (1.2), venous blood (1.7) and TouchHb (1.5) was lower than TrueHb capillary (3.7; 95% CI 3.3 to 4.2) and venous blood (5.7; 95% CI 4.9 to 6.6). TrueHb had a sensitivity of 74.4% (95% CI 71.9% to 76.8%) for venous and 82.0% (95% CI 79.8% to 89.2%) for capillary samples. The specificity was high (>75.0%). The area under receiver operating characteristic was close to 80.0%. Consistent results were seen for detection of severe anaemia.
   Conclusions The digital method (TrueHb) emerged as a better diagnostic method for screening anaemia. Its effectiveness should be established in outreach settings before further recommendation.

AB  - Background & objectives: Childhood obesity is a known precursor to obesity and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. However, the magnitude of the problem among children and adolescents in India is unclear due to paucity of well-conducted nationwide studies and lack of uniformity in the cut-points used to define childhood overweight and obesity. Hence an attempt was made to review the data on trends in childhood overweight and obesity reported from India during 1981 to 2013.
   Methods: Literature search was done in various scientific public domains from the last three decades using key words such as childhood and adolescent obesity, overweight, prevalence, trends, etc. Additional studies were also identified through cross-references and websites of official agencies.
   Results: Prevalence data from 52 studies conducted in 16 of the 28 States in India were included in analysis. The median value for the combined prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity showed that it was higher in north, compared to south India. The pooled data after 2010 estimated a combined prevalence of 19.3 per cent of childhood overweight and obesity which was a significant increase from the earlier prevalence of 16.3 per cent reported in 2001-2005.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our review shows that overweight and obesity rates in children and adolescents are increasing not just among the higher socio-economic groups but also in the lower income groups where underweight still remains a major concern.

AB  - Background and Purpose-Perihematomal edema volume may be related to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume at baseline and, consequently, with hematoma expansion. However, the relationship between perihematomal edema and hematoma expansion has not been well established. We aimed to investigate the relationship among baseline perihematomal edema, the computed tomographic angiography spot sign, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcome in patients with acute ICH.
   Methods-Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT) was a prospective observational cohort study of ICH patients presenting within 6 hours from onset. Patients underwent computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography scans at baseline and 24-hour computed tomography scan. A post hoc analysis of absolute perihematomal edema and relative perihematomal edema (absolute perihematomal edema divided by ICH) volumes was performed on baseline computed tomography scans (n=353). Primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (>6 mL or >33%). Secondary outcomes were early neurological deterioration, 90-day mortality, and poor outcome.
   Results-Absolute perihematomal edema volume was higher in spot sign patients (24.5 [11.5-41.8] versus 12.6 [6.9-22] mL; P<0.001), but it was strongly correlated with ICH volume (rho=0.905; P<0.001). Patients who experienced significant hematoma expansion had higher absolute perihematomal edema volume (18.4 [10-34.6] versus 11.8 [6.5-22] mL; P<0.001) but similar relative perihematomal edema volume (1.09 [0.89-1.37] versus 1.12 [0.88-1.54]; P=0.400). Absolute perihematomal edema volume and poorer outcomes were higher by tertiles of ICH volume, and perihematomal edema volume did not independently predict significant hematoma expansion.
   Conclusions-Perihematomal edema volume is greater at baseline in the presence of a spot sign. However, it is strongly correlated with ICH volume and does not independently predict hematoma expansion.

AB  - Objective
   The study assessed the role of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in evaluating the prognostic value of metabolic response for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Patients and methods
   Thirty patients with locally advanced NSCLC were enrolled in this prospective study and randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms. Arm A (n=15) received two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy [paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC5)] and external beam radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions/6 weeks). Arm B (n=15) received the same neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by external beam radiotherapy (48 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks) with concomitant cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) weekly. Patients underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT at baseline and after 6 weeks of completion of intended treatment. Pretreatment and post-treatment maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were noted. Patients with a reduction of SUVmax more than 50% were considered to be metabolic responders and those with a reduction 50% or less as nonresponders. Median follow-up was 18.98 months.
   Results
   Twenty-one patients completed the intended treatment. The median pretreatment and post-treatment SUVmax values were 14 and 6.4 for arm A and 15.3 and 3.5 for arm B, respectively. Significant decrease in SUVmax was observed in both arms. Metabolic response in arm A and arm B was 50 and 64%, respectively. The median PFS and OS of the responders were 22.31 and 24.73 months and those for nonresponders were 7.83 and 8.26 months, respectively. No significant difference in OS and PFS was observed between responders and nonresponders in the two arms.
   Conclusion
   PET/CT distinguishes responders from nonresponders early after completion of chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, but did not provide any prognostic significance.

AB  - Study Objective: To study the effect of antitubercular treatment (ATT) on the laparoscopic abdominopelvic and fallopian tube findings in female genital tuberculosis (FGBT).
   Design: Prospective cohort (Canadian Task Force classification II2).
   Setting: Tertiary referral center in northern India.
   Patients: Fifty women with infertility and diagnosed with FGTB on laparoscopy, histopathology findings, or endometrial sampling (acid-fast bacilli culture, granuloma on histopathology, positive polymerase chain reaction).
   Interventions: Diagnostic laparoscopy in all women diagnosed with FGTB before and after a 6-month course of ATT (2 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid). All procedures were performed by the same surgeon between June 2012 and May 2014.
   Measurements and Main Results: The mean patient age was 28.7 years, mean parity was 0.9, arid mean body mass index was 23.6 kg/m(2). Infertility was seen in all 50 women (66% primary infertility, 34% secondary infertility), with a mean duration of 6.06 years. Abnormal laparoscopic findings of FGTB included tubercles in the pelvic peritoneum, fallopian tube, and ovary in 27 women (54%) before ATT and in only 1 (2.04%) woman after ATT (p < .001). Caseous nodules and encysted ascites were seen in 4 women (8%) before ATT, and in no women after ATT (p < .001); however, there was no change from before ATT to after ATT in the rate of pelvic adhesions (42% vs 42.5%) and periheliatic adhesions (56% vs 58%). Laparoscopic findings in fallopian tubes included hydrosalpinx (32%), pyosalpinx (4%), beaded tubes (12%), nonvisualization of tube (20%), and tubal blockage on the right side (56%), left side (50%), and both sides (38%) before ATT. Hydrosalpinx, beaded tubes, and nonvisualized tube were seen in 33.4%, 4.1%, and 20.8% cases, respectively, after ATT; however, free spill increased to 52% on the right side and 50% on left side after ATT.
   Conclusion: ATT improves laparoscopic findings in FGTB with infertility. However, advanced fibrotic lesions (eg, pelvic and perihepatic adhesions, bilateral blocked tubes) do not improve with ATT. (C) 2016 AAGL. All rights reserved.

AB  - Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty is being performed in increasing number of cases each year. An adequate scleral rim on all sides is mandatory for the donor cornea to be mounted on the artificial anterior chamber for microkeratome-assisted dissection. Occasionally, the scleral rim may however be inadequate. The primary cause of inadequate scleral rim is poorly trained technicians in in-situ excision technique. Hence, we devised a novel technique for performing successful microkeratome-assisted dissection in donor corneas with inadequate scleral rim. A surrogate scleral rim was obtained from the donor tissue not fit for optical keratoplasty. It was then glued to the optical grade donor cornea that had an inadequate scleral rim either focally or circumferentially. The combination was then used for a successful microkeratome-assisted dissection followed by endothelial keratoplasty.

AB  - Purpose: Based on copy number alterations and transcriptional profiles, the posterior fossa tumors (medulloblastoma (MB), ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma) have been Classified into various subgroups. The study design was aimed to identify and catalog genome-wide copy number alterations and differential gene expression in different types of North-Indian pediatric posterior fossa tumors and matched control tissue through Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) Based and Human Transcriptome Array.
   Experimental design: MIP based OncoScan Array and Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 were used to molecularly-categorize histopathologically and immunohistochemically proven tumor samples on the basis of copy number variations and altered gene expression patterns and/or alternative splicing events.
   Results: Based on molecular, histopathological/immunohistochemical and age-dependent factors MB was subgrouped into group-3 MB, Wnt and SHH; ependymoma into balanced, numerical and structural/anaplastic; and pilocytic astrocytoma was stratified age-dependently. Compared with the vermis tissue of MB, the vermis tissue of ependymoma showed higher levels of gain and losses compared with their counter tumor parts implicating metastasis within the confined region. Group-3 MB and anaplastic ependymoma represented highest differentially expressed genes both at gene and exon levels in the CN altered regions compared with other subgroups of MB and ependymoma respectively.
   Conclusion: This multiomics approach based molecular characterization of posterior fossa tumors together with clinical and histopathological factors may help us in the area of personalized medicine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pediatric vertebral hemangiomas (VH) are exceedingly rare benign and highly vascular tumours of the spine. There are no guidelines available for management of these patients in literature. Purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of intraoperative ethanol embolization, surgical decompression, and instrumented fusion in pediatric symptomatic VH with single-level involvement.
   Surgery consisted of intraoperative bilateral pedicular absolute alcohol injection and laminectomy at the level of pathology followed by a short-/long-segment instrumented fusion using pedicle screws and rod. Seven patients (mean age 14 +/- A 2.4 years, range 10-17 years, five females and two males) (age < 18 years) who were treated using this technique at our institute since March 2008 to December 2013 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Demographical, clinical, radiological, operative details, and postoperative events were retrieved from hospital records. During follow-up visits, clinical status and imaging were recorded. Outcome assessed with clinical and neurological outcome score of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale.
   Duration of symptoms ranged from 3 to 60 months (mean, 14.7 +/- A 20.4 months). Clinical features include myelopathy with motor and sensory involvement in all (five were paraplegic), back pain in two patients, and bladder involvement in two patients. The preoperative American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) were B in five patients and C and D in one patient each. All had pan vertebral body VH with severe cord compression in the thoracic region on imaging study. Mean duration of surgery was 248.6 +/- A 60 minutes (range 195-310 min) and blood loss was 535 ml (range 200-1500 ml). Immediate embolization was achieved in all patients, which allowed laminectomy and soft tissue hemangioma removal relatively easy. Post surgery, at mean follow-up of 45.3 (+/- 23.2) months (range 1-78 months), all patients showed improvement in power (sphincter improvement in two patients). ASIA were E in six patients and D in one patient at the last follow-up.
   The present study is the largest series of pediatric symptomatic VH. This procedure is a safe, efficient method to treat symptomatic pediatric VH with severe cord compression. It seems to serve the purpose of providing embolization, cord decompression, rigid fusion at the same sitting without adding new morbidity, and preventing excessive blood loss.

AB  - Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is an important clinical problem. Aprepitant is a relatively new agent for this condition which may be superior to other treatment. A systematic review was performed after searching a number of medical databases for controlled trials comparing aprepitant with conventional antiemetics published up to 25 April 2015 using the following keywords: `Aprepitant for PONV', `Aprepitant versus 5-HT3 antagonists' and `NK-1 versus 5-HT3 for PONV'. The primary outcome for the pooled analysis was efficacy of aprepitant in preventing vomiting on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 2. 172 potentially relevant papers were identified of which 23 had suitable data. For the primary outcome, 14 papers had relevant data. On POD1, 227/2341 patients (9.7%) patients randomised to aprepitant had a vomiting episode compared with 496/2267 (21.9%) controls. On POD2, the rate of vomiting among patients receiving aprepitant was 6.8% compared with 12.8% for controls. The OR for vomiting compared with controls was 0.48 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.67) on POD1 and 0.54 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.72) on POD2. Aprepitant also demonstrated a better profile with a lower need for rescue antiemetic and a higher complete response. Efficacy for vomiting prevention was demonstrated for 40 mg, 80 mg and 125 mg without major adverse effects. For vomiting comparison there was significant unexplainable heterogeneity (67.9% and 71.5% for POD1 and POD2, respectively). We conclude that (1) aprepitant reduces the incidence of vomiting on both POD1 and POD2, but there is an unexplained heterogeneity which lowers the strength of the evidence; (2) complete freedom from PONV on POD1 is highest for aprepitant with minimum need for rescue; and (3) oral aprepitant (80 mg) provides an effective and safe sustained antivomiting effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Box trainers are ideal simulators, given they are inexpensive, accessible, and use appropriate fidelity.
   OBJECTIVE: The development and validation of an opensource, partial task simulator that teaches the fundamental skills necessary for endonasal skull-base neuro-endoscopic surgery.
   METHODS: We defined the Neuro-Endo-Trainer (NET) SkullBase-Task-GraspPickPlace with an activity area by analyzing the computed tomography scans of 15 adult patients with sellar suprasellar parasellar tumors. Four groups of participants (Group E, n = 4: expert neuroendoscopists; Group N, n = 19: novice neurosurgeons; Group R, n = 11: neurosurgery residents with multiple iterations; and Group T, n = 27: neurosurgery residents with single iteration) performed grasp, pick, and place tasks using NET and were graded on task completion time and skills assessment scale score.
   RESULTS: Group E had lower task completion times and greater skills assessment scale scores than both Group N and R (P <= 0.03, 0.001). The performance of Groups N and R was found to be equivalent; in self-assessing neuroendoscopic skill, the participants in these groups were found to have equally low pretraining scores (4/10) with significant improvement shown after NET simulation (6, 7 respectively). Angled scopes resulted in decreased scores with tilted plates compared with straight plates (30 degrees P <= 0.04, 45 degrees P <= 0.001). With tilted plates, decreased scores were observed when we compared the 0 degrees with 45 degrees endoscope (right, P <= 0.008; left, P <= 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: The NET, a face and construct valid open-source partial task neuroendoscopic trainer, was designed. Presimulation novice neurosurgeons and neurosurgical residents were described as having insufficient skills and preparation to practice neuro-endoscopy. Plate tilt and endoscope angle were shown to be important factors in participant performance. The NET was found to be a useful partial-task trainer for skill building in neuroendoscopy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the outcome after the Fontan operation in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis (ccTGA-VSD-PS).
   METHODS: Patient- and procedure-related variables were analysed in 23 patients with ccTGA-VSD-PS operated between April 2003 and April 2015.
   RESULTS: The mean age was 14.07 +/- 6.38 years (range 4-23, median 11 years), with 82% patients being male (19/23). Dextrocardia was present in 52% (12/23) of patients and left superior vena cava was present in 26% (6/23) of patients. Most patients underwent extracardiac Fontan (n = 18), whereas in 5 patients lateral tunnel Fontan was performed. All patients received polytetrafluoroethylene grafts of size 18-22 mm for extracardiac Fontan. In 8 patients, conduits were fenestrated to reduce the intraconduit pressure. The mean hospital stay was 15.7 +/- 11.24 days (5-60, median 14 days). The most common cause for prolonged hospital stay was pleural effusion in 5 patients (21.7%). One 7-year old patient developed conduit thrombosis, intracranial bleed, seizures and died. The mean follow-up was 46.4.4 +/- 32.2 months (range 8-142, median 42 months) and was available for 21 patients (91.3%). There was 1 mid-term non-cardiac death after 3 years of operation. Of the total, 85.7% (18/21) patients in follow-up are in NYHA class I, whereas 3 patients are in class II. The actuarial event-free survival rate was 81.8 +/- 13.2% at 10 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: In ccTGA-VSD-PS patients with non-routable VSD and in those with difficult options for biventricular repair, the Fontan approach provides satisfactory mid-term palliation.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the role of temperature and adjunctive dehydration in better long-term preservation of human corneas when preserved and stored in glycerol.
   Methods Different preservation temperatures and effects of adding silica gel in glycerol-preserved corneal tissues were evaluated. Human corneal tissues not suitable for optical keratoplasty initially preserved in McCarey-Kaufman medium were transferred to glycerol and stored at four different temperatures for 3 months as follows: tissues in anhydrous glycerol with and without silica gel at -80 degrees C, -20 degrees C, 4 degrees C and at room temperature (RT). Parameters evaluated included microbial sterility, thickness (Digimatic micrometer), transparency (slit lamp examination, UV-Vis spectrophotometer), mechanical strength (Instron 5848 Microtester), tissue integrity (H&E staining), antigenicity (immunohistochemistry) and ultrastructure of collagen (transmission electron microscopy, TEM).
   Results Microbial test after 3 months of glycerol preservation confirmed sterility of the tissues. The thickness increased in corneas preserved at RT with and without silica gel (p<0.001). RT corneas had the lowest transparency and tensile strength. Tissues in anhydrous glycerol stored with and without silica gel at -80 degrees C were the most transparent (p<0.001) and had the highest tensile strength (p<0.001). Tissue integrity was maintained and expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen D related (HLA-DR) was less in glycerol-preserved corneas at -80 degrees C. TEM studies indicated that parallel alignment of stromal collagen was disrupted at RT-preserved corneas.
   Conclusions Corneal tissue preserved at -80 degrees C was the best method for preservation as it maintained the sterility, thickness, optical transparency, mechanical strength and ultrastructural features.

AB  - Aggressive behavior by patients with severe mental illness is a major problem needing intervention. This descriptive cross sectional study examined the perception and coping strategies of caregivers with a sample of 100 toward aggressive behavior by patients with severe mental illness in the outpatient and inpatient unit of the department of psychiatry in a tertiary care hospital. The data were collected by a semistructured interview using Revised Overt Aggression Scale-modified, Aggressive Behavior and Intervention Checklist, Ways of Coping Checklist-Hindi Adaptation and Impact of Patient Aggression on Carers Scale-Adapted. The caregivers perceived aggression in varying extent from the patients. Majority used problem-focused coping to deal with aggressive behavior. Most of the caregivers perceived insisting to take medicines and talking about patient's illness as the triggers for aggressive behavior which was managed by talking to the patient calmly, lovingly and by leaving the patient alone. The findings strongly suggest aggressive behavior as a frequent problem faced by family members of patient with severe mental illness. Nursing interventions should focus on counseling and psycho education for empowering caregivers to utilize strategies to reduce occurrence of aggressive behavior from patient and ways to effectively cope with the situation.

AB  - Brachytherapy is a form of intensive local irradiation, allowing effective protection of surrounding structures with preservation of organ function and results in a favorable therapeutic ratio. It can be used alone, adjuvantly after surgery, and as a local boost in combination with external-beam radiation therapy. This paper is a literature review on the role of brachytherapy in the management of head and neck cancers with a special emphasis on papers published in the last 5 years. Technical details, effectiveness and potential toxicities of brachytherapy when used in different combinations with other therapeutic modalities and tumor sites are presented. Brachytherapy is an attractive treatment option in the management of primary malignancies and recurrent tumors in previously irradiated areas of the head and neck. It is effective and safe, and results in good functional and oncological outcomes.

AB  - The importance of breastfeeding in low-income and middle-income countries is well recognised, but less consensus exists about its importance in high-income countries. In low-income and middle-income countries, only 37% of children younger than 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed. With few exceptions, breastfeeding duration is shorter in high-income countries than in those that are resource-poor. Our meta-analyses indicate protection against child infections and malocclusion, increases in intelligence, and probable reductions in overweight and diabetes. We did not find associations with allergic disorders such as asthma or with blood pressure or cholesterol, and we noted an increase in tooth decay with longer periods of breastfeeding. For nursing women, breastfeeding gave protection against breast cancer and it improved birth spacing, and it might also protect against ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes. The scaling up of breastfeeding to a near universal level could prevent 823 000 annual deaths in children younger than 5 years and 20 000 annual deaths from breast cancer. Recent epidemiological and biological findings from during the past decade expand on the known benefits of breastfeeding for women and children, whether they are rich or poor.

AB  - A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified association with variants in X-linked CLDN2 and MORC4, and PRSS1-PRSS2 loci with chronic pancreatitis (CP) in North American patients of European ancestry. We selected 9 variants from the reported GWAS and replicated the association with CP in Indian patients by genotyping 1807 unrelated Indians of Indo-European ethnicity, including 519 patients with CP and 1288 controls. The etiology of CP was idiopathic in 83.62% and alcoholic in 16.38% of 519 patients. Our study confirmed a significant association of 2 variants in CLDN2 gene (rs4409525-OR 1.71, P = 1.38 x 10(-09); rs12008279-OR 1.56, P = 1.53 x 10(-04)) and 2 variants in MORC4 gene (rs12688220-OR 1.72, P = 9.20 x 10(-09); rs6622126-OR 1.75, P = 4.04x10(-05)) in Indian patients with CP. We also found significant association at PRSS1-PRSS2 locus (OR 0.60; P = 9.92 x 10(-06)) and SAMD12-TNFRSF11B (OR 0.49, 95% CI [0.31-0.78], P = 0.0027). A variant in the gene MORC4 (rs12688220) showed significant interaction with alcohol (OR for homozygous and heterozygous risk allele -14.62 and 1.51 respectively, P = 0.0068) suggesting gene-environment interaction. A combined analysis of the genes CLDN2 and MORC4 based on an effective risk allele score revealed a higher percentage of individuals homozygous for the risk allele in CP cases with 5.09 fold enhanced risk in individuals with 7 or more effective risk alleles compared with individuals with 3 or less risk alleles (P = 1.88 x 10(-14)). Genetic variants in CLDN2 and MORC4 genes were associated with CP in Indian patients.

AB  - Lymphoma of the female genital tract is a rare condition. Involvement of the ovary by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is usually secondary to systemic disease and primary ovarian lymphomas are unusual. In most cases, the diagnosis is not suspected initially and is confirmed only after detailed histopathological evaluation. We describe two cases of primary ovarian NHL which were diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). One of the patients was a 40 years old female who presented with abdominal distension and lump. She was found to have bilateral adnexal masses on ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan. A USG guided fine needle aspiration of the ovarian masses was performed, following which a diagnosis of primary ovarian diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was established. The second patient was a 14 years old female who presented with pelvic lump, which was lobulated and mildly enhancing on contrast enhanced CT. A diagnosis of high grade NHL of ovaries was made on cytology. Subsequently, the lymphoma was characterized as Burkitt's on histopathological examination. Both the patients were started on R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen. FNAC serves as an extremely useful minimally invasive procedure for the diagnosis of ovarian lymphomas and early institution of appropriate chemotherapeutic regimens.

AB  - Blastocystis species has been extensively studied in recent few years to establish its pathogenecity. Present study was designed to identify and examine the association of Blastocystis sp. and its subtypes with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Blastocystis sp. detected using wet-mount microscopy, trichrome staining, in-vitro culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay in a cohort of IBS patients (n = 150) and healthy controls (n = 100). Isolates of Blastocystis sp. were subtyped using Sequence Tagged Site and representative samples were sequenced at SSUrRNA locus. A total of sixty five isolates of Blastocystis sp. were identified [IBS (n = 50); Controls (n = 15)] of which 91% belonged to ST3 and 9% belonged to ST1. No other subtypes could be identified. Statistically significant association was observed between Blastocystis sp. and IBS patients; however no particular subtype could be ascertained to any particular clinical type of IBS. The frequency of occurrence of Blastocystis sp. was more in IBS patients as compared to the controls and ST3 being the most prevalent subtype. The genetic polymorphism of SSU-rRNA gene amongst the different Blastocystis sp. isolates found in this study reinforces the fact that these organisms are genetically highly divergent.

AB  - There is a need to develop innovative therapeutic strategies to counteract epilepsy, a common disabling neurological disorder. Despite the recent advent of additional antiepileptic drugs and respective surgery, the treatment of epilepsy remains a major challenge. The available therapies are largely based on symptoms, and these approaches do not affect the underlying disease processes and are also associated frequently with severe side effects. This is mainly because of the lack of well-defined targets in epilepsy. The discovery that inflammatory mediators significantly contribute to the onset and recurrence of seizures in experimental seizure models, as well as the presence of inflammatory molecules in human epileptogenic tissue, highlights the possibility of targeting specific inflammation related pathways to control seizures that are otherwise resistant to the available AEDs. Emerging studies suggest that miRNAs have a significant role in regulating inflammatory pathways shown to be involved in epilepsy. These miRNAs can possibly be used as novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of epilepsy as well as serve as diagnostic biomarkers of epileptogenesis. This review highlights the immunological features underlying the pathogenesis of epileptic seizures and the possible miRNA mediated approaches for drug resistant epilepsies that modulate the immune-mediated pathogenesis.

AB  - The possible association between Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been studied extensively. However, previous findings have been inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies, seeking to provide insights into ApoE's potential as a biomarker for AD. A systematic literature search of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed to retrieve relevant studies evaluating ApoE levels in CSF from AD subjects and controls. The association between ApoE levels in the CSF and AD was estimated by the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effect model. We identified 24 studies that included 1064 AD cases and 1338 non-demented controls. Although the pooled WMD did not indicate a significant association between AD and ApoE levels (-0.30 mg/l; 95% CI: -0.69 to 0.09; P = 0.13), sub-group analysis controlling for patient sample size (n >= 43) revealed significantly lower ApoE levels (WMD: -0.66 mg/l; 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.31; P = 0.0002) among patients with AD than in controls. Publication bias was absent and sensitivity analysis did not result in any significant change in the pooled estimates, indicating highly stable results. The present meta-analysis indicates the potential of CSF ApoE levels as a predictor of AD association. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acute rheumatic fever (ARE) is the result of an autoimmune response to pharyngitis caused by infection with group A Streptococcus. The long-term damage to cardiac valves caused by ARF, which can result from a single severe episode or from multiple recurrent episodes of the illness, is known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and is a notable cause of morbidity and mortality in resource-poor settings around the world. Although our understanding of disease pathogenesis has advanced in recent years, this has not led to dramatic improvements in diagnostic approaches, which are still reliant on clinical features using the Jones Criteria, or treatment practices. Indeed, penicillin has been the mainstay of treatment for decades and there is no other treatment that has been proven to alter the Likelihood or the severity of RHD after an episode of ARE. Recent advances including the use of echocardiographic diagnosis in those with ARF and in screening for early detection of RHD, progress in developing group A streptococcal vaccines and an increased focus on the Lived experience of those with RHD and the need to improve quality of life give cause for optimism that progress will be made in coming years against this neglected disease that affects populations around the world, but is a particular issue for those Living in poverty.

AB  - Chanarin Dorfman syndrome (CDS) is a very rare neutral lipid metabolism disorder with multisystem involvement. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive manner. It is characterized with congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma and involvement of liver, muscle, and central nervous system. Demonstration of lipid vacuoles in neutrophils from peripheral blood smears in patients with ichthyosiform erythroderma leads to the diagnosis. We report a novel ABHD5 truncating variant in a twenty nine month old female child, who presented with icthyosiform erythroderma. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Due to the limited data available in the pediatric population and lack of interventional studies to show that administration of vitamin D indeed improves clinical outcomes, opinion is still divided as to whether it is just an innocent bystander or a marker of severe disease. Our objective was therefore to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in children admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and to examine its association with duration of ICU stay and other key clinical outcomes.
   Methods: We prospectively enrolled children aged 1 month-17 years admitted to the ICU over a period of 8 months (n = 101). The primary objectives were to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25 (OH) < 20 ng/mL) at 'admission' and to examine its association with length of ICU stay.
   Results: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 74 % (95 % CI: 65-88). The median (IQR) duration of ICU stay was significantly longer in 'vitamin D deficient' children (7 days; 2-12) than in those with 'no vitamin D deficiency' (3 days; 2-5; p = 0.006). On multivariable analysis, the association between length of ICU stay and vitamin D deficiency remained significant, even after adjusting for key baseline variables, diagnosis, illness severity (PIM-2), PELOD, and need for fluid boluses, ventilation, inotropes and mortality [adjusted mean difference (95 % CI): 3.5 days (0.50-6.53); p = 0.024].
   Conclusions: We observed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill children in our study population. Vitamin D deficient children had a longer duration of ICU stay as compared to others.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) calls for an accurate, rapid, and simple point-of-care (POC) test for the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis (TB) in order to make progress "Towards Zero Deaths". Whereas the sensitivity of a POC test based on detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is likely to have poor sensitivity (70-80% of children have culture-negative disease), host biomarkers reflecting the on-going pathological processes across the spectrum of MTB infection and disease may hold greater promise for this purpose. We analyzed transcriptional immune biomarkers direct ex-vivo and translational biomarkers in MTB-antigen stimulated whole blood in 88 Indian children with intrathoracic TB aged 6 months to 15 years, and 39 asymptomatic siblings. We identified 12 biomarkers consistently associated with either clinical groups "upstream" towards culture-positive TB on the TB disease spectrum (CD14, FCGR1A, FPR1, MMP9, RAB24, SEC14L1, and TIMP2) or "downstream" towards a decreased likelihood of TB disease (BLR1, CD3E, CD8A, IL7R, and TGFBR2), suggesting a correlation with MTB-related pathology and high relevance to a future POC test for pediatric TB. A biomarker signature consisting of BPI, CD3E, CD14, FPR1, IL4, TGFBR2, TIMP2 and TNFRSF1B separated children with TB from asymptomatic siblings (AUC of 88%).

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare combined hormonal vaginal ring with ultralow-dose combined oral contraceptive (COC) pills in management of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). Fifty patients were randomised into Group I: vaginal ring (n = 25) and group II: COC pills (n = 25). Menstrual blood loss (MBL) was assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months (while on treatment) and at 9 months (3 months after stopping therapy). There was significant reduction in baseline pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score from 440 +/- 188 (Mean +/- SD) to 178 +/- 95, 139 +/- 117, 112 +/- 84 and 120 +/- 108 in group I and from 452 +/- 206 to 204 +/- 152, 179 +/- 125, 176 +/- 164 and 202 +/- 167 in group II at 1, 3, 6 and 9 months, respectively (p = 0.001). Reduction in MBL was 72% and 62% at 6 months and up to 71% and 55% at 9 months in group I and group II, respectively (p = 0.001). Reduction in MBL with ring was greater at higher baseline PBAC score but lesser in patients with fibroid >2 cm. Combined vaginal hormonal treatment for HMB is as effective as oral hormonal therapy, with minor and transient side effects and persistence of response after cessation of therapy.

AB  - Mesh erosion into visceral organs is a rare complication following laparoscopic mesh repair for inguinal hernia with only 15 cases reported in English literature. We report the first case of complete laparoscopic management of mesh erosion into small bowel and urinary bladder. A 62-year-male underwent laparoscopic total extra-peritoneal repair of left inguinal hernia at another centre in April 2012. He presented to our centre 21 months later with persistent lower urinary tract infection (UTI). On evaluation mesh erosion into bowel and urinary bladder was suspected. At laparoscopy, a small bowel loop was adhered to the area of inflammation in the left lower abdomen. After adhesiolysis, mesh was seen to be eroding into small bowel. The entire infected mesh was pulled out from the pre-peritoneal space and urinary bladder wall using gentle traction. The involved small bowel segment was resected, and bowel continuity restored using endoscopic linear cutter. The resected bowel along with the mesh was extracted in a plastic bag. Intra-operative test for leak from urinary bladder was found to be negative. The patient recovered uneventfully and is doing well at 12 months follow-up with resolution of UTI. Laparoscopic approach to mesh erosion is feasible as the plane of mesh placement during laparoscopic hernia repair is closer to peritoneum than during open hernia repair.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) need frequent computed tomography (CT) of the head for assessment and management. In view of the associated polytrauma, hemodynamic instability, and various in-dwelling catheters and tubes, shifting of patients for CT scans may be difficult.
   Aims and Objectives: To assess the role of mobile CT (Ceretom (R); NeuroLogica Corporation, Boston, MA, USA) in a trauma center with respect to patient management.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study over 67 months (June 2009 to January 2015), the number of CT scans done, the time taken for CT and downtime were evaluated. Also, for the first 1000 mobile CT scans, the clinical and radiological records of all patients with TBI who underwent imaging using the mobile CT scanner in the intensive care units (ICUs) were analyzed.
   Observations and Results: A total of 10,000 mobile CT scans were done on the mobile CT scanner till January 5, 2015. Of the first 1000 patients evaluated, 75.3% had severe TBI, 15.1% had moderate TBI, and 9.6% had mild TBI. 78.1% patients were on ventilator, with 80.2% requiring sedation and 8.4%, an inotropic support. An in situ intracranial pressure monitoring was present in 21.1% of patients. In all, 12.4% of patients had long-bone fractures requiring skeletal traction; and, the tube thoracostomy was in-situ in 7.4%. No adverse events related to line malfunction/pullout occurred. The mean time for the performance of imaging using the mobile CT scan was 11.6 minutes compared with 47.8 minutes when patients were shifted to a conventional CT scan suite. The machine was nonfunctional 94 times, with an average downtime of 4.2 hours (range 2-72 hours). The life-cycle cost per mobile CT scan was Rs. 1340.
   Conclusions: A mobile CT has considerably changed the management response time in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) setup and decreased patient transfer times and the associated complications. Inclusion of a mobile CT scanner in the armamentarium of a neurosurgeon as a "bedside tool" can dramatically change decision making and the response time. It should be considered as the standard of care in any large-volume emergency department or neurosurgical facility.

AB  - High mobility group A1 (HMGA1), a non-histone chromosomal protein, is highly expressed in a wide range of human cancers including cervical, breast, and prostate cancers. Therefore, hmga1 gene is considered as an attractive potential target for anticancer drugs. We have chosen 27bp DNA sequence from a regulatory region of hmga1 promoter and studied its interaction with adriamycin (ADM) and in vitro expression of HMGA1 in the presence of ADM in HeLa cell line. A variety of biophysical techniques were employed to understand the characteristics of [DNA-ADM] complex. Spectrophotometric titration data, DNA denaturation profiles, and quenching of fluorescence of ADM in the presence of DNA demonstrated a strong complexation between DNA and ADM with a high binding affinity (Ka) of 1.3x10(6)M(-1) and a stoichiometry of 1:3 (drug:nucleotide). The energetics of binding obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry suggest the binding to be exothermic and enthalpy ( increment H, -6.7 +/- 2.4kcalM(-1)) and entropy (T Delta S, 18.5 +/- 6.4kcalM(-1)) driven (20 degrees C), which is typical of intercalative mode of binding. Further, results on decreased expression (by ~70%) of HMGA1 both at mRNA and protein levels in association with the observed cell death (by ~75%) in HeLa cell line, clearly confirm that ADM does target hmga1; however, the effect of ADM on genes other than hmga1 either directly or via hmga1-mediated pathways cannot be ruled out in the observed cytotoxicity. Therefore, hmga1 in general and particularly the regulatory region is a promising target for therapeutic strategy in combating cancer.

AB  - Tryptophan-rich antigens of malarial parasites interact with host molecules and play an important role in parasite survival. Merozoite expressed Plasmodiumvivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 binds to human erythrocytes and facilitates parasite growth in a heterlologous Plasmodiumfalciparum culture system. Recently, we identified band 3 in human erythrocytes as one of its receptors, although the receptor-ligand binding mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, using synthetic mutated peptides of PvTRAg38, we show that multiple amino acid residues of its 12 amino acid domain (KWVQWKNDKIRS) at position 197-208 interact with three different ectodomains of band 3 receptor on human erythrocytes. Our findings may help in the design of new therapeutic approaches for malaria.

AB  - Objective: Large middle cerebral artery stroke (space-occupying middle-cerebral-artery (MCA) infarction (SO-MCAi)) results in a very high incidence of death and severe disability. Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) for SO-MCAi results in large reductions in mortality; the level of function in the survivors, and implications, remain controversial. To address the controversy, we pooled available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the impact of DHC on survival and functional ability in patients with large SO-MCAi and cerebral oedema.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients suffering SO-MCAi comparing conservative management to DHC administered within 96 hours after stroke symptom onset. Outcomes were death and disability measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We used a random effects meta-analytical approach with subgroup analyses (time to treatment and age). We applied GRADE methods to rate quality/confidence/ certainty of evidence.
   Results: 7 RCTs were eligible (n= 338 patients). We found DHC reduced death (69-30% in medical vs surgical groups, 39% fewer), and increased the number of patients with mRS of 2-3 (slight to moderate disability: 14-27%, increase of 13%), those with mRS 4 (severe disability: 10-32%, increase of 22%) and those with mRS 5 (very severe disability 7-11%: increase of 4%) (all differences p< 0.0001). We judged quality/confidence/certainty of evidence high for death, low for functional outcome mRS 0-3, and moderate for mRS 0-4 (wide CIs and problems in concealment, blinding of outcome assessors and stopping early).
   Conclusions: DHC in SO-MCAi results in large reductions in mortality. Most of those who would otherwise have died are left with severe or very severe disability: for example, inability to walk and a requirement for help with bodily needs, though uncertainty about the proportion with very severe, severe and moderate disability remains (low to moderate quality/confidence/certainty evidence).

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY
KW  - Anterior mediastinum
KW  - sclerosing liposarcoma
KW  - well-differentiated liposarcoma
AB  - Liposarcomas are extremely rare in the mediastinum. Patients usually present late due to the compressive effect of the tumor on the adjacent structures. Severity of the symptoms depend mainly on the size of the tumor and the structure it infiltrates. Well differentiated slow growing liposarcomas are the most common ones in the mediastinum followed by dedifferentiated and poorly differentiated ones. These tumors have bad prognosis because of incomplete surgical excision due to its inaccessible location. Hence these patients should be kept under close follow up because of high recurrent rates. Here we are presenting a rare case of anterior mediastinal sclerosing liposarcoma in a 77 year old male.

AB  - Detection and quantification of drugs from various biological matrices are of immense importance in forensic toxicological analysis. Despite the various reported methods, development of a new method for the detection and quantification of drugs is still an active area of research. However, every method and biological matrix has its own limitation, which further encourage forensic toxicologists to develop new methods and to explore new matrices for the analysis of drugs. In this study, an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS/MS) method is developed and validated for simultaneous identification and quantification of 24 drugs of forensic relevance in various body fluids, namely, whole blood, plasma and vitreous humour. The newly developed method has been validated for intra-day and inter-day accuracy, precision, selectivity and sensitivity. Absolute recovery shows a mean of 84.5, 86.2, and 103% in the vitreous humour, whole blood and plasma respectively, which is suitable for the screening procedure. Further, the absolute matrix effect (AME) shows a mean of 105, 96.5, and 109% in the vitreous humour, whole blood and plasma, respectively. In addition, to examine the practical utility of this method, it has been applied for screening of drugs in post-mortem samples of the vitreous humour, whole blood and plasma collected at autopsy from ten cadavers. Experimental results show that the newly developed method is well applicable for screening of analytes in all the three matrices. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim: Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of nephrotic proteinuria in adults. Most studies on FSGS have combined pediatric and adult patients. This study aims at assessing the response to immunosuppression and its impact on renal survival in adults with primary FSGS. Methods: Patients with nephrotic proteinuria with primary FSGS seen from January 2010 to December 2014 were included. Clinical, laboratory and treatment details were recorded. Deterioration in renal function was defined as >= 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or progression to end-stage renal disease. Results: There were 116 patients with median follow-up of 23.6 (6-65.1) months. Baseline proteinuria was 5.1 +/- 2.6 g/day and eGFR was 96.9 +/- 35.1 ml/min/1.73 m2. One hundred one (94.4%) patients had received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB). One hundred fourteen patients received steroids. Forty two of 114 patients (36.8%) were steroid resistant. Thirty eight received calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). Seventeen (44.7%) were CNI resistant of which 2 achieved remission with alternate immunosuppression. Eleven (9.5%) patients had worsening renal function - 9 had no remission, 2 had PR with none in CR (30 vs. 5.6% vs. 0, respectively, log-rank, p < 0.001). ACEi/ARBs use and remission of proteinuria were independently associated with better renal survival. Conclusion: Achieving remission, whether complete or partial, is the critical factor in predicting renal survival in nephrotic adults with primary FSGS. Steroid-resistant patients have reasonable renal survival, if proteinuria is reduced with timely use of alternate immunosuppression. CNI resistance is a major hurdle in management with limited treatment options. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Introduction It is estimated that 3-10% of infants are growth restricted. Growth disturbances may have long-term issues. Doppler allows insight into the fetal response to intrauterine stress.
   Objective The aim of this study was to detect fetal compromise in intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetuses by means of biophysical profile (BPP) vis-a-vis Doppler velocimetry studies of the fetal umbilical artery, and to find out which of the two is a better and earlier predictor of fetal compromise. Methods A prospective study was conducted on a total of 50 singleton pregnancies with IUGR between 28 and 42 weeks of gestation. Study patients were managed expectantly with nonstress testing and amniotic fluid assessment, BPP and Doppler velocimetry studies of the fetal umbilical artery.
   Results Fetal outcome was poor in 5/50 (10%) of the fetuses, defined as presence of all of the following: poor Apgar test score, neonatal intensive care unit stay, necrotizing enterocolitis, and low birth weight. Of the four with abnormal BPP, 50% had poor fetal outcomes. Out of 46 with normal BPP, 6.5% had poor fetal outcomes.
   Conclusion Inference drawn from the study is that the Doppler technology provides us the opportunity for repetitive noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring in IUGR pregnancies.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) has been increasing alarmingly in India. We had earlier shown that vitamin B-12 deficiency is associated with CAD in Indian population. However, only about a quarter of the total vitamin B12 is internalised in the cells by the proteins transcobalamin II. Vitamin B-12-bound transcobalamin II (holotranscobalamin, holoTC) is thus referred to as biologically active B-12. In this study, we ascertained the levels of holoTC in 501 CAD cases and 1253 healthy controls and for the first time show that holoTC levels are significantly lower (p = 2.57E-4) in CAD (26.81 pmol/l) cases as compared to controls (29.97 pmol/l).

AB  - World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2 doses of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for girls below 15y on the basis of the immune-bridging studies demonstrating non-inferior immune response of 2 doses in the adolescent girls compared to 3 doses in the young adult women in whom the efficacy against disease is established. The biological nature of the antigens (virus-like particles) constituting the HPV vaccine is responsible for the vigorous antibody response that may make the third dose redundant. The protection offered by 2 doses has been demonstrated in non-randomized clinical trials to be comparable to that offered by 3 doses against incident and persistent infections of vaccine targeted HPV types. However, results emerging from the ecological and nested case-control studies embedded in the population based screening programs of different countries indicate reduced efficacy of 2 doses against virological and disease end points. Some recent studies observed the protective effect of single dose of the vaccine against incident and persistent infections of the vaccine targeted HPV types to be similar to 3 doses in spite of immunological inferiority. The sample size, duration of follow-ups and number of events were limited in these studies. Longer follow ups of the less than 3 doses cohorts in the ongoing studies as well as appropriately designed and ethically justifiable randomized studies are needed to establish the protection offered by the alternative schedules at least beyond 10y of vaccination.

AB  - The study was carried out to characterise and analyze the expression pattern of proteins of infective trophozoite and cyst forms of Acanthamoeba spp. isolated from an amoebic keratitis patient. Protein was isolated from the trophozoites and cysts of Acanthamoeba spp. isolates and subjected to SDS PAGE, 2D PAGE analysis where a large number of protein bands and protein spots were observed. Four prominent protein spots i.e. 2 from trophozoites and 2 from cysts that appeared more intense compared to the corresponding spots in other corresponding gel were excised from the 2D PAGE gels and analysed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS assay and Mascot search software. Protein spots from trophozoites were identified as "hypothetical protein ACA1" and "eukaryotic porin protein" and those from cysts were identified as "chaperone protein DnaK" and "chaperonin protein" respectively. Proteomic results of 4 proteins were further validated by reverse genomics using quantitative real time PCR assay which showed a 1388 fold and 4.35 fold increase in expression of "hypothetical protein ACA1" gene and "eukaryotic porin protein" gene respectively in trophozoites compared to cysts and a 15 fold and 12.36 fold increase in expression of "chaperone protein DnaK" gene and "chaperonin protein" gene respectively in cysts compared to trophozoites. "Hypothetical protein ACA1" of trophozoites, whose function is unknown might have some important role in the parasite division and pathogenicty of Acanthamoeba spp. which needs further study. As trophozoites are the active and feeding form of Acanthamoeba spp., "eukaryotic porin" proteins may have some important role in efflux of toxic metabolites and exudates from interior of cell to outside along with some role in pathogenicity. Similarly proteins such as "chaperone protein DnaK' and "chaperonin protein" which belongs to group of heat shock proteins may have a role in folding of cyst specific proteins in cyst which needs further study.

AB  - Purpose: We conducted a comprehensive review of the epidemiology of epilepsy in the Arab world.
   Methods: Epidemiological literature about epilepsy from 22 countries of the Arab League was searched in French and English using several keywords (specific and wider) and combinations, individually for each country. The search was conducted on Google first and then on PubMed. The results are presented as counts, proportions, and medians along with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Unpaired t-test with unequal variance and regressions were performed, altogether and individually, for lifetime and active epilepsy prevalence as well as incidence.
   Results: Google provided 21 prevalence, four camp and nine incidence estimates while PubMed provided ten such estimates; none of them was identified by Google. No epidemiological data about epilepsy was found from 10/22 countries. Excluding pediatric studies, 13 prevalence estimates from six countries were identified. Including pediatric studies, 21 estimates from nine countries were found. Median lifetime and active epilepsy prevalence were 7.5/1000 (95% CI 2.6-12.3, range 1.9-12.9) and 4.4/1000 (95% CI 2.1-9.3, range 2.1-9.3), respectively, excluding pediatric studies (1984-2014, N = 244081). Median incidence was 56.0/100,000 (n = 9, N = 122484, 95% CI 13.7-147.9, range 10.4-190).
   Conclusion: The fact that no epidemiological data about epilepsy is available in the public domain for almost one half of all Arab countries offers opportunities for future research. This thorough review of existing literature demonstrates a prevalence of epilepsy three times higher than previously reported for this region. The median incidence is similar to other regions of the world, e.g. North America. Google yielded additional valuable sources not indexed in PubMed and provided pertinent references more quickly.

AB  - Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that runs an indolent course. The rare complications of DLE include scarring, mutilation, non-healing ulceration, cicatricial alopecia and malignancy. DLE progresses to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in around 5% of localized cases and 22% of generalized cases. We report a case of DLE, presenting with a six-month history of ulcerated fungating plaques and small crusted nodules superimposed on DLE plaques over both the forearms. Two weeks prior to the presentation, maggots were also noticed on these plaques. Skin biopsies from these lesions were suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma. A wide surgical excision of the tumor followed by partial split-thickness skin grafting was performed with complete healing of the lesions. No recurrence has been noted 18 months from follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetic Mellitus is the chronic metabolic illness characterised by hyperglycemia and various complications of heart, eyes, nerves, kidney etc. Diabetic Nephropathy is the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patient. We hypothesized that decreased serum folic acid levels are associated with Diabetic Nephropathy.
   Materials and Method: Our study population consist of 100 subjects out of which 50 cases of Diabetes Mellitus are without Diabetic Nephropathy and 50 cases of Diabetes Mellitus with Diabetic Nephropathy. We measured various routine lab parameters, apart from that, we measured spot urinary albumin to creatinine ratio to assess diabetic nephropathy and we used chemiluminesence based immunoassay to measure serum folic acid.
   Result: Serum folic acid in the group with nephropathy was significantly lower than that of the group without nephropathy (4.9 +/- 0.4 ng/dl) vs (6.8 +/- 0.5 ng/dl) p = 0.05. We found that serum folic acid was negatively correlated with spot urinary albumin ratio and on multivariate logistic regression analysis we found that decrease in folic acid significantly (p < 0.05) increases the chances of diabetes with nephropathy by 19.9 %.
   Conclusion: Our study tilt toward the deficiency of serum folic acid levels in diabetes mellitus patient with nephropathy. So if we would correct folic acid deficiency in diabetic patient then we could prevent the development of various complication associated with diabetes and help in reducing the morbidity and mortality of diabetic patient.

AB  - Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant embryonal central nervous system tumor commonly affecting children <3 years of age. It roughly constitutes 1%-2% of all pediatric central nervous system tumors. Recent data show that it is the most common malignant central nervous system tumor in children <6 months of age. Management of this aggressive tumor is associated with a myriad of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. On the basis of radiology and histopathology alone, distinction of AT/RT from medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor is difficult, and hence this tumor has been commonly mis-diagnosed as primitive neuroectodermal tumor for decades. Presence of a bulky heterogeneous solid-cystic mass with readily visible calcification and intratumor hemorrhage, occurring off-midline in children <3 years of age, should alert the radiologist toward the possibility of AT/RT. Presence of rhabdoid cells on histopathology and polyphenotypic immunopositivity for epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuroectodermal markers along with loss of expression of SMARCB1/INI1 or SMARCA4/BRG1 help in establishing a diagnosis of AT/RT. The optimal management comprises maximal safe resection followed by radiation therapy and multiagent intensive systemic chemotherapy. Gross total excision is difficult to achieve in view of the large tumor size and location and young age at presentation. Leptomeningeal spread is noted in 15%-30% of patients, and hence craniospinal irradiation followed by boost to tumor bed is considered standard in children older than 3 years. However, in younger children, craniospinal irradiation may lead to long-term neurocognitive and neuroendocrine sequel, and hence focal radiation therapy may be a pragmatic approach. In this age group, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue may also be considered to defer radiation therapy, but this approach is also associated with significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Novel small molecule inhibitors hold promise in preclinical studies and should be considered in patients with relapsed or refractory tumor.

AB  - Genus Mycoplasma, belonging to the class Mollicutes, encompasses unique lifeforms comprising of a small genome of 8,00,000 base pairs and the inability to produce a cell wall under any circumstances. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most common pathogenic species infecting humans. It is an atypical respiratory bacteria causing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children and adults of all ages. Although atypical pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae can be managed in outpatient settings, complications affecting multiple organ systems can lead to hospitalization in vulnerable population. M. pneumoniae infection has also been associated with chronic lung disease and bronchial asthma. With the advent of molecular methods of diagnosis and genetic, immunological and ultrastructural assays that study infectious disease pathogenesis at subcellular level, newer virulence factors of M. pneumoniae have been recognized by researchers. Structure of the attachment organelle of the organism, that mediates the crucial initial step of cytadherence to respiratory tract epithelium through complex interaction between different adhesins and accessory adhesion proteins, has been decoded. Several subsequent virulence mechanisms like intracellular localization, direct cytotoxicity and activation of the inflammatory cascade through toll-like receptors (TLRs) leading to inflammatory cytokine mediated tissue injury, have also been demonstrated to play an essential role in pathogenesis. The most significant update in the knowledge of pathogenesis has been the discovery of Community-Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome toxin (CARDS toxin) of M. pneumoniae and its ability of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation and inflammosome activation, thus initiating airway inflammation. Advances have also been made in terms of the different pathways behind the genesis of extrapulmonary complications. This article aims to comprehensively review the recent advances in the knowledge of pathogenesis of this organism, that had remained elusive during the era of serological diagnosis. Elucidation of virulence mechanisms of M. pneumoniae will help researchers to design effective vaccine candidates and newer therapeutic targets against this agent.

AB  - Background: To report the management and clinical outcome of children with unsuspected retinoblastoma who underwent trabeculectomy surgery.
   Methods: Three children who presented to us after trabeculectomy surgery were diagnosed with retinoblastoma. They were treated with enucleation of the affected eye. Histopathology of the enucleated eyeball showed tumor infiltration into the iris and the ciliary body in two cases, and massive choroidal invasion in the third case. Six cycles of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin, vincristine and etoposide were given.
   Results: The follow-up ranged from 18-48 months. At last follow-up, all children were alive and well, with no local recurrence or systemic metastasis.
   Conclusions: The management of retinoblastoma with operated trabeculectomy is challenging due to risk of tumor dissemination. Timely intervention can result in good clinical outcome. Nevertheless, a meticulous posterior segment evaluation to rule out retinoblastoma in children presenting with buphthalmos or secondary glaucoma should always be considered.

AB  - Background
   Anaesthetic drugs during general anaesthesia are titrated according to sympathetic or somatic responses to surgical stimuli. It is now possible to measure depth of anaesthesia using electroencephalography (EEG). Entropy, an EEG-based monitor can be used to assess the depth of anaesthesia using a strip of electrodes applied to the forehead, and this can guide intraoperative anaesthetic drug administration.
   Objectives
   The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of entropy monitoring in facilitating faster recovery from general anaesthesia. We also wanted to assess mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year following general anaesthesia with entropy monitoring.
   The secondary objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the entropy monitor in: preventing postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) following general anaesthesia; reducing the amount of anaesthetic drugs used; reducing cost of the anaesthetic as well as in reducing time to readiness to leave the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU).
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014). We reran the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE via Ovid SP and EMBASE via Ovid SP in January 2016. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting Classification' and we will incorporate this study into the formal review findings during the review update.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults and children (aged greater than two years of age), where in one arm entropy monitoring was used for titrating anaesthesia, and in the other standard practice (increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, lacrimation, movement in response to noxious surgical stimuli) was used for titrating anaesthetic drug administration. We also included trials with an additional third arm, wherein another EEG monitor, the Bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used to assess anaesthetic depth.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from trials considered eligible for inclusion. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a random-effect model where there was heterogeneity. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs, we downgraded evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect or potential publication bias).
   Main results
   We included 11 RCTs (962 participants). Eight RCTs (762 participants) were carried out on adults (18 to 80 years of age), two (128 participants) involved children (two to 16 years) and one RCT (72 participants) included patients aged 60 to 75 years. Of the 11 included studies, we judged three to be at low risk of bias, and the remaining eight RCTs at unclear or high risk of bias.
   Six RCTs (383 participants) estimated the primary outcome, time to awakening after stopping general anaesthesia, which was reduced in the entropy as compared to the standard practice group (mean difference (MD) -5.42 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -2.08; moderate quality of evidence). We noted heterogeneity for this outcome; on performing subgroup analysis this was found to be due to studies that included participants undergoing major, long duration surgeries (off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, major urological surgery). The MD for time to awakening with four studies on ambulatory procedures was -3.20 minutes (95% CI -3.94 to -2.45). No trial reported the second primary outcome, mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year with the use of entropy monitoring.
   Eight trials (797 participants) compared the secondary outcome, postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) in the entropy and standard practice groups. Awareness was reported by only one patient in the standard practice group, making meaningful estimation of benefit of entropy monitoring difficult; moderate quality of evidence.
   All 11 RCTs compared the amount of anaesthetic agent used between the entropy and standard practice groups. Six RCTs compared the amount of propofol, four compared the amount of sevoflurane and one the amount of isoflurane used between the groups. Analysis of three studies (166 participants) revealed that the MD of propofol consumption between the entropy group and control group was -11.56 mcg/kg/min (95% CI -24.05 to 0.92); low quality of evidence. Analysis of another two studies (156 participants) showed that the MD in sevoflurane consumption in the entropy group compared to the control group was -3.42 mL (95% CI -6.49 to -0.35); moderate quality of evidence.
   No trial reported on the secondary outcome of the cost of general anaesthesia.
   Three trials (170 participants) estimated MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU of the entropy group as compared to the control group (MD -5.94 minutes, 95% CI -16.08 to 4.20; low quality of evidence). Heterogeneity was noted, which was due to the difference in anaesthetic technique (propofol-based general anaesthesia) in one study. The remaining two studies had used volatile-based general anaesthesia. The MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU was -4.17 minutes (95% CI -6.84 to -1.51) with these two studies.
   Authors' conclusions
   The evidence as regards time to awakening, recall of intraoperative awareness and reduction in inhalational anaesthetic agent use was of moderate quality. The quality of evidence of as regards reduction in intravenous anaesthetic agent (propofol) use, as well as time to readiness to leave the PACU was found to be of low quality. As the data are limited, further studies consisting of more participants will be required for ascertaining benefits of entropy monitoring.
   Further studies are needed to assess the effect of entropy monitoring on focal issues such as short-term and long-term mortality, as well as cost of general anaesthesia.

AB  - Coronary artery disease is an inflammatory disorder characterized by narrowing of coronary arteries due to atherosclerotic plaque formation. To date, the accumulated epidemiological evidence supports an association between oral bacterial diseases and coronary artery disease, but has failed to prove a causal link between the two. Due to the recent surge in microbial identification and analyses techniques, a number of bacteria have been independently found in atherosclerotic plaque samples from coronary artery disease patients. In this study, we present meta-analysis from published studies that have independently investigated the presence of bacteria within atherosclerotic plaque samples in coronary artery disease patients. Data were collated from 63 studies covering 1791 patients spread over a decade. Our analysis confirms the presence of 23 oral commensal bacteria, either individually or in co-existence, within atherosclerotic plaques in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, catheter-based atherectomy, or similar procedures. Of these 23 bacteria, 5 (Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens) are unique to coronary plaques, while the other 18 are additionally present in non-cardiac organs, and associate with over 30 non-cardiac disorders. We have cataloged the wide spectrum of proteins secreted by above atherosclerotic plaque-associated bacteria, and discuss their possible roles during microbial migration via the bloodstream. We also highlight the prevalence of specific poly-microbial communities within atherosclerotic plaques. This work provides a resource whose immediate implication is the necessity to systematically catalog landscapes of atherosclerotic plaque-associated oral commensal bacteria in human patient populations.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a novel technique of trabeculectomy combined with cyclodialysis and Ologen implantation at 3 sites in cases with high risk for failure of trabeculectomy.
   Methods: Six eyes of 6 patients who had high risk for failure of trabeculectomy underwent cyclodialysis-augmented trabeculectomy with Ologen implantation at 3 sites using the described technique.
   Results: All the eyes achieved target intraocular pressure, which was maintained until 1 year of follow-up. One eye required bleb needling at 6 weeks postoperative follow-up. None of the eyes had any other intraoperative or postoperative complications.
   Conclusions: This novel technique of combining trabeculectomy with cyclodialysis augmented by Ologen placement at 3 locations appears to have encouraging short-term intraocular pressure control and may be adopted in eyes with risk factors for failure of conventional trabeculectomy.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to review the current evidence and design a diabetic macular edema (DME) management guideline specific for India. The published DME guidelines from different organizations and publications were weighed against the practice trends in India. This included the recently approved drugs. DME management consisted of control of diabetes and other associated systemic conditions, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and specific therapy to reduce macular edema. Quantification of macular edema is precisely made with the optical coherence tomography and treatment options include retinal laser, intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), and implantable dexamethasone. Specific use of these modalities depends on the presenting vision and extent of macular involvement. Invariable eyes with center-involving macular edema benefit from intravitreal anti-VEGF or dexamethasone implant therapy, and eyes with macular edema not involving the macula center benefit from retinal laser. The results are illustrated with adequate case studies and frequently asked questions. This guideline prepared on the current published evidence is meant as a guideline for the treating physicians.

AB  - Background & objectives: There has been a limited focus on prescription drug abuse among women in the country. Choice of psychoactive substance, reasons for initiation and co-occurring disorders have been found to be different among men and women. The current study was aimed at studying the profile of female patients seeking in-patient treatment for prescription drug use over a period of five years at a tertiary care drug dependence treatment centre in India.
   Methods: Case records of all female patients admitted with substance use disorder at a national level drug dependence treatment centre in north India across five years (between January 2008 and December 2012) were reviewed retrospectively to study their socio-demographic and clinical profile. The information was gathered using a semi-structured proforma and detailed case records. Abstinence, relapse and retention rates were calculated.
   Results: Over the five years, 31 female patients were admitted with prescription drug abuse. Of them, 12 (39%) used prescription opioids and 11 (36%) used prescription opioid along with benzodiazepines. Commonest prescription opioid was pentazocine used by 87 per cent of the women. Twenty two (71%) women were introduced to opioid by medical practitioners and commonest reason for introduction was pain (among 48%). Common co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses were depressive disorder (26%), cluster B traits/disorder (19%) and somatoform disorder (13%). Eight women did not complete treatment and left against medical advice. Thirteen women were advised maintenance treatment, and 70 per cent of them were retained for at least six months.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings revealed a link between mental illness, pain and non-medical use of prescription opioids among women. Majority of these women received opioids as a legitimate prescription form physician. Therefore, these legitimate prescribers should be trained for pain management to facilitate proper treatment of pain and to prevent the subsequent misuse of these medicines. Female patients with frequent pain complaints should be assessed for psychopathology while prescribing opioids.

AB  - Introduction: Structure-based drug discovery offers a rational approach for the design and development of novel anti-mitotic agents which target specific proteins involved in mitosis. This strategy has paved the way for development of a new generation of chemotypes which selectively interfere with the target proteins. The interference of these anti-mitotic targets implicated in diverse stages of mitotic cell cycle progression culminates in cancer cell apoptosis.
   Areas covered: This review covers the various mitotic inhibitors developed against validated mitotic checkpoint protein targets using structure-based design and optimization strategies. The protein-ligand interactions and the insights gained from these studies, culminating in the development of more potent and selective inhibitors, have been presented.
   Expert opinion: The advent of structure-based drug design coupled with advances in X-ray crystallography has revolutionized the discovery of candidate lead molecules. The structural insights gleaned from the co-complex protein-drug interactions have provided a new dimension in the design of antimitotic molecules to develop drugs with a higher selectivity and specificity profile. Targeting noncatalytic domains has provided an alternate approach to address cross-reactivity and broad selectivity among kinase inhibitors. The elucidation of structures of emerging mitotic drug targets has opened avenues for the design of inhibitors that target cancer.

AB  - Aim of the study: The monitoring of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in clinical setting is important for measuring the efficacy of drugs and their safety and in personalizing drug therapy. We investigated the levels of AED, carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PHB), to understand their association in saliva compared with those in serum during the therapy. Materials and methods: In this study, we performed a prospective study of 116 persons with epilepsy (PWE; mean age 26.90 +/- 11.83 years). Serum and saliva samples were collected at trough levels from the patients, who were under the treatment of CBZ, PHT and PHB either alone or in combination of these drugs for at least three months. The drug levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results and conclusions: The number of males (n = 88; 75.86%) was higher than females (n = 28; 24.14%) among the recruited patients. The intake of CBZ, PHT and PHB was observed in 49.14%, 68.10% and 38.79% of PWE, respectively. The levels of these AEDs showed a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between serum and saliva. Interestingly, the levels of mono-therapy or bi-therapy showed a significant association (p < 0.05) between serum and saliva, however, there was no significant association in case of poly-therapy. This is the first report in the Indian population on simultaneous estimation of the three commonly used AEDs, such as CBZ, PHT and PHB in serum and saliva implicating their associations, either in mono-therapy or bi-therapy in PWE.

AB  - Glaucoma is a form of multifactorial ocular neurodegeneration with immensely complex etiology, pathogenesis and pathology. Though the mainstream therapeutic management of glaucoma is lowering of intraocular pressure, there is, as of now, no cure for the disease. New evidences ardently suggest brain involvement in all aspects of this malady. This consequently advocates the opinion that brain should be the spotlight of glaucoma research and may form the impending and promising target for glaucoma diagnosis and treatment. The present analysis endeavors at understanding glaucoma vis-a-vis brain structural and/or functional derangement and central nervous system (CNS) degeneration. Commencing with the premise of developing some understanding about the brain-nature of ocular structures; we discuss the nature of the cellular and molecular moieties involved in glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease. Substantial deal of literature implies that glaucoma may well be a disease of the brain, nevertheless, manifesting as progressive loss of vision. If that is the case, then targeting brain will be far more imperative in glaucoma therapeutics than any other remedial regimen currently being endorsed.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) among Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and analyze the role of oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test on its estimation.
   Design: Cross-sectional clinical study.
   Setting: Tertiary care center.
   Patient(s): A total of 2,014 women with PCOS diagnosed on the basis of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were enrolled, and the data of 1,746 subjects were analyzed.
   Intervention(s): In addition o recording clinical, biochemical, and hormone parameters, a 75 g OGTT was administered. Main Outcome Measure(s): Prevalence of AGT and impact of age, body mass index (BMI), family history, and OGTT on its prevalence.
   Result(s): The mean age of subjects was 23.8 +/- 5.3 years, with a mean BMI of 24.9 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2). The overall prevalence of AGT was 36.3% (6.3% diabetes and 30% impaired fasting plasma glucose/impaired glucose tolerance) using American Diabetes Association criteria. The glucose intolerance showed a rising trend with advancing age (30.3%, 35.4%, 51%, and 58.8% in the second, third, fourth, and fifth decades, respectively) and increasing BMI. Family history of diabetes mellitus was present in 54.6% (953/1,746) subjects, and it did not correlate with any of the studied parameters except waist circumference and BMI. Sensitivity was better with 2-hour post-OGTT glucose values as compared with fasting plasma glucose, since using fasting plasma glucose alone would have missed the diagnosis in 107 (6.1%) subjects.
   Conclusion(s): We conclude that AGT is high among young Indian women with PCOS and that it is not predicted by family history of type 2 DM. OGTT significantly improves the detection rate of AGT among Indian women with PCOS. (C) 2016 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB  - Background: Thrombocytopenia has been shown to predict mortality. We hypothesize that platelet indices may be more useful prognostic indicators. Our study subjects were children one month to 14 years old admitted to our hospital.
   Aim: To determine whether platelet count, plateletcrit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) and their ratios can predict mortality in hospitalised children.
   Methods: Children who died during hospital stay were the cases. Controls were age matched children admitted contemporaneously. The first blood sample after admission was used for analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify the best threshold for measured variables and the ratios studied. Multiple regression analysis was done to identify independent predictors of mortality.
   Results: Forty cases and forty controls were studied. Platelet count, PCT and the ratios of MPV/Platelet count, MPV/PCT, PDW/Platelet count, PDW/PCT and MPV x PDW/Platelet count x PCT were significantly different among children who survived compared to those who died. On multiple regression analysis the ratio of MPV/PCT, PDW/Platelet count and MPV/Platelet count were risk factors for mortality with an odds ratio of 4.31(95% CI, 1.69-10.99), 3.86 (95% CI, 1.53-9.75), 3.45 (95% CI, 1.38-8.64) respectively. In 67% of the patients who died MPV/PCT ratio was above 41.8 and PDW/Platelet count was above 3.86. In 65% of patients who died MPV/Platelet count was above 3.45.
   Conclusion: The MPV/PCT, PDW/Platelet count and MPV/Platelet count, in the first sample after admission in this case control study were predictors of mortality and could predict 65% to 67% of deaths accurately.

AB  - An epileptic seizure is defined as transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in brain. There are diverse etiologies for acute seizure in infants and children. The present review provides a broad approach to diagnosis and treatment plan for acute seizure in children. The approach to a child with acute seizure is discussed with special emphasis on clinical approach based on history and focused examination with judicious choice of investigation and further management plan. The review also emphasizes on recognizing common nonepileptic events that masquerade as true seizure among infants and children.

KW  - MANIFESTATIONS
AB  - Sarcoidosis is a chronic, systemic disease of unknown etiology that affects multiple organs. The disease was considered rare in developing countries like India. More recently sarcoidosis is being increasingly diagnosed in countries where tuberculosis continues to be endemic. There is a general perception among physicians that the prevalence of sarcoidosis has increased over the last two decades in countries like India. This may be true but could also be related to better awareness of the condition, availability of improved diagnostic facilities and the increased ability of physicians to differentiate it from tuberculosis. In India, diagnosis of tuberculosis is entertained first in patients who may have sarcoidosis and thus, it is very likely for sarcoidosis to be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, owing to the high prevalence of tuberculosis and clinicoradiological resemblance to the disease. This editorial highlights the challenges in diagnosing tuberculosis in countries where tuberculosis still continues to be endemic.

AB  - Hearts in which the arterial trunks arise from the morphologically appropriate ventricles, but in a parallel manner, rather than the usual spiralling arrangement, have long fascinated anatomists. These rare entities, for quite some time, were considered embryological impossibilities, but ongoing experience has shown that they can be found in various segmental combinations. Problems still exist about how best to describe them, as the different variants are often described with esoteric terms, such as anatomically corrected malposition or isolated ventricular inversion. In this review, based on our combined clinical and morphological experience, we demonstrate that the essential feature of all hearts described in this manner is a parallel arrangement of the arterial trunks as they exit from the ventricular mass. We show that the relationship of the arterial roots needs to be described in terms of the underlying ventricular topology, rather than according to the arrangement of the atrial chambers. We then discuss the importance of determining atrial arrangement on the basis of the morphology of the appendages, following the precepts as set out in the so-called morphological method and distinguished according to the extent of the pectinate muscles relative to the atrioventricular junctions as opposed to basing diagnosis on the venoatrial connections. We show that, when approached in this manner, the various combinations can be readily diagnosed in the clinical setting and described in straightforward way.

AB  - Background:To determine the prevalence of peripheral retinal degenerations (PRD) and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in patients with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG).Methods:Records of all patients with PCG operated from year 2000 onwards were evaluated to look for the prevalence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Of these, those children who were old enough to cooperate and had sufficient medial clarity were screened with an indirect ophthalmoscopy in a cross-sectional evaluation from 2010 to 2014. Peripheral retina was examined, and prevalence of PRD was estimated in this subset. For statistical purposes, only one eye of each patient was considered in this cross-sectional analysis.Results:Of the 310 eyes (180 patients with PCG) operated from the year 2000 onwards, a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment was noted in 13 eyes (4%). Mean axial length of these eyes was 26.3 3.2 mm (range, 19.8-34.7 mm). Among the eyes screened for PRD (n = 60), prevalence of pathologic PRD (lattices with/without atrophic holes and isolated holes/tears) was 15%. The average follow-up between glaucoma filtering surgery and the date of last examination was 8.55 +/- 3.98 years (range, 5-20 years) in this subset. Mean axial length was significantly greater in eyes with pathologic PRD than in those without (28.1 +/- 3.3 mm vs. 25.8 +/- 2.6 mm; P = 0.01). For axial length 26 mm, the odds of having a pathologic PRD were 14.4 times more than those with axial length <26 mm (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-120.5).Conclusion:Prevalence of PRD among eyes with PCG is high. Peripheral retinal screening should be performed in eyes with PCG, especially those with axial lengths 26 mm.

AB  - Although atypical presentations of herpetic infection in immunocompetent individuals are common, they very rarely have the extensive, chronic and verrucous appearances seen in the immunocompromised host. We report a case of genital herpes manifesting as painless chronic non-healing genital ulcers with exuberant granulation tissue in an immunocompetent man. Owing to this morphology, the ulcers were initially mistaken for donovanosis. To the best of our knowledge, such a presentation of genital herpes in an immunocompetent individual has not been described previously.

AB  - Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4) plays significant role in the regulation of calcium-dependent gene expression, and thus, it is involved in varieties of cellular functions such as cell signaling and neuronal survival. On the other hand, curcumin, a naturally occurring yellow bioactive component of turmeric possesses wide spectrum of biological actions, and it is widely used to treat atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and inflammation. It also acts as an antioxidant. Here, we studied the interaction of curcumin with human CAMK4 at pH 7.4 using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, fluorescence binding, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methods. We performed MD simulations for both neutral and anionic forms of CAMK4-curcumin complexes for a reasonably long time (150ns) to see the overall stability of the protein-ligand complex. Molecular docking studies revealed that the curcumin binds in the large hydrophobic cavity of kinase domain of CAMK4 through several hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonded interactions. Additionally, MD simulations studies contributed in understanding the stability of protein-ligand complex system in aqueous solution and conformational changes in the CAMK4 upon binding of curcumin. A significant increase in the fluorescence intensity at 495nm was observed (lambda(exc)=425nm), suggesting a strong interaction of curcumin to the CAMK4. A high binding affinity (K-D=3.7x10(-8)+/-.03M) of curcumin for the CAMK4 was measured by SPR further indicating curcumin as a potential ligand for the CAMK4. This study will provide insights into designing a new inspired curcumin derivatives as therapeutic agents against many life-threatening diseases.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is mainly a disease of developed countries and a major cause of death worldwide. The present study was undertaken to investigate the association of novel cancer testis (CT) antigen, A-kinase anchor protein (AKAP4) with CRC. AKAP4 gene and protein was examined by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 200 clinical specimens of different stages and grades. In addition, humoral response against AKAP4 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting in 172 available sera samples of CRC patients. We observed that majority of CRC patients demonstrated AKAP4 expression and elicited immune response. AKAP4 protein expression, based on immunoreactivity score (IRS) predicted presence of CRC with 84% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% of positive predictive value (PPV) and 83.33% negative predictive value (NPV). Humoral response against AKAP4 protein was generated in 82% of the CRC patients. Further, statistical analysis revealed that antibodies found against AKAP4 in CRC patients predicted presence of malignancy with 81.98% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV, and 63.53% NPV. Collectively, our data suggests that the majority of CRC cases show significant difference of AKAP4 expression among stages and grades and also generated antibodies against AKAP4 protein. Therefore, AKAP4 may be potential candidate molecule for developing as a biomarker for early diagnosis and immunotherapy of CRC.

AB  - Diabetes insipidus (DI) is one of the common disorders affecting sodium and water homeostasis, and results when ADH is either inadequately produced, or unable to negotiate its actions on the renal collecting tubules through aquaporins. The diagnostic algorithm starts with exclusion of other causes of polyuria and establishing low urine osmolality in the presence of high serum osmolality. In this paper, we have reviewed the diagnosis, etiology and management of DI in children, with special emphasis on recent advances in the field.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental and neuroimmunological genes critically regulate antipsychotic treatment outcome. We report genetic associations of antipsychotic response in 742 schizophrenia patients from Indian populations of Indo-European and Dravidian ancestry, segregated by disease severity. Meta-analysis comparing the two populations identified CCL2 [rs4795893: OR (95% CI) = 1.79 (1.27-2.52), P = 7.62 x 10(-4); rs4586: OR (95% CI) = 1.74 (1.24-2.43), P = 1.13 x 10(-3)] and GRIA4 [rs2513265: OR (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.36-0.78), P = 1.44 x 10(-3)] in low severity group; and, ADCY2 [rs1544938: OR (95% CI) = 0.3x6 (0.19-0.65), P = 7.68 x 10(-4)] and NRG1 [rs13250975, OR (95% CI) = 0.42 (0.23-0.79), P = 6.81 x 10(-3); rs17716295, OR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.15-2.75), P = 8.71 x 10(-3)] in high severity group, with incomplete response toward antipsychotics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia patients from two major India populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to compare outcome of primary and secondary Illizarov's fixator application as a treatment method for type III open tibial fractures in terms of nonunion and wound infection.
   METHODS: This prospective study was done in a tertiary care center. Forty-eight type III tibial fractures were treated with Illizarov's apparatus between 2008 and 2011. The patients were divided into two groups depending on the treatment protocol, timing of wound closure and Illizarov's application, primary (n=28) and secondary (n=20).
   RESULTS: In the primary group, healing was achieved in all 28 patients. The median time to recovery was 24 weeks, and the median number of operations was 3. There were 6 patients with a bone defect. In the secondary group, complete recovery was achieved in 18 out of 20 patients. The median time to recovery was 30 weeks, and the median number of operations 5. There were 9 patients with a bone defect. The median time to recovery and the number of operations were significantly smaller in patients undergoing primary operation. Union was 100% in the primary group and more than 95% in the secondary group. Chronic osteomyelitis persisted in one patient and below amputation was done in one patient in the secondary group.
   CONCLUSION: Primary wound closure and Illizarov's fixation required a smaller number of operations and shorter time to recovery than secondary wound closure and Illizarov's fixation, mostly due to a significantly less number of patients with a bone defect in the primary group.

AB  - Infections by dematiaceous fungi are an emerging group of infectious diseases worldwide with a variety of clinical presentations. Though generally localized, they can disseminate in immunocompromised settings, therefore, early diagnosis and prompt therapy can prevent significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Fungi of genus Exophiala are common causative organisms; however, Exophiala jeanselmei (E. jeanselmei) has not yet been reported from environmental sources in India. We present here the case of a renal transplant recipient who presented with an innocuous lesion on the foot, diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) as phaeohyphomycosis, and promptly treated with excision and antifungal therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report from India of E. jeanselmei causing phaeohyphomycosis in a transplant recipient and highlights the role a cytopathologist can play in the timely management of such cases.

AB  - Background
   Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the main form of tuberculosis that affects the central nervous system and is associated with high rates of death and disability. Most international guidelines recommend longer antituberculous treatment (ATT) regimens for TBM than for pulmonary tuberculosis disease to prevent relapse. However, longer regimens are associated with poor adherence, which could contribute to increased relapse, development of drug resistance, and increased costs to patients and healthcare systems.
   Objectives
   To compare the effects of short-course (six months) regimens versus prolonged-course regimens for people with tuberculous meningitis (TBM).
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases up to 31March 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; INDMED; and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also checked article reference lists and contacted researchers in the field.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies of adults and children with TBM treated with antituberculous regimens that included rifampicin for six months or longer than six months. The primary outcome was relapse, and included studies required a minimum of six months follow-up after completion of treatment.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors (SJ and HR) independently assessed the literature search results for eligibility, and performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments of the included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. Most data came from single arm cohort studies without a direct comparison so we pooled the findings for each group of cohorts and presented them separately using a complete-case analysis. We assessed the quality of the evidence narratively, as using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was inappropriate with no direct comparisons between short-and prolonged-course regimens.
   Main results
   Four RCTs and 12 prospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria, and included a total of 1881 participants with TBM. None of the included RCTs directly compared six months versus longer regimens, so we analysed all data as individual cohorts to obtain relapse rates in each set of cohorts.
   We included seven cohorts of participants treated for six months, with a total of 458 participants. Three studies were conducted in Thailand, two in South Africa, and one each in Ecuador and Papua New Guinea between the 1980s and 2009. We included 12 cohorts of participants treated for longer than six months (ranging from eight to 16 months), with a total of 1423 participants. Four studies were conducted in India, three in Thailand and one each in China, South Africa, Romania, Turkey and Vietnam, between the late 1970s and 2011.
   The proportion of participants classified as having stage III disease (severe) was higher in the cohorts treated for six months (33.2% versus 16.9%), but the proportion with known concurrent HIV was higher in the cohorts treated for longer (0/458 versus 122/1423). Although there were variations in the treatment regimens, most cohorts received isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide during the intensive phase.
   Investigators achieved follow-up beyond 18 months after completing treatment in three out of the seven cohorts treated for six months, and five out of the 12 cohorts treated for eight to 16 months. All studies had potential sources of bias in their estimation of the relapse rate, and comparisons between the cohorts could be confounded.
   Relapse was an uncommon event across both groups of cohorts (3/369 (0.8%) with six months treatment versus 7/915 (0.8%) with longer), with only one death attributed to relapse in each group.
   Overall, the proportion of participants who died was higher in the cohorts treated for longer than six months (447/1423 (31.4%) versus 58/458 (12.7%)). However, most deaths occurred during the first six months in both treatment cohorts, which suggested that the difference in death rate was not directly related to duration of ATT but was due to confounding. Clinical cure was higher in the group of cohorts treated for six months (408/458 (89.1%) versus longer than six months (984/1336 (73.7%)), consistent with the observations for deaths.
   Few participants defaulted from treatment with six months treatment (4/370 (1.1%)) versus longer treatment (8/355 (2.3%)), and adherence was not well reported.
   Authors' conclusions
   In all cohorts most deaths occurred in the first six months; and relapse was uncommon in all participants irrespective of the regimen. Further inferences are probably inappropriate given this is observational data and confounding is likely. These data are almost all from participants who are HIV-negative, and thus the inferences will not apply to the efficacy and safety of the six months regimens in HIV-positive people. Well-designed RCTs, or large prospective cohort studies, comparing six months with longer treatment regimens with long follow-up periods established at initiation of ATT are needed to resolve the uncertainty regarding the safety and efficacy of six months regimens for TBM.

TI  - Six-month therapy for abdominal tuberculosis
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
KW  - TRIAL
AB  - Background
   Tuberculosis (TB) of the gastrointestinal tract and any other organ within the abdominal cavity is abdominal TB, and most guidelines recommend the same six-month regimen used for pulmonaryTB for peoplewith this diagnosis. However, some physicians are concerned whether a six-month treatment regimen is long enough to prevent relapse of the disease, particularly in people with gastrointestinal TB, which may sometimes cause antituberculous drugs to be poorly absorbed. On the other hand, longer regimens are associated with poor adherence, which could increase relapse, contribute to drug resistance developing, and increase costs to patients and health providers.
   Objectives
   To compare six-month versus longer drug regimens to treat people that have abdominal TB.
   Search methods
   We searched the following electronic databases up to 2 September 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase (accessed via OvidSP), LILACS, INDMED, and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also checked article reference lists.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared six-month regimens versus longer regimens that consisted of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol to treat adults and children that had abdominal TB. The primary outcomes were relapse, with a minimum of six-month follow-up after completion of antituberculous treatment (ATT), and clinical cure at the end of ATT.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. For analysis of dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we pooled data from the included trials in meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
   Main results
   We included three RCTs, with 328 participants, that compared six-month regimens with nine-month regimens to treat adults with intestinal and peritoneal TB. All trials were conducted in Asia, and excluded people with HIV, those with co-morbidities and those who had received ATT in the previous five years. Antituberculous regimens were based on isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and these drugs were administered daily or thrice weekly under a directly observed therapy programme. The median duration of follow-up after completion of treatment was between 12 and 39 months.
   Relapse was uncommon, with two cases among 140 participants treated for six months, and no events among 129 participants treated for nine months. The small number of participants means we do not know whether or not there is a difference in risk of relapse between the two regimens (very low quality evidence). At the end of therapy, there was probably no difference in the proportion of participants that achieved clinical cure between six-month and nine-month regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.08; 294 participants, 3 trials, moderate quality evidence). For death, there were 2/150 (1.3%) in the six-month group and 4/144 (2.8%) in the nine-month group. All deaths occurred in the first four months of treatment, so was not linked to the duration of treatment in the included trials. Similarly, the number of participants that defaulted from treatment was small in both groups, and there may be no difference between them (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.59; 294 participants, 3 trials, low quality evidence). Only one trial reported on adherence to treatment, with only one participant allocated to the nine-month regimen presenting poor adherence to treatment. We do not know whether sixmonth regimens are associated with fewer people experiencing adverse events that lead to treatment interruption (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.55; 318 participants, 3 trials, very low quality evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   We found no evidence to suggest that six-month treatment regimens are inadequate for treating people that have intestinal and peritoneal TB, but numbers are small. We did not find any incremental benefits of nine-month regimens regarding relapse at the end of followup, or clinical cure at the end of therapy, but our confidence in the relapse estimate is very low because of size of the trials. Further research is required to make confident conclusions regarding the safety of six-month treatment for people with abdominal TB. Larger studies that include HIV-positive people, with long follow-up for detecting relapse with reliability, would help improve our knowledge around this therapeutic question.

AB  - Mixed serous neuroendocririe neoplasms are extremely rare tumors that are usually seen in female patients and are often associated with von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease. We describe the case of a 38-year-old male who presented with complaints of anorexia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. CT abdomen showed a mass in the head of the pancreas, multiple small nodules in the body of pancreas, and bilateral adrenal masses. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the mass showed features of a neuroendocrine tumor, with many of the cells demonstrating abundant clear cytoplasm. Histopathological examination of the pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen showed a mixed serous neuroendocrine neoplasm with two components viz. serous cystadenoma and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2. In addition, he was diagnosed to have bilateral pheochromocytomas and a paraganglioma. The synchronicity of these tumors suggested the possibility of VHL disease. Thus, identification of a NET with clear cells or of a mixed serous neuroendocrine neoplasm should raise suspicion of VHL disease. In a mixed tumor, FNAC may identify only one of the two components. Thorough processing of all pancreatic serous tumors for pathological examination is recommended, as NET may occur as a small nodule within the serous cystadenoma. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Insulin misperceptions are specific, widespread, incorrect beliefs about the purpose, utility, and limitations of insulin. This article, the first of a series, attempts to define and classify insulin misperceptions, while providing an overview of their sources. It lists the target audience in whom misperceptions must be addressed, and differentiates between insulin-naive and insulin-experienced users, who may hold different misperceptions. The article provides a scientific framework with which to address insulin misperceptions in a rational, effective, manner.

AB  - Objective: To identify the best performing prognostic model using admission characteristics to predict mortality at 30 days and functioning outcome at 6-months post-admission in patients with moderate or severe brain injury.
   Methods: Using a retrospective database (n = 1466 patients) of a tertiary trauma care centre, three different models were developed using logistic regression methods for predicting mortality and functioning outcome. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. The models were validated using split sample method. For facilitating clinical usefulness, score charts were derived from the regression models.
   Results: The variables motor score, hypotension, pupillary reactivity, age, creatinine level, limb movement (hemiparesis), and tSAH/IVH were found to be the most predictive independent prognostic factors of both mortality and functioning outcome. For both the outcomes, discriminative ability of the three prognostic models was excellent in the development dataset (AUC = 0.845--0.905) as well as the validation data set (AUC = 0.836-0.880). Calibration in the validation data set for model-2 was good (H-L test p-value > 0.05); however, for model-1 and model-3, it was poor (H-L test p-value < 0.05).
   Conclusion: For clinical decision-making, model-2 is recommended on the basis of good performance in predicting outcomes in patients with moderate or severe TBI in India and other similar countries.

AB  - Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent, but the therapeutic utility is limited due to its dose dependent nephrotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the nephroprotective effect of pomegranate in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Wistar rats were allocated into six groups as follows: the normal control, cisplatin-induced, pomegranate rind extract treatment (50, 100 and 200 mg kg(-1)) and pomegranate rind extract per se group. All the experimental test drugs/vehicle were administered orally for a period of ten days. Intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (8 mg kg(-1)) was administered on day 7 to all the groups except the normal control and pomegranate per se group. On day 10, cisplatin resulted in significant nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats with a drastic elevation of serum creatinine and BUN, a decline in the concentrations of GSH, MDA and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and an elevation in the TNF-alpha level in renal tissues. Pathological changes in renal tissues were examined by histopathology and dysfunction in mitochondria and proximal tubule cells was detected by transmission electron microscopy. The rate of apoptosis and the expression of caspase-3, Il-1 beta and IL-6 in rat renal tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The administration of pomegranate at a dose of 200 mg per kg body weight significantly (p < 0.001) ameliorates increased serum creatinine and BUN. In parallel to this, pomegranate also exhibits anti-apoptotic activity through the reduction of active caspase-3 expression in kidneys. Additionally, in-silico studies also confirmed a renoprotective effect of pomegranate. The above findings suggest that pomegranate can be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of cisplatin-induced kidney injury by reducing apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB  - ObjectiveTreatment guidelines for managing symptomatic terminal ileitis (TI) are lacking. We followed up a cohort of symptomatic TI patients to conduct an algorithm for their management.
   MethodsConsecutive patients with symptomatic TI from July 2007 to October 2013 were included. Symptomatic TI was defined as isolated terminal ileum ulceration (superficial or deep) and/or nodularity with abdominal symptoms. Patients were diagnosed either with intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) or Crohn's disease (CD) using standard criteria or received only symptomatic treatment according to their clinical manifestations, endoscopic, imaging and histological (specific to ITB/CD vs non-specific) features. Based upon above findings, an algorithm was conducted to differentiate non-specific TI from those with specific etiology (ITB/CD).
   ResultsIn all, 63/898 (7.0%) patients with ulcero-constrictive intestinal disease had TI, of which 45 (26 males and 19 females) were included. Fever, diarrhea, weight loss, deep ulcers, and ileal thickening were more frequently observed in patients with ITB or CD having specific treatments compared with those receiving symptomatic treatments. All patients with deep ulcers and those with superficial ulcer and specific histology had ITB/CD. In patients with superficial ulcers and/or nodularity and non-specific inflammation (n=31), the absence of fever, diarrhea, GI bleeding or weight loss had a negative predictive value of 92% in excluding ITB/CD.
   ConclusionsIn symptomatic TI patients with superficial ulcers and a non-specific histology, the absence of fever, diarrhea, GI bleeding or weight loss rules out the possibility of significant diagnoses like ITB/CD.

AB  - Cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles doped with Cu2+ and co-doped with rare earth metallic ions (Ln(3+)) have been synthesized by co-precipitation method. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction studies (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size by dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV), and photoluminescence (PL) studies. It is observed that CdS nanoparticles can be co-doped with copper and rare earth metallic ions without altering XRD pattern as indicated by X-ray diffraction results. SEM and TEM results show that synthesized particles have spherical aggregation. Absorption spectra of all the samples show strong blue shift from bulk CdS. Interesting luminescence pattern with enhanced intensity has been observed for co-doped CdS nanoparticles at room temperature.

AB  - Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is an important pathogen of acute respiratory tract infection. The G protein of hRSV is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a neutralizing antigen and is thus a vaccine candidate. In this study, synthetic codon optimized ectodomain G protein [G(TM)] of BA genotype of group B hRSV was cloned, expressed, and characterized using biophysical techniques. The molar absorption coefficient and mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm ([]222) of G (TM) was found to be 7950 M-1 cm(-1) and -19701.7 deg cm(2) dmol(-1) respectively. It was concluded that G(TM) mainly consist of -helix (74.9%) with some amount of -sheet (4%). The protein was stable up to 85 degrees C without any transition curve. However, heat-induced denaturation of G(TM) resulted in total loss of -sheet whereas not much change was observed in the -helix part of the secondary structure. It was concluded that G(TM) is an -helical protein and it is highly stable at high temperature, but could be easily denatured using high concentrations of GdmCl/urea or acidic condition. This is the first investigation of cloning, expression, and characterization of G(TM) of BA viruses from India.

AB  - The intent of this review is to comprehensively appraise the state of the art with regard to Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), with particular attention to the ocular surface complications and their management. SJS and TEN represent two ends of a spectrum of immune-mediated, dermatobullous disease, characterized in the acute phase by a febrile illness followed by skin and mucous membrane necrosis and detachment. The widespread keratinocyte death seen in SJS/TEN is rapid and irreversible, and even with early and aggressive intervention, morbidity is severe and mortality not uncommon. We have divided this review into two parts. Part I summarizes the epidemiology and immunopathogenesis of SJS/TEN and discusses systemic therapy and its possible benefits. We hope this review will help the ophthalmologist better understand the mechanisms of disease in SJS/TEN and enhance their care of patients with this complex and often debilitating disease. Part II (April 2016 issue) will focus on ophthalmic manifestations.

AB  - Stroke, a heterogeneous multifactorial disorder, is known to be a major cause of death and adult disability within both the developed and developing countries. Approximately 85% of stroke cases are ischemic, whereas the remaining 15% are hemorrhagic. It is caused by multiple genetic factors, environmental factors, and interactions among these factors. Several candidate genes have been found to be associated with ischemic stroke. The most extensively studied genes include those involved in hemostasis, inflammation, nitric oxide production, homocysteine and lipid metabolism, and rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Combined linkage/association studies have demonstrated that genes encoding phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP) confer risk for stroke. Even though there is substantial evidence for the genetic basis of stroke as provided by the epidemiological data from twin-and family-based studies, the contribution of genetic factors identified till now is either not enough or very less to explain the entire spectrum of encountered phenomena associated with ischemic stroke. Till date, no genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out in India. We aim to extensively review the studies on candidate genes that may have potential applications in the early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of ischemic stroke in the Indian population. This article further emphasizes the role of GWAS in ischemic stroke and the need for an extensive GWAS in the Indian population.

AB  - Purpose: Lymphotoxin alpha (LTA), a proinflammatory cytokine, plays an important role in promoting atherosclerosis which is an independent risk factor for stroke. Recent genetic studies have suggested that polymorphisms in the LTA gene, which affect its expression and biological function, may contribute to the development of stroke. The aim of this case-control study was to determine the association between LTA (-252 A/G and -804 C/A) gene polymorphisms and risk of stroke. Methods: Genotyping was determined by using SNaPshot method for 250 ischemic stroke (IS) patients, 250 age and sex matched IS free controls, 100 intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients and 100 age and sex matched ICH free controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis with adjusting multiple demographic and risk factor variables was used to calculate the strength of association between LTA (-252 A/G and -804 C/A) gene polymorphisms and risk of stroke. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) was analyzed by using HaploView 4.2 software. Results: The distribution of LTA (-252 A/G and -804 C/A) genotypes was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis showed no significant association between LTA (-252 A/G and -804 C/A) gene polymorphisms and risk of both IS and ICH. Based on Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification, a significant association between LTA -252 A/G gene polymorphism and small vessel disease subtype of IS under dominant model (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.03-4.12; p value 0.04) with the risk of IS was observed. No LD was observed for both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in north Indian population. Conclusion: Neither -252 G/A nor -804 C/A polymorphism of the LTA gene was found to be associated with overall stroke as well as any subtype of IS excluding SVD in North Indian population.

AB  - Early evaluation of the pyramidal tract using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a prerequisite to decide the optimal treatment or to assess appropriate rehabilitation. The early predictive value of DTI for assessing motor and functional recovery in ischemic stroke (IS) has yielded contradictory results. The purpose is to systematically review and summarize the current available literature on the value of Fractional Anisotropy (FA) parameter of the DTI in predicting upper limb motor recovery after sub-acute IS. MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Cochrane CENTRAL searches were conducted from January 1, 1950, to July 31, 2015, which was supplemented with relevant articles identified in the references. Correlation between FA and upper limb motor recovery measure was done. Heterogeneity was examined using Higgins I-squared, Tau-squared. Summary of correlation coefficient was determined using Random Effects model. Out of 166 citations, only eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review and six studies were included in the meta analysis. A random effects model revealed that DTI parameter FA is a significant predictor for upper limb motor recovery after sub-acute IS [Correlation Coefficient=0.82; 95% Confidence Interval-0.66 to 0.90, P value < 0.001]. Moderate heterogeneity was observed (Tau squared = 0.12, I-squared = 62.14). The studies reported so far on correlation between DTI and upper limb motor recovery are few with small sample sizes. This meta-analysis suggests strong correlation between DTI parameter FA and upper limb motor recovery. Well-designed prospective trials embedded with larger sample size are required to establish these findings.

AB  - Background: Polymorphisms of G174C and C572G in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) promoter gene can affect both transcription and secretion of IL-6 and may be involved in inflammation related to and pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). Whether these IL-6 gene polymorphisms are risk factors for IS or not, remains controversial.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association between IL-6 G174C and C572G gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to ischemic stroke in North Indian Population.
   Methods: Two hundred and fifty IS patients and 250 age-and sex-matched controls were studied. Genotyping was performed using SNaPshot method. Stroke was classified using Trial of Org 10172 in acute stroke treatment classification. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the strength of association between IL-6 (G174C and C572G) polymorphisms and risk of IS.
   Results: Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, alcohol, smoking, family history of stroke, sedentary life style and low socioeconomic status were found to be associated with the risk of IS. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of IL-6 G174C with the risk of IS under dominant model (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4; P value 0.02) and allelic model (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P value 0.02). For IL-6 C572G, multivariate adjusted analysis showed a significant association with the risk of IS under dominant model for overall IS (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.04-3.15; P value 0.03) and small vessel disease subtype of IS (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0; P value 0.006).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that IL-6 (G174C) polymorphism is significantly associated with the risk of IS in North Indian population. However, IL-6 (C572G) polymorphism is found significantly associated with the risk of IS after adjusting the demographic and risk factors variables. Prospective studies with large sample size are required for independent validation. Our findings could be helpful in identifying individuals at increased risk for developing IS.

AB  - The role of anti-inflammatory Interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine gene polymorphism with the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) remains controversial. The aim of present meta-analysis was to investigate the association of IL-10 (-1082 A/G) gene polymorphism with the risk of IS. A literature search for candidate gene association studies published before 29 February 2016 was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and TRIP database. The following search terms were used: 'Interleukin-10' or 'IL-10' and 'Ischemic stroke' or 'IS' and 'Cerebral Infarction' or 'CI' and 'genetic polymorphism' or 'single nucleotide polymorphisms' or 'SNP'. Fixed or random effects models were used to estimate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Begg's funnel plot was used to assess the potential for publication bias. In our meta-analysis, five case-control studies involving 1209 IS cases and 1139 controls were included. Overall, there was no significant association between IL-10 (-1082 A/G) [rs1800896] and risk of IS under dominant [AA + AG vs. GG], recessive [AA vs. AG + GG], and allelic [G vs. A] models. However, based on Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification, we observed significant association of IL-10 (-1082 A/G) gene polymorphism with the risk of IS for Large Vessel Disease (LVD), Small Vessel Disease (SVD), and other (others due to determined and undetermined etiology) subtypes of IS. This is the first meta-analysis to conclude that IL-10-1082A/ G gene polymorphism is associated with the risk of LVD, SVD, and other subtypes of IS. Further well-designed large sample size studies based on TOAST classification are needed to validate these findings.

AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the anti-arthritic activity of Berberis aristata hydroalcoholic extract (BAHE) in formaldehyde-induced arthritis and adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model. Arthritis was induced by administration of either formaldehyde (2% v/v) or CFA into the subplantar surface of the hind paw of the animal. In formaldehyde-induced arthritis and AIA, treatment of BAHE at doses 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg orally significantly decreased joint inflammation as evidenced by decrease in joint diameter and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in histopathological examination. BAHE treatment demonstrated dose-dependent improvement in the redox status of synovium (decrease in GSH, MDA, and NO levels and increase in SOD and CAT activities). The beneficial effect of BAHE was substantiated with decreased expression of inflammatory markers such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-R1, and VEGF by immunohistochemistry analysis in AIA model. BAHE increased HO-1/Nrf-2 and suppressed NF-B mRNA and protein expression in adjuvant immunized joint. Additionally, BAHE abrogated degrading enzymes, as there was decreased protein expression of MMP-3 and -9 in AIA. In conclusion, we demonstrated the anti-arthritic activity of Berberis aristata hydroalcoholic extract via the mechanism of inhibition of NF-B and activation of Nrf-2/HO-1.

AB  - The present study investigates the anti-arthritic activity of Picrorhiza kurroa (PK), on formaldehyde and adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rat. Administration of Picrorhiza kurroa rhizome extract (PKRE) significantly inhibited joint inflammation in both animal models. In AIA-induced arthritic rat, treatment with PKRE considerably decreased synovial expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1) and vascular endothelial growth factor as compared with control. The anti-arthritic activity was found to be well substantiated with significant suppression of oxidative and inflammatory markers as there was decreased malonaldehyde, Nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha levels accompanied with increased glutathione and superoxide dismutase, catalase activities. Additionally, PKRE significantly inhibited the expression of degrading enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases-3 and matrix metalloproteinases-9 in AIA-induced arthritic rat. Histopathology of paw tissue displayed decreased inflammatory cell infiltration as compared with control. Taken together, these results demonstrated the anti-arthritic activity of PKRE against experimental arthritis, and the underlying mechanism behind this efficacy might be mediated by inhibition of inflammatory mediators and angiogenesis, improvement of the synovium redox status and decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinases.

AB  - Cell adhesion mediated-drug resistance (CAM-DR) is designated as the culprit of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). c-Myc and VEGF overexpression in MM is correlated with MM progression and CAM-DR in bone marrow microenvironment, c-Myc is responsible for hyperproliferation of myeloma cells whereas VEGF induces angiogenesis to support the hyperproliferation. Hence, c-Myc and VEGF represent the promiscuous targets in MM. In this study, we have examined online databases to verify the severity of c-Myc and VEGF expression in MM. Effect of differentiation inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) was studied by treating RPMI8226 cells with DIF-1 (10 mu M) followed by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and cell proliferation by XTT. DIF-1 targets c-Myc and VEGF expression at both transcriptional and translational level in RPMI8226 cells. DIF-1 activates GSK-3 beta, which may influence c-Myc and VEGF expression. Hence, DIF-1 inhibits cell proliferation of MM cells. Our report is a maiden attempt to reveal that DIF-1 could act as an adjunct drug to overcome chemoresistance in MM in future.

AB  - High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is an extremely versatile, highly conserved nuclear protein, with its unique intracellular and extracellular functions mediated by its relatively simple domain structure. Within the nucleus, HMGB1 binds to DNA minor groove in a nonspecific manner and causes bends in the double helix thus helps in recruiting a number of DNA binding protein and transcription factors, to facilitate transcription of various genes. HMGB1 also helps in DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, V (D) J recombination, and assembly of nucleosome on the chromatin. On contrary, under pathological conditions HMGB1 displays inflammatory response by interaction with specific cell surface receptors like RAGE, TLR-4, TLR9, and TLR2 and activates NF-kB downstream signaling pathways. The upregulation of HMGB1 is directly associated with the pathogenesis of cancer, sepsis, ischemia, hemorrhagic shock, anorexia, rheumatic disease, periodontal disease etc. Therefore, HMGB1 has been considered as a promising target in the treatment of various human diseases. The interest in HMGB1 is evident and reflected in the exponential increase in the recent publications, and therefore there is a need for an update on the understanding of the role of HMGB1 in pathogenesis and its potential application of HMGB1 as a therapeutic target in a number of human diseases.

AB  - Adriamycin and actinomycin are frequently used anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. The resistance and side effects are the major drawbacks that have been attributed to their nonspecific nature of binding to DNA. Therefore, one efficient strategy is to target drug-delivery to sequence/and structure specific DNA regions so that higher potency can be achieved. We have chosen a positive regulatory region (-183 to -165 from the transcription start site) in the hmgb1 gene as the sequence specific target and also made DNA triplex (of the same region) as a structure specific target for anti-cancer drugs. The conformational and binding characteristics were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding results showed that in presence of the triplex forming oligonucleotide, the DNA triplex formed by the target DNA had higher binding affinity to the drugs as compared to the DNA duplex alone. The results suggest that an anti-gene approach of DNA triplex in combination with an anti-cancer drug be used as a preferential option in achieving higher efficacy. Furthermore, the DNA triplex structure-specific target can alleviate unwanted side effects from anti-cancer drugs.

AB  - Background: Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (c-TBNA) is an underutilized bronchoscopic modality. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided-TBNA though efficacious is an expensive modality, facilities of which are available at only limited centers. c-TBNA is cost-effective and has potential for wide utilization especially in resource-limited settings. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) improves the yield of c-TBNA. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of the bronchoscopy records (May 2012 to July 2014) was performed. The patients who underwent c-TBNA with ROSE were included in the study and their clinical details were extracted. Convex probe EBUS-TBNA was being regularly performed during the study period by the operators performing c-TBNA. Results: c-TBNA with ROSE was performed in 41 patients with mean age of 42.4 (16.2) years. The most frequently sampled node stations (> 90% patients) were the subcarinal and lower right paratracheal. Representative samples could be obtained in 33 out of the 41 patients (80.4%). c-TBNA was diagnostic in 32 [tuberculosis (TB)-8, sarcoidosis-9, and malignancy-15] patients out of the 41 patients. The overall diagnostic yield (sensitivity) of c-TBNA with ROSE was 78%. Mean procedure duration was 18.4 (3.1) min and there were no procedural complications. Conclusion: c-TBNA with ROSE is a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective bronchoscopic modality. When it was performed by operators routinely performing EBUS-TBNA, diagnostic yields similar to that of EBUS-TBNA can be obtained. Even at the centers where EBUS facilities are available, c-TBNA should be routinely performed.

AB  - Corneal ectasias include a group of disorders characterised by progressive thinning, bulging and distortion of the cornea. Keratoconus is the most common disease in this group. Other manifestations include pellucid marginal degeneration, Terrien's marginal degeneration, keratoglobus and ectasias following surgery. Advanced ectasias usually present with loss of vision due to high irregular astigmatism. Management of these disorders is difficult due to the peripheral location of ectasia and associated severe corneal thinning. Newer contact lenses such as scleral lenses are helpful in a selected group of patients. A majority of these cases requires surgical intervention. This review provides an update on the current treatment modalities available for management of advanced corneal ectasias.

AB  - Salzmann's nodular degeneration (SND) is a rare, noninflammatory, slowly progressive degenerative disease of the cornea that is characterized by the appearance of nodular bluish gray opacities that vary in number and size. It is usually bilateral; most commonly occurring in people aged 50-60 years old, with a female preponderance; and often associated with a history of prior corneal inflammation. The clinical features usually depend on the location of the nodules. Generally, the nodules of SND are bluish white to gray in color, 1-2 mm in size, and round, conical or prismatic in shape. The overlying Bowman's layer is usually absent from the nodular areas and is partially replaced by granular Periodic Acid Schiff-positive eosinophilic material resembling the basement membrane. Diagnostic investigations include ultrasonic pachymetry, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and confocal microscopy. The majority of patients respond well to conservative management with topical lubricants; severe cases may require surgical intervention. The various surgical modalities described include superficial keratectomy, which may be combined with phototherapeutic keratectomy and keratoplasty. Various modifications of these procedures include the use of alcohol-assisted epithelial delamination, intraoperative mitomycin-C or amniotic membrane transplantation to make the procedure easy, reduce the risk of recurrence and improve postoperative comfort. Recurrences are rarely reported; overall, the visual prognosis following treatment is optimal.

AB  - Context: Retention in treatment can improve the outcomes of patients with substance use disorders. Aims: This study aimed to assess the predictors of treatment retention in a set of patients admitted with substance use disorders. Setting and Design: This record-based study was conducted among consecutive patients discharged from the inpatient unit of a tertiary care de-addiction facility in Northern India. Materials and Methods: Patients were classified as being retained in treatment or drop-outs based on follow-up records. Statistical Analysis: Those who were retained and those who dropped out were compared using appropriate parametric and nonparametric tests. Logistic regression was used to find out the predictors of retention in treatment. Results: A total of 88 case records were evaluated. All subjects were males and majority of the sample was married, educated up to 10 (th) grade, employed, belonged to the nuclear family and urban background. Opioid dependence syndrome (96.6%) was the most common substance use disorder identified. Guilt feelings, general weakness of body, and loss of social respect were the most common substance-related complications experienced. Of the total sample, 40 (45.4%) were classified as retained into treatment. Higher socioeconomic status and having a family member with substance use was associated with higher chances of treatment retention. Conclusion: Identification of patient characteristics predicting drop-outs can help in targeting those individuals at higher risk. This can help in more favorable patient outcomes.

AB  - India is an ancient country with a vast population, diverse geography and culture. Although sleep medicine has been rapidly progressing during the last decade in the country, the ancient Indian literature is rich in descriptions of sleep physiology and the importance of sleep in life. In spite of rapid industrialization and the emergence of a modern 24/7 h society, knowledge about sleep and its disorders is lacking amongst the general public and doctors. A need is felt to raise the level of awareness of sleep to that of the level of nutrition and exercise. There is shortage of trained certified sleep specialists and technicians to meet the emerging demand. A need is felt to provide standardized sleep health care service. The role of professional sleep societies, industry, private enterprises and government agencies in promoting sleep medicine education in the country is emphasized. Vertical integration of education in sleep physiology and disorders, from school level to graduate and postgraduate medical education, is advocated. To create specialists in the discipline, horizontal integration with physiology, neurology, psychiatry and pulmonary medicine is a viable solution in this multidisciplinary subject. The government should recognize sleep as an important public health issue.

AB  - In the treatment of medial osteoarthritis secondary to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury there is no consensus about optimum treatment, with both high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) being viable options. The aim of this review was to compare the outcomes of these treatments, both with or without ACL reconstruction.
   EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Clinical Trials Registers were searched to identify relevant studies. Studies meeting pre-defined inclusion criteria were assessed independently by two researchers for methodological quality and data extracted.
   Twenty-six studies involving 771 patients were identified for inclusion. No randomized controlled trials were identified. Seventeen studies reported outcomes following HTO and nine studies reported outcomes following UKA. HTO patients were significantly younger than those receiving UKA, and ACL reconstruction patients were younger than non-reconstructed patients. Treatment with HTO ACL reconstruction had the lowest revision rate (0.62/100 observed component years) but the highest rate of complications (4.61/100 observed component years). Too little data were available to test for differences in outcome between different surgical techniques or prosthesis designs.
   Limited conclusions about the optimum treatment can be made due to the absence of controlled trials. In patients treated with HTO ACL reconstruction, the high complication rate likely outweighs its minimally superior survival. Outcomes following UKA ACL reconstruction are similar to outcomes for UKA in the ACL intact knee without any increase in complications. As such in patients meeting indications for UKA, UKA ACL reconstruction should be performed with further work required to identify the optimum treatment in other patient groups.

AB  - Serum messenger RNA (mRNA) is an emerging prognostic tool for noninvasive malignant disease prognosis, and to study serum mRNA may have importance in the prognosis and detection of disease. This study aimed to evaluate the possible prognostic role of serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expressions in lung adenocarcinoma patients. One hundred newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma patients and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Expression was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR and overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expressions was found to be significantly associated with distant metastases and TNM stages. It was observed that patients with distant metastases had 4.8- and 3.4-fold high ERBB3 and ERBB4 expression in contrast to patients without distant metastases, respectively. It was also found that ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expression was 7.7-fold and 6.7-fold high in TNM stage IV compared to TNM stage I, respectively. Significantly, 2.6-fold increased serum ERBB4 mRNA expression was found in patients with pleural effusion compared to patients without pleural effusion (p = 0.005). Lung adenocarcinoma patients with a parts per thousand currency sign8- and > 8-fold increased serum ERBB3 mRNA expression had 10.0 and 5.5 months of overall median survival while serum ERBB4 mRNA with a parts per thousand currency sign10- and > 10-fold increased expression showed 11.4 and 5.0 months overall median survival, respectively. ERBB3 and ERBB4 together also found to be significantly associated with poor overall median survival. Patients with a parts per thousand currency sign8 + a parts per thousand currency sign10- and > 8 + > 10-fold expression showed 11.3 vs 4.8 months of overall median survival, respectively. In conclusion, serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA expressions may be a prognostic marker and monitoring of serum ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA can be one of the predictive factors for metastases and poor overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients.

AB  - Objectives: The signaling pathways upstream of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) get reduced during ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in hyperlipidemic rat heart. Pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, exerts cardioprotection through GSK-3. The objective of the study is to investigate the role of pioglitazone on the attenuated cardioprotective effect of IPC in hyperlipidemic rat heart.
   Materials and Methods: The rats were administered high-fat diet for 8 weeks to induce experimental hyperlipidemia (HL). After mounting on a Langendorff apparatus, isolated perfused hearts were given four cycles of IPC; each consists of 5 min of both ischemia and reperfusion followed by 30 min of ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. Insulin (50 mU/ml) was perfused alone and in combination with pioglitazone (2 M), while in other groups, this combination was repeated with wortmannin (100 nM), a selective PI3K inhibitor and rapamycin (1 nM), a selective mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, separately, and in combination. Myocardial injury was assessed by measuring infarct size and the levels of creatinine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the coronary effluent.
   Results: IPC significantly decreased the infarct size and levels of LDH and CK-MB in normal but not in HL rat heart. Perfusion of insulin along with pioglitazone significantly reduced the infarct size and release of CK-MB and LDH in IPC-treated HL rat hearts. Perfusion of wortmannin or rapamycin alone significantly and in combination almost completely abolished the pioglitazone-induced restored cardioprotection (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Cardioprotective effect of IPC gets lost in hyperlipidemic rat heart. The results suggest that perfusion of pioglitazone restored the cardioprotective effect of IPC in hyperlipidemic rat heart, an effect that may be via PI3K and mTOR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasms worldwide and accounts for more deaths than any other cancer. The clinicopathological profile of lung cancer has shown marked regional and geographical variation. AIMS: We aimed to compare the demographic and pathological profile of lung cancer patients from North India with other Indian and International series. SETTING AND DESIGN: A retrospective study over a period of 5 years from January 2008 to May 2013 was conducted in the Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 397 newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer from January 2008 to May 2013 were included in the study. The clinical, demographic, and pathological features were reviewed and compared with other major National and International reports. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc. Released 2009. PASW Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0. Chicago: SPSS Inc. RESULTS: A total of 397 patients (86% men, mean age 57.8 years) were studied. The ratio of men to women was 7.4. Majority of patients (78.3%) were current/previous smokers. Small cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 14.6% (58) of patients while 85.4% (339) had nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Within NSCLC, the most common histology types were squamous cell carcinoma (30%), followed closely by adenocarcinoma (ADC) (28.3%) and large cell carcinoma (1.7%). Majority (87%) of the patient were staged III and IV. About 30.1% patients received anti-tubercular treatment during the current episode before a diagnosis of lung cancer was made. CONCLUSION: The clinicopathological profile of lung cancer has undergone noticeable changes over the last four decades, especially in the increase in ADC incidence and their frequent presence in smokers. Lung cancer is often mistreated as tuberculosis in the Indian subcontinent and hence continues to be diagnosed late.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are common worldwide, causing nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication. Evidence: A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describes the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence. Process: Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus. Results: This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts. Conclusion: Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel and The Endocrine Society

AB  - Granular cell tumor (GCT) is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor that uncommonly occurs in the lung and tracheobronchial tree. Small cell carcinoma of lung is a centrally located malignant neoplasm that commonly occurs in elderly smokers. Concomitant existence of both the neoplasm in lung is extremely rare with only one reported case in the literature. Few rare combinations of GCT with other primary bronchogenic carcinomas have also been reported. Clinical symptoms depend upon the site and size of the tumor. Definitive diagnosis is by histopathological and proper immunohistochemical analysis. Identification of this entity is important as treatment requires individual therapy protocols that depend on the presence of metastasis, location of the tumors, and type of bronchogenic carcinoma.

AB  - Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of ultrafine size have drawn attention for their use in drug delivery systems. Tissue toxicity may be an issue when AuNPs are used for such applications. We investigated the long-term biokinetics (90 d), redistribution, and urinary excretion of three different-sized (2 +/- 0.5nm, 5 +/- 1 nm, and 10 +/- 2 nm) AuNPs after a single intravenous (i. v.) administration of 1250 mu g/kg dose in mice. ICP-AES analysis of lungs, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, brain, blood, and urine revealed highest accumulation of gold in spleen around 15 d after injection. A low concentration was detected in brain after 1 d without any residual AuNPs after 30 d. Ultrastructural study of brain tissue also showed few AuNPs in lysosome with no changes in cellular architecture. Renal retention of AuNPs was limited indicating low nephrotoxic potential. AuNPs were detectable in urine till 30 d after single injection indicating slow excretion from the body. No evidence of significant toxicity was observed in hemogram, serum biochemistry, and tissue histology. No mortality, changes in behavior, hair color, weight, and food intake was observed as compared to control mice. Therefore, we conclude that the ultrafine AuNPs are predominantly excreted in urine without any systemic toxicity following i.v. administration and are hence safe for use in drug delivery systems.

AB  - Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent and widely used anthracycline antibiotic for the treatment of several malignancies. Unfortunately, the clinical utility of DOX is often restricted due to the elicitation of organ toxicity. Particularly, the increased risk for the development of dilated cardiomyopathy by DOX among the cancer survivors warrants major attention from the physicians as well as researchers to develop adjuvant agents to neutralize the noxious effects of DOX on the healthy myocardium. Despite these pitfalls, the use of traditional cytotoxic drugs continues to be the mainstay treatment for several types of cancer. Recently, phytochemicals have gained attention for their anticancer, chemopreventive, and cardioprotective activities. The ideal cardioprotective agents should not compromise the clinical efficacy of DOX and should be devoid of cumulative or irreversible toxicity on the naive tissues. Furthermore, adjuvants possessing synergistic anticancer activity and quelling of chemoresistance would significantly enhance the clinical utility in combating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The present review renders an overview of cardioprotective effects of plant-derived small molecules and their purported mechanisms against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Phytochemicals serve as the reservoirs of pharmacophore which can be utilized as templates for developing safe and potential novel cardioprotective agents in combating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Background: High retention rates have been documented among patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Myanmar. However, there is no information on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals in care before initiation of ART (pre-ART care). We assessed attrition (loss-to-follow-up [LTFU] and death) rates among HIV-infected individuals in pre-ART care and their associated factors over a 4-year period.
   Design: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted routinely collected data of HIV-infected adults ( > 15 years old) entering pre-ART care (June 2011-June 2014) as part of an Integrated HIV Care (IHC) programme, Myanmar. Attrition rates per 100 person-years and cumulative incidence of attrition were calculated. Factors associated with attrition were examined by calculating hazard ratios (HRs).
   Results: Of 18,037 HIV-infected adults enrolled in the IHC programme, 11,464 (63%) entered pre-ART care (60% men, mean age 37 years, median cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count 160 cells/mu L). Of the 11,464 eligible participants, 3,712 (32%) underwent attrition of which 43% were due to deaths and 57% were due to LTFU. The attrition rate was 78 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 75-80). The cumulative incidence of attrition was 70% at the end of a 4-year follow-up, of which nearly 90% occurred in the first 6 months. Male sex (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6), WHO clinical Stage 3 and 4, CD4 count < 200 cells/mu L, abnormal BMI, and anaemia were statistically significant predictors of attrition.
   Conclusions: Pre-ART care attrition among persons living with HIV in Myanmar was alarmingly high - with most attrition occurring within the first 6 months. Strategies aimed at improving early HIV diagnosis and initiation of ART are needed. Suggestions include comprehensive nutrition support and intensified monitoring to prevent pre-ART care attrition by tracking patients who do not return for pre-ART care appointments. It is high time that Myanmar moves towards a 'test and treat' approach and ultimately eliminates the need for pre-ART care.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was previously thought to be rare in Asia, but emerging data indicate rising incidence and prevalence of IBD in the region. The Asia Pacific Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease was established in Cebu, Philippines, at the Asia Pacific Digestive Week conference in 2006 under the auspices of the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology with the goal of developing best management practices, coordinating research, and raising awareness of IBD in the region. The consensus group previously published recommendations for the diagnosis and management of ulcerative colitis with specific relevance to the Asia-Pacific region. The present consensus statements were developed following a similar process to address the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of Crohn's disease. The goals of these statements are to pool the pertinent literature specifically highlighting relevant data and conditions in the Asia-Pacific region relating to the economy, health systems, background infectious diseases, differential diagnoses, and treatment availability. It does not intend to be all comprehensive and future revisions are likely to be required in this ever-changing field.

AB  - Background
   Brain tumour surgery usually is carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia. Over past years, both intravenous and inhalational anaesthetic agents have been used, but the superiority of one agent over the other is a topic of ongoing debate. Early and rapid emergence from anaesthesia is desirable for most neurosurgical patients. With the availability of newer intravenous and inhalational anaesthetic agents, all of which have inherent advantages and disadvantages, we remain uncertain as to which technique may result in more rapid early recovery from anaesthesia.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of intravenous versus inhalational techniques for rapid emergence from anaesthesia in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 6) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1966 to June 2014) and Embase via Ovid SP (1980 to June 2014). We also searched specific websites, such as www.indmed.nic.in, www.cochrane-sadcct.org and www.Clinicaltrials.gov (October 2014). We reran the searches for all databases in March 2016, and when we update the review, we will deal with the two studies of interest found through this search that are awaiting classification.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of intravenous anaesthetic agents such as propofol and thiopentone with inhalational anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane and sevoflurane for maintenance of general anaesthesia during brain tumour surgery. Primary outcomes were emergence from anaesthesia (assessed by time to follow verbal commands, in minutes) and adverse events during emergence, such as haemodynamic changes, agitation, desaturation, muscle weakness, nausea and vomiting, shivering and pain. Secondary outcomes were time to eye opening, recovery from anaesthesia using the Aldrete or Modified Aldrete score (i.e. time to attain score >= 9, in minutes), opioid consumption, brain relaxation (as assessed by the surgeon on a 4-or 5-point scale) and complications of anaesthetic techniques, such as intraoperative haemodynamic instability in terms of hypotension or hypertension (mmHg), increased or decreased heart rate (beats/min) and brain swelling.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standardized methods in conducting the systematic review, as described by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors independently extracted details of trialmethods and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We performed all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a fixed-effect model when we found no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies, and a random-effects model when heterogeneity was likely. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs only, we downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect or potential publication bias.
   Main results
   We included 15 RCTs with 1833 participants. We determined that none of the RCTs were of high methodological quality. For our primary outcomes, pooled results from two trials suggest that time to emergence from anaesthesia, that is, time needed to follow verbal commands, was longer with isoflurane than with propofol (mean difference (MD) -3.29 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.41 to -1.18, low-quality evidence), and time to emergence from anaesthesia was not different with sevoflurane compared with propofol (MD 0.28 minutes slower with sevoflurane, 95% CI -0.56 to 1.12, four studies, low-quality evidence). Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest lower risk of nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, low-quality evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78) and greater risk of haemodynamic changes with propofol than with sevoflurane (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.17), but no differences in the risk of shivering or pain. Pooled analyses for brain relaxation suggest lower risk of tense brain with propofol than with isoflurane (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, low-quality evidence), but no difference when propofol is compared with sevoflurane.
   Authors' conclusions
   The finding of our review is that the intravenous technique is comparable with the inhalational technique of using sevoflurane to provide early emergence from anaesthesia. Adverse events with both techniques are also comparable. However, we derived evidence of low quality from a limited number of studies. Use of isoflurane delays emergence from anaesthesia. These results should be interpreted with caution. Randomized controlled trials based on uniform and standard methods are needed. Researchers should follow proper methods of randomization and blinding, and trials should be adequately powered.

AB  - Background
   Rocuronium bromide is a routinely used muscle relaxant in anaesthetic practice. Its use, however, is associated with intense pain on injection. While it is well established that rocuronium bromide injection causes pain in awake patients, anaesthetized patients also tend to show withdrawal movements of the limbs when this muscle relaxant is administered. Various strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, have been studied to reduce the incidence and severity of pain on rocuronium bromide injection. We wanted to find out which of the existing modalities was best to reduce pain on rocuronium injection.
   Objectives
   The objectives of this review were to assess the ability of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce or eliminate the pain that accompanies rocuronium bromide administration.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1966 to July 2013) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1980 to July 2013). We also searched specific websites. We reran the searches in February 2015 and will deal with the 11 studies of interest found through this search when we update the review.
   Selection criteria
   We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any drug or a non-pharmacological method with control patients, or those receiving no treatment to reduce the severity of pain with rocuronium injection. Our primary outcome was pain on rocuronium bromide injection measured by a pain score assessment. Our secondary outcomes were rise in heart rate and blood pressure following administration of rocuronium and adverse events related to the interventions.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used the standardized methods for conducting a systematic review as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We made all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a fixed-effect model where there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies and a random-effects model if heterogeneity was likely.
   Main results
   We included 66 studies with 7840 participants in the review, though most analyses were based on data from fewer participants. In total there are 17 studies awaiting classification. No studies were at a low risk of bias. We noted substantial statistical and clinical heterogeneity between trials. Most of the studies reported the primary outcome pain as assessed by verbal response from participants in an awake state but some trials reported withdrawal of the injected limb as a proxy for pain after induction of anaesthesia in response to rocuronium administration. Few studies reported adverse events and no study reported heart rate and blood pressure changes after administration of rocuronium. Lidocaine was the most commonly studied intervention drug, used in 29 trials with 2256 participants. The risk ratio (RR) of pain on injection if given lidocaine compared to placebo was 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.31; I-2 = 65%, low quality of evidence). The RR of pain on injection if fentanyl and remifentanil were given compared to placebo was 0.42 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.70; I-2 = 79%, low quality of evidence) and (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.26; I-2 = 74%, low quality of evidence), respectively. Pain on injection of intervention drugs was reported with the use of lidocaine and acetaminophen in one study. Cough was reported with the use of fentanyl (one study), remifentanil (five studies, low quality evidence) and alfentanil (one study). Breath holding and chest tightness were reported with the use of remifentanil in two studies (very low quality evidence) and one study (very low quality evidence), respectively. The overall rate of complications was low.
   Authors' conclusions
   The evidence to suggest that the most commonly investigated pharmacological interventions reduce pain on injection of rocuronium is of low quality due to risk of bias and inconsistency. There is low or very low quality evidence for adverse events, due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision of effect. We did not compare the various interventions with one another and so cannot comment on the superiority of one intervention over another. Complications were reported more often with use of opioids.

AB  - Insulin resistance is associated with endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can lead to impaired vascular reactivities of both systemic and cerebral circulations. Appropriate 'correction' of vascular reactivity results for non-endothelium-dependent systemic effects avoids misinterpretation of endothelial function. Therefore, we 'corrected' vascular reactivity results and explored the potential correlations between systemic vascular reactivity, cerebrovascular reactivity and insulin resistance. In 34 patients, 'systemic vascular reactivity' was assessed by quantifying reactive hyperaemia. Cerebrovascular reactivity was assessed by quantifying changes in cerebral blood flow velocity during hypercapnia. To minimize the influence of non-endothelium-dependent systemic effects on vascular reactivity results, 'corrected systemic vascular reactivity' was calculated by normalizing systemic vascular reactivity using the measurements from the contralateral side; and cerebrovascular reactivity results were corrected by calculating percentage and absolute changes in cerebrovascular conductance index ('percent cerebrovascular conductance index' and 'delta cerebrovascular conductance index', respectively). Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostatic model assessment. Correlation between conventional cerebrovascular reactivity and systemic vascular reactivity was not significant. But correlations between 'corrected systemic vascular reactivity' and 'percent cerebrovascular conductance index' (r=0.51; p=0.002) and 'corrected systemic vascular reactivity' and 'delta cerebrovascular conductance index' (r=0.50; p=0.003) were significant. Among all vascular reactivity parameters, only 'delta cerebrovascular conductance index' was significantly correlated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (r=-0.38; p=0.029). In conclusion, endothelial function in the systemic and cerebral circulations is moderately correlated, provided that vascular reactivity estimates are corrected for non-endothelium-dependent influences.

AB  - Background: Perceptions of individuals with opioid dependence regarding medications used for long-term management of the condition have been explored only by a handful of studies. Interestingly, no study had compared the perceptions regarding buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone, and oral naltrexone in the opioid-dependent subjects from the same setting. Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the perceptions related to treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone, and oral naltrexone among individuals seeking help at a tertiary care center. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, observational study with consecutive sampling. Sociodemographic data, Drug Abuse Monitoring System questionnaire, perceptions questionnaire, clinical interview to elicit drug use history, treatment history and details of prior abstinence attempts were completed. Results: Eighty-five subjects were recruited in the study. Fear of becoming dependent (35.3%) was the most commonharm reported while withdrawal control (82.4%) was the most common benefit reported with buprenorphine preparations. Precipitated withdrawals (21.2%) were the most common harm reported and prevention of relapse (53%) was the most common benefit reported with oral naltrexone. While patients who believed that buprenorphine or naltrexone were harmful reported durations of treatment that were much shorter than those who did not so believe, there was no statistically significant difference in the actual duration and period of abstinence (p = .34; p = .62). Sociodemographic profile, perceptions related to dosing, nature of medication, expectations from treatment, and duration of illness were also described.

AB  - Background
   Tuberculous meningitis is a serious form of tuberculosis ( TB) that affects the meninges that cover a person's brain and spinal cord. It is associated with high death rates and with disability in people who survive. Corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct to antituberculous drugs to treat people with tuberculous meningitis, but their role has been controversial.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effects of corticosteroids as an adjunct to antituberculous treatment on death and severe disability in people with tuberculous meningitis.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register up to the 18 March 2016; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and Current Controlled Trials. We also contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked reference lists.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials that compared corticosteroid plus antituberculous treatment with antituberculous treatment alone in people with clinically diagnosed tuberculous meningitis and included death or disability as outcome measures.
   Data collection and analysis
   We independently assessed search results and methodological quality, and extracted data from the included trials. We analysed the data using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used a fixed-effect model. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, where we included all participants randomized to treatment in the denominator. This analysis assumes that all participants who were lost to follow-up have good outcomes. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the missing data.
   Main results
   Nine trials that included 1337 participants (with 469 deaths) met the inclusion criteria.
   At follow-up from three to 18 months, steroids reduce deaths by almost one quarter (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; nine trials, 1337 participants, high quality evidence). Disabling neurological deficit is not common in survivors, and steroids may have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; eight trials, 1314 participants, low quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in the incidence of adverse events, which included gastrointestinal bleeding, invasive bacterial infections, hyperglycaemia, and liver dysfunction.
   One trial followed up participants for five years. The effect on death was no longer apparent at this time-point (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; one trial, 545 participants, moderate quality evidence); and there was no difference in disabling neurological deficit detected (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.69; one trial, 545 participants, low quality evidence).
   One trial included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive people. The stratified analysis by HIV status in this trial showed no heterogeneity, with point estimates for death (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.20; one trial, 98 participants) and disability (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 19.07; one trial, 98 participants) similar to HIV-negative participants in the same trial.
   Authors' conclusions
   Corticosteroids reduce mortality from tuberculous meningitis, at least in the short term.
   Corticosteroids may have no effect on the number of people who survive tuberculous meningitis with disabling neurological deficit, but this outcome is less common than death, and the CI for the relative effect includes possible harm. However, this small possible harm is unlikely to be quantitatively important when compared to the reduction in mortality.
   The number of HIV-positive people included in the review is small, so we are not sure if the benefits in terms of reduced mortality are preserved in this group of patients.

AB  - Sestrins (sesn) are highly conserved proteins that play an important neuroprotective role, in part as a consequence of their antioxidative capacity, which prevents reactive oxygen species formation. In this study, we evaluated the concentrations of sesn1 and sesn2 in the serum of 41 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 27 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 60 elderly controls, by surface plasmon resonance, which was validated by using western blot. Moreover, the mRNA level of sestrins in all the study groups was determined by real time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed significant overexpression of serum sesn2 protein and mRNA levels in the AD group compared to MCI and elderly control groups. A difference in serum sesn2 concentration between MCI and the control group was also evident. ROC analysis showed highly sensitive, selective cutoff values for sens2 in the differentiation of AD, MCI, and controls. No significant difference in sesn1 level was observed among the study groups. This study highlights the important role of sesn2 in the progression of the AD, indicating its potential utility as a protein marker in this devastating disease.

AB  - Preliminary evaluation of statistical modeling for non-invasive detection of malignancy in the prevalence of breast diseases is discussed. The standard databases for breast cancer symptoms, mammography diagnosing features and breast cancer ultrasound Elastography imaging screening standards were used, with ten dataset features as attributes. The satisfying conditions of the features were categorized for the classification as benign or malignant classes. The interpretation criteria in Elastography consist of the qualitative parameter elasticity score and the quantitative parameter strain ratio. Training of dataset was first done using 180 biopsy cases with 132 benign and 48 malignant results. 95% confidence interval for symptomatic was 1.625 to 4.955; mammographic was 1.506 to 5.494 and ultrasound Elastography imaging was 2.213 to 6.087. The model created was further tested with 210 cases using three machine learning classifiers and results were compared with gold standard biopsy results. Performance characteristics were statistically analyzed. The three classifiers have yielded an accuracy of 95.7%, 84.3% and 91.4% respectively and the statistical models proved its efficiency in differentiating malignant from benign.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although celiac disease (CeD) affects 1% of people in the northern part of India, it is believed to be uncommon in the southern and northeastern parts because of significant differences in dietary pattern and ethnicity. We estimated the prevalence of CeD in these three populations. In a subset, we also investigated differences in the prevalence of HLA-DQ 2/8 allelotype and dietary grain consumption.
   METHODS: A total of 23,331 healthy adults were sampled from three regions of India-northern (n = 6207), northeastern (n = 8149), and southern (n = 8973)-and screened for CeD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. Positive tests were reconfirmed using a second ELISA. CeD was diagnosed if the second test was positive and these participants were further investigated. A subsample of participants was tested for HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 and underwent detailed dietary evaluation.
   RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence of celiac autoantibodies was 1.23% in northern, 0.87% in northeastern, and 0.10% in southern India (P < 0.0001). Prevalence of CeD and latent CeD, respectively, was 8.53/1,000 and 3.70/1,000 in northern, 4.66/1,000 and 3.92/1,000 in northeastern, and 0.11/1,000 and 1.22/1,000 in the southern part. The population prevalence of genes determining HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8 expression was 38.1% in northern, 31.4% in northeastern, and 36.4% in southern India. Mean daily wheat intake was highest in northern (455 g) compared with northeastern (37 g) or southern part (25 g), whereas daily rice intake showed an inverse pattern.
   CONCLUSIONS: CeD and latent CeD were most prevalent in northern India and were the least in southern India. The prevalence correlated with wheat intake and did not reflect differences in the genetic background.

AB  - Naringenin chemically known as 5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman4-one is a common dietary polyphenolic constituent of the citrus fruits. It has received considerable attention for pharmaceutical and nutritional development due to potent pharmacological activities and therapeutic potential. Accruing evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies have unraveled numerous biological targets along with complex underlying mechanisms suggesting possible therapeutic applications of naringenin in various neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, rheumatological, metabolic and malignant disorders. Functionally, this ameliorative effect of naringenin is primarily attributed to its anti-inflammatory (via inhibiting recruitment of cytokines and inflammatory transcription factors) and anti-oxidant (via scavenging of free radicals, bolstering of endogenous antioxidant defense system and metal ion chelation) effects. The present article provides a comprehensive review of the various studies that have evaluated the therapeutic potential of naringenin and its actions at the molecular level. It also summarizes the pharmacokinetic data and issues and challenges involved in pharmaceutical development and suggest that it may be a potential agent for further exploration as well as may be useful as a dietary adjunct in treatment of various human ailments.

AB  - Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an infrequent cause of hospital-acquired infections. The clinical and microbiological profiles of infections due to E. meningoseptica over a seven-year period at a Level-I trauma centre are reported in this study. Medical records of patients from whose clinical samples E. meningoseptica was isolated on more than one occasion were reviewed. A total of 21 cases were observed during the study, 16 (76.2%) of which exhibited multidrug resistance. The observed in-hospital mortality rate was 47.6%. A high index of clinical suspicion and effective detection of E. meningoseptica in clinical samples are requisite for improved clinical outcome. (C) 2015 The Healthcare Infection Society.

AB  - Certain plant-derived alkaloids and flavonoids have shown propitious cytotoxic acitvity against different types of cancer, having deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) as their main cellular target. Flavopiridol, a semi-synthetic derivative of rohitukine (a natural compound isolated from Dysoxylum binectariferum plant), has attained much attention owing to its anticancer potential against various haematological malignancies and solid tumours. This work focuses on investigating interaction between flavopiridol and DNA at molecular level in order to decipher its underlying mechanism of action, which is not well understood. To define direct influence of flavopiridol on the structural, conformational and thermodynamic aspects of DNA, various spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques have been used. ATR-FTIR and SERS spectral outcomes indicate a novel insight into groove-directed-intercalation of flavopiridol into DNA via direct binding with nitrogenous bases guanine (C6=O6) and thymine (C2=O2) in DNA groove together with slight external binding to its sugar-phosphate backbone. Circular dichroism spectral analysis of flavopiridol-DNA complexes suggests perturbation in native B-conformation of DNA and its transition into C-form, which may be localized up to a few base pairs of DNA. UV-visible spectroscopic results illustrate dual binding mode of flavopiridol when interacts with DNA having association constant, K-a=1.18x10(4)M(-1). This suggests moderate type of interaction between flavopiridol and DNA. Further, UV melting analysis also supports spectroscopic outcomes. Thermodynamically, flavopiridol-DNA complexation is an enthalpy-driven exothermic process. These conclusions drawn from this study could be helpful in unveiling mechanism of cytoxicity induced by flavopiridol that can be further applied in the development of flavonoid-based new chemotherapeutics with more specificity and better efficacy.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of accelerated hypofractionated radiation with concomitant chemotherapy (AHFx-RT-CT) in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung.
   Methods: 36 patients were enrolled in this study (CTRI/2013/11/004143). Patients in Arm A (n=18) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (paclitaxel 200 mg m(-2) and carboplatin area under the curve 5) followed by external radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions/6 weeks). Patients in Arm B (n=18) received NACT as in Arm A followed by AHFx-RT (48 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks) with concomitant chemotherapy (cisplatin 30 mg m(-2) weekly). Primary end points included comparative evaluation of overall locoregional response rates (ORRs) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included toxicity, quality of life (QOL) and overall survival (OS).
   Results: The median follow-up duration was 15 months. The ORR at first follow-up (72.2% vs 44%, p=0.06) and at 1 year after treatment completion (61% vs 5.5%, p=0.04) were superior in Arm B. The median PFS (17 vs 5.36 months; p=0.053) and OS (24.73 vs 12.33 months; p=0.007) were also superior in Arm B. Grade >= 3 acute pharyngitis/oesophagitis was less in Arm B (p=0.05). Improvement of emotional function, cognitive function and chest pain was observed in Arm B.
   Conclusion: The study suggests that AHFx-RT-CT is feasible for locally advanced SCC of the lung with improved response rate, survival, QOL and favourable toxicity.
   Advances in knowledge: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing conventionally fractionated radiation with AHFx-RT-CT. Addition of low-dose weekly cisplatin as radiosensitizer may be the potential factor responsible for improved response rate, survival and favourable toxicity in the study arm despite lower biological effective dose.

AB  - T cell defect is a common feature in lepromatous or borderline lepromatous leprosy (LL/BL) patients in contrast to tuberculoid or borderline tuberculoid type (TT/BT) patients. Tuberculoid leprosy is characterized by strong Th1-type cell response with localized lesions whereas lepromatous leprosy is hallmarked by its selective Mycobacterium leprae specific T cell anergy leading to disseminated and progressive disease. FoxP3+ Regulatory T cells (Treg) which are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune diseases and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases also dampen proinflammatory T cells that include T helper 17 (Th17) cells. This study is aimed at evaluating the role of Treg cells in influencing other effector T cells and its relationship with the cytokine polarized state in leprosy patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from of BT/TT (n = 15) and BL/LL (n = 15) patients were stimulated with M. leprae antigen (WCL) in presence of golgi transport inhibitor monensin for FACS based intracellular cytokine estimation. The frequency of Treg cells showed >5-fold increase in BL/LL in comparison to BT/TT and healthy contacts. These cells produced suppressive cytokine, IL-10 in BL/LL as opposed to BT/TT (p = 0.0200) indicating their suppressive function. The frequency of Th17 cells (CD4, CD45RO, IL-17) was, however, higher in BT/TT. Significant negative correlation (r = -0.68, P = 0.03) was also found between IL-10 of Treg cells and IL-17+ T cells in BL/LL. Blocking IL-10/TGF-beta restored the IL-17+ T cells in BL/LL patients. Simultaneously, presence of Th17 related cytokines (TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23) decreased the number of FoxP3+ Treg cells concomitantly increasing IL-17 producing CD4+ cells in lepromatous leprosy. Higher frequency of Programmed Death-1/PD-1+ Treg cells and its ligand, PDL-1 in antigen presenting cells (APCs) was found in BL/LL patients. Inhibition of this pathway led to rescue of IFN-gamma and IL-17 producing T cells. Results indicate that Treg cells are largely responsible for the kind of immunosuppression observed in BL/LL patients. This study also proves that Treg cells are profoundly affected by the cytokine milieu and this property may be utilized for benefit of the host.

AB  - Background. The purpose of this study was for us to describe a case of recurrent sebaceous carcinoma treated with postoperative reirradiation.
   Methods. A 38-year-old man was diagnosed with sebaceous carcinoma of the right lower eyelid. The patient developed local recurrence 4 times, with the first one at 30 months after the excision. The first local recurrence was treated with excision and postoperative radiotherapy with 60 Gy/30 fractions/6 weeks. He manifested preauricular nodal metastasis with the third local recurrence, which was confirmed with F-18-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT (F-18-FDG PET-CT). He received 2 courses of adjuvant reirradiation to the right orbit with 45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks and 30 Gy/15 fractions/3 weeks, respectively.
   Results. The patient was successfully treated with no evidence of locoregional recurrence at 2 years after the cancer-directed therapy. The patient's follow-up from the date of diagnosis has been 9 years.
   Conclusion. Adjuvant reirradiation with modest doses may be considered with a view to provide disease control and long-term survival. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Headache is infrequent in early childhood. Headache and neurological deficits associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis (HaNDL), a variant of migraine, is a rare disorder. A 5-year-old boy presented with recurrent episodes of headache for 6 months. Each episode lasted for a week and in the current episode, he was symptomatic for 3 days. All the episodes were associated with paresthesias and CSF lymplocytosis with normal protein and sugar. There was history of migraine in his family. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with contrast with magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and venography were normal. Work-up for relevant causes of infection and vasculitis were negative. His symptoms subsided on oral antimigraine prophylaxis and he has been on remission for last 8 months. HaNDL should be considered in relevant clinical scenarios, as it prevents unnecessary investigations, therapy, and hospitalization.

AB  - Background
   Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in angiogenesis in fetal life. Recently, researchers have attempted to use anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a vasoproliferative disorder. There is currently uncertainty regarding the safety and efficacy of these agents in preterm infants with ROP.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF drugs when used either as monotherapy, i.e. without concomitant cryotherapy or laser therapy or in combination with planned cryo/laser therapy in preterm infants with type 1 ROP (defined as zone I any stage with plus disease, zone I stage 3 with or without plus disease or zone II stage 2 or 3 with plus disease).
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 1, 2016), EMBASE (1980 to January 1, 2016), CINAHL (1982 to January 1, 2016), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of administration, or both, of anti-VEGF agents compared with conventional therapy in premature infants with ROP.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal methods for data collection and analysis.
   Main results
   Three trials, in which 239 infants participated, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared intravitreal bevacizumab with conventional laser therapy (monotherapy) while the third compared intravitreal pegaptanib plus laser treatment with laser and cryotherapy (combination therapy) in infants with type 1 ROP.
   Of the two studies that evaluated intravitreal bevacizumab, one randomized infants while the other randomized eyes of the infants to the intervention and control groups. The former did not report any difference in the incidence of complete or partial retinal detachment between the groups (143 infants; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.21 to 5.13; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.07; very low quality evidence) but reported a significant reduction in the risk of refractive errors - very high myopia - at 30 months of age (211 eyes; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20; RD -0.40, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.30; low quality evidence) and recurrence of ROP by 54 weeks' postmenstrual age (143 infants; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.62; RD -0.20, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.09; moderate quality evidence) in the bevacizumab group. The study found no difference in the risk of mortality before discharge from the hospital (150 infants; RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.26 to 8.75; RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.07; low quality evidence), mortality at 30 months of age (150 infants; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.45; RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.08; low quality evidence), corneal opacity requiring corneal transplant (286 eyes; RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.26; RD -0.01; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02; very low quality evidence), or lens opacity requiring cataract removal (286 eyes; RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79; RD -0.02; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.01; very low quality evidence). The second trial that randomized eyes of the infants did not find any difference in the risk of complete retinal detachment between the eyes randomized to bevacizumab and those that were randomized to laser therapy (13 eyes; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.50; RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.11).
   When used in combination with laser therapy, intravitreal pegaptanib was found to reduce the risk of retinal detachment when compared to laser/cryotherapy alone (152 eyes; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.16; low quality evidence). The incidence of recurrence of ROP by 55 weeks' postmenstrual age was also lower in the pegaptanib + laser therapy group (76 infants; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.7; RD -0.35, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.16; low quality evidence). There was no difference in the risk of perioperative retinal haemorrhages between the two groups (152 eyes; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.56; RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.05; very low quality evidence). The risk of delayed systemic adverse effects with either of the drugs is, however, not known.
   Authors' conclusions
   Implications for practice: Intravitreal bevacizumab reduces the risk of refractive errors during childhood when used as monotherapy while intravitreal pegaptanib reduces the risk of retinal detachment when used in conjunction with laser therapy in infants with type 1 ROP. Quality of evidence was, however, low for both the outcomes because of the risk of detection and other biases. Effect on other critical outcomes and, more importantly, the long-term systemic adverse effects of the drugs are not known. The insufficient data precludes strong conclusions favouring routine use of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents in preterm infants with type 1 ROP.
   Implications for research: Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of anti-VEGF agents on structural and functional outcomes in childhood and delayed systemic adverse effects such as myocardial dysfunction and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - Background An increase in worldwide HPV vaccination could be facilitated if fewer than three doses of vaccine are as effective as three doses. We originally aimed to compare the immunogenicity and frequency of persistent infection and cervical precancerous lesions caused by vaccine-targeted HPV after vaccination with two doses of quadrivalent vaccine on days 1 and 180 or later, with three doses on days 1, 60, and 180 or later, in a cluster-randomised trial. Suspension of the recruitment and vaccination due to events unrelated to our study meant that some enrolled girls could not be vaccinated and some vaccinated girls received fewer than the planned number of vaccinations by default. As a result, we re-analysed our data as an observational cohort study.
   Methods Our study was designed to be done in nine locations (188 clusters) in India. Participants were unmarried girls aged 10-18 years vaccinated in four cohorts: girls who received three doses of vaccine on days 1, 60, and 180 or later, two doses on days 1 and 180 or later, two doses on days 1 and 60 by default, and one dose by default. The primary outcomes were immunogenicity in terms of L1 genotype-specific binding antibody titres, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity after vaccination for the vaccine-targeted HPV types 16, 18, 6, and 11 and incident and persistent infections with these HPVs. Analysis was per actual number of vaccine doses received. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN98283094; and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00923702.
   Findings Vaccination of eligible girls was initiated on Sept 1, 2009, and continued until April 8, 2010. Of 21 258 eligible girls identified at 188 clusters, 17 729 girls were recruited from 178 clusters before suspension. 4348 (25%) girls received three doses, 4979 (28%) received two doses on days 1 and 180 or later, 3452 (19%) received two doses at days 1 and 60, and 4950 (28%) received one dose. Immune response in the two-dose HPV vaccine group was non-inferior to the three-dose group (median fluorescence intensity ratio for HPV 16 1.12 [95% CI 1.02-1.23] and for HPV 18 1.04 [0.92-1.19]) at 7 months, but was inferior in the two-dose default (0.33 [0.29-0.38] for HPV 16 and 0.51 [0.43-0.59] for HPV 18) and one-dose default (0.09 [0.08-0.11] for HPV 16 and 0.12 [0.10-0.14] for HPV 18) groups at 18 months. The geometric mean avidity indices after fewer than three doses by design or default were non-inferior to those after three doses of vaccine. Fewer than three doses by design and default induced detectable concentrations of neutralising antibodies to all four vaccine-targeted HPV types, but at much lower concentration after one dose. Cervical samples from 2649 participants were tested and the frequency of incident HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 infections was similar irrespective of the number of vaccine doses received. The testing of at least two samples from 838 participants showed that there was no persistent HPV 16 or 18 infections in any study group at a median follow-up of 4.7 years (IQR 4.2-5.1).
   Interpretation Despite the limitations imposed by the suspension of the HPV vaccination, our findings lend support to the WHO recommendation of two doses, at least 6 months apart, for routine vaccination of young girls. The short-term protection afforded by one dose of HPV vaccine against persistent infection with HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 is similar to that afforded by two or three doses of vaccine and merits further assessment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) are rare highly aggressive neoplasms. The diagnosis is made by histopathology with the support of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cytogenetics. The aggressive multimodality treatment is recommended for the management of these tumors. The purpose of our study is to review our experiences in the diagnoses and treatment of PNET of the kidneys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of all the patients, who were treated for the PNET of the kidneys at our institute between April and March 2011 and compared with the available literature. RESULTS: A total of eight patients were treated for PNET of the kidney. Out of the eight patients, four were males and four females. Nearly 50% of our patients had inferior vena caval thrombus at the time of presentation. The diagnosis was made on histopathology supported by IHC. Out of the eight patients, one patient had intraoperative death due to massive pulmonary thromboembolism and another died on the 7th post-operative day due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure. Rest six patients were treated with post-operative chemotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. For these six patients, overall median survival was 45 months with a 3 year disease-free survival of 66% and 5 year survival of 44%. CONCLUSIONS: PNET of the kidneys are rare peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with an aggressive clinical course. These tumors carry a very poor prognosis. An aggressive treatment approach using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is recommended for a reasonable survival in these tumors.

AB  - Severe vitamin D deficiency and rickets are highly prevalent among children with congenital ichthyosis. We report an incidental observation of a dramatic and excellent clinical response with regard to skin scaling and stiffness in children with congenital ichthyosis after short-term high-dose vitamin D supplementation that has not been previously described. Seven children with congenital ichthyosis (5 with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis; 2 with epidermolytic ichthyosis) and severe vitamin D deficiency (and/or rickets) were given 60 000 IU of oral cholecalciferol daily for 10 days under supervision. All children were subsequently put on recommended daily allowance of 400 to 600 IU of cholecalciferol. The main outcome measures observed and studied were reduction in skin scaling and stiffness of the extremities. All cases had severe vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 4 ng/mL) and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Six patients had clinical and radiologic evidence of rickets. Significant improvement in scaling was noticeable by day 5, showing further improvement by day 10, in 6 of the 7 cases. At 1 month, the skin had become near normal in all the cases of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis. Remarkable reduction in stiffness was also observed in all children. Supplementation with high-dose vitamin D followed by recommended daily allowance appears to be an effective form of therapy in the management of congenital ichthyosis with vitamin D deficiency.

AB  - Objective: Corneal permeability of drugs is an important factor used to assess the efficacy of topical preparations. Transcorneal penetration of drugs from aqueous formulation is governed by various physiological, physiochemical, and formulation factors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of formulation factors like concentration, pH, and volume of instillation across the cornea using cassette dosing technique for ophthalmic fluoroquinolones (FQs).
   Materials and methods: Sterile cocktail formulations were prepared using four congeneric ophthalmic FQs (ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, pefloxacin mesylate, and gatifloxacin) at concentrations of 0.025%, 0.5%, and 0.1%. Each formulation was adjusted to different pH ranges (4.5, 7.0, and 8.0) and assessed for transcorneal penetration in vivo in rabbit's cornea (n=4 eyes) at three different volumes (12.5, 25, and 50 mu L). Aqueous humor was aspirated through paracentesis after applying local anesthesia at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes postdosing. The biosamples collected from a total of 27 groups were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy to determine transcorneal permeability of all four FQs individually.
   Results: Increase in concentration showed an increase in penetration up to 0.05%; thereafter, the effect of concentration was found to be dependent on volume of instillation as we observed a decrease in transcorneal penetration. The highest transcorneal penetration of all FQs was observed at pH 7.0 at concentration 0.05% followed by 0.025% at pH 4.5. Lastly, increasing the volume of instillation from 12.5 to 50 mu L showed a significant fall in transcorneal penetration.
   Conclusion: The study concludes that formulation factors showed discernible effect on transcorneal permeation; therefore, due emphasis should be given on drug development and design of ophthalmic formulation.

AB  - Purpose: Pen-urethral cancer (PUC) in females is a rare malignancy. Surgery is not usually contemplated due to associated morbidity. Radiation therapy (RT) can be employed in the form of interstitial brachytherapy (IBT) alone for early lesions, and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without IBT for advanced lesions. We report our first experience in the literature to evaluate the role of high-dose-rate (HDR) IBT in female PUC.
   Material and methods: Between 2008 and 2013, 10 female patients with PUC (5 primary and 5 recurrent) were treated with HDR-IBT with or without EBRT at our center. Size of the lesion ranged from 1.5 cm to 5.0 cm. A 2-3 plane free-hand implant was performed using plastic catheters. The prescribed dose of HDR-IBT was 42 Gy in 14 fractions for brachytherapy alone (5 patients), and 18-21 Gy for the boost along with EBRT (5 patients). Patients were followed up regularly for assessment of disease control and toxicity.
   Results: At a median follow up of 25 months, six patients were disease free at their last follow up. Four patients developed recurrence: 2 at inguinal nodes, 1 at local site, and 1 at both local as well as inguinal nodes. Moist desquamation was the commonest acute toxicity observed in all 5 patients treated with IBT alone, which healed within 4 weeks' time. Overall, grade II delayed complication rate was 30%.
   Conclusions: Though small sample size, the results of our study have shown that HDR-IBT provides good loco-regional control with acceptable toxicity for female PUC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with cystic fibrosis may have a deficiency of micronutrients, including zinc, which may affect their susceptibility to infections. There is a paucity of data on zinc supplementation among children with cystic fibrosis. We hypothesized that a pharmacologic dose of zinc administered daily for 12 months would reduce the need for antibiotics by 50%. METHODS: This double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted among children with cystic fibrosis to assess the effect of zinc supplementation on the need for antibiotics and pulmonary function tests. The children, age 5-15 y, of either sex, received either 30-mg zinc tablets or similar looking placebo tablets daily in addition to standard care. They were followed up every month for a period of 12 months and whenever they had pulmonary exacerbations. Their serumzinc was estimated at baseline and at 12 months of enrollment. During each visit, the children underwent a pulmonary function test and sputum culture. RESULTS: Of a total of 43 children screened, 40 were enrolled, and of them, 37 completed the study. The median (interquartile range) number of days of the administration of antibiotics over 12 months of follow-up among the children receiving zinc was 42 (14-97) d. In the placebo group, it was 38 (15-70) d (P = .79). There were no significant differences in the percent-of-predicted FEV1 or change in FEV1 values at 12 months (P = .44). The number of children in whose respiratory specimens Pseudomonas was isolated was similar for the 2 groups at different time intervals. The adverse events reported were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: We did not find any significant difference in the need for antibiotics, pulmonary function tests, hospitalization, colonization with Pseudomonas, or the need for antibiotics for children with cystic fibrosis receiving zinc supplementation of 30 mg/d.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracameral amphotericin B (ICAMB) in the management of fungal keratitis.Methods: In total, 45 eyes with smear-confirmed fungal keratitis with hypopyon were randomized into three treatment groups: Group I (topical antifungal treatment+oral antifungal); Group II (topical antifungal treatment+ICAMB+oral antifungal); and Group III (topical antifungal treatment+drainage of hypopyon+ICAMB+oral antifungal). The main outcome measures were treatment success rate, time to heal, visual acuity gain, and presence of complications.Results: There were no differences in the treatment success rates (p=0.66), time to healing (p=0.18), or mean final visual acuity (logMAR) (p=0.8) between the three groups. The major complication observed was increased incidence of cataract in group III (40%), though it was statistically insignificant.Conclusions: ICAMB does not offer any benefit over topical antifungal therapy when performed alone or associated with drainage of hypopyon.

AB  - Apoptosis of motor neurons is an important feature in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A vital role of mitochondria in apoptosis and cell survival is well documented. Eventually mitochondria have shown to be an early target in the pathogenesis of ALS. On account of these facts, we investigated the involvement of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in ALS and control (CTR) cybrids, generated fusing human platelets with mitochondrial DNA-depleted NT2-neuroteratocarcinoma cells. After a 6 week selection process during which transferred subject mtDNA repopulated the NT2 cells and restored mitochondrial oxygen consumption, we assessed cell viability and two programmed cell death parameters, caspase 3 activity and cytosolic cytochrome c levels. Compared to the control cybrid lines (n = 5), the ALS cybrid lines (n = 10) showed 45% less XTT reduction and higher caspase 3 activity (p < 0.05, two-way Student's t test) exhibiting lesser cell viability and execution of apoptosis. Elevated cytosolic cytochrome c levels in ALS cybrid lines (n = 8) than in CTR (n = 4) (p < 0.05, two-way Student's t-test) indicating its mitochondrial release and initiation of apoptosis. This indicates apoptosis as one of the possible mechanisms of cell death in ALS. Our findings support the view that in ALS, subject's mitochondria are altered in non-degenerating tissues in such a way that intrinsic apoptotic pathway activity is relatively increased.

AB  - Hanging deaths associated with binding of limbs, masking of a face, and gagging are always suspicious. In suicidal hanging, the victim uses these added techniques to prevent him from backing out of his decision and to ensure death. However, binding of limbs and adding extra weight to the suspension in hanging are not reported. Herein, we report a case where the victim tied a bag containing books weighing 7 kg (15.4 lbs) to both his hands during hanging. The forensic specialist must be aware of the unusual presentation of suicidal hanging which may suggest foul play. The manner of death must be established after detailed analysis of circumstantial evidence, information obtained from the witnesses, complete autopsy, and toxicological examination.

AB  - The periportal space is a potential space surrounding the portal vein and its intrahepatic branches. A variety of neoplasms can involve the periportal region, whether primary or secondary, owing to contiguous spread from surrounding hepatic parenchyma or from adjacent organs. CT plays an important role in not only diagnosing these lesions but also determining the extent of the disease. Most of the malignancies leading to the periportal spread manifest as periportal hypodensity either distinctly or in contiguity with the primary tumour. Even in known malignancies, periportal hypodensity commonly results from non-neoplastic causes like periportal oedema; hence, a knowledge of the imaging findings to ascertain its presence as well as to conclude the definite neoplastic spread is prudent. Periportal spread of neoplasm may suggest locally aggressive or disseminated disease ( in extrahepatic malignancies), which may change management accordingly.

AB  - CdSe/CdS/ZnS and CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique and direct aqueous synthesis respectively using thiol stabilizers. Synthesized CdSe/CdS/ZnS and CdTe QDs stabilized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) were used as fluorescent labels after conjugation with folic acid (FA) and anti-HER2 antibodies. Photoluminescence quantum yield of folated CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA and CdTe-MSA QDs was 59% and 77% than that of non-folated hydrophilic QDs. The folate receptor mediated delivery of folic acid-conjugated CdTe-MSA and CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA QDs showed higher cellular internalization as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopic studies. Folated and non-folated CdTe-MSA QDs were highly toxic and exhibited only 10% cell viability as compared to >80% cell viability with CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA QDs over the concentration ranging from 3.38 to 50 pmoles. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of human breast cancer tissue samples showed positive results with anti-HER2 antibody conjugated CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA QDs with better sensitivity and specificity as compared to conventional IHC analysis using diaminobenzedene staining.

AB  - Anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis (B anthracis), poses a potential threat as a bioterror agent because after inhalation, the spores rapidly cause bacteraemia and toxaemia. It produces a toxin consisting of three proteins ie protective antigen (PA), oedema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). Protective antigen plays a central role in the pathophysiology of anthrax and offers an excellent therapeutic target for treatment of anthrax. Raxibacumab is a recombinant, fully human, IgG1. monoclonal antibody directed against PA of B anthracis. It inhibits PA binding to the anthrax toxin receptor and inhibits toxin-mediated cell death. It has been approved under animal rule or animal efficacy rule by the United States Food and Drug Administration which comes into play when it is not feasible or ethical to perform controlled clinical trials in humans. It has shown promising results in various animal studies which includes significantly improved survival rates in the raxibacumab group than non- raxibacumab group.

AB  - Purine repeat sequences present in a gene are unique as they have high propensity to form unusual DNA-triple helix structures. Friedreich's ataxia is the only human disease that is well known to be associated with DNA-triplexes formed by purine repeats. The purpose of this study was to recognize the expanded purine repeats (EPRs) in human genome and find their correlation with cancer pathogenesis. We developed "PuRepeatFinder.pl" algorithm to identify non-overlapping EPRs without pyrimidine interruptions in the human genome and customized for searching repeat lengths, n >= 200. A total of 1158 EPRs were identified in the genome which followed Wakeby distribution. Two hundred and ninety-six EPRs were found in geneic regions of 282 genes (EPR-genes). Gene clustering of EPR-genes was done based on their cellular function and a large number of EPR-genes were found to be enzymes/enzyme modulators. Meta-analysis of 282 EPR-genes identified only 63 EPR-genes in association with cancer, mostly in breast, lung, and blood cancers. Protein-protein interaction network analysis of all 282 EPR-genes identified proteins including those in cadherins and VEGF. The two observations, that EPRs can induce mutations under malignant conditions and that identification of some EPR-gene products in vital cell signaling-mediated pathways, together suggest the crucial role of EPRs in carcinogenesis. The new link between EPR-genes and their functionally interacting proteins throws a new dimension in the present understanding of cancer pathogenesis and can help in planning therapeutic strategies. Validation of present results using techniques like NGS is required to establish the role of the EPR genes in cancer pathology.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
KW  - MEMBRANOPROLIFERATIVE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
KW  - COMPLEMENT
AB  - Dense deposit disease is caused by fluid-phase dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway and frequently deviates from the classic membranoproliferative pattern of injury on light microscopy. Other patterns of injuty described for dense deposit disease include mesangioproliferative, acute proliferative/exudative, and crescentic GN. Regardless of the histologic pattern, C3 glomerulopathy, which includes dense deposit disease and C3 GN, is defined by immunofluorescence intensity of C3c two or more orders of magnitude greater than any other immune reactant (on a 0-3 scale). Ultrastructural appearances distinguish dense deposit disease and C3 GN. Focal and segmental necrotizing glomerular lesions with crescents, mimicking a small vessel vasculitis such as ANCA-associated GN, are a very rare manifestation of dense deposit disease. We describe our experience with this unusual histologic presentation and distinct clinical course of dense deposit disease, discuss the pitfalls in diagnosis, examine differential diagnoses, and review the relevant literature.

AB  - Introduction: Flowcytometry has an essential role in the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemias. However, there exists a great degree of inter-laboratory variability on issues like panel selection, antibody combinations, gating strategies, fluorochromes, and clonal selection.
   Aim: The primary aim of this study was to derive a minimal panel of antibodies and evaluate its diagnostic usefulness in acute leukemias by flowcytometry by using the detailed immune-phenotype of different lineage-specific or non-specific markers.
   Materials and methods: This prospective observational study involved 400 newly diagnosed cases of acute leukemias. Bone marrow aspirate samples were subjected to morphological evaluation, cytogenetics and flow cytometric immunophenotyping.
   Results: A minimal panel of eight antibodies comprising of CD45/CD34/CD19/MPO/cytoCD3/CD64/CD117/CD79a was derived by applying different permutations and combinations with a diagnostic yield of 97.5%. The minimal panel was further validated by testing in an independent cohort of patients with similar demographic characteristics, where it showed a high diagnostic yield of 98% in comparison with the screening panels proposed by other recently published studies.
   Conclusion: It may be concluded that the diagnostic performance of the eight antibody panel is better than most other panels used across the different laboratories in terms of yield, number of antibodies used and the scientific approach used to derive and validate the results and so henceforth may be applied in any setting with limited resources for better diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - A novel indirect immuno-polymerase chain reaction (I-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of circulating anti-Ag85B (antigen 85B, Rv1886c), anti-ESAT-6 (early secretory antigenic target-6, Rv3875) and anti-cord factor (trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate) antibodies from the sera samples of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) patients and the results were compared with an analogous enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We covalently attached the amino-modified reporter DNA to the dithiothreitol (DTT)-reduced anti-human IgG antibody through a chemical linker succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). The detection of cocktail of anti-Ag85B, anti-ESAT-6 and anti-cord factor antibodies was found to be superior to the detection of individual antibodies. The sensitivities of 89.5% and 77.5% with I-PCR and 70.8% and 65% with ELISA were observed in smear-positive and smear-negative PTB cases, respectively with high specificity (90.9%). On the other hand, a sensitivity of 77.5% with I-PCR and 65% with ELISA was observed in EBTB cases. The detection of cocktail of antibodies by I-PCR is likely to improve the utility of existing algorithms for TB diagnosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To identify perioperative risk factors for postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and suggest possible modifications to reduce morbidity. Material and Methods: We prospectively analysed perioperative data such as history of pervious stone surgery, number and configuration of stones, presence of stent or nephrostomy, any previous positive urine culture, intraoperative renal pelvic urine and stone culture, aspiration of turbid urine on initial puncture, number of tracts required and clearance of stones, operative time and intraoperative hypotension and tachycardia of all patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy over a period of 15 months. Results: A total of 182 patients were included, average stone size was 2.8 cm, 36.2% had staghorn stones and 15.9% had an indwelling stent or nephrostomy. Despite sterile preoperative urine culture, renal pelvic urine culture (RPUC) was positive in 14.8% (27 patients) and stone culture was positive in 21.9% (40 patients). SIRS developed in 17.5% (32 patients) and septic shock in 1.09% (2 patients). On analysis younger age, positive RPUC and stone culture, longer operative time and intraoperative tachycardia correlated significantly with the development of SIRS. Conclusion: Intra-operative cultures are only therapy-guiding cultures during SIRS, as preoperative urine cultures seldom accurately depict bacteriological status of upper tracts and thus should be obtained in all patients.

AB  - Background: Celiac disease (CeD) is a systemic disease with manifestations not limited to small intestine. The data on association between CeD and infertility is contradictory. There are no recommendations for the screening of female patients with infertility for CeD.
   Aim: We conducted a meta-analysis to find out whether women with infertility are at higher risk of CeD.
   Methods: Literature search was performed using the MeSH keywords "CeD," "gluten," and "infertility." Diagnosis of CeD was based on positive serology and biopsies showing villous atrophy. Data were extracted about CeD patients in 3 groups-women with infertility (including unexplained infertility), unexplained infertility, and controls. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and prevalence, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were calculated.
   Results: Of 105 relevant studies, 5 studies were included for calculation of pooled OR. Four additional studies, where data on controls were not available, were also considered for calculation of pooled prevalence of CeD. Women with infertility had 3.5 times higher odds of having CeD in comparison with control population (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 1.3-9; P < 0.01). Similarly, women with "unexplained infertility" had 6 times higher odds of having CeD than controls (OR = 6; 95% CI, 2.4-14.6). Of 884 women with infertility, 20 had CeD indicating a pooled prevalence of 2.3% (95% CI, 1.4-3.5). Of 623 women with "unexplained infertility," 20 had CeD. The pooled prevalence of CeD in women with unexplained infertility was 3.2 (95% CI, 2-4.9).
   Conclusions: CeD is more prevalent in women with all-cause infertility and unexplained infertility than that in general population.

AB  - In a developing country, where patient access to tertiary care is limited and most patients have to pay out of pocket, it is imperative for the physicians to practice evidence-based medicine. Reports on prescription details and surveys are not available. The aim of this study is to describe the prescribing patterns for various medications used in the treatment of stroke among the first contact physicians in North India; to estimate the proportion of patients being prescribed the non-recommended drugs and to determine any relationship between the economic status of the patient and the prescription pattern. Details of economic status, education level, type of stroke, type of hospital, qualification of treating physician and the number and nature of medications were noted from the prescriptions and patients. Two hundred and sixteen patients with ischemic stroke (71.3% males, average age 51.5 years) were included. Among poor patients, N = (36.8%) received any of the neuroprotective drugs including citicoline 19 (27.5%), piracetam 11(15.9%) and edaravone 2(2.9%). Both specialist and private hospitals are associated with higher prescription of "ineffective neuroprotective" drugs in both poor and rich patients. Reasons for overprescribing neuroprotective medications need to be studied and remedial measures need to be taken to practice evidence-based medicine.

AB  - Present guidelines recommend bariatric surgery at BMI a parts per thousand yen40 kg/m(2) or BMI a parts per thousand yen35 kg/m(2) with obesity-related morbidity.
   Evidence for cost and mortality/morbidity risk of bariatric surgery and obesity-related diseases was evaluated determining equivalency point of absolute incremental mortality risk by BMI and risks associated with bariatric surgery. A stochastic model was developed evaluating costs related to surgical procedure at a given BMI.
   Bariatric surgery produces significant lifetime cost savings associated with diabetes, gallstones, hypertension, high cholesterol, colon cancer, heart disease, and stroke in men at BMI 30 kg/m(2) for laparoscopic gastric bypass. For women, laparoscopic gastric bypass saves cost at BMI 32 kg/m(2) and laparoscopic gastric banding at BMI 37 kg/m(2). In white men, relative to single-year mortality risks by BMI, surgical intervention becomes risk-beneficial at BMI 25 kg/m(2) for laparoscopic gastric banding, BMI 27 kg/m(2) for laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure and open gastric banding, and BMI 37 kg/m(2) for open gastric bypass. Risk benefit for African-American men by procedure occurs at BMI < 25 kg/m(2), BMI 27 kg/m(2), and BMI 42 kg/m(2), respectively. In white women, surgical intervention is beneficial at BMI 25.5 kg/m(2) (laparoscopic gastric banding), BMI 28.5 kg/m(2) (laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure), and BMI 45 kg/m(2) (open gastric banding). Risk benefit for black women by procedure occurs at BMI 27.5 kg/m(2), BMI 33.5 kg/m(2), and BMI 50+ kg/m(2), respectively.
   Risk and cost benefit suggest surgical guidelines should be reconsidered. Threshold for bariatric surgery should be redefined to BMI 35 kg/m(2) or BMI 30 kg/m(2) with comorbidities.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy which is based upon inelastic scattering of photons has a potential to emerge as a noninvasive bedside in vivo or ex vivo molecular diagnostic tool. There is a need to improve the sensitivity and predictability of Raman spectroscopy. We developed a grid matrix-based tissue mapping protocol to acquire cellular-specific spectra that also involved digital microscopy for localizing malignant and lymphocytic cells in sentinel lymph node biopsy sample. Biosignals acquired from specific cellular milieu were subjected to an advanced supervised analytical method, i.e., cross-correlation and peak-to-peak ratio in addition to PCA and PC-LDA. We observed decreased spectral intensity as well as shift in the spectral peaks of amides and lipid bands in the completely metastatic (cancer cells) lymph nodes with high cellular density. Spectral library of normal lymphocytes and metastatic cancer cells created using the cellular specific mapping technique can be utilized to create an automated smart diagnostic tool for bench side screening of sampled lymph nodes. Spectral library of normal lymphocytes and metastatic cancer cells created using the cellular specific mapping technique can be utilized to develop an automated smart diagnostic tool for bench side screening of sampled lymph nodes supported by ongoing global research in developing better technology and signal and big data processing algorithms.

AB  - Roles of nutrients and other environmental variables in development of cyanobacterial bloom and its toxicity are complex and not well understood. We have monitored the photoautotrophic growth, total microcystin concentration, and microcystins synthetase gene (mcyA) expression in lab-grown strains of Microcystis NIES 843 (reference strain), KW (Wangsong Reservoir, South Korea), and Durgakund (Varanasi, India) under different nutrient regimes (nitrogen, phosphorus, and boron). Higher level of nitrogen and boron resulted in increased growth (avg. 5 and 6.5Chl alpha mg/L, resp.), total microcystin concentrations (avg. 1.185 and 7.153 mg/L, resp.), and mcyA transcript but its expression was not directly correlated with total microcystin concentrations in the target strains. Interestingly, Durgakund strain had much lower microcystin content and lacked microcystin-YR variant over NIES 843 and KW. It is inferred that microcystin concentration and its variants are strain specific. We have also examined the heterotrophic bacteria associated with cyanobacterial bloom in Durgakund Pond and Wangsong Reservoir which were found to be enriched in Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria and that could influence the bloom dynamics.

AB  - Kaempferol (KMP), a dietary flavonoid, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. Hence, we investigated the effect of KMP in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) model of myocardial injury in rats. We studied male albino Wistar rats that were divided into sham, IR-control, KMP-20 + IR, and KMP 20 per se groups. KMP (20 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered daily to rats for the period of 15 days, and, on the 15th day, ischemia was produced by one-stage ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min. After completion of surgery, rats were sacrificed; heart was removed and processed for biochemical, morphological, and molecular studies. KMP pretreatment significantly ameliorated IR injury by maintaining cardiac function, normalizing oxidative stress, and preserving morphological alterations. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the level of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and NF kappa B), inhibition of active JNK and p38 proteins, and activation of ERK1/ERK2, a prosurvival kinase. Additionally, it also attenuated apoptosis by reducing the expression of proapoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3), TUNEL positive cells, and increased level of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). In conclusion, KMP protected against IR injury by attenuating inflammation and apoptosis through the modulation of MAPK pathway.

AB  - The differentiation of idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) from multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), the most common atypical parkinsonian look-alike syndromes (APS), can be clinically challenging. In these disorders, diagnostic inaccuracy is more frequent early in the clinical course when signs and symptoms are mild. Diagnostic inaccuracy may be particularly relevant in trials of potential disease-modifying agents, which typically involve participants with early clinical manifestations. In an initial study, we developed a probabilistic algorithm to classify subjects with clinical parkinsonism but uncertain diagnosis based on the expression of metabolic covariance patterns for IPD, MSA, and PSP. Classifications based on this algorithm agreed closely with final clinical diagnosis. Nonetheless, blinded prospective validation is required before routine use of the algorithm can be considered. Methods: We used metabolic imaging to study an independent cohort of 129 parkinsonian subjects with uncertain diagnosis; 77 (60%) had symptoms for 2 y or less at the time of imaging. After imaging, subjects were followed by blinded movement disorders specialists for an average of 2.2 y before final diagnosis was made. When the algorithm was applied to the individual scan data, the probabilities of IPD, MSA, and PSP were computed and used to classify each of the subjects. The resulting image-based classifications were then compared with the final clinical diagnosis. Results: IPD subjects were distinguished from APS with 94% specificity and 96% positive predictive value (PPV) using the original 2-level logistic classification algorithm. The algorithm achieved 90% specificity and 85% PPV for MSA and 94% specificity and 94% PPV for PSP. The diagnostic accuracy was similarly high (specificity and PPV > 90%) for parkinsonian subjects with short symptom duration. In addition, 25 subjects were classified as level I indeterminate parkinsonism and 4 more subjects as level II indeterminate APS. Conclusion: Automated pattern-based image classification can improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients with parkinsonism, even at early disease stages.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting mainly the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra leading to various motor and non-motor deficits. We explored the neuroprotective potential of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) along with exposure to EMF in 6-OHDA rat model of PD. IONPs were implanted at the site of lesion and 24 h thereafter the rats were exposed to magnetic fields 2 h/day for one week. Bilateral lesions of the striatum were made with 6-OHDA. The rats in all the intervention groups improved progressively over the days and by post-surgery day 4 they were active and bright. We observed a significant beneficial effect of the IONPs implantation and MF exposure on feeding behavior, gait and postural stability. There was a significant enhancement of mitochondrial function and attenuation of lesion volume in all the intervention, groups as compared to PD. The results demonstrate neuroprotective effect of iron oxide nanoparticle implantation and magnetic field exposure in an in vivo 6-OHDA rat model of PD.

AB  - Since centuries, the rapid spread and cure of infectious diseases have been a major concern to the progress and survival of humans. These diseases are a global burden and the prominent cause for worldwide deaths and disabilities. Nanomedicine has emerged as the most excellent tool to eradicate and halt their spread. Various nanoformulations (NFs) using advanced nanotechnology are in demand. Recently, hydrogel and nanogel based drug delivery devices have posed new prospects to simulate the natural intelligence of various biological systems. Owing to their unique porous interpenetrating network design, hydrophobic drug incorporation and stimulus sensitivity hydrogels owe excellent potential as targeted drug delivery systems. The present review is an attempt to highlight the recent trends of hydrogel based drug delivery systems for the delivery of therapeutic agents and diagnostics for major infectious diseases including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, tuberculosis, influenza and ebola. Future prospects and challenges are also described.

AB  - Aim: To validate the stability of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements in blood samples stored at -20 degrees C for up to one month.
   Methods: The study group comprised 142 type 2 diabetic subjects visiting a tertiary centre for diabetes at Chennai city in south India. The HbA1c assay was done on a fasting blood sample using the Bio-Rad Variant machine on Day 0 (day of blood sample collection). Several aliquots were stored at-20 degrees C and the assay was repeated on the 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 30th day after the sample collection. Bland-Altman plots were constructed and variation in the HbA1c levels on the different days was compared with the day 0 level.
   Results: The median differences between HbA1c levels measured on Day 0 and the 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 30th day after blood collection were 0.0%, 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.5% respectively. Bland-Altman plot analysis showed that the differences between the day '0' and the different time points tend to get larger with time, but these were not clinically significant.
   Conclusions: HbA1c levels are relatively stable up to 2 weeks, if blood samples are stored at -20 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Effective therapeutic options are limited for the management of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) complicated by exudative retinal detachments (RD). The authors describe the resolution of one such case following partial thickness scleral resection with mitomycin C.
   Case presentation: This 39-year-old male presented with a unilateral inferior exudative RD in the right eye. There was no history of steroid use either locally or systemically. The fundus fluorescein angiogram showed window defects and leaks typical of chronic CSCR. The axial length was 21.06 mm in the right eye and 21 mm in the left eye. Thickening of the ocular coats was evident on ocular ultrasound. Considering an axial length in the borderline-low range inferotemporal and inferonasal partial thickness scleral resection with mitomycin C was performed. The exudative RD resolved at 4 months.
   Conclusion: Partial thickness scleral resection may be considered as an option for treating chronic CSCR patients with borderline low axial length complicated by exudative RD.

AB  - Background: Titer of contact hypersensitivity TCH) is a measure of contact hypersensitivity to an allergen in an individual. Clinical severity of Parthenium dermatitis varies with season. However, the effect of seasonal variation on the TCH as determined by patch test to Parthenium has not been studied. Objective: To study the effect of seasonal variation on TCH to Parthenium hysterophorus in patients with Parthenium dermatitis. Materials and Methods: It was a prospective investigational study on clinically and patch test confirmed patients with airborne contact dermatitis to P. hysterophorus. The TCH values at baseline and after 6 months were recorded. The patients who were recruited in summers (April to September) and whose repeat patch test and TCH were determined in winters (October to March) were identified as Group I and those who were recruited in reverse order were identified as Group II. Results: The study had 47 patients, of which 23 were in Group I and 24 in Group II. Mean TCH in Group, I (summer to winter) in period I (summer) was 0.11 +/- 0.28 whereas that in period II (winter), was 0.76 +/- 0.41. Similarly, mean TCH in Group II (winter to summer) in period I (winter) and period II (summer) were 0.34 +/- 0.44 and 0.166 +/- 0.32, respectively. The difference in TCH values (95% confidence interval) in the two groups with a change of season was -0.41 (-0.58, -0.24) (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: TCH values in Parthenium dermatitis are lower in the summer season, indicating increased sensitivity to Parthenium allergen in summer.

AB  - Introduction: There is a relatively high incidence of screw misplacement during spinal instrumentation due to distortion of normal anatomy following spinal trauma. The O-arm is the next-generation spinal navigation tool that provides intraoperative 3-D imaging and navigation for spine surgeries.
   Aims and objectives: To evaluate and compare the use of O-arm as compared to C-arm for spinal trauma in a Level I trauma center in India.
   Materials and methods: In this retrospective study over 3 years (July 2010-April 2013), All patients of spinal injury who underwent spinal instrumentation were divided into O-arm group and C-arm group. Accuracy of screw placement was assessed during each surgery in both groups.
   Results: A total of 587 patients were evaluated during the study period. There were 278 patients in O-arm group and 309 patients in C-arm group. Both groups were well matched in mean age (27.7 vs. 28.9 years), ASIA grades, and level of injury. The number of screws placed was significantly higher in the C-arm group as compared to the O-arm group (2173 vs. 1720). However, the O-arm group had significantly less screw malplacement rate of 0.93% (n = 16) as compared to malplacement rate in C-arm group of 8.79% (n = 191, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Use of O-arm imaging system ensures accurate screw placement and dramatically decreases screw malplacement rate, thus providing better patient safety. Its use is especially beneficial in academic and teaching centers where novice surgeons can attain results equivalent to that of experts in spinal instrumentation.

AB  - Cut-throat wounds are a well-recognized method of homicide, are less commonly used in suicides and are rarely accidental. The forensic pathologist has a very challenging and important task when commenting on the manner of infliction of such wounds when such a case is presented with no proper history or witnesses. We present two cases of cut-throat wounds, one suicide and one homicide, to show the differences between the pattern of wounds. We highlight the differences between the two cases in relation to other external injuries, the circumstances in which the bodies were found and other factors. We intend to update the literature regarding this topic in reference to our cases. We also hope that our presentation will be beneficial to doctors performing autopsies on such cases, so as to distinguish the manner of cut-throat wounds in equivocal cases of death.

AB  - Objectives: Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (PanNETs) are rare neoplasms, and not much is known about their pathogenesis. We aimed to evaluate ATRX/DAXX immunoexpression in PanNETs a cohort of well-characterized PanNETs. Methods: PanNETs diagnosed over a 10-year period were retrieved and clinicopathogical features reviewed. Immuohistochemistry for pancreatic hormones, and for ATRX and DAXX was performed. Results: Sixty-eight PanNETs were included (30 males and 38 females) with median age of 39 years. Histologically, there were 37 Grade 1 (54.4%), 27 Grade 2 (39.7%), and 4 Grade 3 (5.9%) cases. On immunostaining for hormones, insulin expression was most frequent (22 cases; 38.6%), followed by gastrin (7 cases; 12.3%); 25 cases (43.9%) were negative for all hormones. Loss of ATRX/DAXX immunoexpression was noted in 18 cases (39.1%), and was significantly more frequent in tumors larger than 5cm. Lymphovascular invasion, infiltrative borders, and infiltration of adjacent organs were also more frequent in tumors with loss of ATRX/DAXX immunoreactivity. A little over half the tumors with ATRX/DAXX loss showed negative immunostaining for all hormones (55.6%). Conclusion: Loss of ATRX/DAXX expression is frequent in PanNETs, indicating a role in their pathogenesis. As ATRX/DAXX loss is more frequent in larger tumors, and in those with lymphovascular invasion, adjacent organ infiltration and infiltrative borders, this suggests that loss of ATRX/DAXX expression is a late event in pathogenesis and is associated with an aggressive phenotype. Immunohistochemical detection of ATRX/DAXX loss is a simple method for ATRX/DAXX evaluation and can easily be incorporated into routine pathological evaluation of PanNETs.

AB  - Background. Long-term graft patency is the major factor impacting survival after coronary artery bypass grafting. Arteries are superior in this regard. Radial artery is considered the second best conduit after internal mammary artery. Several studies have shown excellent radial artery patency. We evaluated the morphologic characteristics of radial artery by three modalities, (i) preoperative Doppler ultrasound, (ii) intraoperative manual morphometry, and (iii) postoperative histology-based morphometry, and compared these with the aim of validating Doppler as a noninvasive test of choice for preoperative assessment of radial artery. Methods. This was a prospective study involving 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in which radial artery was used. The radial artery was assessed using preoperative Doppler ultrasound studies, intraoperative morphometry, and postoperative histopathology and morphometry. The morphometric measurements included (i) luminal diameter, (ii) intimal and medial thickness, and (iii) intima-media thickness ratio. Results. Using Bland-Altman plots, there was a 95% limit of agreement between the preoperative Doppler measurements and the postoperative histopathology and morphometry. Conclusion. Doppler ultrasound is an accurate screening test for evaluation of radial artery, in terms of intimal/medial thickness and luminal diameter as a conduit in coronary artery bypass grafting and has been validated by both morphometric and histopathology based studies.

AB  - Thirty new aryl-pyridazinone-substituted benzenesulphonylurea derivatives (I-XXX) were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-hyperglycaemic activity in glucose-fed hyperglycaemic normal rats. Twenty-three compounds (III-XI, XIV-XVII, XIX-XXIV, XXVI and XXVIII-XXX) showed more or comparable area under the curve (AUC) reduction percentage (ranging from 21.9% to 35.5%) as compared to the standard drug gliclazide (22.0%). On the basis of docking results, 18 compounds were screened for their in vitro ability to inhibit rat lens aldose reductase. Ten compounds (III-VI, XII, XVI-XVIII, XXI and XXVII) showed ARI activity with IC50 ranging from 34 to 242 mu M. Out of these, two compounds IV and V showed best ARI activity which is comparable with that of quercetin. As a result, two compounds (IV and V) possessing significant dual action (anti-hyperglycaemic and aldose reductase inhibition) were identified and may be used as lead compounds for developing new drugs.

AB  - Background: Extubation failure (EF), defined as need for re-intubation within 24-72 h, is multifactorial. Factors predicting EF in adults generally are not useful in children.
   Objective: To determine the factors associated with EF and to facilitate prediction of EF in mechanically ventilated infants and children less than 12 years of age.
   Material and Methods: Design Prospective cohort study. Setting PICU and NICU of a multispecialty tertiary care institute. Patients All consecutive newborns, infants and children, who remained on the ventilator for more than 12 h, were included. Patients with upper airway obstruction, neuromuscular disorders, complex anatomic malformations, accidental extubation, tracheostomy or death before extubation were excluded. Methods The pre-extubation clinical, laboratory and ventilatory parameters were collected for 92 cases over a one and half year period. The EF rate was calculated for each variable using STATA 9. All the treating physicians were blinded to the data collection procedure.
   Measurements and Results: Demographics were comparable between the extubation success and EF groups. Respiratory failure was the main cause requiring ventilation (46.74 %, 95 % CI 0.37-0.57) as well as EF (30.23 %, 95 % CI 0.08-0.23). 76.92 % (95 % CI 0.58-0.89) of patients that failed extubation had alterations in respiratory effort, 38.46 % (95 % CI 0.22-0.57) each had either poor or increased respiratory effort. Poor cough reflex (p = 0.001), thick endotracheal secretions (p = 0.02), failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) (p = 0.001) and higher rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) (p = 0.001) were found to be associated with EF.
   Conclusions: Paediatric EF is multifactorial. Increased or poor respiratory effort and failed SBT are potential factors in deciding re-intubation. Increased RSBI, poor cough reflex and thick.

AB  - Background: A new class of non-coding RNAs, known as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), has been recently described. These lncRNAs are implicated to play pivotal roles in various molecular processes, including development and oncogenesis. Gene expression profiling of human B-ALL samples showed differential lncRNA expression in samples with particular cytogenetic abnormalities. One of the most promising lncRNAs identified, designated B-ALL associated long RNA-6 (BALR-6), had the highest expression in patient samples carrying the MLL rearrangement, and is the focus of this study.
   Results: Here, we performed a series of experiments to define the function of BALR-6, including several novel splice forms that we identified. Functionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of BALR-6 in human B-ALL cell lines caused reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death. Conversely, overexpression of BALR-6 isoforms in both human and mouse cell lines caused increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Overexpression of BALR-6 in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments caused a significant increase in early hematopoietic progenitor populations, suggesting that its dysregulation may cause developmental changes. Notably, the knockdown of BALR-6 resulted in global dysregulation of gene expression. The gene set was enriched for leukemia-associated genes, as well as for the transcriptome regulated by Specificity Protein 1 (SP1). We confirmed changes in the expression of SP1, as well as its known interactor and downstream target CREB1. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated an enhancement of SP1-mediated transcription in the presence of BALR-6. These data provide a putative mechanism for regulation by BALR-6 in B-ALL.
   Conclusions: Our findings support a role for the novel lncRNA BALR-6 in promoting cell survival in B-ALL. Furthermore, this lncRNA influences gene expression in B-ALL in a manner consistent with a function in transcriptional regulation. Specifically, our findings suggest that BALR-6 expression regulates the transcriptome downstream of SP1, and that this may underlie the function of BALR-6 in B-ALL.

AB  - Amyloid aggregates display striking features of detergent stability and self-seeding. Human serum albumin (HSA), a preferred drug-carrier molecule, can also aggregate in vitro. So far, key amyloid properties of stability against ionic detergents and self-seeding, are unclear for HSA aggregates. Precautions against amyloid contamination would be required if HSA aggregates were self-seeding. Here, we show that HSA aggregates display detergent sarkosyl stability and have self-seeding potential. HSA dimer is preferable for clinical applications due to its longer retention in circulation and lesser oedema owing to its larger molecular size. Here, HSA was homodimerized via free cysteine-34, without any potentially immunogenic cross-linkers that are usually pre-requisite for homodimerization. Alike the monomer, HSA dimers also aggregated as amyloid, necessitating precautions while using for therapeutics. (C) 2015 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thymoma is the most common mediastinal tumor. They have varied presentation ranging from asymptomatic incidental mediastinal masses to locally extensive tumor with compressive symptoms and distant metastases. They have frequent association with various paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS). The most common PNS associated with thymoma is myasthenia gravis (MG). Patients of thymoma with MG have a favourable outcome due to early disclosure of the disease. Histologically they are classified into five subtypes and Masaoka-Koga staging system is used for staging. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy play an important role along with anti-myasthenia drugs. This review would like to highlight the association of thymoma with MG and associated clinical and therapeutic issues.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics, electrophysiology, MRI features and conduct viral assays in patients with Monomelic Amyotrophy (MMA) and follow them up over one year.
   Methods: Consecutive patients with MMA who attended the Neurology services from April 2013 to March 2014 were included. Age and sex matched controls were taken for the purpose of viral assay analysis. The clinical evaluation was repeated at six months and one year.
   Results: 109 cases and 109 controls were included in the study. The patients were predominantly males (98.2%; n = 107/109) and had involvement of upper limbs (83.5%; n = 91/109). 26 (23.8%) patients with clinically unilateral involvement had bilateral neurogenic changes in the electromyography. Serological assays of Japanese E, West Nile Virus, and Poliovirus 1, 2 and 3, HIV 1 and 2 were negative in all the cases and controls.
   Conclusions: Patients with MMA are predominantly young males with upper limb wasting and weakness. MRI of the cervical cord is normal in most of the patients (67.9%). The present study did not find any evidence of the association of viral infection in MMA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Successive Governments of India have promised to transform India's unsatisfactory health-care system, culminating in the present government's promise to expand health assurance for all. Despite substantial improvements in some health indicators in the past decade, India contributes disproportionately to the global burden of disease, with health indicators that compare unfavourably with other middle-income countries and India's regional neighbours. Large health disparities between states, between rural and urban populations, and across social classes persist. A large proportion of the population is impoverished because of high out-of-pocket health-care expenditures and suffers the adverse consequences of poor quality of care. Here we make the case not only for more resources but for a radically new architecture for India's health-care system. India needs to adopt an integrated national health-care system built around a strong public primary care system with a clearly articulated supportive role for the private and indigenous sectors. This system must address acute as well as chronic health-care needs, off er choice of care that is rational, accessible, and of good quality, support cashless service at point of delivery, and ensure accountability through governance by a robust regulatory framework. In the process, several major challenges will need to be confronted, most notably the very low levels of public expenditure; the poor regulation, rapid commercialisation of and corruption in health care; and the fragmentation of governance of health care. Most importantly, assuring universal health coverage will require the explicit acknowledgment, by government and civil society, of health care as a public good on par with education. Only a radical restructuring of the health-care system that promotes health equity and eliminates impoverishment due to out-of-pocket expenditures will assure health for all Indians by 2022-a fitting way to mark the 75th year of India's independence.

AB  - In the present study, we have synthesized poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride), a biocompatible copolymer that was further conjugated with paclitaxel (PTX) via ester linkage and self-assembled to form poly(styrene-co-maleic acid)-paclitaxel (PSMAC-PTX) nanopartides (NPs). The in vitro release of PTX from PSMAC-PTX NPs showed a higher release at lower pH than at the physiological pH of 7.4, confirming its pH-dependent release. The cell viability of PSMAC-PTX nanopartides was evaluated using MTT assay. IC50 values of 9.05-18.43 ng/mL of PTX equivalent were observed in various cancer cell lines after 72 h of incubation. Confocal microscopy, Western blotting, and Flow cytometry results further supported that the cellular uptake and apoptosis of cancer cells with PSMAC-PTX NPs. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the conjugation of PTX to the PSMAC copolymer not only increased the plasma and tumor C-max of PTX but also prolonged its plasma half-life and retention in tumor via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Administration of PSMAC-PTX NPs showed significant tumor growth inhibition with improved apoptosis effects in vivo on Ehrlich Ascites Tumor (EAT)-bearing BALB/c syngeneic mice in comparison with Taxol, without showing any cytotoxicity. On the basis of preliminary results, no subacute toxicity was observed in major organs, tissues and hematological system up to a dosage of 60 mg/kg body weight in mice. Therefore, PSMAC-PTX NPs may be considered as an alternative nanodrug delivery system for the delivery of PTX in solid tumors.

AB  - Introduction: Literature remains sparse regarding decompressive craniectomy (DC) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) in very young children. This study analysed the indications, complications and outcome of young children undergoing DC for TBI at our institute.Study design: Retrospective.Observations: The total number of patients was 71. Mean age was 1.6 years. Mean duration from injury to surgery was 11.9 hours (range=3-80 hours). Around 50% had severe head injury. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring was done in 33 patients. Mean ICP was 22.2mm Hg (range=9-50mm Hg). The threshold ICP for surgery was 15mm Hg. Perioperative mortality was 50% each for severe TBI (18/36) and diffuse cerebral edema (7/14), and 58% for infants (4/7). Ninety per cent of expired patients had ICP>20mm Hg. Mean follow-up duration was 19.6 months (range=2-42 months). Except one, all survivors had good-to-excellent outcomes (Glasgow outcome scale extended; GOS-E=7-8).Conclusions: Decompressive craniectomy offers a survival advantage in almost 50% of young children with severe TBI and should be used judiciously. The highest mortality was within the 1st week of surgery. The cut-off limit of 20mm Hg for surgical decompression might not be applicable to young children and a low threshold ICP needs to be considered. Factors associated with increased mortality are high opening ICP (>20mm Hg), GCS <8, diffuse cerebral oedema and infant age group. Timing of DC remains crucial. Further prospective studies are necessary to optimize the timing and ICP limit for surgical decompression.

AB  - Background The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor study 2013 (GBD 2013) is the first of a series of annual updates of the GBD. Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution.
   Methods Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol.
   Findings All risks combined account for 57.2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55.8-58.5) of deaths and 41.6% (40.1-43.0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87.9% (86.5-89.3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11.3 million deaths and 241.4 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10.4 million deaths and 208.1 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1.7 million deaths and 176.9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6.1 million deaths and 143.5 million DALYs, air pollution for 5.5 million deaths and 141.5 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4.4 million deaths and 134.0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa.
   Interpretation Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks.

AB  - Sirtuins are the protein deacetylases, which are linked to metabolic diseases and aging. There are seven sirtuins present in cell, whose regulation in diabetic heart is yet to be explored. Resveratrol is a well-known activator of SIRT-1, but its effect on other sirtuins is not yet clear. In the present study, we focused to find out the expression and regulation of all sirtuins in diabetic heart with the effect of resveratrol administration on them. We have induced T1DM rat model using steptozotocin and T2DM rat model by feeding high fructose diet for a period of eight weeks and analyzed the myocardial changes. Resveratrol was administrated to both the models simultaneously. Increased oxidative stress and cardiac phenotype alterations shows the induction of cardiac abnormalities in both models. We have observed decreased SIRT-1 and increased SIRT-3 activity in the T2DM rat heart. Moreover, in case of T1DM, gene and protein expression of all sirtuins was down, except SIRT-2 whose protein levels were increased. Administration of resveratrol prevented the alteration in SIRT-1 in T2DM and SIRT-1, 2, 3 and SIRT-5 in T1DM rat heart. Altered level of protein acetylation was observed corresponding to the changes in sirtuins. In conclusion, sirtuins are perturbed in both types of diabetic heart and can be considered as druggable target for therapeutic intervention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: In traditional medicine, Cissus quadrang-ularis has been used as a chief ingredient of many formulation for the treatment of inflammatory and bone disorders.. Objective: The study was carried out to investigate the anti-arthritic activity of C quadrangularis hydroalcoholic extract (CQHE) and to explore the plausible mechanism of action.
   Materials and methods: Arthritis was induced by sub plantar administration of formaldehyde (2% v/v) and 0.1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant. Joint swelling was measured on days 8, 9 and 10 in formaldehyde-induced arthritis and on 3, 7, 14 and 21 days in adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) respectively. Serum and ankle joints of ALA rats were used for estimation of serum TNF-alpha level, oxidative stress markers and synovial expression of proinflammatory cytokines/cytokine receptor (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-R1), angiogenesis marker (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-3& 9). An acute and 28-day oral toxicity was carried out to evaluate the safety of the test drug.
   Results: CQHE produced a dose dependent inhibition of joint swelling in both formaldehyde-induced and adjuvant induced arthritis. CQHE treatment also reduced serum TNF-a level, oxidative stress and synovial expression of inflammatory and angiogenesis marker. In sub acute toxicity study of CQHE, chronic administration of CQHE did not produce any physiological and pathological changes as compared to normal rats.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the anti-arthritic potential of C. quadrangularis and it validates its traditional use for the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zebrafish can repair their injured brain and spinal cord after injury unlike adult mammalian central nervous system. Any injury to zebrafish spinal cord would lead to increased proliferation and neurogenesis. There are presences of proliferating progenitors from which both neuronal and glial loss can be reversed by appropriately generating new neurons and glia. We have demonstrated the presence of multiple progenitors, which are different types of proliferating populations like Sox2(+) neural progenitor, A2B5(+) astrocyte/ glial progenitor, NG2(+) oligodendrocyte progenitor, radial glia and Schwann cell like progenitor. We analyzed the expression levels of two common markers of dedifferentiation like msx-b and vimentin during regeneration along with some of the pluripotency associated factors to explore the possible role of these two processes. Among the several key factors related to pluripotency, pou5f1 and sox2 are upregulated during regeneration and associated with activation of neural progenitor cells. Uncovering the molecular mechanism for endogenous regeneration of adult zebrafish spinal cord would give us more clues on important targets for future therapeutic approach in mammalian spinal cord repair and regeneration.

AB  - Purpose: Ictal motor phenomena play a crucial role in the localization of seizure focus in the management of refractory focal epilepsy. While the importance of unilateral automatisms is well established, little attention is paid to the contralateral relatively immobile limb. In cases where automatisms mimic clonic or dystonic movements and in the absence of previously well-established signs, unilateral relative ictal immobility (RII) is potentially useful as a lateralizing sign. This study was carried out to examine the lateralizing value of this sign and to define its characteristics among patients of refractory focal epilepsy.
   Methods: VEEGs of 69 consecutive patients of refractory focal epilepsy who had undergone epilepsy surgery at our center over last four years were reviewed and analyzed for the presence of RII. Unilateral RII was defined as a paucity of movement in one limb lasting for at least 10 s while the contralateral limb showed purposive or semi-purposive movements (in the absence of tonic or dystonic posturing or clonic movements in the involved limb). The findings were seen in the light of VEEG, radiological and nuclear imaging data, and with post-surgical outcome.
   Results: Unilateral RII as a lateralizing sign was found in 24 of 69 patients (34.78%), consisting of both temporal and extra temporal epilepsy, with 100% concordance with VEEG and MRI data. All patients demonstrating this sign had a good post-surgical outcome.
   Conclusion: Rh, when well characterized is a frequent and reliable lateralizing sign in patients of refractory focal epilepsy. (C) 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - LIFE-SUPPORT PROGRAM
AB  - The Rural Trauma Team Development Course (RTTDC) was devised to optimize trauma resuscitation training in under-resourced rural institutions. This program appears ideal for India because of its dense traffic, large population, and high frequency of rural trauma. We report on the feasibility and desirability of introducing RTTDC in India. An instructor course for 20 faculties and a provider course for 23 were conducted in New Delhi, India. The courses were evaluated by multiple choice question (MCQ) performance, by rating the modules on a three-point scale (1 0 very relevant, 2 0 relevant, and 3 0 not relevant) for communication skills, principles of performance improvement and patient safety (PIPS), and clinical scenarios. Evaluation questionnaires including desirability of promulgation in India were completed using a five-point Likert Scale (1 0 strongly agree, 2 0 agree, 3 0 neutral, 4 0 disagree, and 5 0 strongly disagree). Overall written comments were also provided. Both faculty and providers improved post-course MCQ scores (p<0.05) with lower scores in the provider group. Seventy-eight percent faculty and 74 % providers rated the communication module very relevant. PIPS was rated very relevant by 72 % faculty and 65 % providers. There were over 150 comments, generally positive with over 90 % of both faculty and providers rating strongly agree to agree that the course be promulgated widely in India. The RTTDC including plans for promulgation was enthusiastically received in India, and its potential for improving trauma care including communication skills and PIPS appears excellent.

AB  - Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) plays a central role in growth and differentiation of ovarian follicles. A plethora of information exists on molecular aspects of FSH responses but little is known about the mechanisms involved in its cross-talk with insulin/IGF-1 pathways implicated in the coordination of energy homeostasis in preovulatory granulosa cells (GCs). In this study, we hypothesized that FSH may regulate IRS-2 expression and thereby maintain the energy balance in GCs. We demonstrate here that FSH specifically increases IRS-2 expression in human and rat GCs. FSH-stimulated IRS-2 expression was inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Furthermore, FSH decreases IRS-2 mRNA degradation indicating post-transcriptional stabilization. Herein, we demonstrate a role of cAMP pathway in the activation of IRS-2 expression by FSH. Scan and activity analysis of IRS-2 promoter demonstrated that FSH regulates IRS-2 expression through SP1 binding sites. FSH stimulates SP1 translocation into nucleus and its binding to IRS-2 promoter. These results are corroborated by the fact that siRNA mediated knockdown of IRS-2 decreased the FSH-stimulated PI3K activity, p-Akt levels, GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. However, FSH was not able to increase IRS-2 expression in GCs from PCOS women undergoing IVF. Interestingly, IRS-2 mRNA expression was downregulated in GCs from the PCOS rat model. Taken together, our findings establish that FSH induces IRS-2 expression and thereby activates PI3K, Akt and glucose uptake. Crucially, our data confirms a molecular defect in FSH action in PCOS GCs which may cause deceleration of metabolism and follicular growth leading to infertility. These results lend support for a therapeutic potential of IRS-2 in the management of PCOS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bile duct injury following cholecystectomy is an iatrogenic catastrophe associated with significant perioperative morbidity, reduced long-term survival and quality of life. There has been little literature on the long-term outcomes after surgical reconstruction and factors affecting it. The aim of this study was to study factors affecting long-term outcomes following surgical repair of iatrogenic bile duct injury being referred to a tertiary care centre. Between January 2005 to December 2011, 138 patients with bile duct injury were treated in a single surgical unit in a tertiary care referral hospital. Preoperative details were recorded. After initial resuscitation, any intra-abdominal collection was drained and an imaging of biliary anatomy was done. Once the general condition of the patient improved, patients were taken up for a side-to-side extended left duct hepaticojejunostomy. The post-operative outcomes were recorded and a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan and liver function tests were done, and then the patients were followed up at regular intervals. Clinical outcome was evaluated according to clinical grades described by Terblanche and Worthley (Surgery 108: 828-834, 1990). The variables were compared using chi-square, unpaired Student's t test and Fisher's exact test. A two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered significant. One hundred thirty-eight patients, 106 (76.8 %) females and 32 (23.2 %) males with an age range of 2063 years (median 40.8 +/- SD) with bile duct injury following open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were operated during this period. Majority of the patients [83 (60.1 %)] had a delayed presentation of more than 3 months. Based on imaging, Strasburg type E1 was seen in 17 (12.5 %), type E2 in 30 (21.7 %), type E3 in 85 (61.5 %) and type E4 in 6 (4.3 %). On multivariate analysis, only level of injury, longer duration of referral and associated vascular injury were independently associated with an overall poor long-term outcome. This study demonstrates level of injury at or above the confluence; associated vascular injury and delay in referral were associated with poorer outcomes in long-term follow-up; however, almost all patients had excellent outcome in long-term follow-up.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women with the incidence rising in young women. GST gene polymorphisms are significant because of their role in the detoxification of both environmental carcinogens and also cytotoxic drugs used in therapy for breast cancer. The present study has been designed to identify the role of polymorphisms in GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes in the risk of development of breast cancer, in the prognostication of breast cancer, and in the prediction of response towards chemotherapy. Ninety-nine patients with breast cancer and 100 healthy controls with no history of cancer were taken from blood donors after informed consent. Epidemiological and clinical data was collected from participants and 5 ml of peripheral venous blood was collected for genotype analysis. Null genotype of GSTT1 was detected in 51.04 % of the controls in comparison to 20.2 % of patients with carcinoma breast, which was found to be statistically significant (OR 4.18; 95 % CI 2.01-8.75; P=0.0001). GSTM1 gene deletion was also significantly more common among controls (60 %) than in patients with breast cancer (33 %) (OR 4.57; 95% CI 2.20-9.51; P=0.0001). Tumors more than 5 cm in size had greater tendency for GSTM1 gene expression (P value=0.019), but other clinicopathological parameters did not show any correlation. GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes status did not show any association with response to chemotherapy. The results indicated the null genotype of both GSTT1 and GSTM1 to be protective for the development of carcinoma breast. None of the known etiological factors have any correlation with GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletion. Patients with small tumor size expressed GSTM1 gene deletion. Other tumor characteristics and clinicopathological parameters did not have any correlation with gene deletion.

AB  - Wilson's disease, characterized by abnormal topper accumulation in the human body, may present with psychiatric manifestations in about one-fifth of patients. The authors report a patient with Wilson's disease who initially presented with acute psychosis and later developed catatonic symptoms. The atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment. Wilson's disease can be ruled out in all young patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time by screening for a Kayser-Fleischer ring.

AB  - We report on two siblings with features suggestive of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Estimation of CD46 expression by flow cytometry and gene sequencing were performed in members of this family.
   Three siblings, two of whom were symptomatic, had markedly decreased (< 10 %) cell surface expression of CD46 and homozygous splice site mutation (IVS2 + 2 T > G) in the CD46 gene; the other 10-year-old sibling was asymptomatic. The illness was preceded by dengue shock syndrome in the index case. Both parents and two other siblings were heterozygous for this CD46 mutation.
   Homozygous IVS2 + 2 T > G mutation in CD46 gene, similar to heterozygous mutation, may be clinically silent at least during childhood. The role of antecedent infections in triggering the disease requires further examination.

AB  - AimInformation about fusion transcripts in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is used to risk-stratify patients, decide on the treatment and to detect minimal residual disease. This study was conducted to determine the frequency of common fusion transcripts BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4 and E2A-PBX1 for B-ALL and SIL-TAL1 for T-ALL as seen at a tertiary care center in India.
   MethodsUp to 304 new cases of ALL (271 B-ALL and 33 T-ALL) diagnosed on morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping were studied. All were screened for the common fusion transcripts by RT-PCR.
   ResultsBoth our B- (218/271; 80.4%) and T-ALL (26/33; 78.8%) patients were largely children. In the B-ALL children, BCR-ABL was detected in 26/218 (11.9%), E2A-PBX1 in 13/218 (5.9%), TEL-AML1 in 16/218 (7.3%) and MLL-AF4 in 3/218 (1.4%) patients. Adult B-ALL cases had BCR-ABL in 15/53 (28.3%) and E2A-PBX in 2/53 (3.8%); however, no other fusion transcript was detected. SIL-TAL1 was found in four of 26 pediatric (15%) and zero of 7 adult T-ALL cases.
   ConclusionThe higher incidence of BCR-ABL and lower incidence of TEL-AML1 in our ALL patients, both in children and adults as compared with the West, suggests that patients in India may be biologically different. This difference may explain at least in part the higher relapse rate and poorer outcome in our B-ALL cases.

AB  - AimTo evaluate the effect of breastfeeding on long-term (breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus) and short-term (lactational amenorrhoea, postpartum depression, postpartum weight change) maternal health outcomes.
   MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library and CABI databases. Outcome estimates of odds ratios or relative risks or standardised mean differences were pooled. In cases of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were explored.
   ResultsBreastfeeding >12months was associated with reduced risk of breast and ovarian carcinoma by 26% and 37%, respectively. No conclusive evidence of an association between breastfeeding and bone mineral density was found. Breastfeeding was associated with 32% lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Exclusive breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding were associated with longer duration of amenorrhoea. Shorter duration of breastfeeding was associated with higher risk of postpartum depression. Evidence suggesting an association of breastfeeding with postpartum weight change was lacking.
   ConclusionThis review supports the hypothesis that breastfeeding is protective against breast and ovarian carcinoma, and exclusive breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding increase the duration of lactational amenorrhoea. There is evidence that breastfeeding reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, an association between breastfeeding and bone mineral density or maternal depression or postpartum weight change was not evident.

AB  - Idiopathic male infertility is empirically managed using a number of drugs. We reviewed 64 articles published in the last 10 years on such drug therapy. There was severe heterogeneity in data along with poor definition of outcome parameters. Pregnancy or live birth rate was not reported in many studies. Antiestrogens appear to improve pregnancy rates while there is some data supporting the use of aromatase inhibitors. Antioxidants significantly increase the rate of both live birth and pregnancy but the data are limited. However, valid end-points based on data are limited for the empirical use of drugs in idiopathic male infertility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is characterised by the presence of immune responses to previously acquired Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection without clinical evidence of active tuberculosis (TB). Here we report evidence-based guidelines from the World Health Organization for a public health approach to the management of LTBI in high risk individuals in countries with high or middle upper income and TB incidence of <100 per 100 000 per year. The guidelines strongly recommend systematic testing and treatment of LTBI in people living with HIV, adult and child contacts of pulmonary TB cases, patients initiating anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment, patients receiving dialysis, patients preparing for organ or haematological transplantation, and patients with silicosis. In prisoners, healthcare workers, immigrants from high TB burden countries, homeless persons and illicit drug users, systematic testing and treatment of LTBI is conditionally recommended, according to TB epidemiology and resource availability. Either commercial interferon-gamma release assays or Mantoux tuberculin skin testing could be used to test for LTBI. Chest radiography should be performed before LTBI treatment to rule out active TB disease. Recommended treatment regimens for LTBI include: 6 or 9 month isoniazid; 12 week rifapentine plus isoniazid; 3-4 month isoniazid plus rifampicin; or 3-4 month rifampicin alone.

AB  - Background: Studies on predictors of ischemic strokes caused by rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are sparse and extremely important for identifying high-risk cases to direct future therapeutic trials for prevention of ischemic stroke in this population. Objective: The aim of the present study was to study the predictors of ischemic stroke in patients with RHD and to observe outcome of patients with ischemic stroke at 3 months' follow-up using modified Rankin scale. Methods: We conducted a case-control study comparing the clinical profile of 40 adult patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by RHD with equal numbers of matched controls comprising patients with RHD without any prior history of stroke. We also observed the functional outcome of ischemic strokes in these patients. Results: The presence of left atrial spontaneous echo contrast (odds ratio = 39.9; 95% confidence interval, 3.16-501.9; P = .004) and atrial fibrillation (AF) (odds ratio = 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-6.7; P = .002) was significantly associated with stroke occurrence in RHD populations. The outcome of patients was good with low mortality and significant improvement of modified Rankin scale at 3 months' follow-up. Conclusions: Presence of AF and left atrial spontaneous echo contrast are significant risk factors for ischemic stroke in patients with RHD. There is high percentage of subclinical AF in this population. Future large clinical trials for oral anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents are needed for stroke prevention in high-risk RHD patients identified by a detailed workup.

KW  - INTRAOCULAR FOREIGN-BODIES
AB  - Objective: To evaluate use of multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) in diagnosing retinal toxicity from siderosis with normal ERG.
   Design: Prospective case series.
   Participants: Six patients with retained intraocular foreign body were recruited. Methods: The affected eye of the patients had no clinical evidence of siderosis, had similar full-field photopic 3.0 ERG compared with the fellow eye, and had subnormal visual acuity. Group averages in each MfERG ring for implicit time and amplitude at P1 wave were compared between affected and fellow eye to look for latent siderosis.
   Results: On mfERG, no statistical difference in group averaged amplitude was observed; however, a significant difference (p < 0.05) was found in group averaged latency between fellow and affected eye at most tested rings (<2 degree, 2-5 degree, and >15 degree rings). Average latency for overall retinal area mapped also showed significant difference (p = 0.010).
   Conclusions: Increased mfERG latency may serve as an early predictor of retinal damage from siderosis when full-field ERG is normal.

AB  - Mercury, one of the most toxic heavy metals, is ubiquitous in environment. The adverse health impact of mercury on living organisms is well known. The health care facilities are one of the important sources of mercury release into the atmosphere as mercury items are extensively used in hospitals. To assess the awareness about mercury toxicity and the knowledge of proper handling and disposal of mercury-containing items in health care set-up, a questionnaire-based survey was carried out amongst doctors (n = 835), nurses (n = 610) and technicians (n = 393) in government hospitals, corporate hospitals and primary health care centres in the Indian states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The study was conducted using a tool-containing pretested structured multiple-choice questionnaire. Analysis of the results using STATA 11.1 software highlighted that overall awareness was more in corporate sector. However, percentage range of knowledge of respondents irrespective of health care sector was only between 20 and 40%. Despite the commitment of various hospitals to be mercury free, mercury containing-thermometer/sphygmomanometer are still preferred by health professionals. The likely reasons are availability, affordability, accuracy and convenience in use. There is an urgent need for source reduction, recycling and waste minimization. Emphasis must be laid on mercury alternative products, education and training of health personnel and public at large, about correct handling and proper clean up of spills.

AB  - Background & objectives: Abnormal endothelial function represents a preclinical marker of atherosclerosis. This study was conducted to evaluate associations between anthropometry, cardiometabolic risk factors, and early life factors and adult measures of endothelial function in a young urban Indian cohort free of clinical cardiovascular disease.
   Methods: Absolute changes in brachial artery diameter following cuff inflation and sublingual nitroglycerin (400 mu g) were recorded to evaluate endothelium-dependent and -independent measures of endothelial function in 600 participants (362 men; 238 women) from the New Delhi Birth Cohort (2006-2009). Data on anthropometry, cardiometabolic risk factors, medical history, socio-economic position, and lifestyle habits were collected. Height and weight were recorded at birth, two and 11 yr of age. Age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models were developed to evaluate these associations.
   Results: The mean age of participants was 36 +/- 1 yr. Twenty two per cent men and 29 per cent women were obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)). Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 131 +/- 14 and 119 +/- 13 mmHg, and diabetes prevalence was 12 and 8 per cent for men and women, respectively. Brachial artery diameter was higher for men compared with women both before (3.48 +/- 0.37 and 2.95 +/- 0.35 cm) and after hyperaemia (3.87 +/- 0.37 vs. 3.37 +/- 0.35 cm). A similar difference was seen before and after nitroglycerin. Markers of increased adiposity, smoking, SBP, and metabolic syndrome, but not early life anthropometry, were inversely associated with endothelial function after adjustment for age and sex.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The analysis of the current prospective data from a young urban Indian cohort showed that cardiometabolic risk factors, but not early life anthropometry, were associated with worse endothelial function.

AB  - Background & objectives: There is a significant bone tissue loss in patients from diseases and traumatic injury. The current autograft transplantation gold standard treatment has drawbacks, namely donor site morbidity and limited supply. The field of tissue engineering has emerged with a goal to provide alternative sources for transplantations to bridge this gap between the need and lack of bone graft. The aim of this study was to prepare biocomposite scaffolds based on chitosan (CHT), polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) by freeze drying method and to assess the role of scaffolds in spatial organization, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in vitro, in order to achieve bone graft substitutes with improved physical-chemical and biological properties.
   Methods: Pure chitosan (100CHT) and composites (40CHT/HAP, 30CHT/HAP/PCL and 25CHT/HAP/PCL scaffolds containing 40, 30, 25 parts per hundred resin (phr) filler, respectively) in acetic acid were freeze dried and the porous foams were studied for physicochemical and in vitro biological properties.
   Results: Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the scaffolds showed porous microstructure (20300 mu m) with uniform pore distribution in all compositions. Materials were tested under compressive load in wet condition (using phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4). The in vitro studies showed that all the scaffold compositions supported mesenchymal stem cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation as visible from SEM images, [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay and quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Scaffold composition 25CHT/HAP/PCL showed better biomechanical and osteoinductive properties as evident by mechanical test and alkaline phosphatase activity and osteoblast specific gene expression studies. This study suggests that this novel degradable 3D composite may have great potential to be used as scaffold in bone tissue engineering.

AB  - Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogenous disease with respect to prognosis. Early response assessment has an established role as predictor of remission rate, and overall and disease-free survival. Assessment of blast percentage on bone marrow aspirate smears at this stage has its own limitations.
   Materials and method: In this study, a total of 100 AML cases that were positive for CD34 at the time of diagnosis were included in the study. Blast percentage obtained in bone marrow aspirate smears by morphology was compared with that obtained in bone marrow biopsy using CD34 immunohistochemistry.
   Results: Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were discordant in 19% of the cases. In 15% of the cases, bone marrow aspirate blast count was <= 5% and bone marrow biopsy blast percentage was >5%.
   Conclusion: Early response assessment plays an important role in management of acute myeloid leukemia. In patients with CD34-positive blasts, the CD34 IHC can improve the detection of residual blasts on Day 14 bone marrow biopsy in comparison with morphological assessment of blast percentage in bone marrow aspirate.

AB  - This article describes a number-based system for the classification of insulin regimes. It utilizes a patient-centered variable (number of injections per day) and pharmacokinetic/dynamic characteristics to craft a taxonomic system that is able to incorporate all available insulin preparations and coformulations. This framework of systematics is robust enough to include various molecules that have been recently developed. It serves to enhance understanding of the subject, and facilitates the practical or clinical usage of theoretical knowledge. We propose that number-based insulin taxonomic models should be used in clinical guidelines and recommendations rather than restricting ourselves to pharmaceutical-based classifications. PubMed articles including both review articles and clinical trials published since the year 1990 were searched, to gather evidence and information on the various types of insulins available, and how they can be used, based on the number or frequency of injections prescribed per day.

AB  - Ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) is a novel way of assessing glycaemic levels on a 24 hour basis, through a minimally invasive method, known as flash glucose monitoring. This review describes the unique features of AGP, differentiates it from existing methods of glucose monitoring, and explains how it helps pursue the glycaemic pentad. The review suggests pragmatic usage of this technology, including pre-test, intra-test, and post-test counselling, and lists specific clinical scenarios where the investigation seems to be of immense benefit.

AB  - The breast surgeries are classically taught as clean surgical procedures. The infection rates following breast surgery ranges from 3 to 15 %, which is much higher than infection rates after clean surgery (ranging from 1.5 to 3 %). This high infection rate following breast surgery can be explained by opening of the ductal system to outside world through nipple similar to the gastrointestinal and genitourinary system. We conducted a systematic review of infection following breast surgeries. We searched various randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and Cochrane Reviews over PubMed and Medline via the Internet. These evidences were found to support the thesis, "Breast surgeries need to be reclassified as clean-contaminated". We recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in breast surgery.

AB  - Intestinal parasitic infections are one of the major causes of diarrhea in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive individuals. Antiretroviral therapy has markedly reduced the incidence of many opportunistic infections, but parasite-related diarrhea still remains frequent and often underestimated especially in developing countries. The present hospital-based study was conducted to determine the spectrum of intestinal parasitosis in adult HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) patients with or without diarrhea with the levels of CD4(+) T-cell counts. A total of 400 individuals were enrolled and were screened for intestinal parasitosis. Of these study population, 200 were HIV seropositives, and the remaining 200 were HIV uninfected individuals with or without diarrhea. Intestinal parasites were identified by using microscopy as well as PCR assay. A total of 130 (32.5%) out of 400 patients were positive for any kinds of intestinal parasites. The cumulative number of parasite positive patients was 152 due to multiple infections. A significant association of Cryptosporidium (P<0.001) was detected among individuals with CD4(+) T-cell counts less than 200 cells/mu l.

AB  - Introduction Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare sporadic congenital neurocutaneous syndrome which is characterized by vascular malformation involving the brain, face and eye. The anesthetic management is complicated by its localized as well as systemic manifestations, associated anomalies and difficult airway due to the presence of angiomas of the oral cavity and airway. We retrospective analyzed the perioperative anesthetic management of children with SWS undergoing ophthalmic surgery and reviewed the literature.
   Methods Medical records and anesthetic charts of all the children with SWS who had undergone an ophthalmic procedure under general anesthesia during the past 6 years were reviewed. Information related to the demographic profile, preoperative evaluation, anesthetic techniques, and perioperative complications were collected and analyzed.
   Results Forty children with SWS received general anesthesia for an ophthalmic procedure within the 6-year period. The median age of the children was 3 years. 30 (92.5 %) children had facial port-wine staining, 10 (25 %) had facial hypertrophy, 15 (37.5 %) had a history of convulsion and 4 (10 %) children had mental retardation. Inhalational induction was performed in 34 (85 %) children (sevoflurane 82.8 %). A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and endotracheal tube were used in 32 (80 %) and 5 (12.5 %) cases, respectively. One patient had difficult mask ventilation and difficult LMA insertion. There was no significant problem in any of the other children.
   Conclusion Preoperative evaluation with airway assessment should be performed with the knowledge of local and systemic manifestation of the syndrome. Proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties of the anesthetics, as well as drug interactions of antiepileptic medications should be considered when planning anesthesia. Avoiding a rise in intracranial and intraocular pressures, vigilant intraoperative monitoring and postoperative care are the key for conducting safe anesthesia in these children. For ophthalmic procedures, LMAs can be used for airway maintenance with minimal complications in children with SWS.

AB  - Although delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy is not life-threatening and can be treated conservatively, it results in discomfort and significant prolongation of the hospital stay and adds on to the hospital costs. To overcome this problem, we started using the isolated loop technique of reconstruction along with pancreaticogastrostomy and we present our series using this technique. All consecutive patients undergoing Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy in a single surgical unit from January 2009 until December 2012 were included. In the absence of hepatic and peritoneal metastasis, resection (Whipple's procedure) with curative intent was done using isolated loop technique with pancreaticogastrostomy. Delayed gastric emptying was assessed clinically and on oral gastrograffin study. Bile reflux was also assessed on clinical parameters and evidence of beefy friable gastric mucosa on upper GI endoscopy and presence of reflux on hepatobiliary scintigraphy. A total of 52 patients were operated using this technique from January 2009 to October 2012. The mean operative time was 260.8 +/- 50.3, and the mean operative blood loss was 1,068.0 +/- 606.1 ml. Mean gastric emptying time 106.0 +/- 6.1 min (89-258 min). Three out of the 52(5.7 %) patients had persistent vomiting in the post-operative period requiring reinsertion of NG tube. A HIDA scan done on POD7 for all patients did not show any evidence of bile reflux in any of the patients. Pancreatogastrostomy with isolated loop in pancreaticoduodenal resection markedly reduces the post-operative incidence of alkaline reflux gastritis and DGE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virchow Robin spaces (VRSs) are perivascular spaces that act as drainage pathways for interstitial fluid. Dilatation of VRSs is visible on magnetic resonance images in asymptomatic individuals. However, giant dilatation of VRSs (dVRSs) is very rare. Such giant dVRSs may produce a pressure effect on surrounding structures and can be confused with more sinister conditions such as cystic neoplasm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 30-year-old man who presented with complaints of headache, poor attention and concentration, forgetfulness, polyuria, urinary incontinence for past 3 years and hypersomnia for 3 months. He was found to have a multicystic lesion in the midbrain with extension into the third ventricle, causing hydrocephalus due to aqueductal obstruction. Although at first look, the radiologic features suggested a cystic neoplasm, a careful magnetic resonance imaging evaluation helped to establish the correct diagnosis of dVRS. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy resolved his symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dilatation of VRS may produce multicystic giant lesions that can easily be confused with other pathologic condition that have a completely different prognosis and management. Knowledge about the existence of such an entity and their radiologic features is important to prevent such misdiagnosis and mismanagement in the form of biopsy/excision, which can have devastating consequences.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to describe the surgical technique and clinical outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy without laser or gas tamponade in cases with optic disc pit maculopathy at our centre. Six eyes of six consecutive patients presenting with unilateral optic disc pit maculopathy were enrolled. Preoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed to determine the presence and extent of schisis and macular detachment. All eyes underwent 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with induction of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and eyes were closed under fluid. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months post-surgery. Median age of patients was 22.5 years. Five of six eyes had neurosensory detachment (NSD) at the presentation; whereas, inner layer schisis was present in all patients. None of the patients had any evidence of vitreomacular or vitreopapillary adhesion or PVD either clinically or on OCT. Inner and outer retinal schisis resolved in all eyes after follow-up of at least 6 months. Resolution of subretinal fluid in eyes with NSD was seen in 4 of 5 eyes. There was a significant visual acuity improvement from mean preoperative visual acuity of 0.79 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units to 0.36 logMAR units at 12 months (P = 0.001). Thus, vitrectomy with ILM peeling and PVD induction alone could achieve good functional outcomes in cases with optic disc pit maculopathy.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex autoimmune disease with strong genetic influence. In this study, we investigated +49A/G SNP (rs 231775) in exon 1 of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) by PCR-RFLP and its influence as a risk factor for the disease in the North Indian population. This polymorphism at codon 17 results in an amino acid substitution (Thr/Ala) in the leader peptide of the molecule. The study included 232 patients with T1D (age at onset of disease (AOD): 0.5-37 years) and 305 ethnically matched healthy controls. The DNA obtained from these 537 individuals was amplified using a set of specific primers followed by restriction enzyme digestion with Fnu4HI. The +49G allele as well as its homozygous genotype G/G was observed to be significantly higher in patients as compared to the healthy controls {(37.3% vs. 25.6%, P = 4.96E(-05), OR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.33-2.25) (15.52% vs. 6.6%, P = 0.001, OR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.48-4.63) respectively}. The frequency of G/G genotype was significantly higher in patients with early age at onset of disease (AOD: <12 years) as compared to that in the late-onset patients with AOD: = 12 years (21.1% vs. 10.6%, P = 0.042, OR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.09-4.67) as well as to that in the healthy controls (21.1% vs. 6.6%, P = 0.00004, OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 2.01-7.2). Further analysis revealed that the median AOD significantly reduced (P = 0.049) from 14 years in patients with A/A genotype to 11 and 10 years in those with A/G and G/G genotypes, respectively. These results suggest that CTLA4+49G allele, particularly in homozygous G/G condition, associates with early onset of T1D.

AB  - This paper investigates the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) response of BaFCl:Eu and K2Ca2(SO4)(3):Eu phosphors for different doses and bleaching durations. The results have also been compared with the commercially available Landauer Al2O3:C (LuxelA (R)) dosemeter. Nanocrystalline K2Ca2(SO4)(3):Eu is known to be a sensitive thermoluminescent phosphor, but its OSL response is hardly reported. At first, pellets of nanocrystalline K2Ca2(SO4)(3):Eu powder were prepared by adding Teflon as a binder. Their OSL signal was compared with that of the material in pure form, i.e. without adding the binder (in 100:1 ratio). It was observed that adding the binder does not appreciably affect the OSL intensity. On comparison with the commercially available Al2O3:C from Landauer, it was found that K2Ca2(SO4)(3):Eu is around 15 times less sensitive than Al2O3:C. 'Homemade' BaFCl:Eu phosphor has also been studied. The intensity of BaFCl:Eu was similar to 20 times more than the standard Al2O3:C dosemeter and similar to 200 times more sensitive than K2Ca2(SO4)(3):Eu in the dose range of 13-200 cGy. OSL dosemeters are believed to give luminescence signal even if they are read before, i.e. multiple reading may be possible under suitable conditions after single exposure. This was also checked for all the prepared dosemeters and it was found that Al2O3:C showed the least decrease of < 2 %, followed by BaFCl:Eu of 15 % and K2Ca2(SO4)(3):Eu with 20 %. Finally, Al2O3:C and BaFCl:Eu phosphors were also studied for their optical bleaching durations to which the respective signals get completely removed so that the phosphor can be re-used. It was observed that BaFCl:Eu is bleached faster and more easily than Al2O3:C.

AB  - The objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate prevalence of traumatic diaphragmatic injury (TDI), (2) identify the predictors of mortality, and (3) study the accuracy of investigations in survivors of TDI. Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of TDI from January 2007 to December 2011. Emergency department (ED) records, operative details, and autopsy reports were reviewed to determine injury characteristics, treatment provided, and outcome. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS ver. 15 software. TDI was identified in 75 individuals. Thirty-two of 75 (42.6 %) cases were brought dead to the hospital, and 43/75 (57.3 %) were survivors presented to emergency department, diagnosed to have TDI intraoperatively. Seven of 43 (16.3 %) died post-operatively. Mortality in TDI was significantly related to age (p = 0.001), injury severity (p < 0.001), site of TDI (p = 0.002), and associated injuries (p = 0.021, odds ratio of 9). Death increased with increase in the number of organ injured (p < 0.001, odds ratio of 12). Multi-detector computer tomography (MDCT) detected TDI in 23/26 (88.5 %) cases preoperatively. Laparotomy (p < 0.001, odds ratio of 22) and thoracotomy (p = 0.021, with odds ratio of 9) were associated with survival benefit when compared to minimal invasive surgery in injured cases. The prevalence of TDI was 2.67 %, TDI's mark severity of injury. Mortality increases with increasing number of organ injured. Right-sided or bilateral injury of diaphragm is associated with increased mortality.

AB  - Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a limited ultrasound examination, primarily aimed at the identification of the presence of free intraperitoneal or pericardial fluid. In the context of blunt trauma abdomen (BTA), free fluid is usually due to hemorrhage, bowel contents, or both; contributes towards the timely diagnosis of potentially life-threatening hemorrhage; and is a decision-making tool to help determine the need for further evaluation or operative intervention. Fifty patients with blunt trauma abdomen were evaluated prospectively with FAST. The findings of FAST were compared with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), laparotomy, and autopsy. Any free fluid in the abdomen was presumed to be hemoperitoneum. Sonographic findings of intra-abdominal free fluid were confirmed by CECT, laparotomy, or autopsy wherever indicated. In comparing with CECT scan, FAST had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 77.27, 100, and 79.16 %, respectively, in the detection of free fluid. When compared with surgical findings, it had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 94.44, 50, and 90 %, respectively. The sensitivity of FAST was 75 % in determining free fluid in patients who died when compared with autopsy findings. Overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FAST were 80.43, 75 and 80 %, respectively, for the detection of free fluid in the abdomen. From this study, we can safely conclude that FAST is a rapid, reliable, and feasible investigation in patients with BTA, and it can be performed easily, safely, and quickly in the emergency room with a reasonable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. It helps in the initial triage of patients for assessing the need for urgent surgery.

TI  - Primary Ectopic Mediastinal Goiter in a Patient With Crohn's Disease Presenting as Myasthenia Gravis
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB  - Mediastinum is an uncommon location for ectopic goiter. Primary ectopic mediastinal goiter has been reported to present mostly with compressive symptoms. We report a case of a 62-year-old man with history of Crohn's disease, who presented with symptoms of myasthenia gravis and was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass. The mass was resected completely with successful outcome. On histopathologic examination this mass turned out to be colloid goiter. This is an extremely rare presentation of a primary ectopic mediastinal goiter. (C) 2015 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons

AB  - The concept of pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) is virtually nonexistent in India. Suboptimally organized prehospital services substantially hinder the evaluation, management, and subsequent transport of the acutely ill and/or injured child to an appropriate facility. Furthermore, the management of the ill child at the hospital level is often provided by overburdened providers who, by virtue of their training, lack experience in the skills required to effectively manage pediatric emergencies. Finally, the care of the traumatized child often requires the involvement of providers trained in different specialities, which further impedes timely access to appropriate care. The recent recognition of Doctor of Medicine (MD) in Emergency Medicine (EM) as an approved discipline of study as per the Indian Medical Council Act provides an unprecedented opportunity to introduce PEM as a formal academic program in India. PEM has to be developed as a 3- year superspeciality course (in PEM) after completion of MD/Diplomate of National Board (DNB) Pediatrics or MD/DNB in EM. The National Board of Examinations (NBE) that accredits and administers postgraduate and postdoctoral programs in India also needs to develop an academic program-DNB in PEM. The goals of such a program would be to impart theoretical knowledge, training in the appropriate skills and procedures, development of communication and counseling techniques, and research. In this paper, the Joint Working Group of the Academic College of Emergency Experts in India (JWG-ACEE-India) gives its recommendations for starting 3-year DM/DNB in PEM, including the curriculum, infrastructure, staffing, and training in India. This is an attempt to provide an uniform framework and a set of guiding principles to start PEM as a structured superspeciality to enhance emergency care for Indian children.

AB  - The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function and changes inthe intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.

AB  - Purpose Primary pediatric gliosarcoma (pPGS) is an extremely rare entity with only 25 cases reported in the English literature. The value of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide is not known in this group of patient.
   Five patients of pPGS treated from 2006 to 2011 were included in this retrospective analysis. All patients underwent maximal safe surgical resection. Adjuvant therapy included conformal radiation 60 Gy in 30 fractions (2 Gy daily for 5 days in a week) with concurrent temozolomide 75 mg/m(2) daily followed by six cycles of maintenance temozolomide 150-200 mg/m(2) (day 1 to day 5) every 4 weeks. We combined the survival data of 25 patients (already published) and five of our patients and analyzed them in terms of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier method.
   Male to female ratio was 1:4 and median age was 12 years (range, 7-19 years). All but one patient underwent gross total resection and four patients completed adjuvant radiotherapy as well as concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. At a median follow up of 22.6 months (range, 0 to 45.3 months), two patients were dead and two were alive without disease while one was lost to follow up. For the pooled data, estimated median PFS and OS of all 30 patients reported in literature were 12 and 43 months, respectively. Two years PFS and OS rate for all patients was 44.2 and 62.9 %, respectively.
   Adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide is well tolerated and show an encouraging survival in pPGS.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth is the leading cause of child death worldwide. Small and sick newborns require timely, high-quality inpatient care to survive. This includes provision of warmth, feeding support, safe oxygen therapy and effective phototherapy with prevention and treatment of infections. Inpatient care for newborns requires dedicated ward space, staffed by health workers with specialist training and skills. Many of the estimated 2.8 million newborns that die every year do not have access to such specialised care.
   Methods: The bottleneck analysis tool was applied in 12 countries in Africa and Asia as part of the Every Newborn Action Plan process. Country workshops involved technical experts to complete the survey tool, which is designed to synthesise and grade health system "bottlenecks" (or factors that hinder the scale up) of maternal-newborn intervention packages. For this paper, we used quantitative and qualitative methods to analyse the bottleneck data, and combined these with literature review, to present priority bottlenecks and actions relevant to different health system building blocks for inpatient care of small and sick newborns.
   Results: Inpatient care of small and sick newborns is an intervention package highlighted by all country workshop participants as having critical health system challenges. Health system building blocks with the highest graded (significant or major) bottlenecks were health workforce (10 out of 12 countries) and health financing (10 out of 12 countries), followed by community ownership and partnership (9 out of 12 countries). Priority actions based on solution themes for these bottlenecks are discussed.
   Conclusions: Whilst major bottlenecks to the scale-up of quality inpatient newborn care are present, effective solutions exist. For all countries included, there is a critical need for a neonatal nursing cadre. Small and sick newborns require increased, sustained funding with specific insurance schemes to cover inpatient care and avoid catastrophic out-of-pocket payments. Core competencies, by level of care, should be defined for monitoring of newborn inpatient care, as with emergency obstetric care. Rather than fatalism that small and sick newborns will die, community interventions need to create demand for accessible, high-quality, family-centred inpatient care, including kangaroo mother care, so that every newborn can survive and thrive.

AB  - Background: The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP), launched in 2014, aims to end preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths, with national targets of <= 12 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births and <= 12 stillbirths per 1000 total births by 2030. This requires ambitious improvement of the data on care at birth and of small and sick newborns, particularly to track coverage, quality and equity.
   Methods: In a multistage process, a matrix of 70 indicators were assessed by the Every Newborn steering group. Indicators were graded based on their availability and importance to ENAP, resulting in 10 core and 10 additional indicators. A consultation process was undertaken to assess the status of each ENAP core indicator definition, data availability and measurement feasibility. Coverage indicators for the specific ENAP treatment interventions were assigned task teams and given priority as they were identified as requiring the most technical work. Consultations were held throughout.
   Results: ENAP published 10 core indicators plus 10 additional indicators. Three core impact indicators (neonatal mortality rate, maternal mortality ratio, stillbirth rate) are well defined, with future efforts needed to focus on improving data quantity and quality. Three core indicators on coverage of care for all mothers and newborns (intrapartum/skilled birth attendance, early postnatal care, essential newborn care) have defined contact points, but gaps exist in measuring content and quality of the interventions. Four core (antenatal corticosteroids, neonatal resuscitation, treatment of serious neonatal infections, kangaroo mother care) and one additional coverage indicator for newborns at risk or with complications (chlorhexidine cord cleansing) lack indicator definitions or data, especially for denominators (population in need). To address these gaps, feasible coverage indicator definitions are presented for validity testing. Measurable process indicators to help monitor health service readiness are also presented. A major measurement gap exists to monitor care of small and sick babies, yet signal functions could be tracked similarly to emergency obstetric care.
   Conclusions: The ENAP Measurement Improvement Roadmap (2015-2020) outlines tools to be developed (e.g., improved birth and death registration, audit, and minimum perinatal dataset) and actions to test, validate and institutionalise proposed coverage indicators. The roadmap presents a unique opportunity to strengthen routine health information systems, crosslinking these data with civil registration and vital statistics and population-based surveys. Real measurement change requires intentional transfer of leadership to countries with the greatest disease burden and will be achieved by working with centres of excellence and existing networks.

The pathological conditions that can involve the cavernous sinus can be categorized into infective, inflammatory, granulomatous, vascular and neoplastic causes. Imaging, especially with MRI, plays an important role not only in detection but also in definition of disease extent and in characterization of the pathology. Currently, high-resolution MR images clearly show various components of cavernous sinus which help in making a proper diagnosis and thus appropriate further management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Retinal pigment epithelial cells as well as choroidal melanocytes (CM) possess melanin granules. The former show clear, age-related changes (formation of lipofuscin granules with a concomitant decrease in melanin content); however, data on changes in the CM with aging are fairly limited. We examined CM in human macular and mid-peripheral areas by light- and transmission electron microscopy in 50-94 year-old donor eyes (N=12). Unlike in the choroid of lower ages, the melanocytes from aging choroid (>75 years) showed partial fusion of about 8-15 melanosomes, forming rosettes-like structures. Besides, there was evidence of emptiness in cytoplasm caused by the loss of melanosomes in aged CM, as was confirmed by quantification in macular part of choroid. In advanced aged eyes (85-94-year-old), the CM possessed many lipid droplets as well as irregular lipofuscin granules, the latter had a tendency to fuse with melanosomes, as happens in aged retinal pigment epithelium. Macrophages in their cytoplasm contained abundant irregular as well as clumped melanosomes of variable size, suggesting that damaged granules/melanocytes are cleared by these phagocytes. These obvious changes in the CM are likely to make the choroid prone to damage by visible light. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Topical emollient application reduces trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) in preterm neonates. Coconut oil used traditionally for infant massage in India has not been evaluated for the same.
   Patients and Methods: Very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates were randomized at 12 h of age to Oil (n = 37) or Control (n = 37) groups. Oil group neonates received twice-daily coconut oil application without massage, and Control group received standard care. TEWL was measured every 12 h using an evaporimeter till Day 7 when skin swabs were obtained for bacterial growth and skin condition was assessed using a validated score.
   Results: Birth weight (g; mean +/- SD: 1213 + 214 vs. 1164 + 208, p = 0.31), gestation [week; median (interquartile range): 32 (31-33) vs. 32 (29-33), p = 0.10] and other baseline variables were comparable. TEWL was significantly reduced (g/m(2)/h, mean difference: -6.80, 95% confidence interval: -3.48, -10.15; p < 0.01) with better skin condition and lower bacterial growth in the Oil group (20% vs. 60%, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Coconut oil application reduced TEWL without increasing skin colonization in VLBW neonates.

AB  - The Monte Carlo code SIMIND is used in nuclear medicine for research purposes, and also for testing the validity of various applications. Conversion of a SIMIND-generated interfile (header and image data file) is required to process the simulated image data on a Xeleris workstation. Currently there is no conversion program provided with SIMIND to convert its interfile, which is acceptable in any nuclear medicine workstation. Manual editing of the header file is possible with any standard text editor but it is time-consuming (requiring approximate to 1h) and stressful. To alleviate this, we have developed a conversion program using FreeMat V4.0 (an open source software similar to MATLAB from MathWorks). It takes an average of 0.04404s to convert a SIMIND SPECT data interfile and make it acceptable to Xeleris. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - IntroductionWe assessed the feasibility of blind orotracheal intubation in children using the Air-QILA as a conduit in supine position and the glottic view grading by fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) through it both in supine and lateral positions.
   Methods: After ethical approval and consent, 60 children were enrolled in the study. In the operating room, after attaching standard monitors to all children, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane ( 2- 8%) in oxygen ( 100%). Once the children became sedated, an i. v. access was established and injection glycopyrrolate ( 10 mu g center dot kg(-1)), fentanyl ( 2 mu g center dot kg-1), and atracurium ( 0.5 mg center dot kg-1) were administered. After 3 min, the Air- QILA was placed in supine position and glottic view was assessed by using FOB, in supine and right lateral decubitus position. In all children, gradings of glottic view in two different positions were noted. After that all children were turned supine, and orotracheal intubation was done blindly through the Air- QILA. The success rate, insertion time of the Air- QILA, and endotracheal intubation were noted.
   ResultsThe Air-QILA placement was successful in 57 children in first attempt and three children required second attempt. However, blind endotracheal intubations through the Air-QILA were successful in 38 children in first attempt and 12 children required second attempt. In the remaining 10 children, where blind endotracheal intubation through the Air-QILA remained unsuccessful, conventional laryngoscopy was performed. In supine and lateral positions, Grade 1 glottic view was seen in 41 and 38 of total 60 patients, respectively. Turning of all children from supine to lateral decubitus position resulted in the deterioration of grading of glottic view in eight children and improvement in two children (P = 0.001 ).
   ConclusionThe Air-QILA is an easy to place supraglottic airway device with excellent airway seal and low airway morbidity. It may be useful as a conduit for blind orotracheal intubation in supine position and can be used as an effective alternative to FOB in low resource settings.

AB  - Objective: To present the profile of patients undergoing surgical treatment for vertigo at a contemporary institutional vertigo clinic. Study design: A retrospective analysis of clinical charts.
   Methods: The charts of 1060 patients, referred to an institutional vertigo clinic from January 2003 to December 2012, were studied. The clinical profile and long-term outcomes of patients who underwent surgery were analysed.
   Results: Of 1060 patients, 12 (1.13 per cent) were managed surgically. Of these, disease-modifying surgical procedures included perilymphatic fistula repair (n = 7) and microvascular decompression of the vestibular nerve (n = 1). Labyrinth destructive procedures included transmastoid labyrinthectomy (n = 2) and labyrinthectomy with vestibular nerve section (n = 1). One patient with vestibular schwannoma underwent both a disease-modifying and destructive procedure (translabyrinthine excision). All patients achieved excellent vertigo control, classified as per the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery 1995 criteria.
   Conclusion: With the advent of intratympanic treatments, surgical treatments for vertigo have become further limited. However, surgery with directed intent, in select patients, can give excellent results.

AB  - To determine the effect of prosthesis need on nutritional status and oral health-related quality of life (OHrQoL) in elderly and to check the disparity between prosthesis need and prosthesis want in the Indian elderly.
   A total of 946 geriatric participants reporting to a geriatric medicine clinic were recruited in the study. Mini-nutritional assessment (MNA), geriatric oral health assessment (GOHAI) indices, prosthesis need according to WHO criteria, and prosthesis want was recorded along with age, gender, socioeconomic status and posterior occluding pair.
   Significant associations exist between prosthesis need and age (p = 0.005), MNA (p = 0.006) and GOHAI (p = 0.000). Prosthesis demand too was influenced by age (p = 0.004), posterior occluding pairs (p = 0.000), MNA (p = 0.012) and GOHAI (p = 0.000). GOHAI was negatively correlated with upper (r = -0.445) and lower prosthesis need (r = -0.460). Participants with some prosthesis need had significantly lower MNA and GOHAI scores as compared to those with no prosthesis need. Though prosthesis need was high (79.7 %), demand was low (39.3 %).
   Prosthesis need affects nutritional status and OHrQoL in elderly, and a wide gap exists between need and want of prosthesis.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to study anatomical, functional, and cosmetic outcomes of a novel technique, 'Lateral Eyelid Rotation Flap' for reconstruction of full thickness eyelid defect. In this prospective interventional study, 10 patients with full thickness eyelid defect measuring 1/2-2/3rd of eyelid width were included. Eyelid reconstruction was performed by single surgeon, using lateral eyelid rotation flap. Anatomic outcome was assessed by analyzing horizontal and vertical palpebral apertures (HPA and VPA), eyelid contour, and lateral canthus. Functional outcome was assessed by measuring tear film break-up time (TBUT) and Schirmer's test in both the eyes. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated by patients. Median age of patients was 56 years. Nine cases had full thickness defect following the excision of eyelid malignancy. The mean horizontal defect size was 17 +/- A 4.2 mm. HPA did not change significantly after surgery. VPA was statistically comparable to contralateral eye at 1-month follow-up. Lateral canthus angle recovered by 3rd month after surgery. TBUT and Schirmer's tests were comparable to contralateral eye. Eight patients graded cosmetic outcome as good to excellent. This is a new, single-stage technique for reconstruction of full thickness eyelid defects, with full thickness eyelid tissue including margin.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension in children is a rare disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis is not fully understood. Diagnostic evaluation focuses on ruling out other etiologies of pulmonary hypertension and prognosticating the disease. Congenital heart disease and left sided heart disease associated pulmonary hypertension are more common in children. Therapies for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension have evolved over the past decade. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil), endothelin antagonists (Bosentan and ambrisentan) and prostanoids are the classes of drugs shown to be useful in pulmonary hypertension. However, use of these drugs in children is based on extrapolation of adult usage and on expert consensus rather than based on randomized controlled trial evidence. Despite these advances, the outcomes of various forms of pulmonary hypertension remain poor, especially in India, where some forms of therapy are not available and children often are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease.

AB  - There is very little awareness of the general physicians and surgeons about the benign breast conditions such as duct ectasia (DE) and periductal mastitis (PDM) causing nipple discharge. Not only that these benign breast diseases ring a false alarm of cancer, they are also the second most common cause of benign breast diseases. The objective was to study the clinical and microbiological profiles of duct ectasia and periductal mastitis in Indian women for better understanding of the disease process, in order to be able to treat them well. Forty-one consecutive patients presenting to the Surgical Out-Patient Department with non-bloody nipple discharge with clinical and radiological features suggestive of DE or PDM were included. Microbial culture and cytopathological study of the nipple discharge were done. Histopathological studies and culture of the ductal tissue taken intraoperatively were carried out. There is no significant difference in the age distribution among women with DE and PDM. Smoking is not associated with DE and PDM of Indian patients in contrast to the Western literature evidence. Infective etiology was present in nearly 46 % of the patients in the study population more so in the periductal mastitis cases. The most common isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, unlike in Western population where nearly 50 % were anaerobes. Since the isolated organisms were resistant to the routinely used antibiotics in high proportion of cases, culture and sensitivity should be done in all possible cases for appropriately treating the subareolar sepsis before proceeding with the definitive treatment in the form of duct excision.

AB  - Background The burden estimation studies for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been based on varied case definitions, including case-definitions designed for influenza surveillance systems. We used all medical admissions among children aged 0-59 months to study the effect of case definitions on estimation of RSV-associated hospitalizations rates.
   Methods The hospital-based daily surveillance enrolled children aged 0-59 months admitted with acute medical conditions from July 2009-December 2012, from a well-defined rural population in Ballabgarh in northern India. All study participants were examined and nasal and throat swabs taken for testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RSV and influenza virus. Clinical data were used to retrospectively evaluate World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions (2011) commonly used for surveillance of respiratory pathogens, ie, acute respiratory illness (WHO-ARI), severe ARI (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI), for determination of RSV-associated hospitalization. RSV-associated hospitalization rates adjusted for admissions at non-study hospitals were calculated.
   Findings Out of 505 children enrolled, 82 (16.2%) tested positive for RSV. Annual incidence rates of RSV-associated hospitalization per 1000 children were highest among infants aged 0-5 months (15.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.3-26.8), followed by ages 6-23 months (5.3, 95% CI 3.2-8.7) and lowest among children 24-59 months (0.5, 95% CI 0.1-1.5). The RSV positive children were more likely to have signs of respiratory distress like wheeze, chest in-drawing, tachypnea, and crepitation compared to RSV-negative based on bivariate comparisons. Other less commonly seen signs of respiratory distress, ie, nasal flaring, grunting, accessory muscle usage were also significantly associated with being RSV positive. Compared to the estimated RSV hospitalization rate based on all medical hospitalizations, the WHO-ARI case definition captured 86% of the total incidence, while case definitions requiring fever like ILI and SARI underestimated the incidence by 50-80%.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that RSV is a substantial cause of hospitalization among children aged <24 months especially those aged <6 months. The WHO-ARI case definition appeared to be the most suitable screening definition for RSV surveillance because of its high sensitivity.

AB  - Introduction: Age associated progressive fibrosis may be a major causative factor that leads to pathogenesis of many diseases. Activated pancreatic stellate cells (alpha-SMA positive) play a major role in fibrogenesis that affects the cytoarchitecture and functioning of pancreas. This study dealt with age-related fibrotic changes in the ductular system of the tail and body of pancreas and the morphology of pancreatic stellate cells.
   Methods: Pancreata (n = 36) from cadavers aged 30-80 years were obtained after due clearances and processed for Masson's trichome staining. Fibrosis was quantified using Adobe Photoshop (CS2) and Image-J software. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done on the luminal area and total ductal area that were measured by the nucleator probe of StereoInvestigator software (MBF, Vermont, USA). Pancreatic stellate cells (alpha-SMA positive cells) were identified by immunohistochemistry and quantified stereologically around periacinar, periductular, perivascular, and peri-Islet areas.
   Results: An increased fibrosis was noted in body and tail regions of the pancreas with increasing age. Three duct populations were identified in clustering. Their area and corresponding lumen showed a significant increase with progressive decades (p < 0.001). alpha-SMA positive cells increased significantly from 4th to 7th decades (p = 0.002, 0.004 and 0.002, respectively).
   Discussion: Pancreatic stellate cells may be important contributors to increased fibrosis in pancreas. The classification of pancreatic ducts into three clusters may serve to be a useful tool.

AB  - Aim: To synthesise the evidence for effects of optimal breastfeeding on all-cause and infection-related mortality in infants and children aged 0-23months.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review to compare the effect of predominant, partial or nonbreastfeeding versus exclusive breastfeeding on mortality rates in the first sixmonths of life and effect of no versus any breastfeeding on mortality rates between 6 and 23months of age. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL and CABI.
   Results: The risk of all-cause mortality was higher in predominantly (RR 1.5), partially (RR 4.8) and nonbreastfed (RR14.4) infants compared to exclusively breastfed infants 0-5months of age. Children 6-11 and 12-23months of age who were not breastfed had 1.8- and 2.0-fold higher risk of mortality, respectively, when compared to those who were breastfed. Risk of infection-related mortality in 0-5months was higher in predominantly (RR 1.7), partially (RR 4.56) and nonbreastfed (RR 8.66) infants compared to exclusive breastfed infants. The risk was twofold higher in nonbreastfed children when compared to breastfed children aged 6-23months.
   Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of optimal breastfeeding practices during infancy and early childhood.

AB  - Introduction: Somatic mutations in Calreticulin (CALR) have been recently discovered in JAK2/MPL unmutated patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or essential thrombocythemia.
   Methods: Clinical and hematologic features were obtained for 80 patients with PMF. JAK2V617F mutation was analyzed by DNA tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR). CALR and MPL mutations were identified by bi-directional Sanger sequencing.
   Results: CALR mutations were detected in 11.2% (9/80) of all PMF patients and 25.7% (9/35) of all JAK2V617F and MPL unmutated patients all of which were Type I mutation or deletions. A novel CALR mutation pattern (c.1241_1288del) was identified in one (1/9) patient. No case of Type II mutations or scattered point mutations was found in any of these patients. Uni-variate analysis at presentation showed that CALR mutations were significantly associated with younger age (P = 0.003) and larger spleen size (P = 0.001). No significant correlation was found between CALR mutation and clinico-hematologic characteristics or international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) scoring of the PMF patients.
   Conclusion: CALR mutations have a distinct molecular profile in Indian patients, different from that of other studies worldwide. Larger prospective studies need to be designed to establish the impact of paucity of Type II mutations in contributing to disease phenotype and prognostic outcome of patients.

AB  - To evaluate the safety and efficacy of collagen cross-linking (CXL) in the treatment of keratoconus. A prospective randomized sham-controlled clinical trial was undertaken and 43 eyes with moderate to severe keratoconus were randomized into two groups that is the treatment (n = 23) and the sham (n = 20) group. CXL was performed with riboflavin (0.1 in 20 % dextran) followed by UVA radiation (365 nm, 3 mW/cm(2), 30 min). In the sham group, only riboflavin was administered without UVA radiation. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity, intraocular pressure, corneal thickness, keratometry, endothelial count, confocal microscopy were evaluated at baseline and at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months. In cases where CXL was done, UDVA improved by mean 0.11 +/- A 0.06 logMAR units at 6 months (P = 0.01). The refractive cylinder and spherical equivalent decreased by mean of 0.62 D (P = 0.01) and 0.5 D (P = 0.19), respectively. Ultrasonic central corneal thickness decreased by mean 22.7 +/- A 10.3 mu m (P = 0.01). The maximum and minimum keratometry decreased by mean of 1.2 +/- A 0.8 D (P = 0.01) and 0.83 +/- A 1.2 D (P = 0.39), respectively. The specular count and intraocular pressure did not show any significant change. In the sham group, no significant change was observed in any parameter. Confocal analysis showed that the epithelial healing was complete at 1 week after crosslinking. The sub-epithelial plexus showed loss of nerve plexus at 1 month, regeneration of nerve fibers which started at 3 months and was complete at 6 months. The anterior stroma showed loss of keratocytes with honeycomb oedema and apoptotic bodies till 3 months. The regeneration of keratocytes started at 3 months and was complete at 6 months of follow-up. Collagen cross-linking is an effective procedure to halt progression in keratoconus. The confocal microscopic changes correlate with the outcomes in the treatment and the sham groups.

AB  - Operating room services are one of the major cost and revenue-generating centres of a hospital. The cost associated with the provisioning of operating department services depends on the resources consumed and the unit costs of those resources. The objective of this study was to calculate the cost of operation theatre services at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi. The study was carried out at the operation theatre department of Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre (JPNATC), AIIMS from April 2010 to March 2011 after obtaining approval from concerned authorities. This study was observational and descriptive in nature. Traditional (average or gross) costing methodology was used to arrive at the cost for the provisioning of operation theatre (OT) services. Cost was calculated under two heads; as capital and operating cost. Annualised cost of capital assets was calculated according to the methodology prescribed by the World Health Organization and operating costs were taken on actual basis; thereafter, per day cost of OT services was obtained. The average number of surgeries performed in the trauma centre per day is 13. The annual cost of providing operating room services at JPNATC, New Delhi was calculated to be 197,298,704 Indian rupees (INR) (US$ 3,653,679), while the per hour cost was calculated to be INR 22,626.92 (US$ 419). Majority of the expenditures were for human resource (33.63 %) followed by OT capital cost (31.90 %), consumables (29.97 %), engineering maintenance cost (2.55 %), support services operating cost (1.22 %) and support services capital cost (0.73 %). Of the total cost towards the provisioning of OT services, 32.63 % was capital cost while 67.37% is operating cost. The results of this costing study will help in the future planning of resource allocation within the financial constraints (US$ 1=INR 54).

AB  - CdSe/CdS/ZnS and CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique and direct aqueous synthesis respectively using thiol stabilizers. Synthesized CdSe/CdS/ZnS and CdTe QDs stabilized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) were used as fluorescent labels after conjugation with folic acid (FA) and anti-HER2 antibodies. Photoluminescence quantum yield of folated CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA and CdTe-MSA QDs was 59% and 77% than that of non-folated hydrophilic QDs. The folate receptor-mediated delivery of folic acid-conjugated CdTe-MSA and CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA QDs showed higher cellular internalization as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopic studies. Folated and non-folated CdTe-MSA QDs were highly toxic and exhibited only 10% cell viability as compared to >80% cell viability with CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA QDs over the concentration ranging from 3.38 to 50 pmoles. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of human breast cancer tissue samples showed positive results with anti-HER2 antibody conjugated CdSe/CdS/ZnS-MPA QDs with better sensitivity and specificity as compared to conventional IHC analysis using diaminobenzedene staining.

AB  - Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a malignant neuroectodermal tumor. Hyams grading has an established role in its prognostication. The importance of microvessel density (MVD) and Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) is well studied in various tumors, but the same remains understated in END. The aims of the study were to estimate proliferation index and MVD in ENB and to correlate them with Hyams grade. Twenty-six ENB cases diagnosed over a period of 5 years were included. Hyams grade, MVD, and Ki-67 LI were evaluated for each of them. The cases were categorized as low (Hyams grades 1 and 2) and high (Hyams grades 3 and 4) grades. Microvessel density and Ki-67 LI were correlated with grade. The treatment response was analyzed in different grades. The commonest histologic grade was 4 (42%). The mean Ki-67 LI was 2%, 8.2%, 30.8%, and 40.5% and mean MVD was 81.67/mm(2), 37/mm(2), 24/mm(2), and 25.2/mm(2) in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A statistically significant correlation of grade with Ki-67 LI (P < .001) and MVD (P < .007) was noted. Hyams grade in ENB correlates well with treatment response. Ki-67 LI is an important prognostic factor in ENB. We propose a cutoff of 25% for Ki-67 LI to differentiate low- vs high-grade ENB, but larger studies are needed for validation. Contrary to epithelial tumors, there is a decrease in MVD with increasing grade in ENB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The amino-modified reporter DNA was covalently attached with the antidetection antibody through a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The detection limit of Ag85B by I-PCR was found to be 1 femtogram (fg)/mL, which was 10(6)-fold lower than an analogous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sensitivities of 85% and 77% with I-PCR and 77.6% and 62.5% with ELISA were observed in smear-positive and smear-negative PTB patients, respectively, with high specificity. On the other hand, sensitivities of 84% and 63.7% with I-PCR and 68% and 47.5% with ELISA were observed in confirmed and clinically suspected EPTB cases, respectively, with high specificity.

AB  - The optimum induction agent for anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been long debated. Ideal agent should be short acting with minimal suppression of seizure potentials. Recent studies have suggested longer seizure duration with etomidate in comparison to propofol, thiopental, and methohexital. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to pool data available from studies comparing systematically the efficacy of etomidate against other induction agents in terms of seizure duration (both electroencephalography (EEG) and motor). Methods We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane registry for trials evaluating etomidate against methohexital, propofol, or thiopental for duration of EEG or motor seizure in patients undergoing ECT. Specific adverse effects reported were also identified.
   Results Seventeen trials were identified involving 704, 84, 2491, and 258 setting of ECT using etomidate, methohexital, thiopental, and propofol, respectively. In the etomidate group, pooled EEG seizure duration was longer by 2.23 seconds (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.62 to 8.01; P = 0.456) than methohexital, longer by 17.65 seconds (95% CI, 9.72-25.57; P < 0.001) than propofol, and longer by 11.81 seconds (95% CI, 4.26-19.35; P = 0.003) than thiopental. Pooled motor seizure duration was longer in etomidate group by 1.45 seconds (95% CI, -4.79 to 7.69; P = 0.649) than methohexital, longer by 11.13 seconds (95% CI, 6.64-15.62; P < 0.001) than propofol, and longer by 3.60 seconds (95% CI, 2.15-5.06; P < 0.001) than thiopental. Myoclonus (6 trials) and painful injection (4 trials) were commonest adverse effects with etomidate.
   Conclusions Etomidate is clearly better in terms of seizure duration potential (both motor and EEG) than propofol and thiopental. Superiority/inferiority over methohexital could not be demonstrated with the presently available literature.

AB  - Host cell interactions and invasion by Cryptosporidium is a complex process mediated by zoites ligand-host cell receptors. Knowledge of proteins involved in this process will enable entry level inhibitors to be tried as therapeutic agents. In the present study, invasion proteins of Cryptosporidium parvum were studied in vitro. Cryptosporidium sporozoites membrane proteins were isolated and Cy5 dye labelled. They were then allowed to interact with the intact host cells. The interacting proteins were identified using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Sixty-one proteins were identified including twenty-seven previously reported invasion proteins. The newly identified proteins such as serine/threonine protein kinase, PI4 kinase, Hsp105 and coiled coil may have their roles in the parasitic invasion process. Thus, a new approach was used in the study to identify the probable proteins involved in invasion and/or host-parasite interactions. The advantage of this method is that it takes only a months' time instead of decades to identify these proteins involved in invasion process.

AB  - AimTo provide comprehensive evidence of the effect of interventions on early initiation, exclusive, continued and any breastfeeding rates when delivered in five settings: (i) Health systems and services (ii) Home and family environment (iii) Community environment (iv) Work environment (v) Policy environment or a combination of any of above.
   MethodsOf 23977 titles identified through a systematic literature search in PUBMED, Cochrane and CABI, 195 articles relevant to our objective, were included. We reported the pooled relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence intervals as our outcome estimate. In cases of high heterogeneity, we explored its causes by subgroup analysis and meta-regression and applied random effects model.
   ResultsIntervention delivery in combination of settings seemed to have higher improvements in breastfeeding rates. Greatest improvements in early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding and continued breastfeeding rates, were seen when counselling or education were provided concurrently in home and community, health systems and community, health systems and home settings, respectively. Baby friendly hospital support at health system was the most effective intervention to improve rates of any breastfeeding.
   ConclusionTo promote breastfeeding, interventions should be delivered in a combination of settings by involving health systems, home and family and the community environment concurrently.

AB  - The Abstracts presented at scientific meetings are important for making ongoing research more widely known and may also reflect the quality of the parent institution's standard of patient care. We analyzed the abstracts presented at the annual meetings of IASG for the past 5 years for (i) medium of presentation (oral/poster/videos), (ii) subjects discussed, (iii) institution of origin, (iv) whether a prospective/ retrospective study or a case report, (v) changing trends, and (vi) awards received. Of the 1340 abstracts analyzed, there were 18.5 % oral, 74.9 % posters, and 6.5 % videos presented from 205 in 2009 to 388 in 2012. The main organs discussed were the liver (19.3 %) pancreas (18.8 %), and biliary system (14.4 %). Sixty percent was from the private sector with Sir Ganga Ram, SGRH (95) and the Apollo Hospital, New Delhi (60), being the most prolific. From public institutes, the abstracts were predominantly from PGIMER, Chandigarh (39) and GB Pant Hospital (37). Thirty-three percent was from DNB and 25 % from M.Ch GI Surgery centres and 42 % was from others (most of these were as posters). There were 1016 (75.8 %) prospective/retrospective studies and 324 (24.2 %) case reports. Presentations, especially those related to liver transplantation, showed an increase. The main awards were won by SGRH (8); AIIMS, New Delhi (7); and JIPMER, Puducherry (6). Over the last 5 years, abstracts presented at the IASG have increased in number especially those dealing with the hepato-pancreatico-biliary system and liver transplantation. Most presentations were from "academic" departments, and similar analyses may inform us where we are heading and stimulate healthy competition.

AB  - Background
   Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant global public health risk. In tropical countries such as India where periodic dengue outbreaks can be correlated to the high prevalence of the mosquito vector, circulation of all four dengue viruses (DENVs) and the high population density, a drug for dengue is being increasingly recognized as an unmet public health need.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Using the knowledge of traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, we developed a systematic bioassay-guided screening approach to explore the indigenous herbal bio-resource to identify plants with pan-DENV inhibitory activity. Our results show that the alcoholic extract of Cissampelos pariera Linn (Cipa extract) was a potent inhibitor of all four DENVs in cell-based assays, assessed in terms of viral NS1 antigen secretion using ELISA, as well as viral replication, based on plaque assays. Virus yield reduction assays showed that Cipa extract could decrease viral titers by an order of magnitude. The extract conferred statistically significant protection against DENV infection using the AG129 mouse model. A preliminary evaluation of the clinical relevance of Cipa extract showed that it had no adverse effects on platelet counts and RBC viability. In addition to inherent antipyretic activity in Wistar rats, it possessed the ability to down-regulate the production of TNF-alpha, a cytokine implicated in severe dengue disease. Importantly, it showed no evidence of toxicity in Wistar rats, when administered at doses as high as 2g/Kg body weight for up to 1 week.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our findings above, taken in the context of the human safety of Cipa, based on its use in Indian traditional medicine, warrant further work to explore Cipa as a source for the development of an inexpensive herbal formulation for dengue therapy. This may be of practical relevance to a dengue-endemic resource-poor country such as India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the comparative efficacy of single deep breathing versus tidal breathing for inhaled asthma medications is limited, although such information can be of much use for the treatment of patients suffering from asthma. The objective of the present study was to compare the relative difference in improvement in peak expiratory flow (PEF) with single maximal inhalation with breath-holding versus 5 tidal breaths during inhalation of salbutamol from a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with valved holding chamber (VHC) in children 5-15 y of age with asthma. METHODS: The randomized controlled trial was carried out on children with asthma between 5 and 15 y of age using a pMDI with a VHC either by a single deep breath with breath-hold or 5 tidal breaths. The experimental group received 200 mu g of salbutamol from the pMDI with VHC with a single maximal inhalation and breath-hold technique, whereas the control group received 200 mu g of salbutamol from pMDI with VHC using the 5 tidal breaths technique. The outcome variable, PEF, was reassessed 30 min after salbutamol use. RESULTS: Eighty-two subjects (mean age 8.79 +/- 2.5 y, 65 boys and 17 girls) were analyzed. There was significant improvement in the PEF, from baseline (pre-intervention) to post-intervention within the single maximal inhalation with breath-hold group and tidal breathing group independently (P < .001). The mean difference in improvement in PEF between the single maximal inhalation with a breath-hold and 5 tidal breaths group was 30.0 +/- 18.16 and 28.29 +/- 13.94 L/min, respectively, and was not statistically significant (P = .88). CONCLUSIONS: Single maximal inhalation with a breath-hold technique is not superior to tidal breathing for improvement in PEF following salbutamol inhalation. Either method may be used in children between 5 and 15 y of age. (C) 2015 Daedalus Enterprises

AB  - Fibroadenoma is a common cause of breast lump in young girls. Nearly 10-15 % of lesions regress spontaneously over the period of 6 to 60 months. The aim of study was to investigate the role of Centchroman in regression of fibroadenoma in comparison to natural observation and to study the association of hormonal receptors with degree of regression. The study was carried out at the outpatient clinic of Department of Surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from November 2004 to November 2007. Patients aged <= 30 years with fibroadenoma were included. Patients with fibroadenoma equal to or larger than 5 cm and with polycystic ovarian disease were excluded. Patients were randomized in two groups. Patients in active therapy arm were prescribed Centchroman 30 mg daily for 12 weeks, and another group was observed without any intervention (control group). Patients were followed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 to assess response to therapy. Twenty-two (31.88 %) fibroadenomas in Centchroman arm disappeared completely as compared to four (7.69 %) in control arm over a period of 6 months. There was a decrease in the volume of fibroadenoma in ten (19.23 %) patients in control arm and 36 (52.17 %) patients in Centchroman arm. Centchroman therapy allowed 31 % fibroadenoma to regress completely with scanty menses or amenorrhea as the only side effect.

TI  - Femtosecond Laser-assisted Cataract Surgery Technique to Enhance Safety in Posterior Polar Cataract
T2  - JOURNAL OF REFRACTIVE SURGERY
KW  - PHACOEMULSIFICATION
KW  - EYES
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the technique of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery for management of posterior polar cataracts.
   METHODS: The technique was performed in 25 eyes of 20 patients with posterior polar cataract and nuclear sclerosis grades II to III. A hybrid pattern of three cylinders (2, 4, and 6 mm) and three chops (6 mm in length) was used for nucleotomy. Block by block emulsification of the pre-chopped nucleus was done from the center outward, with the remaining outer rings acting as a protective cushion. Manual hydrodissection and hydrodelineation were avoided.
   RESULTS: There were no cases with posterior capsular tear in this series and the phacoemulsification procedure could be completed uneventfully with implantation of intraocular lens in the bag in all of the eyes. The postoperative uncorrected Snellen visual acuity was 20/25 or greater in all cases.
   CONCLUSION: The technique of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with a hybrid pattern of cylinder and chop is safe and effective in managing cases of posterior polar cataract, specifically for higher grades of nuclear sclerosis.

AB  - Giant cell tumour of tendon sheath is a benign soft tissue tumour arising from the tendon sheath. The involvement of foot and ankle by such tumours is relatively rare. Children are not commonly afflicted by this condition. All such tumours are reported to arise either from a single tendon sheath or one joint. We report a case of giant cell tumour of tendon sheath in a 12-year-old child, arising simultaneously from the tendon sheaths of tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus tendons, as well as extending into the ankle joint. It was treated by complete excision of the mass along with the tendon sheaths with reconstruction of the flexor retinaculum. The location of the tumour, age of the patient, diffuse nature of the tumour and novel technique of reconstruction of the flexor retinaculum make this case extremely rare and the first to be reported in literature.

   Methods This was a retrospective cohort study in which we evaluated the records of 22 hip arthroscopies performed in known cases of tuberculosis of the hip joint in children less than 12 years of age. A note of the demographic and clinical parameters like age, duration of symptoms, stage of the disease, time period of follow-up, any complications during surgery, and pre- and post-operative modified Harris hip score (MHHS) was made in all cases. We compared the results with an age-matched cohort of 44 children with hip joint tuberculosis who were treated non-operatively with anti- tuberculosis therapy and traction in the same tertiary care institute.
   Results The arthroscopic findings in our series included synovitis, chondral erosions of the femoral head and/or acetabulum, pannus formation over the femoral head and/or acetabulum, and labral tears. The various arthroscopic procedures which were done included joint lavage, synovectomy, labral debridement and cheilectomy. The mean follow- up was 45 months, with the minimum being 36 months. There was a statistically significant change in the mean MHHS after hip arthroscopic procedures (p < 0.001); the difference in the mean post- and pre-operative MHHS was independent of age, stage or duration of follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the magnitude of improvement in MHHS after hip arthroscopy and that after conservative management.
   Conclusions Arthroscopy of the hip joint in children in cases of tuberculosis can serve as an emerging therapeutic modality. It is an effective and safe minimally invasive procedure, and helps in improving the functional outcome in early disease.

AB  - Background The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes, age-sex groups, and countries. The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development.
   Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time.
   Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6.2 years (95% UI 5.6-6.6), from 65.3 years (65.0-65.6) in 1990 to 71.5 years (71.0-71.9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5.4 years (4.9-5.8), from 56.9 years (54.5-59.1) to 62.3 years (59.7-64.8), total DALYs fell by 3.6% (0.3-7.4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26.7% (24.6-29.1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries.
   Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition-in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden-is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions.

AB  - Objective
   In this study, we have attempted comparison of detailed body composition phenotype of Asian Indians with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) vs. those without, in a case controlled manner. We also aim to analyse prediction equations for NAFLD for non-diabetic Asian Indians, and compare performance of these with published prediction equations researched from other populations.
   Methods
   In this case-control study, 162 cases and 173 age-and sex-matched controls were recruited. Clinical, anthropometric, metabolic, and body composition profiles, and liver ultrasound were done. Fasting insulin levels, value of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and serum high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were evaluated. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were used to arrive at prediction equations for fatty liver [Indian fatty liver index (IFLI)].
   Results
   As compared to those without fatty liver, those with fatty liver exhibited the following; Excess dorsocervical fat ('Buffalo hump'), skin tags, xanthelasma, 'double chin', arcus; excess total, abdominal and subcutaneous adiposity, and high blood pressure, blood glucose, measures of insulin resistance (fasting insulin and HOMA-IR values), lipids and hs-CRP levels. Two prediction equations were developed; Clinical [Indian Fatty Liver Index-Clinical; IFLIC]: 1(double chin) + 15.5 (systolic blood pressure) + 13.8 (buffalo hump); and IFLI-Clinical and Biochemical (CB): serum triglycerides+ 12 (insulin)+ 1(systolic blood pressure) + 18 (buffalo hump). On ROC Curve analysis, IFLI performed better than all published prediction equations, except one.
   Conclusion
   Non-diabetic Asian Indians with NAFLD researched by us were overweight/obese, had excess abdominal and subcutaneous fat, multiple other phenotypic markers, had higher insulin resistance, glycemia, dyslipidemia and subclinical inflammation than those without. Prediction score developed by us for NAFLD; IFLI-C and IFLI-CB, should be useful for clinicians and researchers.

AB  - Quaternary composite scaffold consisting of chitosan, alginate, gelatin, and silk fibroin, was fabricated by applying foaming method, for tissue engineering applications. The fabricated scaffold was evaluated for its applicability in skin tissue regeneration. The environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) showed the presence of interconnected pores, mostly spread over the entire surface of the scaffold with mean pore size 92 +/- 11.8 m and the porosity 88%. The scaffold showed good mechanical stability under physiological conditions as determined by short term mechanical stability testing. In vitro scaffold-degradation study showed no degradation at day 1 and from day 3 scaffold starts degrading. The degradation of the composite scaffold after 28 days was 38%. Less degradation rate of the scaffold might be beneficial, as it can provide sufficient time for the formation of neo-tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) during tissue regeneration. In vitro cell culture studies by seeding L929 mouse fibroblast cells over composite scaffold showed good cell viability, proliferation, and adhesion as indicated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay and ESEM of cell-scaffold construct. Giemsa staining of L929 fibroblast cells over the scaffold showed fibroblastic morphology of L929 cells, having elongated cells with nuclei and faint cytoplasm, and these cells are positive for Oil Red stain and negative for Alizarin Red stainingindicating that they maintained their dermal fibroblastic phenotype and were not differentiated into any other cell types in presence of composite scaffold. Results of histological staining supports growth and viability of L929 fibroblasts over scaffold, thereby proving the great prospective of this scaffold for skin tissue engineering applications.

AB  - Facilities for measuring methotrexate (MTX) levels are not available everywhere, potentially limiting administration of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX). We hypothesized that serum creatinine alteration after HDMTX administration predicts MTX clearance. Overall, 122 cycles in 50 patients of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged <= 18 years receiving HDMTX were enrolled prospectively. Plasma MTX levels were measured at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours; serum creatinine was measured at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Correlation of plasma MTX levels with creatinine levels and changes in creatinine from baseline (Delta creatinine) were evaluated. Plasma MTX levels at 72 hours showed positive correlation with serum creatinine at 48 hours (P = .011) and 72 hours (P = .013) as also Delta creatinine at 48 hours (P = .042) and 72 hours (P = .045). However, cut-off value of either creatinine or Delta creatinine could not be established to reliably predict delayed MTX clearance. Greater than 50% Delta creatinine at 48 and 72 hours significantly predicted grade 3/4 leucopenia (P = .036 and P = .001, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (P = .012 and P = .009, respectively) but not mucositis (P = .827 and P = .910, respectively). Delayed MTX elimination did not predict any grade 3/4 toxicity. In spite of demonstration of significant correlation between serum creatinine and creatinine with plasma MTX levels at 72 hours, cut-off value of either variable to predict MTX delay could not be established. Thus, either of these cannot be used as a surrogate for plasma MTX estimation. Interestingly, creatinine effectively predicted hematological toxicities, which were not predicted by delayed MTX clearance.

AB  - Airway evaluation and its management remains an ever emerging clinical science. Present airway management tools are static and do not provide dynamic airway management option. Visualized procedures like ultrasound (US) provide point of care real time dynamic views of the airway in perioperative, emergency and critical care settings. US can provide dynamic anatomical assessment which is not possible by clinical examination alone. US aids in detecting gastric contents and the nature of gastric contents (clear fluid, thick turbid or solid) as well. US can help in predicting endotracheal tube size by measuring subglottic diameter and diameter of left main stem bronchus. US was found to be a sensitive in detecting rotational malposition of LMA in children. Also, US is the fastest and highly sensitive tool to rule out a suspected intraoperative pneumothorax. In intensive care units, US helps torule out causes of inadequate ventilation, determine the tracheal width and distance from the skin to predict tracheotomy tube size and shape and assist with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. US can help in confirming the correct tracheal tube placement by dynamic visualisation of the endotracheal tube insertion, widening of vocal cords (children), and bilateral lung-sliding and diaphragmatic movement. Thus, ultrasonography has brought a paradigm shift in the practise of airway management. With increasing awareness, portability, accessibility and further sophistication in technology, it is likely to find a place in routine airway management.

AB  - Background and Aim
   Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease, considered as an important disease of gastrointestinal tract having a huge impact on the health of the patient. Prolonged inflammation of colon in UC patients increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. MiRNA are reported as a connecting link between inflammation and cancer. Differential miRNA expression is reported in Crohn's disease (CD) patients involving various regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The current study was performed to dissect out the site specific miRNA expression in the colon biopsy samples of UC patients from Northern India.
   Methods
   Biopsy samples were collected from UC patients and healthy controls from Rectosigmoid Area (RS) and Ascending Colon (AC). MiRNA expression was compared between patients with RS and AC using a microarray platform. Differential expression was further validated by Real Time PCR analysis. Demographic and pathological data of UC -associated CRC patients was collected from the hospital database and analyzed for assessing the site of cancer.
   Results
   Upon analysis of data generated on a microarray platform and qRT PCR revealed that the expression of six miRNAs hsa-miR-146b-5p, hsa-miR-335-3p, hsa-miR-342-3p, hsa-miR-644b-3p, hsa-miR-491-3p, hsa-miR-4732-3p were downregulated in patients where RS was involved as compared to AC. The expression of hsa-miR-141-3p was upregulated in patients where RS region was involved as compared to AC. Analysis of the registered UC patient's database from the hospital revealed that the site of CRC was predomimnantly the rectosigmoid region of the colon in most of the cases.
   Conclusion
   This is the first study to show the differential expression of miRNA involving different sites of colon in UC patients. Taking our data and previous reports into consideration, we propose that differential miRNA expression during UC perhaps contribute in the development of UC-associated CRC at the rectosigmoid area.

AB  - Acute tissue damage is accompanied by synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) in the inflamed tissue as well as in the spinal cord. NO release at the spinal level is likely involved in the neuroplastic changes contributing to pain. Also, previous studies indicate that this could be due to the inducible isoform of the nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzyme. Though, the role of NO has been investigated in several animal models of nociception, the precise contribution of NO to nociception arising from hind paw incision is unknown, which is a rodent model of postoperative pain. In the present work, we have estimated the formation of NO in Sprague-Dawley rats, both at the site of incision and the corresponding spinal cord levels by Griess assay. Subsequently, naive rats were implanted with chronic indwelling intrathecal (i.t.) catheters. Fixed quantity (30 mu g) of 1400 W, an iNOS inhibitor, was either administered locally into the wound at the time of incision or into the i.t. space, 15 min before hind paw incision. In a different set, i.t. 1400 W was administered, 20 h after incision. Control group received i.t saline. Nociception was evaluated by guarding score, mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. NO level was significantly increased between 4 h - day 1 locally and at 4 h at the spinal level after incision. Local inhibition of iNOS produced transient decrease of guarding (4-12 h) whereas pronounced decrease of guarding and allodynia was evident after spinal inhibition of iNOS. Also, spinal NO level decreased after i.t drug administration. Post-incision drug treatment resulted in greater antinociceptive effect at day 1 though not on day 2. These results indicate involvement of NO in postincisional nociception in rats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs) are highly malignant tumors that remain incurable and relatively understudied. The crucial role of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) has been reported in various cancers. However, the study on miRNAs in pediatric HGGs is scant and there is no report till date on the status of other small ncRNAs. Genome-wide microarray analysis was performed to investigate small ncRNA expression in pediatric HGG (n=14) and compared to adult glioblastoma (GBM) signature. The validation of miRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction. TP53 and H3F3A mutation-specific miRNA and snoRNA profiles were generated and analyzed. Pediatric HGGs showed upregulation of miR-17/92 and its paralog clusters (miR106b/25 and miR106a/363), whereas majority of downregulated miRNAs belonged to miR379/656 cluster (14q32). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified two distinct groups. Interestingly, Group 2 with downregulated 14q32 cluster showed better overall survival. The miRNAs unique to pediatric HGG as compared to adult GBM were predicted to affect PDGFR and SMAD2/3 pathways. Similarities were seen between pediatric HGG and TP53 mutant miRNA profiles as compared to wild types. Several of H3F3A mutation-regulated genes were found to be the targets of H3F3A mutant-specific miRNAs. Remarkably, a significant downregulation of HBII-52 snoRNA cluster was found in pediatric HGGs, and was specific to H3F3A nonmutants. This is the first genome-wide profiling study on miRNAs and snoRNAs in pediatric HGGs with respect to H3F3A and TP53 mutations. The comparison of miRNA profiles of pediatric HGGs and adult GBM reiterates the overlaps and differences as also seen with their gene expression and methylation signatures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extant data from in vivo animal models and postmortem studies indicate that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is associated with reduction of the brain antioxidant glutathione (GSH), yet direct clinical evidence has been lacking. In this study, we investigated GSH modulation in the brain with AD and assessed the diagnostic potential of GSH estimation in hippocampi (HP) and frontal cortices (FC) as a biomarker for AD and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   METHODS: Brain GSH levels were measured in HP of 21 AD, 22 MCI, and 21 healthy old controls (HC) and FC of 19 AD, 19 MCI, and 28 HC with in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The association between GSH levels and clinical measures of AD progression was tested. Linear regression models were used to determine the best combination of GSH estimation in these brain regions for discrimination between AD, MCI, and HC.
   RESULTS: AD-dependent reduction of GSH was observed in both HP and FC (p < .001). Furthermore, GSH reduction in these regions correlated with decline in cognitive functions. Receiver operator characteristics analyses evidenced that hippocampal GSH robustly discriminates between MCI and healthy controls with 87.5% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 8.76/.13, whereas cortical GSH differentiates MCI and AD with 91.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 9.17/.08.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides compelling in vivo evidence that estimation of GSH levels in specific brain regions with magnetic resonance spectroscopy constitutes a clinically relevant biomarker for MCI and AD.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the major health concern in Indian population. Despite of advanced treatment the mortality rate for this disease has not been improved very much. Current research focused on development of protein marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC. The case control study was performed with 125 HNSCC patients and 104 control cases. The level of p50 and I kappa B alpha proteins in serum were evaluated at pre and post therapy by label free real time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and western blot analysis. The serum p50 concentration were significantly (P < 0.0001) higher at the time of diagnosis i.e. pre therapy (Mean +/- SD = 27.06 +/- 4.88 ng/mu l) as compared to controls (Mean +/- SD = 16.96 +/- 4.04 ng/mu l) while it decline at post therapy (Mean +/- SD = 21.01 +/- 4.98 ng/mu l). Similarly, the concentration of licBcz protein in serum were slightly higher at pre therapy (Mean +/- SD = 8.33 +/- 1.85 ng/mu l) as compared to controls (Mean +/- SD = 7.27 +/- 1.84 ng/mu l) and declined at post therapy (Mean +/- SD = 7.09 +/- 1.24 ng/mu l). The level of p50 was also high at the early stage of the disease. The specificity and sensitivity of p50 proteins obtained from ROC analysis revealed the potentiality to be diagnostic protein marker for HNSCC for its accuracy in the study cohort.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori are among the most successful human pathogens that harbour a distinct genomic segment called cag Pathogenicity Island (cag-PAI). This genomic segment codes for a type IV secretion system (Cag-T4SS) related to the prototypical VirB/D4 system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Ag), a plant pathogen. Some of the components of Cag-T4SS share homology to that of VirB proteins including putative energy providing CagE (HP0544), the largest VirB4 homologue. In Ag, VirB4 is required for the assembly of the system, substrate translocation and pilus formation, however, very little is known about CagE. Here we have characterised the protein biochemically, genetically, and microscopically and report that CagE is an inner membrane associated active NTPase and has multiple interacting partners including the inner membrane proteins CagV and Cag beta. Through CagV it is connected to the outer membrane sub-complex proteins. Stability of CagE is not dependent on several of the cag-PAI proteins tested. However, localisation and stability of the pilus associated CagI, CagL and surface associated CagH are affected in its absence. Stability of the inner membrane associated energetic component Cag beta, a VirD4 homologue seems to be partially affected in its absence. Additionally, CagA failed to cross the membrane barriers in its absence and no IL-8 induction is observed under infection condition. These results thus suggest the importance of CagE in Cag-T4SS functions. In future it may help in deciphering the mechanism of substrate translocation by the system.

AB  - Introduction: The susceptibility to adverse outcome from critical injury (occurrence of sepsis, septic shock, organ dysfunction/failure, and mortality) varies dramatically due to different degrees of inflammatory response. We assessed the relationship of the genotype distribution of various cytokine gene polymorphisms (CGP) with regard to the development of sepsis, organ dysfunction or mortality in severely injured patients.
   Method: Observational, hospital-based cohort study of 114 severely injured North Indian patients from New Delhi admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of Trauma Centre, AIIMS. Patients were monitored from day first to discharge or death, measuring SOFA score, sepsis and septic shock occurrences up to one month. We have analyzed 13 cytokine genes, including the SNPs of structural and regulatory regions at 22 positions.
   Results: Sequence-specific primer based PCR indicated that eight polymorphic loci IL-1 alpha/-889, IL-1 beta/-511, IL-1R (pstI 1970), TGF-beta/code 10, TNF-alpha/-308, TNF-alpha/-238, IL-6/+565 and IL-10/-1082, out of 22 SNPs are significantly associated with sepsis morbidity and outcome. Theses SNPs might be used as risk determinants of the outcome. Patients with IL-10 (-1082A/A) genotypes were found significantly higher in post traumatic sepsis patients and had a significantly higher risk to developed sepsis complication (p < 0.05, OR = 0.86, C.I = 0.08-8.8). In case of TNF-alpha (-308) position, GA and GG genotype patients have a significantly lower risk of poor outcome (p < 0.05, OR = 0.25, C.I = 0.01-1.3) and (p < 0.05, OR = 0.22, C.I = 0.01-0.5) in comparison to AA genotype. In this study, two polymorphisms (IL-1 beta (-511) and IL-1R) were significantly associated with the development of MOF and mortality, where as IL-1 alpha (-889) polymorphism associated with susceptibility for sepsis. The distribution of haplotypes of TGF-beta and IL-6 were also associated with sepsis susceptibility and outcome.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, we have found that the alternations in the genotype and allele frequency of IL-1 beta (-511C/T), TNF-alpha (-308 G/A), TNF-alpha (-238 G/A) and IL-10 (-1082 G/A) genes are associated with an higher risk of sepsis development in trauma patients and outcomes.

AB  - Purine repeat sequences present in the human genome are known to act as hotspots for mutations leading to chromosomal imbalances. It is established that large purine repeats (PRs) form stable DNA triplex structure which can inhibit gene expression. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the autosomal neurodegenerative disorder is the only human disease known so far, where a large purine (GM) repeat in the FXN gene is known to inhibit the expression of frataxin protein. We explored the hidden purine repeats (PRn with n >= 200) if any, in the human genome to find out how they are associated with neurological disorders. The results showed 28 PRs, which are mostly restricted to the intronic regions. Interestingly, the transcriptome expression analysis of PR-carrying genes (PR-genes) revealed that most of them are down-regulated in neurological disorders (autism, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, mental retardation, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor) as compared to that in healthy controls. The altered gene expression in brain disorders can be interpreted in terms of a possible expansion of purine repeats leading to formation of very stable DNA-triplex and/or alleviation of the repair enzymes and/or other unknown cellular factors. Interactome analysis identified four PR-genes in signaling pathways whose dysregulation is correlated directly with pathogenesis: GRK5 and KLK6 in Alzheimer's disease; FGF14 in craniosynostosis, mental retardation and FLT1 in neuroferritinopathy. By virtue of being mutational hotspots and their ability to form DNA-triplex, purine repeats in genome disturb the genome integrity and interfere with the transcriptional regulation. However, validation of the disease linkage of PR-genes can be validated using knock-out techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Human placental villous cytotrophoblasts exhibit relative externalization of negatively charged moieties to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during the time of syncytialization rendering their reactivity to positively charged cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) during the window of implantation and early placentation. Vaginal administration of a synthetic CAMP, Ala(8,13,18)-magainin II amide (AMA) inhibited blastocyst implantation and early placentation in monkeys. Furthermore, the administration of AMA resulted in significant inhibition of cell differentiation, enhancement in apoptosis and loss of viability in first trimester placental villous cytotrophoblasts in primary culture. The present study examines the effect of in vitro application of different doses (0, 1, 10, 100, 1000 ng/ml) of AMA on the secreted cytokine profiles of cytotrophoblasts obtained from placental villi samples (n = 13) collected during 8-9 weeks of gestation and grown on three-dimensional collagen matrix in vitro.
   Methods: A panel of forty-eight (48) cytokines in conditioned medium was analysed using multiplex immunoassays technique. Further, the steady state transcript levels of four cytokines (CCL4, CCL5, IL1B, IL6), the concentrations of which were affected by AMA in the isolated cytotrophoblasts, as well as, two cytokines (IL1A and TNF) which were not affected by AMA were estimated. Input list of cytokines secreted by cytotrophoblasts and showing differential secretion in response to AMA were used in enrichment analysis for the generation of biological networks.
   Results: Placental cytotrophoblasts secreted 27 cytokines, 13 of which are affected by AMA in vitro with significantly decreased secretion of CCLs-2, 3, 4, 5, CXCLs-1 and 8, FGF2 and MCSF and that of IL1B, IL6 and MIF, and increased secretion of IL16 and IL-2RA. Of the above cytokines showing differential secretion, only IL-2RA, IL16 and MIF showed significant correspondence in the steady state expression of their respective transcript levels. Post-hoc Enrichment analysis revealed Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated pathways were the top-scored target pathways that were affected by AMA.
   Conclusions: Administration of a CAMP causes shift in the balance of immune-inflammatory responses involving downstream pathways of TLRs in cytotrophoblast function. Further verification of functions of placental trophoblasts on administration of CAMP with pregnancy outcome is necessary.

AB  - Cerebellar liponeurocytoma is a rare tumor of the central nervous system which shows neuronal and variable astrocytic differentiation, along with foci of lipomatous differentiation. It is usually located in the cerebellum, and may be mistaken for medulloblastoma with lipidized cells or lipomatous ependymoma. Histopathological examination, supplemented by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, is required to distinguish between these entities. This 35-year-old male presented with vomiting and headache for three months, followed by gait imbalance. Neurological examination showed positive cerebellar signs with ataxic gait. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion measuring 4.4cmx4.3cmx3.9cm involving the cerebellum. The patient underwent midline suboccipital craniotomy to excise the tumor. Histopathological examination showed a circumscribed, cellular tumor composed of round to polygonal cells with moderate cytoplasm and minimal pleomorphism. Clear intracytoplasmic vacuoles were seen within the tumor cells. These tumor cells were immunopositive for synaptophysin, NSE, and MAP-2, confirming their neurocytic origin. On ultrastructural examination, lipid vacuoles as well as dense-core neurosecretory granules were identified within these neurocytic cells, confirming the diagnosis of liponeurocytoma. No cilia, microvilli, or gap junctions were identified in the tumor cells, ruling out the possibility of lipomatous ependymoma. The differentiation of liponeurocytoma from its morphological mimics is imperative, as their treatment differs drastically. The role of electron microscopy is extremely important in this differential diagnosis.

AB  - Aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, in combination with 5 HT-3 antagonist and dexamethasone is recommended in adults receiving moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy to reduce chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV). Data for use of aprepitant in children is limited and hence aprepitant is not recommended by Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario guidelines for prevention of CIV in children < 12 years.
   A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a single center in chemotherapy na < ve children (5-18 years) receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. All patients received intravenous ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) prior to chemotherapy followed by oral ondansetron and dexamethasone. Patients randomly assigned to aprepitant arm received oral aprepitant (15-40 kg = days 1-3, 80 mg; 41-65 kg = day 1, 125 mg and days 2-3, 80 mg) 1 h before chemotherapy. Control group received placebo as add-on therapy. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of acute moderate to severe vomiting, which was defined as more than two vomiting episodes within 24 h after the administration of the first chemotherapy dose until 24 h after the last chemotherapy dose in the block. Complete response (CR) was defined as absence of vomiting and retching during the specified phase.
   Of the 96 randomized patients, three were excluded from analysis; 93 patients were analyzed (50 in aprepitant arm and 43 in placebo arm). Acute moderate and severe vomiting was reported in 72 % patients receiving placebo and 38 % patients receiving aprepitant (p = 0.001). Complete response rates during acute phase were significantly higher in aprepitant arm (48 vs. 12 %, p < 0.001). No major adverse effects were reported by patients/guardians.
   This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows that aprepitant significantly decreases the incidence of CIV during acute phase when used as an add-on drug with ondansetron and dexamethasone in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

AB  - Altered excitatory synaptic transmission is one of the primary causes of seizure generation in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). The present study is designed to delineate the contribution of glutamatergic tone under resting conditions to the hyper excitability in patients with MTLE. Resected hippocampal tissues were obtained from patients with MTLE. In these samples spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), sensitive to NMDA receptor antagonist APV (50 mu M) and AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (10 mu M) were recorded from pyramidal neurons at 70 mV. We observed that frequency of EPSCs were 28.2% higher in slices obtained from patients with MTLE compared to that in case of non-epileptic controls. We also examined spontaneous fast current transients (CTs) recorded from these pyramidal neurons under cell-attached configuration. The frequency of CTs increased in the absence of extracellular Mg2+ in brain slice preparations and was completely blocked by APV. We found that the frequency of CTs in pyramidal neurons were higher in case of MTLE samples compared to non-epileptic controls. This study suggests that enhanced endogenous activity of NMDA receptor contributes to excitability in pyramidal neurons of slice preparations obtained from patients with MTLE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia show an excellent response to treatment with imatinib. However, in some patients, the disease is resistant to imatinib. This resistance may be related to the presence of genetic variations on the drug's pharmacokinetics and metabolism. We therefore studied three polymorphisms (C1236T, G2677T and C3435T) in the human multidrug-resistance gene (MDR1) in 86 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with imatinib. Imatinib resistance was more frequent in patients with TT genotype at locus 1236 than in those with CT/CC genotypes (p = 0.003). For the other two loci (G2677T and C3435T), resistance was seen to be higher for TT genotype when compared to GG/GT and CT/CC but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.13 and p = 0.099). In conclusion, determination of C1236T MDR1 genotype may help to predict response to imatinib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia.

AB  - Complement system is a major effecter system of the innate immunity that bridges with adaptive immunity The system consists of about 40 humoral and cell surface proteins that include zymogens, receptors and regulators. The zymogens get activated in a cascade fashion by antigen-antibody complex, antigen alone or by polymannans, respectively, by the classical, alternative and mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathways. The ongoing research on complement regulators and complement receptors suggest key role of these proteins in the initiation, regulation and effecter mechanisms of the innate and adaptive immunity. Although, the complement system provides the first line of defence against the invading pathogens, its aberrant uncontrolled activation causes extensive self tissue injury. A large number of humoral and cell surface complement regulatory protein keep the system well-regulated in healthy individuals. Complement profiling had brought important information on the pathophysiology of several infectious and chronic inflammatory disorders. In view of the diversity of the clinical disorders involving abnormal complement activity or regulation, which include both acute and chronic diseases that affect a wide range of organs, diverse yet specifically tailored therapeutic approaches may be needed to shift complement back into balance. This brief review discusses on the complement system, its functions and its importance as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases with focus on SLE and RA.

AB  - Aim: To estimate the prevalence of, and assess factors associated with, diabetes and prediabetes in three South Asian cities.
   Methods: Using a multi-stage cluster random sample representative of each city, 16,288 subjects aged >= 20 years (Chennai: 6906, Delhi: 5365 and Karachi: 4017) were recruited to the Centre for cArdio-metabolic Risk Reduction in South-Asia (CARRS) Study. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured in 13720 subjects. Prediabetes was defined as FPG 100-125 mg/dl (5.6-6.9 mmol/l) and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol) and diabetes as self-report and/or drug treatment for diabetes and/or FPG >= 126 mg/dl (>= 7.0 mmol/l) and/or HbA1c >= 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). We assessed factors associated with diabetes and prediabetes using polytomous logistic regression models.
   Results: Overall 47.3-73.1% of the population had either diabetes or prediabetes: Chennai 60.7% [95% CI: 59.0-62.4%] (diabetes -22.8% [21.5-24.1%], prediabetes -37.9% [36.1-39.7%]); Delhi 72.7% [70.6-74.9%] (diabetes -25.2% [23.6-26.8%], prediabetes -47.6% [45.6-49.5%]); and Karachi 47.4% [45.7-49.1%]; (diabetes -16.3% [15.2-17.3%], prediabetes -31.1% [29.5-32.8%], respectively). Proportions of self-reported diabetes were 55.1%, 39.0%, and 48.0% in Chennai, Delhi, and Karachi, respectively. City, age, family history of diabetes, generalized obesity, abdominal obesity, body fat, high cholesterol, high triglyceride, and low HDL cholesterol levels were each independently associated with prediabetes, while the same factors plus waist-to-height ratio and hypertension were associated with diabetes.
   Conclusion: Six in ten adults in large South Asian cities have either diabetes or prediabetes. These data call for urgent action to prevent diabetes in South Asia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale and background: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most frequently used palliative therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is a safe and effective procedure with few major and minor complications. Rarely, biliary complications are also encountered following TACE. The goal of our study was to investigate the incidence and the presentation of biliary complications following TACE in patients with HCC.
   Material and methods: In this retrospective study, data of patients with HCC who underwent TACE between June 2002 to December 2014 were obtained from the records. Their detailed information about the procedure of TACE, diagnosis of biliary complications and subsequent management details were reviewed.
   Result: One hundred and sixty-eight patients with HCC underwent 305 procedures of TACE. Of these, biliary complications of various severities developed in 6 (3.6%) patients leading to an incidence of 1.9% (6/305). Minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation (IHBD) occurred in three, biliary stricture in one and intrahepatic biloma in two patients. Supportive management was undertaken for IHBD patients while percutaneous aspiration and naso-biliary drainage was performed for the infected bilomas.
   Conclusion: Biliary complications following TACE are infrequent. Diagnosis should be suspected clinically and confirmed with imaging. Treatment depends on the severity. Enforcing specific measures can minimize its frequency. (C) 2015 Editions francaises de radiologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: We performed a survey amongst attendees of the 4th Annual Meeting of Indian Brachytherapy Society to study the patterns of brachytherapy practice and attitude towards brachytherapy use.
   Material and methods: A 19-point questionnaire was designed and e-mailed to the attendees immediately after the conference. Descriptive analysis of the responses were done and satisfaction index was used as a tool for evaluation of the program effectiveness. Binomial test was used to assess the difference between distributions of responses and Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the correlation between responses. P value (2-tailed) of < 0.05 was taken significant for all statistical analysis.
   Results: Of a total of 202 attendees, 90 responded to the survey (response rate: 4-4.5%). Seventy-two percent belonged to an academic institute while 28% belonged to non-academic institutes. Eighty-six percent were radiation oncologists and 10% were medical physicists. Eighty-nine percent respondents used high-dose-rate, 14% - pulse-dose-rate, and 13% used low-dose-rate brachytherapy facility. Orthogonal X-rays, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging was used for brachytherapy planning by 56%, 69%, and 14%, respectively. Ninety-three percent of them thought that lack of training is a hurdle in practicing brachytherapy and 92% opined that brachytherapy dedicated meetings can change their perception about brachytherapy. Seventy percent respondents admitted to make some changes in their practice patterns after attending this meeting. Ninety-seven percent of them would like to attend future meetings and 98% felt the need to include live workshops, hands on demonstrations, and video presentations in the scientific programme.
   Conclusions: The survey highlights a positive attitude towards increasing brachytherapy use, and may serve as an important guiding tool in designing teaching and training programmes; thus overcoming the hurdles in successful and widespread use of a quality brachytherapy programme at radiotherapy centers.

AB  - Background/Aims: Airway difficulties leading to cardiac arrest are frequently encountered during propofol sedation in patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. With a noticeable increase in the use of propofol for endoscopic sedation, we decided to examine the incidence and outcome of cardiac arrests in patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with sedation. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, cardiac arrest data obtained from the clinical quality improvement and local registry over 5 years was analyzed. The information of patients who sustained cardiac arrest attributable to sedation was studied in detail. Analysis included comparison of cardiac arrests due to all causes until discharge (or death) versus the cardiac arrests and death occurring during the procedure and in the recovery area. Results: The incidence of cardiac arrest and death (all causes, until discharge) was 6.07 and 4.28 per 10,000 in patients sedated with propofol, compared with non-propofol-based sedation (0.67 and 0.44). The incidence of cardiac arrest during and immediately after the procedure (recovery area) for all endoscopies was 3.92 per 10,000; of which, 72% were airway management related. About 90.0% of all peri-procedural cardiac arrests occurred in patients who received propofol. Conclusions: The incidence of cardiac arrest and death is about 10 times higher in patients receiving propofol-based sedation compared with those receiving midazolam-fentanyl sedation. More than two thirds of these events occur during EGD and ERCP.

AB  - Cardamom is a popular spice that has been commonly used in cuisines for flavor since ancient times. It has copious health benefits such as improving digestion, stimulating metabolism, and exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The current study investigated the effect of cardamom on hemodynamic, biochemical, histopathological and ultrastructural changes in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction. Wistar male albino rats were randomly divided and treated with extract of cardamom (100 and 200 mg/kg per oral) or normal saline for 30 days with concomitant administration of ISO (85 mg/kg, subcutaneous) on 29th and 30th days, at 24 h interval. ISO injections to rats caused cardiac dysfunction evidenced by declined arterial pressure indices, heart rate, contractility and relaxation along with increased preload. ISO also caused a significant decrease in endogenous antioxidants, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, depletion of cardiomyocytes enzymes, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and increase in lipid peroxidation. All these changes in cardiac and left ventricular function as well as endogenous antioxidants, lipid peroxidation and myocyte enzymes were ameliorated when the rats were pretreated with cardamom. Additionally, the protective effects were strengthened by improved histopathology and ultrastructural changes, which specifies the salvage of cardiomyocytes from the deleterious effects of ISO. The present study findings demonstrate that cardamom significantly protects the myocardium and exerts cardioprotective effects by free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities.

AB  - Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is now an established component for 3D evaluation and treatment planning of patients with severe malocclusion and craniofacial deformities. Precision landmark plotting on 3D images for cephalometric analysis requires considerable effort and time, notwithstanding the experience of landmark plotting, which raises a need to automate the process of 3D landmark plotting. Therefore, knowledge-based algorithm for automatic detection of landmarks on 3D CBCT images has been developed and tested.
   A knowledge-based algorithm was developed in the MATLAB programming environment to detect 20 cephalometric landmarks. For the automatic detection, landmarks that are physically adjacent to each other were clustered into groups and were extracted through a volume of interest (VOI). Relevant contours were detected in the VOI and landmarks were detected using corresponding mathematical entities. The standard data for validation were generated using manual marking carried out by three orthodontists on a dataset of 30 CBCT images as a reference.
   Inter-observer ICC for manual landmark identification was found to be excellent (0.9) amongst three observers. Euclidean distances between the coordinates of manual identification and automatic detection through the proposed algorithm of each landmark were calculated. The overall mean error for the proposed method was 2.01 mm with a standard deviation of 1.23 mm for all the 20 landmarks. The overall landmark detection accuracy was recorded at 64.67, 82.67 and 90.33 % within 2-, 3- and 4-mm error range of manual marking, respectively.
   The proposed knowledge-based algorithm for automatic detection of landmarks on 3D images was able to achieve relatively accurate results than the currently available algorithm.

AB  - Cyanosis is always pathological and demands detailed evaluation. Combined use of clinical findings, electrocardiogram and chest radiograph permits determination of underlying cause in vast majority. Stepwise approach allows hemodynamic classification of the cardiac lesion and directs immediate management. Accurate anatomic diagnosis of the cardiac malformation is seldom essential for preliminary management and therefore, emphasis must be on clinical classification rather than on obtaining echocardiographic diagnosis.

AB  - Aim To determine the prevalence, risk factors and the severity of visual loss caused by steroid-induced glaucoma (SIG) among children.
   Methods Five-year records of all paediatric glaucoma cases presenting to the glaucoma services of our tertiary care centre were evaluated. Data of children presenting with SIG were recorded with respect to their visual acuity, highest baseline intraocular pressure, cup: disc ratio, perimetry and need of glaucoma filtering surgery. Parents were interviewed to assess the indication of steroid use, type of steroid used, person prescribing it and the duration of use. The prevalence of visual impairment was calculated based on WHO criteria.
   Results Of 1259 cases of paediatric glaucoma presenting at our centre over 5 years, 59 children (4.7%) were diagnosed with SIG. Of these, 51 (87%) had been prescribed topical steroids for vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). The median duration of steroid use was 18 months (range 1 month to 8 years). Also, 82% of children with VKC had been prescribed steroids by the treating ophthalmologist and 52% had been on topical steroids for >1 year. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy was the cause of blindness in 37.3% (22/59) and low vision in 23.7% (14/59) children. And 27% (16/59) were unilaterally blind at presentation.
   Conclusions A third of the children presenting with SIG to our tertiary care centre were bilaterally blind at presentation. Ophthalmologists need to consider steroid-sparing agents to treat VKC and monitor these children closely for glaucoma if they prescribe topical steroids in order to prevent unnecessary childhood blindness.

AB  - Anthropologically, the majority of Indian population structure could be discerned in terms of different endogamous population groups (who marry between the clans), but unfortunately we still remain unaware about the epidemiological burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among different endogamous groups in India. We assessed the effect of family history on the risk of T2D among the Aggarwal (endogamous caste group) population of Delhi, a hospital-based case-control association study among the target population group of Delhi. Sixty percent of the cases reported familial history of type 2 diabetes. We found that the family history of T2D among Aggarwals significantly increases the odds of disease to 2.3 (confidence interval; 1.5041 to 3.5077). Cultural hallmarks, e.g., sedentary lifestyle, high socioeconomic status, and fat-enriched vegetarian dietary habits (86 %; pure-vegetarian) were noted in the present population. These factors correlated with age, waist to hip ratio, and blood pressure, which were important indicators for T2D in our study. The family history is a pertinent risk factor of T2D in this population group and can robustly predict the risk of T2D in their family and kinship. We suggest that the familial history of diabetes can be used as a potential public health tool for conducting population and culture-based epidemiological surveys that are required for better understanding of susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane proteins which maintain cellular water and ion homeostasis. Alterations in AQP expression have been reported in rod-dominated rodent retinas exposed to light. In rodents and also in birds, light of moderate intensities (700-2000 lux) damages the retina, though detailed changes were not examined in birds. The aim of our study was to see if light affects cone dominated retinas, which would be reflected in expression levels of AQPs. We examined AQP1 and AQP4 expressions in chick retina exposed to 2000 lux under 12 h light:12 h dark (12L:12D; normal photoperiod), 18L:6D (prolonged photoperiod) and 24L:0D (constant light). Additionally, morphological changes, apoptosis (by TUNEL) and levels of glutamate and GFAP (a marker of injury) in the retina were examined to correlate these with AQP expressions. Constant light caused damage in outer and inner nuclear layer (ONL, INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL). Also, there were associated increases in GFAP and glutamate levels in retinal extracts. In normal photoperiod, AQP1 was expressed in GCL, outer part of INL and photoreceptor inner segments of. AQP4 was additionally expressed in nerve fiber layer. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting revealed over all decreased AQP1 and AQP4 expression in constant light condition compared to those in other two groups. The elevated GFAP and glutamate levels might be involved in the reduction of AQPs in constant light group. Such decreases in AQP expressions are perhaps linked with retinal cell damage seen in constant light condition, while their relatively enhanced expression in two other conditions may help in maintaining a normal retinal architecture, indicating their neuroprotective potential.

AB  - The heterogeneity of diabetes mellitus, and the various metabolic abnormalities associated with it, are well known. Current management guidelines used to help choose glucose-lowering drugs in diabetes mellitus describe various drug classes in detail, but do not take the overall metabolic profile into consideration. To help physicians choose appropriate oral therapy, we propose a discrete metabolic score, based upon the presence and absence of metabolic comorbidities included in the definition of metabolic syndrome. This communication describes how to choose an appropriate oral antidiabetic drug using such a score. The metabolic score based decision making aid should be able to prove its utility in all health care settings, especially resource constrained societies.

AB  - The size and arrangement of stromal collagen fibrils (CFs) influence the optical properties of the cornea and hence its function. The spatial arrangement of the collagen is still questionable in relation to the diameter of collagen fibril. In the present study, we introduce a new parameter, edge-fibrillar distance (EFD) to measure how two collagen fibrils are spaced with respect to their closest edges and their spatial distribution through normalized standard deviation of EFD (NSDEFD) accessed through the application of two commercially available multipurpose solutions (MPS): ReNu and Hippia. The corneal buttons were soaked separately in ReNu and Hippia MPS for five hours, fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde containing cuprolinic blue and processed for transmission electron microscopy. The electron micrographs were processed using ImageJ user-coded plugin. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the image processed equivalent diameter (ED), inter-fibrillar distance (IFD), and EFD of the CFs of treated versus normal corneas. The ReNu-soaked cornea resulted in partly degenerated epithelium with loose hemidesmosomes and Bowman's collagen. In contrast, the epithelium of the cornea soaked in Hippia was degenerated or lost but showed closely packed Bowman's collagen. Soaking the corneas in both MPS caused a statistically significant decrease in the anterior collagen fibril, ED and a significant change in IFD, and EFD than those of the untreated corneas (p < 0.05, for all comparisons). The introduction of EFD measurement in the study directly provided a sense of gap between periphery of the collagen bundles, their spatial distribution; and in combination with ED, they showed how the corneal collagen bundles are spaced in relation to their diameters. The spatial distribution parameter NSDEFD indicated that ReNu treated cornea fibrils were uniformly distributed spatially, followed by normal and Hippia. The EFD measurement with relatively lower standard deviation and NSDEFD, a characteristic of uniform CFs distribution, can be an additional parameter used in evaluating collagen organization and accessing the effects of various treatments on corneal health and transparency.

AB  - Background & objectives: This study was aimed to report the occurrence of ocular graft versus host disease (oGVHD) in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients in a tertiary care hospital setting.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of ocular surface of allo-HSCT patients was done. Slit lamp biomicroscopy, symptom score, tear meniscus height, fluorescein tear break-up time, Schirmer's test I, ocular surface staining, dry eye severity, ocular surface disease index score were done. Indications for allo-HSCT, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, GVHD risk factor, systemic manifestation and treatment were also noted.
   Results: GVHD occurred in 44.4 per cent of 54 allo-HSCT patients (mean age 26.7 +/- 12 yr) included in the study. GVHD risk factors identified included female gender, relapse, older age of donor, cytomagelo virus (CMV) reactivation, and multiparous female donors. oGVHD was noted in 31.5 per cent with mean time to occurrence being 17.8 +/- 21.9 months after the allo-HSCT and was observed in 89.5 per cent of chronic GVHD cases. Acute GVHD (oral and dermatological) involvement showed a significant association with GVHD in our patients (P<0.001, 0R 23.0, CI 6.4-82.1). Chronic GVHD was observed to be associated with the occurrence of oGVHD (dry eye) (P<0.001, OR = 24.0, CI 0.02-0.29). Of the 34 eyes with oGHVD, dry eye of level 3 severity was seen in 16, level 2 in six, level 1 in 12 eyes.
   Interpretation & conclusions: GVHD occurred in 44.4 per cent of the patients studied in the present study. Acute and chronic GVHD showed a strong association with oGVHD. Dry eye disease due to chronic oGVHD was observed in 17 (31.5%) of 54 allo-HSCT patient with chronic oGVHD occurring in 17 (89.4%) of chronic GVHD cases in allo-HSCT patients. Our study on oGVHD in post allo-HSCT patients in tertiary care centre points towards the fact that ocular morbidity due to dry eye disease as a result of oGVHD is a cause for concern in these patients.

AB  - Oral, breast, and cervical cancers are amenable to early detection and account for a third of India's cancer burden. We convened a symposium of diverse stakeholders to identify gaps in evidence, policy, and advocacy for the primary and secondary prevention of these cancers and recommendations to accelerate these efforts.
   Indian and global experts from government, academia, private sector (health care, media), donor organizations, and civil society (including cancer survivors and patient advocates) presented and discussed challenges and solutions related to strategic communication and implementation of prevention, early detection, and treatment linkages.
   Innovative approaches to implementing and scaling up primary and secondary prevention were discussed using examples from India and elsewhere in the world. Participants also reflected on existing global guidelines and national cancer prevention policies and experiences.
   Symposium participants proposed implementation-focused research, advocacy, and policy/program priorities to strengthen primary and secondary prevention efforts in India to address the burden of oral, breast, and cervical cancers and improve survival.

AB  - Silica nanoparticles have drawn a lot of attention for nanomedicine application, and this is attributed to their biocompatibility and ease of surface functionalization. However, successful utilization of these inorganic systems for biomedical application depends on their physicochemical properties. This study, therefore, discusses in vitro toxicity of organically modified silica nanoparticles on the basis of size, shape, and surface properties of silica nanoparticles. Spherical- and oval-shaped nanoparticles having hydroxyl and amine groups were synthesized in Tween 80 micelles using different organosilanes. Nanoparticles of similar size and morphology were considered for comparative assessment. As-prepared nanoparticles were characterized in terms of size, shape, and surface properties using ZetaSizer, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared to establish the above parameters. In vitro analysis in terms of nanoparticle-based toxicity was performed on J-774 (macrophage) cell line using propidium iodide-4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. Fluorescent dye-entrapped nanoparticles were used to visualize the uptake of the nanoparticles by macrophage cells. Results from cell studies suggested low levels of toxicity for different nanoparticle formulations studied, therefore are suitable for nanocarrier application for poorly soluble molecules. On the contrary, the nanoparticles of similar size and shape, having amine groups and low net negative charge, do not exhibit any in vitro cytotoxicity.

AB  - Introduction: Patients suffering from bilateral knee osteoarthritis often require bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to alleviate symptoms. There is controversy surrounding the approach to the surgical treatment of such patients. We asked if Asian patients undergoing staged-bilateral TKA had any difference in their short-term functional outcomes, comparing the first TICA to the second one and if the interval between the 2 surgeries had any impact of functional outcomes. Materials and Methods: We identified 100 patients from a single surgeon from 2006 to 2010 who had staged-bilateral TKA and had at least 2 years of follow-up for each TKA. The time interval between the first and second TKA ranged from 6 months to 1 year. Range of motion, Oxford knee questionnaire scores, knee scores and function scores at 6 months and 2 years of follow-up were then compared between the first and second TKA using the Student's T-test. Results: Although length of stay was reduced and time to ambulation was shorter for the second TKA, there were no significant differences in functional outcomes at 2 years. There was also no difference in outcome when patients were stratified according to time interval between TKAs. Conclusion: Staged-bilateral TKA continues to be a good option for patients presenting with severe bilateral knee osteoarthritis. The second arthroplasty has similar functional outcomes as the first arthroplasty. Our results can be used in preoperative counselling of patients undergoing staged-bilateral TKA.

T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - SOMATOFORM DISORDERS
KW  - ABUSE
AB  - Somatization disorder is a common cause of chronic non-cancer pain. The use of opioids in such conditions carries a risk of their potential abuse. Lax regulations coupled with sub-optimal medical training-in India-lead to the rampant use of prescription opioids. We present a case of somatization disorder along with injection pentazocine dependence in a woman, in whom use of pentazocine was initiated by a registered medical practitioner for somatoform pain management, followed by self-injection because of its easy availability in local pharmacy shops. We highlight the need for education of medical practitioners on appropriate use of pharmaceutical opioids, need for regulation of local pharmacy shops, and development of guidelines for use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the indications, feasibility, safety, and. effectiveness of N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBA) with Modified injection technique in embolization of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (PSAs).
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective evaluation was performed of 31 patients (26 men, 5 women; mean age, 32.6 y) with visceral artery PSAs that were treated with embolization using NBCA with modified sequential injection and flushing technique. The most common indication for using NBA was preservation of a major feeding artery (11 = 18), followed by difficult catheterization secondary to arterial tortuosity (n = 5), failed previous coil embolization (n = 4), and short landing zone for coils (n 4). NBCA alone was used in 25 patients, and NBCA with coils was used in 6 patients. The patients were followed clinically until discharge and 1 and 3 months after discharge.
   Results: The mean amount of NBCA-ethiodized oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet LLC, Villepinte, France) mixture injected was 0.24 mL (range, 0.1-1.1 mL). Embolization with NBCA was technically successful in all (100%) patients. Recurrence was seen in 3 (9.7%; 2 splenic artery; 1 left gastric artery) patients after a mean time of 16.3 days (range, 10-27 d) of initial embolization resulting in clinical success of 90.3%. All 3 patients underwent successful repeat embolization with secondary technical success rate of 100%. Minor (pain) and major (nontarget embolization in 2; microcatheter adhesion and fracture in 1) complications were seen in 3 patients each.
   Conclusions: NBCA is a safe and effective embolization agent when injected with modified technique in treatment of visceral artery PSAs.

AB  - Background: Data on blood pressure recorded by oscillometric method is limited.
   Objective: To develop simplified tables and charts of blood pressure recorded by oscillometric method in children.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Ballabhgarh, Haryana.
   Participants: Healthy school-children.
   Main outcome measures: Blood pressure measured by oscillometric method.
   Results: The study group included 7,761 children (58.4% males) with mean (SD) age of 10.5 (2.8) years. Age and gender were used to create simplified percentile tables and charts, as height was seen to explain very little variability of either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Formulae for SBP and DBP thresholds for hypertension were derived as [110 + 1.6 x age] and [79 + 0.7 x age], respectively, with 1 mm Hg to be added for females. 95th percentile values suggest simple levels indicating hypertension to be 120/80, 125/85 and 135/90 at ages of 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively.
   Conclusions: Simplified reference tables and charts, formulae for SBP and DBP, and simple convenient thresholds may be useful for rapid screening of hypertension using oscillometric method.

AB  - BackgroundStudies of baseline prognostic factors in patients with localized osteosarcoma treated without high dose methotrexate are limited.
   MethodsThis is single-institutional review of localized osteosarcoma patients treated without high dose methotrexate between June 2003-December 2012. A multivariate analysis of impact of baseline and treatment characteristics on outcome was performed and a prognostic model was developed based solely on baseline factors for predicting event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).
   ResultsOf 237 patients with median age of 17 years (range 2-66 yrs), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was administered in 220 (92.82%) patients. Post NACT, 200/237 (84.38%) patients underwent surgery. At 30 months median follow-up, 5-year EFS and OS were 36.600.03%, and 50.33 +/- 0.04%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, baseline factors including duration of symptom >4 months (P<0.001) and good performance status (PS) (P<0.001) predicted better EFS whereas good PS (P=0.01) and normal serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) (P=0.03) predicted better OS. The 5-year EFS without any risk factor (symptom duration <4 months, PS>1) was 58.7 +/- 0.1%, with either one factor 31.5 +/- 0.1% and with both factors 21.9 +/- 0.1%. The 5-year OS without any risk factor (PS>1, elevated SAP) was 66.9 +/- 0.1%, with either one factor 57.9 +/- 0.1% and with both factors 25.6 +/- 0.1%

AB  - Background: Factors influencing publication of manuscripts in reputed journals have never been studied to the best of our knowledge. This study was conducted to evaluate the trend in publication within the Indian Journal of Orthopaedics (IJO).
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by accessing the online database of the IJO. All the issues available online were included. Published articles were classified into one of the following thirteen categories: (i) Basic Sciences (ii) trauma (upper limb and lower limb) (iii) infections (iv) pediatric orthopedics (v) arthroplasty (vi) arthroscopy (vii) spine surgery (viii) musculoskeletal oncology (ix) hand and microvascular surgery (x) adult reconstruction (including the Ilizarov technique) (xi) general orthopedics and miscellaneous (xii) letter to editor (xiii) book review. A scatter diagram was plotted to study the individual trends.
   Results: A total of 2213 articles from 110 issues published between 1967 and 2014 were studied. Total number of articles per issue have increased over the years. Publications in the fields of trauma, adult reconstruction, arthroscopy and hand and microvascular surgery have increased steadily. Arthroplasty and spine surgery have recorded dramatic increase in publication. On the other hand, publications in the rest of the fields have declined of which the greatest fall is noted in the field of musculoskeletal oncology.
   Conclusions: Trend in publication with the IJO has changed over years with more articles being published in arthroplasty and Spine surgery. Despite advances, publication in the field of musculoskeletal oncology has fallen.

AB  - Lesions of the heart valves are the commonest acquired cardiac abnormalities seen in pediatric age group. In India, the underlying cause for most valvular diseases is chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The aim of evaluation of patients with valvular heart disease is not only to make a diagnosis, but also to decide the management plan. The pediatrician or physician is usually the first health care provider to whom such patients (or their parents) report. It is therefore imperative that the general physician and pediatricians are well versed with valvular heart diseases. Valvular abnormalities produce characteristic murmurs and a bedside diagnosis is possible in majority. However, further investigations such as X ray of the chest and an ECG are useful tools to refine the diagnosis. Echocardiography is now widely available to most of the patients in India and is very useful for assessing the severity of valve lesion and to identify the underlying etiology. Serial echocardiography is instrumental in deciding the timing of intervention. Mitral valve is most commonly affected followed by aortic; in some patients both valves may be affected. The valve may not close properly, resulting in regurgitation of blood flow in reverse direction or does not open fully (stenosis). In mitral regurgitation (MR), the blood flows in the reverse direction. MR can occur secondary to several causes, but in India, the commonest cause is RHD. Patient may remain asymptpmatic for a long period of time. Symptoms include fatigue, palpitations and later exertional breathlessness. MR typically produces a pansystolic murmur at apex, which may radiate to left axilla. Surgical intervention is reserved for all symptomatic patients with severe MR. Valve repair is preferred over prosthetic valve replacement. Mitral stenosis (MS) is almost always due to RHD. Severe MS results in pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure and tricuspid regurgitation. Patients are often symptomatic with dyspnea. Hemoptysis may occur. A typical rumbling mid diastolic murmur is the hallmark of MS. Balloon mitral valvotomy, performed in the catheterization lab, is recommended for severe MS.

KW  - Tricuspid valve
KW  - Valve surgery
AB  - Lesions of the heart valves are the commonest acquired cardiac abnormalities seen in pediatric age group. Aortic regurgitation (AR) results from abnormality of the valve leaflets or of the aortic root. Mitral valve lesion may be associated in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Left ventricle dilates and may develop dysfunction in advanced states. Coronary perfusion also tends to suffer in severe AR. The symptoms develop later and include dyspnea and palpitations. An early diastolic, high pitched murmur, best heard at base of the heart is the hallmark of AR. All symptomatic patients with severe AR and those with left ventricular dysfunction should undergo surgical intervention. Aortic stenosis (AS) is often due to congenitally bicuspid or unicuspid valve. RHD rarely results in AS; associated AR is common in such cases. The most common cause of tricuspid valve involvement is secondary to dilatation of right ventricle and tricuspid annulus resulting in tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Rarely RHD affects the tricuspid valve directly; resulting in stenosis with TR. Involvement of both mitral and aortic valves is almost pathognomonic of RHD etiology. Severity of individual lesions may be difficult to ascertain as proximal valve lesion tends to modify the assessment of the distal valve lesion. It is important to understand that all valvular lesions do not require surgery. Regular secondary prophylaxis with long acting penicillin (for patients with RHD) may retard further progression of valve lesion and must be emphasized to the family. For mild and asymptomatic moderate valvular lesions, periodic monitoring with clinical examination and echocardiography is sufficient. No guidelines are available for timing of intervention in such children; data may have to be extrapolated from published guidelines for adult patients. Various types of surgical options are available for regurgitant valves, but none is ideal. The pediatricians are required to have knowledge of valvular diseases so as to refer the patient at an appropriate time for intervention or further evaluation. His/her role is also crucial in follow up of post operated patients, especially those on oral anticoagulation.

AB  - Deficiency of the 5 alpha-reductase 2 enzyme impairs the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and differentiation of external genitalia, seminal vesicles and prostate in males. The present study describes the phenotype, genotype and gender identity in a large cohort of patients with 5 alpha RD2. All patients underwent detailed clinical evaluation, hormonal profile, karyotyping and molecular analysis of the SRD5A2 gene. The molecular analysis of the SRD5A2 gene showed the presence of mutant alleles in 24 patients. We found 6 novel mutations IVS(1-2) T>C, p.A52T, 188-189insTA, 904-905ins A, p.A12T and p.E57X in our patients. All patients had ambiguous genitalia and the degrees of under-virilization ranged from penoscrotal hypospadias and microphallus to clitoromegaly. The position of gonads was variable in patients with same mutation. All the patients with mutations in the SRD5A2 gene had male gender identity. Those reared as female had gender dysphoria and underwent gender reassignment. Though a specific genotype-phenotype correlation could not be established in our patient but confirming the diagnosis of 5 alpha RD2 with assessment of the SRD5A2 gene may help in appropriate gender assignment.

AB  - Introduction: Surgical clipping is the most definite treatment for intracranial aneurysms. Its aim is to achieve complete aneurysmal occlusion without compromising the lumen of a parent vessel or perforators, and with minimal brain tissue trauma.
   Objective: To evaluate the role of endoscopic controlled keyhole approach in clipping of anterior circulation aneurysms.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, all consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic controlled clipping via the keyhole approach by the senior author during the last 1 year were included. The cases in which a microscope was used at any stage of surgery were excluded.
   Results: Fourteen patients with anterior circulation aneurysms underwent clipping via the endoscopic keyhole approach (supraorbital and mini-pterional). Seven patients had anterior communicating (ACom) artery aneurysms, four had middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysms, two had internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysms, and one had a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Ten patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hunt and Hess grade I in 6 and grade II in 4 patients), whereas the remaining four were incidentally detected. The pre-clipping dissection as well as the clipping were successfully performed endoscopically in all patients. The post-clipping inspection revealed inclusion of a perforator within the clip blades in 2 patients (ACom and MCA bifurcation) that required clip readjustment. There was no residual neck/incompletely clipped aneurysm detected on post-clipping inspection. There was no morbidity directly attributable to the use of keyhole approach or the endoscope.
   Conclusion: Endoscopic keyhole approach for intracranial aneurysms combines the advantages of both keyhole approach and endoscopy. Endoscopic visualization can help to reduce chances of an incompletely clipped aneurysms/residual neck and the risk of parent vessel/perforator occlusion. However, the use of an endoscope in narrow corridors with space constraints has a learning curve that can be overcome by practicing on cadavers and initially performing several simple endoscopic procedures.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate aetiology, demographic profile, clinical features and outcomes in cases of peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK).
   Methods Seventy-six eyes of 65 consecutive patients with PUK were evaluated in this prospective interventional study over an 18 month period, which were followed for 3 years. The main outcome measures were sociodemographic profile, aetiology, clinical features, management strategies and outcome.
   Results Sixty per cent (39/65) of cases were men and mean age was 45.5 +/- 17.9 years. Two-thirds (43/65) of the patients were from rural areas with majority (48/65) belonging to low socioeconomic status. Unilateral disease was present in 83% of patients (54/65) with nasal involvement in 60.5% (46/76) cases. The most common aetiology was Mooren's ulcer (31.5% cases (24/76 eyes)) followed by infection and systemic collagen vascular disease. Meibomian gland dysfunction (17/76: 22.3%) was the most common extraocular association and complicated cataract (12/76: 15.7%) was the most common intraocular abnormality. In mild and moderate cases, no significant visual improvement was observed (p=0.085 and p=0.156) as compared with the pretreatment status. Surgical treatment was successful in maintaining anatomical integrity in 83.3% (30/36) eyes. Recurrence of the disease was seen in one eye in moderate disease and three eyes in severe disease.
   Conclusions Mooren's ulcer followed by collagen vascular diseases and infection are important causes of PUK in developing countries. Surgical intervention in perforated cases had good anatomical success and visual prognosis.

AB  - Background & objectives: Limited data are available on malignancies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients from India. We undertook this study to assess the frequency and spectrum of malignancies in HIV-infected adult patients during the first eight years of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) rollout under the National ART Programme at a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of records of patients registered at the ART clinic between May 2005 and December 2013 was done.
   Results: The study included 2598 HIV-infected adult patients with 8315 person-years of follow up. Malignancies were diagnosed in 26 patients with a rate of 3.1 (IQR 2.1-4.5) cases per 1000 person-years. The median age for those diagnosed with malignancy was 45 (IQR 36-54) yr, which was significantly (P<0.01) higher compared with those not developing malignancies 35 (IQR 30-40) yr. The median baseline CD4+ T-cell count in patients with malignancy was 135 (IQR 68-269) cells/mu l compared to 164 (IQR 86-243) cells/mu l in those without malignancies. AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) were seen in 19 (73%) patients, while non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) were observed in seven (27%) patients. Malignancies diagnosed included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (16), carcinoma cervix (3), Hodgkin's lymphoma (2), carcinoma lung (2), hepatocellular carcinoma (1), and urinary bladder carcinoma (1). One patient had primary central nervous system lymphoma. There was no case of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Malignancies in HIV-infected adult patients were infrequent in patients attending the clinic. Majority of the patients presented with advanced immunosuppression and the ADCs, NHL in particular, were the commonest malignancies.

AB  - Objective: The loss of function mutations (biallelic) in frataxin (FXN) has primarily been implicated in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. The protein product of FXN is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein required for the biogenesis of iron- clusters (Fe-S). FRDA is characterized by neurological and non-neurological features which show variable expression in affected individuals. An inverse relationship has been demonstrated between GAA repeat size and age at onset and explains 50% variability of the age at onset. MtDNA variations and haplogroups could be one of the contributory factors to explain the remaining heterogeneity in FRDA, since mitochondrial oxidative stress is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of FRDA.
   Methods: In our study, targeted resequencing of the D-loop and coding region of mitochondrial genes (ND1-6 and ATP) was conducted in 30 genetically confirmed FRDA patients and 62 ethnicity-matched unrelated healthy controls to identify the functionally important mtDNA variations and to trace the mitochondrial lineage of Indian FRDA patients. Cumulative mitochondrial SNP scores were computed for the identified variations in the functional region and haplogroups were determined by Haplogrep.
   Results: A significantly higher load of overall mitochondrial variations (with a trend toward the coding region) per individual was noted among FRDA cases rather than controls (p-value < 0.03). A non-synonymous variation (p. L237M) in ND2 was over-represented among FRDA cases (p-value 0.04). This variation has a reported association with longevity and myocardial infarction. We also observed over-representation of H haplogroup (Caucasian mitochondrial haplogroup) among FRDA patients. We have not observed the influence of mitochondrial variations and haplogroup upon age at onset of FRDA.
   Conclusions: Overall, our study identifies the functionally important variations and mitochondrial lineage of Indian FRDA cases and, that underscores the importance of studying the role of mitochondrial genome variations in FRDA.

AB  - Objective: To compare the predictive value of manual two-dimensional follicular monitoring with that of sonography-based automated volume calculation (SonoAVC) in routine follicular tracking in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Methods: A prospective study was undertaken of women undergoing IVF with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation at a center in New Delhi, India, between October and November 2013. Follicular monitoring was performed both manually and in three dimensions with SonoAVC. On the day of oocyte retrieval, the follicular count and dimensions were calculated with both techniques and correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved. Results: Overall, 46 patients and 91 ovaries were studied. The mean times taken to perform manual and SonoAVC measurements were 209.2 +/- 47.4 s and 156.6 +/- 38.6 s, respectively (P <0.001). The mean follicular count was significantly lower when measured manually than with SonoAVC (8.46 +/- 3.35 vs 9.91 +/- 4.60; P = 0.016). However, the mean leading follicle diameter measured manually (19.45 +/- 2.46 mm) was similar to both the mean diameter (21.12 +/- 2.65 mm) and the volume-based diameter (19.56 +/- 2.16 mm) measured with SonoAVC. Conclusion: Three-dimensional SonoAVC could be a useful adjunct for follicular monitoring, with a significant reduction in time and a good correlation with manual counts. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are required. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. on behalf of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: First-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with celiac disease (CD) are at high risk for CD and prevalence among them varies from 1.6 to 38%. The risk of having CD among FDRs if the FDR is sister, brother, mother, father, son, or daughter of index patient with CD is not known. We conducted a meta-analysis and calculated pooled prevalence of CD among FDRs, second-degree relatives (SDRs), and specific relations with index patient.
   METHODS: On search of literature, 2,259 articles appeared of which 54 articles were included in this metaanalysis. Diagnosis of CD was based on standard criteria.
   RESULTS: Pooled prevalence of CD was 7.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.3%, 8.8%) in 10,252 FDRs and 2.3% (95% CI 1.3%, 3.8%) in 642 SDRs. Pooled prevalence of CD was highest in siblings (8.9%), followed by offsprings (7.9%) and parents (3.0%). Female FDRs had higher prevalence than male FDRs (8.4% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.047). While sisters and daughters of index patient had the highest risk of having CD (1 in 7 and 1 in 8, respectively), the risk was 1 in 13 in sons, 1 in 16 in brothers, 1 in 32 in mothers, and 1 in 33 in fathers. There were also differences in the pooled prevalence of CD in FDRs according to their geographic location.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pooled prevalence of CD among FDRs is 7.5% and varies considerably with their relationship with the index patient. The risk of CD in FDRs also varies according to gender and geographical location.

AB  - Introduction: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic life-threatening infection, especially for immunocompromised individuals. A trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) combination is commonly used for the treatment of PCP, targeting both dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) enzymes. Several studies have already shown that polymorphisms in the DHPS gene are associated with drug resistance. The present study analyzed DHFR gene polymorphisms in Pneumocystis jirovecii recovered from clinical samples from patients admitted to a tertiary care health center in New Delhi, India.
   Methodology: Detection of P. jirovecii was performed using Gomori methenamine silver staining (GMS) and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mt LSU rRNA) gene. The DHFR gene was amplified using nested PCR protocol and was sequenced for detection of polymorphisms.
   Results: Of 180 clinical samples, only 4% (7/180) were positive by GMS staining, and 10% (18/180) were positive by mt LSU rRNA PCR assay. Of these 18 positive samples, only 77% (14/18) were amplified by the DHFR gene PCR assay. A total of 16 nucleotide substitutions were observed in 42% (6/14) samples targeted for the DHFR gene, of which 8 nucleotide substitutions were synonymous and the rest were non-synonymous.
   Conclusions: The DHFR gene mutations found in this study may possibly indicate an association of process likely to contribute to therapeutic failure or an evolutionary process, and warrant continuous monitoring.

AB  - Intravascular hemolysis increases the risk of hypercoagulation and thrombosis in hemolytic disorders. Our study shows a novel mechanism by which extracellular hemoglobin directly affects platelet activation. The binding of Hb to glycoprotein1b alpha activates platelets. Lower concentrations of Hb (0.37-3 mu M) significantly increase the phosphorylation of signaling adapter proteins, such as Lyn, PI3K, AKT, and ERK, and promote platelet aggregation in vitro. Higher concentrations of Hb (3-6 mu M) activate the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak, Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9 and caspase-3, and increase platelet clot formation. Increased plasma Hb activates platelets and promotes their apoptosis, and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of aggregation and development of the procoagulant state in hemolytic disorders. Furthermore, we show that in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a chronic hemolytic disease characterized by recurrent events of intravascular thrombosis and thromboembolism, it is the elevated plasma Hb or platelet surface bound Hb that positively correlates with platelet activation.

AB  - Brachial plexus injuries are devastating injuries that usually affect the younger population. The usual modes of injuries are roadside accidents, falls, and assaults. The affected individuals are crippled and may suffer from excruciating peripheral or central deafferentation pain for rest of their lives. The loss of functional capacity accounts for a significant number of man-hours lost at the workplace and consequent financial burden on the family. The results of brachial plexus reconstructive surgery have generally been unsatisfactory in the past. However, in recent decades, the efficacy of surgery has been proven beyond doubt, and there have been various published series in literature that have reported a good outcome after surgical management of these injuries. This has been made possible by the use of operating microscopes, better microsuture techniques for nerve graft and nerve or tendon transfer repair, and advanced perioperative electrophysiological techniques. The key to successful management lies in the proper clinical evaluation, supplemented with electrophysiology, preoperative imaging studies, and planning of surgical strategy. The partial injuries have a better outcome as compared with global palsies, and early referral should be emphasized. Selective combinations of nerve graft and transfers provide a moderate shoulder and elbow control. However, a multispecialty approach involving hand surgeons, plastic surgeons, and physiotherapists is required.

AB  - Sulfated polysaccharide was isolated from Gracilaria debilis and purified through gel chromatography and their molecular weight was determined through AGE and PAGE. The total sugars in the crude, fractionated and purified polysaccharide were estimated as 52.65%, 59.70% and 67.60%, respectively. The ash and moisture content of crude and purified polysaccharide was found to be 14.2% and 23.5% and the polysaccharide was free from protein contamination. The sulfate and uronic acid contents in the crude, fractionated and purified were estimated as 14.08%, 15.33% and 16.01% and 10.12%, 13.56%, 16.70%. The elemental composition including carbon (crude - 23.12%, purified - 21.05%), hydrogen (crude - 3.4%, purified - 4.13%) and nitrogen (crude - 1.22%, purified - 0.56%) were also analyzed. The anticoagulant activity of the sulfated polysaccharide through APTT and PT was estimated at 14.11 and 8.23 IU/mg. The purified polysaccharide with the molecular mass of 20 kDa showed highest antioxidant activity (38.57%, 43.48% and 38.88%) in all the assays tested such as DPPH hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical scavenging activities and the structural property was analyzed through FT-IR and 1H NMR spectrum. The results together suggest that the isolated low molecular weight sulfated polysaccharide will demonstrate as a enormously available alternative natural source of antioxidant for industrial uses.

AB  - Accurate estimation of post-mortem interval is of great importance in medico-legal autopsy cases. The present study is intended to compare the accuracy of estimating post-mortem interval from biochemical parameters of vitreous humour and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Both the fluids were collected from 100 medico-legal autopsies with known time of death and analysed for potassium, glucose, sodium, calcium, urea and creatinine. The current study found that vitreous humour is a better fluid in comparison to CSF for estimation of post-mortem interval. It is also observed that among the statistically significant parameters in both the fluids, level of potassium and sodium in vitreous humour are giving more accurate results in comparison to their corresponding parameters in CSF while accuracy of glucose is more or less same in both the fluid. Nevertheless potassium concentration in vitreous humour is a single best time honoured parameter to estimate post-mortem interval. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

AB  - A 30-month-old female was admitted with recurrent spells and severe cyanosis. Preoperative echocardiography was diagnostic of tetralogy of Fallot with an atrial septal defect of the primum type, unroofed coronary sinus, and a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium. At surgery the patient was found to have a complete atrioventricular septal defect in addition to these anomalies. Complete anatomical correction was achieved through the right atrial approach.

AB  - The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, takes up numerous host cytosolic components and exogenous nutrients through endocytosis during the intra-erythrocytic stages. Eps15 homology domain-containing proteins (EHDs) are conserved NTPases, which are implicated in membrane remodeling and regulation of specific endocytic transport steps in eukaryotic cells. In the present study, we have characterized the dynamin-like C-terminal Eps15 homology domain containing protein of P. falciparum (PfEHD). Using a GFP-targeting approach, we studied localization and trafficking of PfEHD in the parasite. The PfEHD-GFP fusion protein was found to be a membrane bound protein that associates with vesicular network in the parasite. Time-lapse microscopy studies showed that these vesicles originate at parasite plasma membrane, migrate through the parasite cytosol and culminate into a large multi-vesicular like structure near the food-vacuole. Co-staining of food vacuole membrane showed that the multi-vesicular structure is juxtaposed but outside the food vacuole. Labeling of parasites with neutral lipid specific dye, Nile Red, showed that this large structure is neutral lipid storage site in the parasites. Proteomic analysis identified endocytosis modulators as PfEHD associated proteins in the parasites. Treatment of parasites with endocytosis inhibitors obstructed the development of PfEHD-labeled vesicles and blocked their targeting to the lipid storage site. Overall, our data suggests that the PfEHD is involved in endocytosis and plays a role in the generation of endocytic vesicles at the parasite plasma membrane, that are subsequently targeted to the neutral lipid generation/storage site localized near the food vacuole.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effect of different regimen of first hour fluid administration rates on mortality and severe consequences of impaired circulation in 2 to 60 months old children with impaired circulation.
   Design: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
   Data sources: Various databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE were searched.
   Results: We found only two relevant trials; one was excluded as there was no comparator arm. Only one study (The FEAST Trial) compared boluses with maintenance fluid alone in children with severe febrile illness and one or more signs of impaired perfusion. The 48-hour mortality was more in the bolus group (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13,1.86). The quality of evidence is rated as 'moderate'. For the children who met the WHO criteria for shock (severely impaired circulation) (n=65 children), those receiving boluses had higher mortality (RR 2.40, 95% Cl 0.84, 6.88); the quality of evidence was rated as 'very low'.
   Conclusions: A single large randomized controlled trial conducted in low-resource settings indicates that administration of fluid bolus is associated with higher mortality in comparison to the maintenance fluids alone in children with severe febrile illness and one or more signs of impaired perfusion. The findings are not generalizable to contexts with different severity of and different causes of shock and in centers with better facilities. There is urgent need for research in different settings to determine the optimal rate of fluid resuscitation in the first hour in children presenting with impaired circulation, particularly with severely impaired circulation.

AB  - A 32-year-old female presented with visual acuity of hand movement close to face, an old inferior rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), and a large hemorrhagic macular macrocyst (HMM) in the right eye. After 2 weeks of successful vitreoretinal surgery, the HMM started decreasing in height and resolved by 3 months. On optical coherence tomography, a zone of hyperreflectivity in the outer retinal layers was evident on resolution of the cyst. At final follow-up, the visual acuity improved to 1/60 only. Though HMM resolved completely after retinal reattachment, alteration and thickening of microarchitecture of the outer retinal layers ensued.

AB  - Adult testicular granulosa cell tumor is a rare, potentially malignant sex cord-stromal tumor, of which 30 cases have been described to date. We report the case of a 43-year-old male who complained of a left testicular swelling. Scrotal ultrasound showed a cystic lesion, suggestive of hydrocele. However, due to a clinical suspicion of a solid-cystic neoplasm, a high inguinal orchidectomy was performed, which, on pathological examination, was diagnosed as adult granulosa cell tumor.
   Adult testicular granulosa cell tumors have aggressive behaviour as compared to their ovarian counterparts. They may rarely be predominantly cystic and present as hydrocele. Lymph node and distant metastases have been reported in few cases. Role of MIB-1 labelling index in prognostication is not well defined. Therefore, their recognition and documentation of their behaviour is important from a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic point of view.

AB  - Objective: Feeling stigmatized or having comorbid depression in a PWE may significantly influence epilepsy care and treatment. An important contributory factor to this can be the expressed emotions (EEs) from family, friends, or society. The present study aimed at understanding the influence of EEs, as exhibited by close relatives, on the perception of stigma and comorbid depression experienced by PWEs.
   Method: Eighty PWEs aged 18 years and above, both genders, visiting neurology OPD in AIIMS Hospital, were recruited. Using the PHQ-09, we subdivided them into Group I (PWEs with comorbid depression) and Group II (PWEs without comorbid depression), followed by administration of Levels of Expressed Emotions Scale and Stigma Scale for Epilepsy, respectively.
   Results: The comparative analysis, using independent t-test (for categorical data), Pearson's correlation (for continuous data), and multivariate regression analysis, reflected significant influence of EEs on depression and stigma, with more than 20% of the participants reporting comorbid depression, out of which more than 50% further expressed feelings of inferiority or disgrace due to the ways in which family or society discriminated them from healthy persons, thereby highlighting a greater associations of high EEs as opposed to low EEs from key individuals on patients' perception of stigma or feeling of depression.
   Conclusion: The result suggested that EEs from a relative might go unnoticed but may significantly overwhelm the patient, thereby making him succumb to depression or feeling stigmatized. The analysis of such a clinical profile and relationship between EEs and perceived stigma/depression may help us understand the pattern of attribution styles adopted by PWEs, thereby utilizing it further for enhancing the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for facilitating sustained recovery and improved quality of life for PWEs.

AB  - Purpose: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) results in loss of vision associated with progressive corneal edema and loss of corneal transparency. The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in ZEB1, COL8A2, SLC4A11, and TCF4 rs613872 and correlate them with clinical findings.
   Methods: Eighty-two patients with clinically diagnosed FECD and 143 controls were recruited during the period 2007-2012. Clinical details, pedigree information up to three generations, and 5 ml of blood samples were collected. Histopathological and transmission electron microscopy studies were performed on host corneal buttons from patients who underwent keratoplasty. Genomic DNA from blood was processed for PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing to screen genetic changes in the candidate genes. The pathogenic nature of the genetic variants was assessed using Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) and MutationTaster.
   Results: The mean age at the onset of symptoms was 59.14 +/- 1.41years, the male to female ratio was 1:1.5, and the mean specular count (endothelial cell density) was 1629 +/- 93.62 cells/mm(2) with a mean central corneal thickness (CCT) of 617.30 +/- 15.73 mu m. ZEB1 showed a novel variant IVS2+276 C/T in 14% of the cases, a novel nonsense p.Leu947stop mutation in one patient, two novel missense mutations (p.Glu733Lys, p.Ala818Val) in one patient each, and one novel synonymous variation (p.Ser234Ser) in two patients. Reported mutation p.Gln840Pro and five polymorphisms were also identified. The TCF4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs613872 was significantly higher in patients with FECD.
   Conclusions: This is the first report of genetic variations in ZEB1 and TCF4 SNP rs613872 in patients with FECD from northern India that suggests a possible role in disease pathogenesis and the regulation of endothelial cell density.

AB  - Suicide as a public health problem is studied worldwide and association of psychiatric and genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior are the point of discussion in studies across different ethnic groups. The present study is aimed at evaluating psychiatric and genetic traits among primary relatives of suicide completer families in an urban Indian population. Bi-variate analysis shows significant increase in major depression (PHQ and Hamilton), stress, panic disorder, somatoform disorder and suicide attemptamong primary compared to other relatives. Sib pair correlations also reveal significant results for major depression (Hamilton), stress, suicide attempt, intensity of suicide ideation and other anxiety syndrome. 5-HTTLPR, 5-HTT (Stin2) and COMT risk alleles are higher among primary relatives, though statistically insignificant. Backward conditional logistic regression analysis show only independent variable, Depression (Hamilton) made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model in primary relatives.

AB  - Background: Despite acute respiratory infections being a major cause of death among children in developing countries including India, there is a lack of community-based studies that document its burden and aetiology.
   Methods: A dynamic cohort of children aged 0-10 years was established in four villages in a north Indian state of Haryana from August 2012 onwards. Trained health workers conducted weekly home visits to screen children for acute respiratory infection (ARI) defined as one of the following: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, earache/discharge, or breathing difficulty. Nurses clinically assessed these children to grade disease severity based on standard age-specific guidelines into acute upper or lower respiratory infection (AURI or ALRI) and collected nasal/throat swabs for pathogen testing.
   Results: Our first year results show that ARI incidence in 0-10 years of age was 5.9 (5.8-6.0) per child-year with minimal gender difference, the ALRI incidence in the under-five age group was higher among boys (0.43; 0.39-0.49) as compared to girls (0.31; 0.26-0.35) per child year. Boys had 2.4 times higher ARI-related hospitalization rate as compared to girls.
   Conclusion: ARI impose a significant burden on the children of this cohort. This study platform aims to provide better evidence for prevention and control of pneumonia in developing countries.

AB  - Background: Patients with Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) are considered a reservoir of Leishmania donovani. It is imperative to identify and treat them early for control of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a current priority in the Indian subcontinent. We explored trends in clinico-epidemiological features of PKDL cases over last two decades, for improving management of the disease.
   Methods: Clinically suspected cases were diagnosed with rK39 strip test followed by parasitological confirmation by microscopy and/or PCR/qPCR in skin tissue/slit aspirates. Patients were treated with antimonials till 2008 and subsequently with miltefosine.
   Results: The study indicated higher incidence of PKDL cases in areas of high endemicity for VL, with 20 % cases reporting no history of VL. Approximately 26 % cases of PKDL were initially misdiagnosed at primary health centers. Duration between onset of PKDL and diagnosis was above 12 months in 80 % cases. Diagnostic sensitivity was 32-36 % with microscopy and 96-100 % with PCR/qPCR. Compliance to treatment was over 85 % with miltefosine while 15 % with antimonials. Relapse rate with miltefosine was up to 13.2 %.
   Conclusions: PKDL patients tend to delay reporting and are often misdiagnosed. Confirmatory diagnosis using minimally invasive skin slit aspirate samples would help overcome such issues. There was a paradigm shift in compliance with miltefosine; however, increasing relapse rate indicated the need for newer therapies with oral formulations.

AB  - A novel class of phthalimides functionalized with privileged scaffolds was designed, synthesized and evaluated as potential inhibitors of plasmepsin 2 (Ki: 0.99 +/- 0.1 mu M for 6u) and plasmepsin 4 (Ki: 3.3 +/- 0.3 mu M for 6t), enzymes found in the digestive vacuole of the plasmodium parasite and considered as crucial drug targets. Three compounds were identified as potential candidates for further development. The listed compounds were also assayed for their antimalarial efficacy against chloroquine (CQ) sensitive strain (3D7) of Plasmodium falciparum. Assay of twenty seven hydroxyethylamine derivatives revealed four (5e, 6j, 6o and 6s) as strongly active, which were further evaluated against CQ resistant strain (7GB) of P. falciparum. Compound 5e possessing the piperidinopiperidine moiety exhibited promising antimalarial activity with an IC50 of 1.16 +/- 0.04 mu M. Further, compounds 5e, 6j, 6o and 6s exhibited low cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cell line. Compound 6s possessing C-2 symmetry was identified as the least cytotoxic with significant antimalarial activity (IC50: 1.30 +/- 0.03 mu M). The combined presence of hydroxyethylamine and cyclic amines (piperazines and piperidines) was observed as crucial for the activity. The current studies suggest that hydroxyethylamine based molecules act as potent antimalarial agent and may be helpful in drug development.

AB  - Serratia proteamaculans chitinase-D (SpChiD) has a unique combination of hydrolytic and transglycosylation (TG) activities. The TG activity of SpChiD can be used for large-scale production of chito-oligosaccharides (CHOS). The multiple activities (hydrolytic and/or chitobiase activities and TG) of SpChiD appear to be strongly influenced by the substrate-binding cleft. Here, we report the unique property of SpChiD substrate-binding cleft, wherein, the residues Tyr28, Val35 and Thr36 control chitobiase activity and the residues Trp160 and Trp290 are crucial for TG activity. Mutants with reduced (V35G and T36G/F) or no (SpChiD Delta 30-42 and Y28A) chitobiase activity produced higher amounts of the quantifiable even-chain TG product with degree of polymerization (DP)-6, indicating that the chitobiase and TG activities are inversely related. In addition to its unprecedented catalytic properties, unlike other chitinases, the single modular SpChiD showed dual unfolding transitions. Ligand-induced thermal stability studies with the catalytically inactive mutant of SpChiD (E153A) showed that the transition temperature increased upon binding of CHOS with DP2-6. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments revealed the exceptionally high binding affinities for E153A to CHOS with DP2-6. These observations strongly support that the architecture of SpChiD substrate-binding cleft adopted to control chitobiase and TG activities, in addition to usual chitinase-mediated hydrolysis.

AB  - Pulmonary tuberculosis still remains a major communicable disease worldwide. In 2013, 9 million people developed TB and 1.5 million people died from the disease. India constitutes 24% of the total TB burden. Early detection of TB cases is the key to successful treatment and reduction of disease transmission. Xpert MTB/RIF, an automated cartridge-based molecular technique detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance within two hours has been endorsed by WHO for rapid diagnosis of TB. Our study is the first study from India with a large sample size to evaluate the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in PTB samples. The test showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 95.7% (430/449) and 99.3% (984/990) respectively. In smear negative-culture positive cases, the test had a sensitivity of 77.7%. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting rifampicin resistance was 94.5% and 97.7% respectively with respect to culture as reference standard. However, after resolving the discrepant samples with gene sequencing, the sensitivity and specificity rose to 99.0% and 99.3% respectively. Hence, while solid culture still forms the foundation of TB diagnosis, Xpert MTB/RIF proposes to be a strong first line diagnostic tool for pulmonary TB cases.

AB  - Naegleria fowleri the causative agent of Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis, is ubiquitously distributed worldwide in various warm aquatic environments and soil habitats. The present study reports on the presence of Naegleria spp. in various water bodies present in Rohtak and Jhajjar district, of state Haryana, India. A total of 107 water reservoirs were screened from summer till autumn (2012 and 2013). In order to isolate Naegleria spp. from the collected water samples, the water samples were filtered and the trapped debris after processing were transferred to non-nutrient agar plates already seeded with lawn culture of Escherichia coli. Out of total 107 water samples, 43 (40%) samples were positive by culture for free living amoeba after incubation for 14 days at 37 degrees C. To identify the isolates, the ITS1, 5.8SrDNA and ITS2 regions were targeted for PCR assay. Out of total 43 positive samples, 37 isolates were positive for Naegleria spp. using genus specific primers and the most frequently isolated species was Naegleria australiensis. Out of 37 Naegleria spp. positive isolates, 1 isolate was positive for Naegleria fowleri. The sequence analysis revealed that the Naegleria fowleri strain belonged to Type 2.

AB  - Objective
   To evaluate body fat patterning and phenotype including hepatic fat and pancreatic volume of non-obese (BMI: < 25 kg/m(2)) Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes residing in North India.
   Methods
   Non-obese patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 93) and non-obese, normo-glycemic subjects (n = 40) were recruited. BMI, waist & hip circumferences, skinfold thickness at 8 sites, body fat, lean mass and detailed abdominal fat evaluation [total abdominal fat, total subcutaneous fat (superficial, deep, anterior, and posterior), total intra-abdominal fat (intra-peritoneal, retroperitoneal)], liver span, grades of fatty liver and pancreatic volume were compared.
   Results
   Waist circumference, subscapular skinfolds and total truncal fat (on DEXA) were higher whereas calf, total peripheral skinfolds and total leg fat (on DEXA) lower in patients. Specifically, the following volumes were higher in cases as compared to controls; total abdominal fat (19.4%), total intra-abdominal fat (49.7%), intra-peritoneal fat (47.7%), retroperitoneal fat (70.7%), pancreatic volume (26.6%), pancreatic volume index (21.3%) and liver span (10.8%). In cases, significant positive correlations were observed for pancreatic volume with BMI, waist and hip circumferences, W-HR, subscapular, abdominal and total truncal skinfolds, truncal, total subcutaneous, total intra-abdominal, intra-peritoneal, retroperitoneal fat depots, liver span and fatty liver.
   Conclusions
   In non-obese Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes, subcutaneous and intra-abdominal obesity, including fatty liver, and pancreatic volume were higher and peripheral subcutaneous adiposity was lower than BMI matched non-diabetic subjects. Importantly, increased pancreatic volume in patients was highly correlated with multiple measures of abdominal obesity and liver fat.

AB  - Background: Venoms comprise mixtures of numerous bioactive compounds that have a wide range of pharmacologic actions. Toxins from venomous animals have attracted the attention of researchers because of their affinity for primary sites responsible for lethality and their efficacy at extremely low concentrations. The venoms of marine stingrays have not been extensively studied and limited data is available on them. The present study aims to evaluate the antiproliferative and biochemical properties of the venom obtained from a species of marine stingray (Dasyatis sephen) on human cervical cancer cell line HeLa.
   Methods: The antiproliferative effect of D. sephen venom was determined by MTT assay, and the oxidative stress was determined by lipid peroxidation method along with assessment of changes in the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant status. We observed intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by DCFH-DA method, mitochondrial membrane potential alterations by rhodamine 123 staining and apoptotic morphological changes by acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual staining method.
   Results: D. sephen venom enhances lipid peroxidative markers such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, conjugated diene, and lipid hydroperoxide in HeLa cell lines. Stingray venom enhances the ROS levels, which is evidenced by the increased 2-7-diacetyl dichlorofluorescein fluorescence. Further, D. sephen venom treatment altered the mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cells. Additionally, we observed increased apoptotic morphological changes in D. sephen venom-treated groups.
   Conclusions: Dasyatis sephen venom exhibits potent antiproliferative effect on HeLa cell line and upon further purification it could be a promising antiproliferative agent.

AB  - Background
   Detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis is essential for the control of the disease but it is often hampered by the limitation of transport and storage of samples from remote locations to the reference laboratory. We performed a retrospective field study to evaluate the performance of four supports enabling the transport and storage of samples to be used for molecular detection of drug resistance using the GenoType MTBDRplus.
   Methods
   Two hundred Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were selected and spotted on slides, FTA cards, GenoCards, and in ethanol. GenoType MTBDRplus was subsequently performed with the DNA extracted from these supports. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and compared to the results obtained by drug susceptibility testing.
   Results
   For all supports, the overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of resistance to RIF was between 95% and 100%, and for INH between 95% and 98%.
   Conclusion
   The four transport and storage supports showed a good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of resistance to RIF and INH in M. tuberculosis strains using the GenoType MTBDRplus. These supports can be maintained at room temperature and could represent an important alternative cost-effective method useful for rapid molecular detection of drug-resistant TB in low-resource settings.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to evaluate the incremental value of technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m-MDP) single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) over planar bone scintigraphy (BS) and SPECT in the diagnosis of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head.Materials and methodsThe data of 44 patients (mean age 3616 years, 34 male and 10 female) who underwent Tc-99m-MDP BS along with regional SPECT/CT for suspected femoral head AVN were retrospectively evaluated. Planar BS, SPECT and SPECT/CT images were evaluated by two nuclear medicine physicians in consensus. On the basis of diagnostic confidence, a score of 1-5 was given, with 1 being definitely AVN, 2 being probably AVN, 3 being equivocal, 4 being probably normal and 5 being definitely normal. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed and the area under the curve was calculated. For calculation of sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for planar, an interpretive score of less than or equal to 2 was taken as AVN and a score of 3 or more was taken as no AVN. Clinical and imaging follow-up and histopathological results were taken as the reference standard.ResultsAmong 44 patients with 64 affected femoral heads, there were 48 true-positive, 13 true-negative, two false-positive and one false-negative lesion on SPECT/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of planar BS, SPECT and SPECT/CT was 67, 78 and 95%, respectively. Planar BS was found to have the lowest sensitivity (75%) and specificity (40%), whereas SPECT/CT had the highest sensitivity (98%) and specificity (87%). The area under the curve was highest for SPECT/CT (0.919), followed by SPECT (0.76) and planar BS (0.567). SPECT/CT was superior to both SPECT (P=0.02) and planar BS (P<0.001), whereas SPECT was superior to planar BS (P=0.03).ConclusionSPECT/CT is superior to planar BS and SPECT alone for the diagnosis of AVN of the femoral head.

AB  - Despite multimodality treatment protocol including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), most suffer from treatment failure and tumor recurrence within a few months of initial surgery. The effectiveness of temozolomide (TMZ), the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, is largely dependent on the methylation status of the promoter of the gene O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and the integrity of the mismatch repair (MMR) system. Changes in these regulatory mechanisms at the time of recurrence may influence response to therapy. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of resistance to these drugs may in future lead to improvised patient management. In this article, we provide an update of the spectrum of molecular changes that occur in recurrent GBMs, and thus may have an impact on patient survival and treatment response. For review, electronic search for the keywords "Recurrent GBM", "Recurrent GBM AND MGMT" "Recurrent glioma AND MGMT", "Recurrent GBM AND MMR" and "Recurrent glioma AND MMR", "Recurrent GBM AND MMR" and "Recurrent glioma AND MMR" was done on PubMed and relevant citations were screened including cross-references.

AB  - Myxomas are the most common benign cardiac tumors constituting approximately 75% of all the cardiac tumors. Rest 25% are malignant and sarcomas being the commonest. Among the sarcomas primary cardiac malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are extremely rare. They usually arise in relation to the branches of vagus or phrenic nerves, 5-42% being associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Clinical signs and symptoms depend on the location and extent of involvement. Complete resection is the treatment of choice but local recurrence is common.

AB  - Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV), a relatively common autoimmune blistering disease in India, primarily mediated by anti-Desmoglein 3 (anti-Dsg3) autoantibodies. T-helper 17 (Th17) and T-regulatory (Treg) cells play significant role in regulating immune homeostasis in autoimmune disorders. To understand immunopathogenesis of PV, it is crucial to unfold the phenotypic expression and functional characteristics of these cells along with their specific homing chemokine receptor-ligand. This proposed study aims to unravel the functional expression of Th17 and Treg cells along with their specific homing chemokine receptor-ligand, transcription factors and cytokine levels to better understand the immunopathogenesis of PV.The Flow cytometry results showed decreased frequency of Treg cells and high number of Th17 cells (p <0.001) indicating immune dysregulation in PV. A significant increase (p <0.001) in the serum levels of Th17 associated molecules (IL-17A, CCL-20) and relative expression of ROR gamma t, CCR6 and CCL20 was found in patients. For Treg cells, transcription factor FOXp3 was significantly lowered along with defective CCR4-CCL22 (p< 0.05) that might be playing an ambiguous role in Treg generated immune regulation, leading to homing defect at lesional sites. This maiden study revealed the role of defective receptor-ligand interface that might have failed to suppress inflammatory milieu produced by Th17 cells thus promoting inflammation and contributing to immunopathogenesis of PV. This chemokine receptor-ligand can further be explored as potential target for development of novel therapies in PV. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diabetes and psychiatric disorders share a bi-directional relationship, with both affecting each other adversely. Just as achieving glycaemic control is important, so is ensuring that the person enjoys a good quality of life. All individuals with diabetes must be screened regularly for co-morbidity, especially depressive and anxiety disorders. Multiple evidence based psychotropic pharmacological interventions are available for management of these psychiatric disorders. Additionally, non-pharmacological interventions play a key role in comprehensive management of such patients.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a pivotal role in tumor invasion and metastasis in various malignancies. ZEB2/SIP1 is an important EMT regulator and down-regulates E-cadherin expression. The present study was planned to explore status of EMT-associated markers ZEB2/SIP1 and E-cadherin in eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) and to correlate with clinicopathological high-risk features. Expressions of ZEB2 and E-cadherin were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 65 cases of histopathologically proven eyelid SGC. The results were correlated with clinicopathological high-risk features and survival of the patients to determine the prognostic significance of ZEB2, E-cadherin, and various high-risk features. Cytoplasmic overexpression of ZEB2 and membranous loss of E-cadherin were seen in 68% and 66% of cases of eyelid SGC, respectively. ZEB2 overexpression was significantly associated with E-cadherin loss (P = .002). Overexpression of ZEB2 also showed significant association with lymph node metastasis (P = .046), orbital invasion (P = .049), large tumor size (P = .018), and advanced tumor stages (P = .036). Survival analysis revealed that patients with ZEB2 overexpression had poor survival. ZEB2 overexpression and orbital invasion were found to be independent prognostic indicators (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analysis showed that ZEB2 (hazard ratio, 0.094; 95% confidence interval, 00.012-0.709; P = .022) was the best poor prognostic indicator of eyelid SGC. Our study demonstrates the role of both ZEB2 and E-cadherin in the promotion of EMT in eyelid SGC. The outcome of this study also points toward ZEB2 as an independent prognostic marker as well as a potential therapeutic target in eyelid SGC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - GENE
AB  - Dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing nonintegrin related molecule (DC-SIGNR) is a C-type lectin, calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding protein, which can act as a cell-adhesion and pathogen recognition receptor. DC-SIGNR is known to be highly expressed on liver sinusoidal cells and in the lymph nodes. However, its expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in HIV-1 infection has not been addressed. Therefore, this study determined the expression of DC-SIGNR in PBMCs of HIV-1-infected patients and healthy seronegative individuals by real-time polymerase chain reaction and assessed its correlation with CD4+ T cell counts and DC-SIGNR genotypes. A significantly higher expression of DC-SIGNR was observed in the PBMCs of HIV-1-infected patients compared with healthy seronegative individuals. Further, there was a negative correlation between DC-SIGNR expression and CD4+ T cell counts and positive with viral load, with higher DC-SIGNR expression in the PBMCs of HIV-1-infected patients with a CD4+ T cell count <200 cells/L than those with >200 cells/L. This is the first study to report the expression of DC-SIGNR in PBMCs of HIV-1-infected patients. A salient finding of this study is that the DC-SIGNR expression was higher in HIV-1-infected patients, and its positive correlation with viral load and negative with CD4+ T cells counts suggesting a potential role of DC-SIGNR in HIV-1 infection.

AB  - To report a case of bandage contact lens induced infectious keratitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa following DSAEK.
   Case report: A 56-year-old female who underwent DSAEK at our institute for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, developed contact lens induced keratitis in the fifth post operative week. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) reduced to perception of light in the left eye. Slit lamp examination revealed an epithelial ulcer measuring 4.7 mm x 6 mm with surrounding infiltrates in the anterior stroma with hypopyon. The interface was clear. The corneoscleral rim culture of the donor tissue showed no growth on bacterial and fungal culture ruling out the possibility of donor-to-host transmission of infection. Microbiological evaluation identified the causative agent to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on culture and sensitivity report patient was started on hourly instillation of topical polymyxin B 20,000 IU and fortified ceftazidime 5%. A response to treatment was noted and there was a complete resolution of keratitis with residual scarring.
   Discussion: There have been case reports suggesting a host to donor transmission of infection which manifests during the postoperative period. To the best of our knowledge there are no reports of bandage contact lens associated Pseudomonas keratitis in a case that has undergone DSAEK. The prolonged use of bandage contact lens, lens contamination, stagnation of tear film behind the lens, compromised ocular surface and post operative use of topical steroids can contribute to infectious keratitis in DSAEK cases.

AB  - PurposeThe aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) in paediatric patients with neuroblastoma (NB) and compare the results with iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (I-131-MIBG) scintigraphy.MethodsData on 40 paediatric patients (age, 5.55.6 years; male, 32; female, eight) with histopathologically proven NB who underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT (staging, 21 patients; restaging/response monitoring, 19 patients) were retrospectively evaluated. I-131-MIBG scintigraphy data were available for 28/40 patients (median interval, 15 days; staging, 20 patients; restaging/response monitoring, eight patients). I-131-MIBG scintigraphy and F-18-FDG PET/CT images were evaluated by two nuclear medicine physicians in consensus and in separate sessions. Histopathology (n=50 lesions) and/or clinical/imaging follow-up (n=90 lesions) data were taken as the reference standard.ResultsPatient-wise sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, negative-predictive value and accuracy of F-18-FDG PET/CT were 100, 50, 91.89, 100 and 92.50%, respectively. A total of 140 lesions (primary, 37; lymph node, 31; bone, 50; bone marrow, 15; and others, seven) were detected on PET/CT. In 28 patients undergoing both imaging studies, the sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, negative-predictive value and accuracy of F-18-FDG PET/CT were 100, 60, 92, 100 and 92.80%, respectively, and those of I-131-MIBG were 95.65, 60, 91.67, 75 and 89.20%, respectively. In these 28 patients, PET/CT detected 107 lesions (primary, 25; lymph node, 22; bone/bone marrow, 56; and others, four) and I-131-MIBG scintigraphy detected 74 lesions (primary, 24; lymph node, five; and bone/bone marrow, 45). On a patient-based comparison there was no significant difference between F-18-FDG PET/CT and I-131-MIBG (P=1.000), but F-18-FDG PET/CT was superior to I-131-MIBG on a lesion-based comparison (P<0.0001). Although no difference was noted for primary lesions (P=1.000), PET/CT was superior to I-131-MIBG scintigraphy for the detection of lymph nodal (P=0.001) and bone/bone marrow lesions (P=0.007).Conclusion(18)F-FDG PET/CT shows high accuracy in paediatric patients with NB and demonstrates more lesions as compared with I-131-MIBG scintigraphy.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the acute effects of an oscillating positive expiratory pressure device (flutter) on airways resistance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Randomized crossover study: 15 COPD outpatients from Asthma Lab-Royal Brompton Hospital underwent spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS) for respiratory resistance (R) and reactance (X), and fraction exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measures. Thirty minutes of flutter exercises: a "flutter-sham" procedure was used as a control, and airway responses after a short-acting bronchodilator were also assessed.
   Respiratory system resistance (R): in COPD patients an increase in X5insp (0.21 to 0.33 kPa/L/s) and Fres (24.95 to 26.16 Hz) occurred immediately after flutter exercises without bronchodilator. Following 20 min of rest, a decrease in the R5, Delta R5, R20, X5, and Ax was observed, with R5, R20, and X5 values lower than baseline, with a moderate effect size; there were no changes in FeNO levels or spirometry.
   The use of flutter can decrease the respiratory system resistance and reactance and expiratory flow limitation in stable COPD patients with small amounts of secretions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and accounts for 1% of all breast cancers. There is limited data on MBC from India. The aim of our study was to assess clinico-pathological parameters and outcome in MBC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis was carried out in 76 patients of MBC who were registered at Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital of All India Institute Of Medical Sciences between 1996 and 2012. Patients' records were retrospective reviewed and data obtained from the computer database using International Classification of Diseases code (C-50). RESULTS: The median age was 59 years (range: 28-80). The median duration of symptoms was 11 months (range: 0.5-40). Breast lump was the most common presenting symptom (left >right side). American Joint Committee on Cancer (7th edition) stage distribution was Stage I-2.6%, Stage II-13.1%, Stage III-59.3% and Stage IV-25%. Modified radical mastectomy was the commonest surgical procedure. Moreover, 30% of tumors were high-grade and 70% had pathological node positive disease. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu positivity was 80% and 28%, respectively. Triple negative breast cancer constituted 19% of cases. With a median follow-up of 36 months, 3 years relapse free survival and overall survival was 60% and 80%. Advanced stage and visceral metastasis at baseline predicted poor outcome. CONCLUSION: MBC constituted 0.8% at our institute. Our study population had a longer time to presentation, advanced disease at presentation, more HER2/neu positivity and triple negativity higher than the available literature.

AB  - AimThis study aimed to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and subthreshold MS in antipsychotic naive patients with schizophrenia by pooling the data from three different centres in India.
   MethodsOne hundred thirty-seven antipsychotic naive patients with schizophrenia were evaluated for MS using common criteria for clinical diagnosis.
   ResultsTwenty-six patients (19%) met consensus criteria. Additionally, 56 patients (40.9%) fulfilled one criterion and 32 patients (23.3%) fulfilled two criteria of MS out of five criteria.
   ConclusionOne-fifth of antipsychotic naive patients with schizophrenia had MS and another two-third had at least one metabolic abnormality. Awareness of such a high risk is vitally important for rational selection of antipsychotic medications as well as effective implementation of preventive measures.

AB  - This study describes the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of children with West syndrome in a tertiary care hospital in north India. Overall, 310 case records diagnosed from January 2009 to June 2012 were reviewed. The median age of onset of spasms was 5 months (interquartile range = 2.5-7 months). The predominant underlying etiology was perinatal cerebral ischemia (55%). Adrenocorticotropic hormone or oral steroids were received by 92% children, of whom 43% became seizure free. Median lag time for appropriate treatment initiation was significantly less in patients who became seizure free as compared to those with persisting seizures (11 vs 15 months, P = .001) soon after receiving treatment of choice. Later age at onset of spasms was associated with a favorable seizure outcome (P = .03). In a resource-limited setting, unawareness along with treatment costs and repeated visits to the hospital are significant obstacles to optimum management.

AB  - Bronchiectasis is a pathological abnormality of the airways in which there is permanent dilatation and thickening of the airways. Precise incidence/prevalence in India is not known. Recent data suggests that about 1 % young children admitted in a hospital with pneumonia may develop bronchiectasis. Due to significant burden of pneumonia in young children in developing countries including India, it may be a significant problem that is possibly under recognized. Causes of bronchiectasis depend on the burden of respiratory infections and availability of the investigations for identification of the underlying cause. Post infectious causes are common in countries where infections are more common; however, since these countries are usually resource constrained and therefore, are not able to appropriately diagnose the other causes, leading to more than real overrepresentation of infections as a cause. In countries with less of infectious illnesses and good diagnostic facilities, malformations of airways, immune deficiency disorders and primary ciliary dyskinesia are common causes of bronchiectasis. High resolution CT scan of chest confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive care and consists of maintenance of nutrition, airway clearance and antibiotics for exacerbations. Medical treatment is successful in the majority.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effects of genistein against cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ) (45 mg/kg body weight)-induced diabetic rats. genistein (300 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 24 weeks to STZ-induced diabetic rats. The effects of genistein on blood glucose, % glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF- alpha), transforming growth factor (TGF-beta 1), and total antioxidant were studied. Ultrastructural and histopathological assessment of injury were also undertaken using transmission electron microscope. STZ-induced diabetes resulted in significant increase in the levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, C-reactive protein, TNF- alpha and TGF-beta 1, and a decline in total antioxidant reserve of the myocardium. Administration of genistein to diabetic rats resulted in a decrease in blood glucose (p < 0.001), % HbA1c (p < 0.0001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), and expression of TNF- alpha (p < 0.001) and TGF-beta 1 (p < 0.0001) proteins. In addition, genistein treatment results in augmentation of total antioxidant (p < 0.01) reserve of the hearts. The above findings were supported by histological as well as immunohistochemical localization of NF-kappa B (p65) in the heart. Genistein treatment ameliorated the ultrastructural degenerative changes in the cardiac tissues as compared to the diabetic control. The result demonstrates that genistein restored the integrity of the diabetic myocardium by virtue of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

AB  - Purpose: Composition of the coronary artery plaque is known to have critical role in heart attack. While calcified plaque can easily be diagnosed by conventional CT, it fails to distinguish between fibrous and lipid rich plaques. In the present paper, the authors discuss the experimental techniques and obtain a numerical algorithm by which the electron density (rho(e)) and the effective atomic number (Z(eff)) can be obtained from the dual energy computed tomography (DECT) data. The idea is to use this inversion method to characterize and distinguish between the lipid and fibrous coronary artery plaques.
   Methods: For the purpose of calibration of the CT machine, the authors prepare aqueous samples whose calculated values of (rho(e), Z(eff)) lie in the range of (2.65 x 10(23) <= rho(e) <= 3.64 x 10(23)/cm(3)) and (6.80 <= Z(eff) <= 8.90). The authors fill the phantom with these known samples and experimentally determine HU(V-1) and HU(V-2), with V-1,V-2 = 100 and 140 kVp, for the same pixels and thus determine the coefficients of inversion that allow us to determine (rho(e), Z(eff)) from the DECT data. The HU(100) and HU(140) for the coronary artery plaque are obtained by filling the channel of the coronary artery with a viscous solution of methyl cellulose in water, containing 2% contrast. These (rho(e), Z(eff)) values of the coronary artery plaque are used for their characterization on the basis of theoretical models of atomic compositions of the plaque materials. These results are compared with histopathological report.
   Results: The authors find that the calibration gives Pc with an accuracy of 3.5% while Z(eff) is found within 1% of the actual value, the confidence being 95%. The HU(100) and HU(140) are found to be considerably different for the same plaque at the same position and there is a linear trend between these two HU values. It is noted that pure lipid type plaques are practically nonexistent, and microcalcification, as observed in histopathology, has to be taken into account to explain the nature of the observed (rho(e), Z(eff)) data. This also enables us to judge the composition of the plaque in terms of basic model which considers the plaque to be composed of fibres, lipids, and microcalcification.
   Conclusions: This simple and reliable method has the potential as an effective modality to investigate the composition of noncalcified coronary artery plaques and thus help in their characterization. In this inversion method, (rho(e), Z(eff)) of the scanned sample can be found by eliminating the effects of the CT machine and also by ensuring that the determination of the two unknowns (rho(e), Z(eff)) does not interfere with each other and the nature of the plaque can be identified in terms of a three component model.

AB  - Depression is a highly prevalent and severely disabling condition globally. Despite being a major cause of disability worldwide, little progress has been made in the last three decades in developing rational and novel pharmacological treatment options for the management of depression. Recently there has been growing interest in the role of kynurenine pathway in pathophysiology of depression. In this paper, the potential role of kynurenine pathway inhibitors in the management of depression particularly in secondary and reactive depression and the development of novel antidepressant drugs targeting kynurenine pathway are discussed.

AB  - Background: Meningiomas are the most common benign central nervous system tumors. However, a sizeable fraction recurs, irrespective of histological grade. No molecular marker is available for prediction of recurrence in these tumors. Materials and Methods: We analyzed recurrent meningiomas with paired parent and recurrent tumors by fluorescence in situ hybridization for 1p36 and 14q32 deletion, AKT and SMO mutations by sequencing, and immunohistochemistry for GAB1, progesterone receptor (PR), p53, and MIB-1. Results: 18 recurrent meningiomas (11 grade I, 3 grade II, 4 grade III) with their parent tumors (14 grade I, 2 grade II and 2 grade III) were identified. Overall, 61% of parent and 78% of recurrent meningiomas showed 1p/14q co-deletion. Notably, grade I parent tumors showed 1p/14q co-deletion in 64% cases while 82% of grade I recurrent tumors were co-deleted. AKT mutation was seen in two cases, in both parent and recurrent tumors. SMO mutations were absent. GAB1 was immunopositive in 80% parent and 56.3% recurrent tumors. MIB-1 labeling index (LI), PR and p53 expression did not appear to have any significant contribution in possible prediction of recurrence. Conclusion: Identification of 1p/14q co-deletion in a significant proportion of histologically benign (grade I) meningiomas that recurred suggests its utility as a marker for prediction of recurrence. It appears to be a better predictive marker than MIB1-LI, PR and p53 expression. Recognition of AKT mutation in a subset of meningiomas may help identify patients that may benefit from PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors, particularly among those at risk for development of recurrence, as determined by presence of 1p/14q co-deletion.

KW  - extranodal
KW  - non-Hodgkin lymphoma
KW  - prostate
AB  - Primary prostatic lymphomas are extremely unusual neoplasms. Their rarity and nonspecific symptomatology at presentation usually prompt a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia or chronic prostatitis, leading to significant delay in diagnosis. Clinical examination, serum prostate-specific antigen levels, and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) are not of much utility in differential diagnosis, and histological examination is the gold standard. We report two cases of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of prostate, diffuse large B-cell type, diagnosed on TRUS-guided prostatic biopsies. Correct diagnosis is of crucial importance as the therapeutic strategy for lymphoma is radically different from that for carcinoma, and early detection of prostatic lymphoma can be potentially curative. Thus, knowledge of this rare entity, inclusion in differential diagnosis of lower urinary tract obstruction, and application of an appropriate immunohistochemical panel are essential so as not to miss this unusual diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary surgery.

AB  - Exclusive breastfeeding for six months, continued along with top feed up to the age of 2 years and beyond, is strongly recommended by the World Health Organization. Apart from the various benefits that it provides, breast feeding may also serve to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in mothers, and type 1 diabetes and overweight/obesity in their offspring. This review discusses the evidence related to breastfeeding and type 2 diabetes. It highlights pertinent aspects of breast feeding management, which can help facilitate optimal use of this natural preventive intervention.

AB  - An effective regimen for treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is comprised of multiple drugs that inhibit a range of essential cellular activities in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The effectiveness of a regimen is further enhanced if constituent drugs act with synergy. Here, we report that faropenem (a penem) or biapenem, doripenem, or meropenem (carbapenems), which belong to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics, and rifampin, one of the drugs that forms the backbone of TB treatment, act with synergy when combined. One of the reasons (carba) penems are seldom used for treatment of TB is the high dosage levels required, often at the therapeutic limits. The synergistic combination of rifampin and these (carba) penems indicates that (carba) penems can be administered at dosages that are therapeutically relevant. The combination of faropenem and rifampin also limits the frequency of resistant mutants, as we were unable to obtain spontaneous mutants in the presence of these two drugs. The combinations of rifampin and (carba) penems were effective not only against drug-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis but also against drugresistant clinical isolates that are otherwise resistant to rifampin. A combination of doripenem or biapenem and rifampin also exhibited synergistic activity against Mycobacterium abscessus. Although the MICs of these three drugs alone against M. abscessus are too high to be of clinical relevance, their concentrations in combinations are therapeutically relevant; therefore, they warrant further evaluation for clinical utility to treat Mycobacterium abscessus infection, especially in cystic fibrosis patients.

AB  - Objective: The variant allele of rs3798220 in the apolipoprotein(a) gene (LPA) is used to assess the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in Europeans, where it is associated with short alleles of the Kringle IV-2 (KIV-2) copy number variation (CNV) and high lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentrations. No association of rs3798220 with CAD was detected in a GWAS of East Asians. Our study investigated the association of rs3798220 with Lp(a) concentrations and KIV-2 CNV size in non-European populations to explain the missing association of the variant with CAD in Asians.
   Methods: We screened three populations from Africa and seven from Asia by TaqMan Assay for rs3798220 and determined KIV-2 CNV sizes of LPA alleles by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Additionally, CAD cases from India were analysed. To investigate the phylogenetic origin of rs3798220, 40 LPA alleles from Chinese individuals were separated by PFGE and haplotyped for further SNPs.
   Results: The variant was not found in Africans. Allele frequencies in East and Southeast Asians ranged from 2.9% to 11.6%, and were very low (0.15%) in CAD cases and controls from India. The variant was neither associated with short KIV-2 CNV alleles nor elevated Lp(a) concentrations in Asians.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that rs3798220 is no marker for short KIV-2 CNV alleles and high Lp(a) in East and Southeast Asians, although the haplotype background is shared with Europeans. It appears unlikely that this SNP confers atherogenic potential on its own. Furthermore, this SNP does not explain Lp(a) attributed risk for CAD in Asian Indians. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The study evaluated the impact of implantable Collamer lens (ICL) implantation on stereoacuity in myopes in a retrospective case series. Ninety-five eyes of 48 patients were recruited. Distance and near stereoacuity were measured using distance Randot stereotest and TNO test, respectively, before surgery and at 4 weeks postoperatively. Mean age of the patients was 23.67 +/- 3.7 years. Mean uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) was 1.28 +/- 0.37 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (median: 1.3; range: 0.3-1.8), and median best-corrected distance visual acuity (BDVA) was 0.18 logMAR (range: 0-0.6). There was a significant improvement in both UDVA and BDVA postsurgery (P < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank test). The overall improvement in stereopsis was observed in 15/48 (31.25%) and 13/48 (27.10%) subjects for near and distance, respectively, with no significant difference between the two (P = 0.82; Fisher's exact test). Among stereoblind individuals, the odd's ratio for near stereoacuity to improve in comparison to distance stereoacuity was 8.85 (95% confidence interval: 1.68-46.70; P = 0.01). ICL implantation for refractive correction aided stereoacuity improvement in myopes more so for near.

AB  - Background: Treatment of unresectable HNSCC is not well defined and has a poor outcome. This study has been designed to address the unmet needs of such groups of patients with primary end points of (a) proportion of patients eligible for radical treatment in each arm (b) loco-regional disease control at 6 months between two arms.
   Materials and methods: Locally advanced and unresectable HNSCC patients (except Nasopharynx and Larynx) unfit for radical treatment were randomized to arm A [short course RT alone (4 Gy/#/day for 5 days)] or arm B [RT as arm A + concurrent cisplatin at 6 mg/m(2)/day IV bolus for 5 days]. Those with at least PR were taken for further RT to complete biological equivalent dose of 70 Gy, in both the arms. In arm B, concurrent CDDP at a dose of 40 mg/m(2)/week was administered.
   Results: 114 patients (57 in each arm) were randomized but 111 were analyzable. 15 (27.27%) patients in arm A and 28 (50%) patients in arm B had >= PR (p = 0.01) however patients taken for FRT were 14 (25.45%) and 26 (46.42%) in arms A and B respectively (p = 0.02). Locoregional control i.e. (CR + PR) at 6 months was 16.36% in arm A versus 32.14% in arm B (p = 0.15). Median PFS (arm A - 3.2 months, arm B - 6.2 months; p = 0.02) and OS (arm A - 5.9 months, arm B - 10.1 months; p = 0.03) was significantly more in arm B. There was relative improvement in quality of life for most parameters in arm B.
   Conclusion: Concurrent low dose CTRT can be an effective treatment modality in advanced and incurable HNSCC. However, a larger phase III trial is required. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - tubercular vasculopathy
AB  - Background: Moyamoya vasculopathy, arising secondary to tubercular meningitis (TBM) is unusual. There have also been a few reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in TBM. A case of TBM, complicated simultaneously by Moyamoya syndrome and CVST, is being presented here.
   Case: A 1-year-old girl presented with febrile encephalopathy, vomiting, seizures and left hemiparesis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was suggestive of TBM. Extensive infarcts were noted in the magnetic resonance imaging, involving right middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery and the left MCA. Magnetic resonance venogram revealed left transverse venous sinus thrombosis and magnetic resonance angiography showed bilateral moyamoya pattern of arteriopathy. Patient was started on antitubercular therapy and low molecular weight heparin.
   Conclusions: Early vascular involvement affecting both arterial and venous structures has not hitherto been reported in CNS tuberculosis. Early recognition of secondary complications of CNS tuberculosis is crucial to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with TBM.

AB  - The current definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI) including HRS have been derived from patients with decompensated cirrhosis. No studies have carefully addressed AKI in patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). We evaluated the prevalence, spectrum, natural history and mortality of AKI at admission and new-onset AKI in hospitalized patients with ACLF and compared the results with patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis (ADC).
   Consecutive patients with ACLF (n = 382) and ADC (n = 451) were prospectively studied. Serial renal and liver functions were recorded and correlated with the disease course and outcome.
   AKI at admission and new onset AKI in the hospital were not different in patients with ACLF and ADC (p > 0.05). However, a significant difference in the spectrum of AKI was noted; functional volume-responsive AKI was more common (p < 0.05) in ADC, while patients with ACLF more frequently had the structural form of AKI (p < 0.05). Moreover, patients with ADC had significantly less AKI progression (p < 0.05) and prolonged duration (p < 0.05), a lower requirement of RRT (p < 0.05) and also less AKI resolution (p < 0.05) compared to ACLF patients. Patients with ACLF (versus ADC) had a significantly higher mortality on multivariate analysis.
   The kidneys are differentially affected in patients with cirrhosis with or without liver failure. Patients with ACLF with AKI have more structural AKI, greater potential for reversibility despite higher progression as well as higher mortality compared to patients with ADC. Prevention and early detection of AKI should be considered in patients with ACLF.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neurocytoma (NC) is a rare benign neuronal tumor. A complete excision remains curative for most of these tumors, but atypical histology and extra-ventricular location often necessitates adjuvant therapy. We intended to explore the clinico-pathological features and treatment outcome in patients of NC in our institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were reviewed and data collected on NC over a 6-year period (2006-2012) from the departmental archives. Disease free survival (DFS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients met the study criteria. Fourteen patients had intra-ventricular neurocytoma (IVNC), right lateral ventricle being the most common site of origin. Gross total resection and near total resection were achieved in eight cases each whereas tumor decompression and biopsy could be done in two cases. On post-operative histopathological examination, eight patients were found to have atypical NC while 10 patients had typical NC. All patients underwent adjuvant radiation. The median dose of post-operative radiation was 56 Gy. All patients were alive at their final follow-up. One patient had both clinical and radiological evidence of local relapse. In the evaluable patients (n = 18), after a median follow-up of 35 months the DFS rate at 2 years and 3 years are 100% and 83% respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of adjuvant radiation to a total dose of 56 Gy enhances the local control and achieves superior survival in patients of NC. Use of 3D conformal planning techniques may help us to achieve better therapeutic ratio in patients with NC.

AB  - Primary intradural extramedullary melanoma of spinal cord is an extremely rare tumor. It accounts for approximately 1% of the total melanoma cases. We report a case of primary intradural extramedullary spinal melanoma in a 28-year-old gentleman who was managed with surgery followed by postoperative radiation with concurrent temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide. The patient had a disease-free survival of 24 months, after which he developed marginal recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a primary spinal cord melanoma (PSCM) treated with postoperative radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide followed by adjuvant Temozolomide.

AB  - Background The functional significance of basal ganglia calcification (BGC) in idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH) is not clear.
   Objective To assess the effect of BGC on glucose metabolism and dopaminergic function in IH.
   Methods F-18-FDG and Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 nuclear imaging were performed in 35 IH patients with (n = 26) and without (n = 9) BGC. Controls were subjects without hypoparathyroidism or BGC (nine for F-18-FDG and 12 for Tc-99m-TRODAT-1). Relationship of the glucose metabolism and dopaminergic function was assessed with the neuropsychological and biochemical abnormalities.
   Results F-18-FDG uptake in IH patients with calcification at caudate and striatum was less than that of IH patients without calcification (1.06 +/- 0.13 vs 1.24 +/- 0.09, P = <0.0001 and 1.06 +/- 0.09 vs 1.14 +/- 0.08, P = 0.03, respectively). F-18-FDG uptake did not correlate with neuropsychological dysfunctions. F-18-FDG uptake in IH without BGC was significantly lower than that of controls. The mean Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 uptake at basal ganglia was comparable between IH with and without BGC and between IH without BGC and controls. Serum calcium-phosphorus ratio maintained by the patients correlated with F-18-FDG uptake at striatum (r = 0.57, P = 0.001). For every 0.1 unit reduction in calcium-phosphorus ratio, F-18-FDG uptake decreased by 2.5 +/- 0.68% (P = 0.001).
   Conclusion BGC was associated with modest reduction (15%) in F-18-FDG uptake at basal ganglia in IH but did not affect dopaminergic function. F-18-FDG uptake did not correlate with neuropsychological dysfunctions. Interestingly, chronic hypo-calcaemia-hyperphosphataemia also contributed to reduction in F-18-FDG uptake which was independent of BGC.

AB  - SETTING: The emerging threat of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has cast doubt on the efficacy of Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment in retreatment cases. Data on outcomes of treatment with the Category II regimen in children are scarce.
   OBJECTIVE: To study outcomes of Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment in Indian children.
   DESIGN: Charts belonging to patients registered between 2004 and 2012 at the Paediatric Tuberculosis Clinic, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, were reviewed, and children receiving Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment were included in the study. Outcomes were recorded as treatment success and poor outcome, which included treatment failure and default.
   RESULTS: A total of 125 children (mean age 101.6 months, standard deviation 42.9; girls 58 [46.4%]) were initiated on Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment, mainly due to worsening clinical conditions (36.8%) and relapse (36%). Treatment success, treatment failure and default were recorded in respectively 80 (64%), 20 (16%) and 25 (20%) children. Children who were non-adherent to previous treatment tended to default from Category II treatment as well (11.8% in previous non-defaulters vs. 37.5% in previous defaulters, P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSION: Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment was effective in approximately 60% of children who had failed or defaulted from the previous regimen. All efforts should be made to isolate Mycobacterium tuberculosis and perform drug susceptibility testing to identify MDR-TB in children.

AB  - The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has been a watershed in the history of India's health sector. As a previously unattempted investment, governance, and mobilization effort, the NRHM succeeded in injecting new energy into India's public health system. A huge expansion of infrastructure and human resources is the hallmark of the NRHM action. Demand-side initiatives led to enhanced utilization of public health facilities, especially for facility births. The impact is visible. The Mission has brought Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 within India's grasp. Acceleration in infant and neonatal mortality reduction is especially notable. The NRHM has created conditions for the country to move toward universal health coverage. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Existing knowledge of genetic variants affecting risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is largely based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of common SNPs. Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of similar to 185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 < MAF < 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate causal genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of central nervous system (CNS), which is disabling and majorly involves younger population. Various available treatments in forms of immunomodulation are not very effective; however, stem cell transplantation seems to be promising in recent literature. The current case report is a novel evidence for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in progressive MS. Case Summary: A 33 year old male with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), after being failed and/or intolerance to standard approved interferon (IFN) and mitoxantrone therapy, autologous HSCT was administered. At 2years of post-stem cell transplantation follow-up, he has remained stable with some improvement in functional status (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) reduced by 1.5), with no relapse, no treatment related complications, and no fresh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions. Conclusion: Autologous stem cell transplantation may be beneficial in progressive forms of MS, but needs to be tested in well-designed randomized trial.

AB  - There are contrary reports of association of lead and cadmium with the decline in semen quality. This study evaluates whether seminal lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) at environmental concentration are associated with altered semen quality. We conducted a study of healthy fertile and infertile men 20-43years of age attending the Andrology Laboratory of Reproductive Biology Department for semen analysis. The semen analysis was carried out according to the WHO 2010 guidelines. Seminal lead and cadmium were estimated by ICP-AES. The lead and cadmium values were significantly higher in infertile subjects. A negative association between seminal lead or cadmium concentration and sperm concentration, sperm motility and per cent abnormal spermatozoa was found. This study shows that exposure to Pb (5.29-7.25gdl(-1)) and cadmium (4.07-5.92gdl(-1)) might affect semen profile in men. Age, diet, smoking and tobacco chewing habits may have an influence on the increase in exposure to Pb and Cd in the individual subjects.

AB  - The oral iron chelator deferiprone is associated with various side effects including agranulocytosis, arthropathy, and deranged liver function tests. Rarely, neurological and visual side effects have been reported with high doses. The authors describe rare neurological manifestations of cerebellar ataxia, hypertonia, and bilateral cataract in an 11-year-old boy with thalassemia major on recommended therapeutic doses of deferiprone. The neurological abnormalities resolved with stoppage of deferiprone. Central nervous system toxicity and lenticular opacities may be attributed to the low molecular weight of deferiprone and its ability to cross the blood-brain and blood-ocular barrier, respectively. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of neurological abnormalities that may occur during deferiprone therapy.

AB  - Background Ovarian cancer is one of the most common lethal gynecological malignancies world-wide. Despite an initial 70-80 % response rate, most patients relapse within 1-2 years and develop chemo-resistance. Hence, the identification of novel drugs or the repositioning of known drugs to re-sensitize ovarian cancer cells to existing chemotherapy regimens is needed. Here, we evaluated the effect of metformin (an anti-diabetic drug) on ovarian cancer cells, based on its putative effect on other solid tumors.
   Methods Primary cultures of epithelial ovarian cancer cells established from ascitic fluids of untreated ovarian cancer patients and the SKOV-3 ovarian cancer-derived cell line were used. The respective cells were treated with metformin, carboplatin and paclitaxel alone and its various combinations and their effects, including the ability to induce apoptosis, were examined. Concomitantly, the cells were assessed for the expression of several apoptosis-related mRNAs and proteins using quantitative real time PCR, flowcytometry and Western blotting.
   ResultsWe found that metformin induced apoptosis in the ovarian cancer cells tested, and provoked a cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and S-phase. Metformin induced apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, and up-regulating Bax and Cytochrome c expression. We also found that the apoptosis induction by metformin could be enhanced by a combinatorial use of carboplatin and/or paclitaxel.
   Conclusions Our data indicate that metformin can induce apoptosis in both primary ovarian cancer cells and in SKOV-3 cells. When metformin was combined with carboplatin or paclitaxel, an increased apoptotic activity was observed, implicating a chemo-adjuvant potential.

AB  - Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive constituent of Nigella sativa (Linn.) seed, which is commonly used as a spice in Asian food, has been reported to possess a wide range of biological effects. The present study evaluated the effect of TQ on high-fructose diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS) in male Wistar rats.
   MetS was induced by 60 % HFD over 42 days. TQ (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o. once daily) was administered along with HFD for 42 days. Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg, p.o. once daily) was used as a standard drug. Plasma glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were estimated on days 0 and 42. Change in blood pressure, oral glucose tolerance and insulin resistance were measured. Hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase levels were estimated as measures of hepatic oxidative stress. Hepatic mRNA of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma was also studied.
   TQ prevented the characteristic features of HFD-induced MetS, such as hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolaemia and elevated systolic blood pressure. TQ also prevented impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. It also ameliorated HFD-induced increase in hepatic TBARS and depletion of SOD, catalase and GSH. TQ prevented reduction in hepatic mRNA of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma in HFD rats, and the effects were comparable to those of pioglitazone.
   This study demonstrates protective effect of TQ against HFD-induced MetS on rats which might have been mediated via PPAR mechanism.

AB  - Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) mediated down-regulation of CDKN2A/p16 has been observed in cell lines as well as in a few carcinomas. However, there is no study correlating EZH2 expression with CDKN2A/p16 status in gliomas. Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate EZH2 expression in astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors and correlate with CDKN2A/p16 status as well as MIB-1 labeling index (LI). Gliomas of all grades (n=118) were studied using immunohistochemistry to assess EZH2, p16 and MIB-1 LI and fluorescence in situ hybrization to evaluate CDKN2A gene status. EZH2 expression and CDKN2A homozygous deletion (HD) were both significantly more frequent in high-grade gliomas (HGG). Further, strong EZH2 expression (LI25%) was significantly more common in HGGs without CDKN2A HD (48.7%; 19/39) as compared to cases with deletion (15.8%; 3/19). Loss of p16 expression was noted in 100% and 51.3% of CDKN2A deleted and non-deleted tumors, respectively. Notably, 80% (16/20) of the CDKN2A non-deleted HGGs with p16 loss had strong EZH2 expression, in contrast to only 15.8% (3/19) in the deleted group. Loss of p16 expression significantly correlated with MIB-1 LI, irrespective of EZH2 status. Thus, this study shows that EZH2 expression correlates with tumor grade in both astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors and hence can be used as a diagnostic marker to differentiate between low and HGGs. Further, this is the first report demonstrating an inverse correlation of strong EZH2 expression with CDKN2A HD in HGGs. Loss of p16 protein expression is mostly attributable to CDKN2A HD and correlates significantly with MIB-1 LI. Notably, our study for the first time suggests a possible epigenetic mechanism of p16 loss in CDKN2A non-deleted HGGs mediated by strong EZH2 expression. A hypothetical model for control of proliferative activity in low versus HGGs is therefore proposed.

AB  - Introduction and Materials and Methods: Early diagnosis of sepsis is extremely important to reduce high mortality and morbidity. In this study, clinical usefulness of the volume, conductivity and scatter parameters (mean channels of cell volume, conductivity, and light scatter) in neutrophils was analyzed for predicting acute bacterial infection, which are obtained by the Coulter LH 750 Hematology Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) during automated differential counts. Results: Peripheral blood samples from 162 patients with positive blood cultures for bacteria and 40 healthy controls were studied. We observed a significant increase in the mean channel of neutrophil volume (MNV) from septic patients compared with control subjects (156 +/- 13.5 vs. 143 +/- 4.8; P < 001). Discussion and Conclusion: An elevation of the MNV was associated with a higher white blood cell count and percentage of neutrophils and was present even in patients who did not have leukocytosis or neutrophilia. With a cut-off of 149 for the MNV, a specificity of 91.4% and sensitivity of 88.7% were achieved. As a quantitative, objective, and more sensitive parameter, we propose that the MNV has a potential to be an additional indicator for acute bacterial infection.

AB  - Yersinia pestis, a causative agent of plague, has a plethora of armors to fight against major components of innate immunity and survive within host cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages are important antigen presenting cells for effective immune response. This report is focused on the changes in DC activation and TLR2 and TLR4 expression on macrophages induced by MAP of F1 and V antigens of Y pestis. F1 and V MAPs bear potential synthetic T and B cell epitopes from F1 and V protein respectively. We evaluated these parameters in DC's isolated from spleen and lamina propria and macrophages isolated from peritoneal lavage of mice after intranasal immunization. F1 MAP and V MAP significantly increased the expression of CD80 and CD86 on CD11c(+) dendritic cells isolated from spleen and lamina propria as well as intracellular IL-12 levels. Similarly, in macrophages derived from peritoneal cavity, the above formulation enhanced TLR2 and TLR4 expression. Again after in vitro stimulation with F1 and V MAP these macrophages produced significantly high IL12 and TNF alpha. The study clearly indicates involvement of DC and macrophages for efficient antigen presentation to immune cells. From this study we conclude that F1 MAP and VMAP ameliorate innate immune mechanism. These two synthetic constructs exert their effect via TLR2 and TLR4, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages and are able to increase DC activation, that could be helpful in generation of adaptive immunity as well as is important strong immune response.

AB  - CONTEXT AND AIM: The prognosis of primary gliosarcoma (PGS) remains dismal with current treatment modalities. We analyzed the outcome of PGS patients treated with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective single institutional analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 27 patients of PGS treated with radiotherapy (RT) and TMZ during 2007-2012. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the use of Kaplan Meier method and toxicities were evaluate using common terminology criteria for adverse events version 2.0 (National Cancer Institute, USA). RESULTS: Median age at presentation and Karnofsky performance status was 45 years and 90 respectively and male: female ratio was 20: 7. Patients received adjuvant RT to a total dose of 60 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction. All patients except 5 received adjuvant TMZ to a median number of 6 cycles. Grade 2 and 3 hematological toxicity was seen in 8% and 4% of patients respectively during concurrent RT. During adjuvant chemotherapy, 13.6% had Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and 9.5% had Grade 3 neutropenia. Median OS was 16.7 months (1 year and 2 year actuarial OS was 70.8% and 32.6% respectively). Adjuvant TMZ was associated with a better survival (median survival 21.21 vs. 11.93 months; P = 0.0046) on univariate analysis and also on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.82, 95% confidence interval: 1.503-25.58; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study, largest series of patients with PGS treated with concurrent and adjuvant TMZ shows an impressive survival with acceptable toxicity. We suggest TMZ be included in the "standard of care" for this tumor.

AB  - Introduction: Sepsis is common presenting illness to the emergency services and one of the leading causes of hospital mortality. Researchers and clinicians have realized that the systemic inflammatory response syndrome concept for defining sepsis is less useful and lacks specificity. The predisposition, infection (or insult), response and organ dysfunction (PIRO) staging of sepsis similar to malignant diseases (TNM staging) might give better information. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in emergency medical services attached to medicine department of a tertiary care hospital in Northern India. Patients with age 18 years or more with proven sepsis were included in the first 24 hours of the diagnosis. Two hundred patients were recruited. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to assess the factors that predicted in-hospital mortality. Results: Two hundred patients with proven sepsis, admitted to the emergency medical services were analysed. Male preponderance was noted (M: F ratio = 1.6:1). Mean age of study cohort was 50.50 16.30 years. Out of 200 patients, 116 (58%) had in-hospital mortality. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality for predisposition component of PIRO staging were age > 70 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, cancer and presence of foleys catheter; for infection/ insult were pneumonia, urinary tract infection and meningitis/encephalitis; for response variable were tachypnea (respiratory rate > 20/minute) and bandemia (band > 5%). Organ dysfunction variables associated with hospital mortality were systolic blood pressure < 90mm Hg, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, raised serum creatinine, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/ fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) ratio < 300, decreased urine output in first two hours of emergency presentation and Glasgow coma scale %9. Each of the components of PIRO had good predictive capability for in-hospital mortality but the total score was more accurate than the individual score and increasing PIRO score was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for cumulative PIRO staging system as a predictor of in-hospital mortality was 0.94. Conclusion: This study finds PIRO staging as an important tool to stratify and prognosticate hospitalised patients with sepsis at a tertiary care center. The simplicity of score makes it more practical to be used in busy emergencies as it is based on four easily assessable components.

AB  - Context Vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent throughout the world. Pregnant women, neonates and infants form most vulnerable groups for vitamin D deficiency.
   Objective (1) To find prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women. (2) To evaluate the effect of supplementation with cholecalciferol in improving vitamin D levels in pregnant women and evaluate its correlation with feto-maternal outcome.
   Design Randomized control trial from years 2010 to 2012.
   Setting Tertiary care centre, Delhi, India.
   Participants One-hundred and eighty pregnant women. Study population divided randomly into two groups: group A: nonintervention (60 women) and group B: intervention (120 women).
   Intervention The intervention group received supplementation of vitamin D in dosages depending upon 25(OH)-D levels.
   Main outcome measures Risk of maternal complications such as preterm labour, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes associated with vitamin D deficiency and risk of low birthweight and poor Apgar score in infants of mothers with vitamin D deficiency.
   Results Adjusted serum 25(OH)-D concentration was lower in group A as compared to group B (mean 46.11 +/- 74.21 nmol/l vs 80.51 +/- 53 nmol/l). Forty-four percent patients in group A and 20.3% patients in group B developed preterm labour/preeclampsia/gestational diabetes. Newborns of mothers in group A had lower cord blood levels of 25(OH)-D levels as compared to group B (mean 43.11 +/- 81.32 nmol/l vs 56.8 +/- 47.52 nmol/l). They also had lower birthweight of mean 2.4 +/- 0.38 kg as compared to group B 2.6 +/- 0.33 kg.
   Conclusions Vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of maternal comorbidities and helps improve neonatal outcomes.

AB  - Coeliac disease is a global disease, and the only currently available treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although conceptually simple, the diet changes are substantial and have a profound effect on a patient's life. Untreated coeliac disease is associated with complications, including excess mortality, most of which can be avoided with a strict GFD. However, there are many barriers, including availability, cost and safety of gluten-free foods, and gluten cross-contamination. The GFD can be restrictive in social situations, leading to poor quality of life and, ultimately, nonadherence. As the number of patients with coeliac disease increases worldwide, clinicians need to be aware of the challenges patients face. Heightened awareness by physicians, dietitians and other providers can help maximize successful treatment, improve outcomes, and reduce health-care costs and disease burden. Routine follow-up is necessary to reinforce the need for a GFD, provide social and emotional support, and achieve mucosal healing, leading to reduced risk of complications. Unfortunately, there is wide variation in follow-up practices. The objective of this Review is to increase awareness of the challenges, management and follow-up of patients with coeliac disease to help them achieve GFD adherence and prevent complications whilst preserving their quality of life.

AB  - Phenotypic resistance to APC is a complex mechanism associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis in women with recurrent spontaneous abortions. The primary aim of this prospective case control study was to find out the frequencies of different congenital and acquired thrombophilic factors predisposing to APC resistance and to evaluate the strength of their association with recurrent pregnancy losses. FV Leiden accounted for around 40% of all APCR positive patients and the difference in the group frequencies compared with controls, was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.001). 18.33% (11/60) FV Leiden-negative APC-resistant patients had FVIII:c values exceeding 95th percentile of the control population (145 IU/dL), as compared to 3% in the control group (p = 0.001). Mean FVIII level in control subjects was 118 +/- 14.0 IU dL(-), compared with 127.7 +/- 31.2 IU dL(-) in the patient group (p = 0.009). Apart from FVIII, only the anti-phospholipid antibodies showed a statistically significant association with APCR phenotype (p = 0.028), unlike other thrombophilic factors such as Protein C, Protein S, FV levels, HR2 haplotype or other rarer FV variants. The strong positive association of FVL mutation, anti-phospholipid antibodies and elevated FVIII levels with APCR phenotype calls for incorporating them as first line investigations in patients with recurrent spontaneous miscarriages with APCR positivity.

AB  - Background and AimCeliac disease (CeD) is a common autoimmune disorder in which ingestion of gluten and related proteins leads to inflammation in the small intestine. Although the histological findings in CeD are characteristic, they are not specific. In this study, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the differences in metabolic profile of duodenal mucosal biopsies of patients with CeD and controls to find out the biomarker/s of villous atrophy.
   MethodsDuodenal mucosal biopsies were collected from 29 CeD patients (mean age 26.210.8 years) and 17 controls (mean age 34.111.1 years) and were subjected to proton NMR spectroscopy following perchloric acid extraction. Assignment of metabolite resonances was carried out and their concentrations were determined. For comparison between the groups unpaired t-test/Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis was performed to study the clustering behavior of the samples from CeD patients and controls using the Unscrambler 10.2 software.
   ResultsPartial least squares-discriminant analysis clearly differentiated CeD patients from controls. Significantly higher concentrations of isoleucine, leucine, aspartate, succinate, and pyruvate, and lower concentration of glycerophosphocholine, were observed in the duodenal mucosa of CeD patients compared with controls. The results suggest abnormalities in glycolysis, Krebs cycle (energy deficiency), and amino acid metabolism, which may affect the biosynthetic pathways and consequently contribute to villous atrophy.
   ConclusionsNMR spectroscopy with multivariate analysis of duodenal mucosal biopsies revealed a characteristic metabolic profile in CeD patients. The work provided an insight in determining biomarker/s for villous atrophy and diagnosis of CeD patients.

AB  - Chronic ventricular pacing is known to adversely affect left ventricular (LV) function. Studies comparing right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) pacing with RV apical (RVA) pacing have shown heterogeneous outcomes. Our aim was to objectively assess LV function and mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with RVOT and RVA pacing using equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA).
   Fifty-one patients who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation and had normal LV function were prospectively included. Twenty-nine patients had pacemaker lead implanted in the RVOT and 22 at the RVA site. All patients underwent ERNA within 5 days post-pacemaker implantation and follow-up studies at 6 and 12 months. Standard deviation of LV mean phase angle (SD LV mPA) expressed in degrees, which was derived by Fourier first harmonic analysis of phase images, was used to quantify left intraventricular dyssynchrony.
   No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to indication (P = .894), Type/mode (P = .985), and percentage of ventricular pacing (P = .352). Paced QRS duration was significantly longer in RVA group than RVOT group (P = .05). There was no statistically significant difference between the RVA and RVOT groups at baseline with respect to LVEF (P = .596) and SD LV mPA (P = .327). Within the RVA group, a significant decline in LVEF was observed over 12-month follow-up (from 57.3% +/- A 5.32% to 55.6% +/- A 6.25%; P = .012). In the RVOT group, the change in LVEF was not statistically significant (from 56.7% +/- A 4.08% to 54.3% +/- A 6.63%; P = .159). No significant change in SD LV mPA was observed over 12-month follow-up within the RVA group (from 10.5 +/- A 2.58A degrees to 10.4 +/- A 3.54A degrees; P = 1.000) as well as in the RVOT group (from 9.7 +/- A 3.28A degrees to 9.4 +/- A 2.85A degrees; P = .769). However, between the RVA and RVOT groups, no significant difference was observed at 12-month follow-up in terms of LVEF and dyssynchrony (LVEF P = .488; SD LV mPA P = .296).
   No significant difference was observed between RVOT and RVA groups with regard to LV function and synchrony over a 12-month follow-up. RVOT pacing offers may lead to better preservation of LV function on longer follow-up.

AB  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant epithelial neoplasm comprising mucous, intermediate and epidermoid cells, arising mainly in salivary gland. It is extremely uncommon in ocular region, where it can arise in conjunctiva, lacrimal gland or lacrimal sac. The index case is being presented for its rarity and for highlighting the importance of meticulous sampling for correct diagnosis. A 68-year-old female presented with complaints of ulceration over right lower eyelid for 3 years. She underwent a local surgical excision 2 years ago after which she was asymptomatic for the following 1 year. Histopathological examination of excised specimen showed features of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma in ocular adnexa may be difficult to differentiate from its close mimickers like basal, squamous, sebaceous cell carcinoma and apocrine carcinoma. Meticulous sampling, judicious use of special stains and immunohistochemistry are pivotal in establishing the diagnosis.

AB  - Due to lack of safe treatment and developing resistance to the available drugs for visceral leishmaniasis or Kala-azar - a fatal parasitic disease caused by Leishmania donovani - the search for drugs from natural resources is imperative. In the present study, the comparative in vitro anti-leishmanial activity of various fractions of Agave americana extracts has been evaluated. Extracts were prepared through successive solvent extraction through Soxhlet apparatus using benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol respectively. Among those extracts ethyl acetate fraction was capable of selectively inhibiting both stages of Leishmania donovani by generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Ethyl acetate fraction Agave americana showed significant antileishmanial activity (IC50 similar to 25 mu g/ml complete inhibition (IC90) at 50 mu g/ml. This observation emphasizes the need to extend studies related to traditional medicines from botanicals for better and safe alternatives to the available anti-leishmanials.

AB  - Red-free light allows better detection of vascular lesions as this wavelength is absorbed by hemoglobin; however, the current gold standard for the detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy remains 7-field color fundus photography. The goal of this study was to compare the ability of 7-field fundus photography using red-free light to detect retinopathy lesions with corresponding images captured using standard 7-field color photography. Non-stereoscopic standard 7-field 30A degrees digital color fundus photography and 7-field 30A degrees digital red-free fundus photography were performed in 200 eyes of 103 patients with various grades of diabetic retinopathy ranging from mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The color images (n = 1,400) were studied with corresponding red-free images (n = 1,400) by one retina consultant (PV) and two senior residents training in retina. The various retinal lesions [microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates, intra-retinal microvascular anomalies (IRMA), neovascularization of the retina elsewhere (NVE), and neovascularization of the disc (NVD)] detected by all three observers in each of the photographs were noted followed by determination of agreement scores using kappa values (range 0-1). Kappa coefficient was categorized as poor (a parts per thousand currency sign0), slight (0.01-0.20), fair (0.2 -0.40), moderate (0.41-0.60), substantial (0.61-0.80), and almost perfect (0.81-1). The number of lesions detected by red-free images alone was higher for all observers and all abnormalities except hard exudates. Detection of IRMA was especially higher for all observers with red-free images. Between image pairs, there was substantial agreement for detection of hard exudates (average kappa = 0.62, range 0.60-0.65) and moderate agreement for detection of hemorrhages (average kappa = 0.52, range 0.45-0.58), soft exudates (average kappa = 0.51, range 0.42-0.61), NVE (average kappa = 0.47, range 0.39-0.53), and NVD (average kappa = 0.51, range 0.45-0.54). Fair agreement was noted for detection of microaneurysms (average kappa = 0.29, range 0.20-0.39) and IRMA (average kappa = 0.23, range 0.23-0.24). Inter-observer agreement with color images was substantial for hemorrhages (average kappa = 0.72), soft exudates (average kappa = 0.65), and NVD (average kappa = 0.65); moderate for microaneurysms (average kappa = 0.42), NVE (average kappa = 0.44), and hard exudates (average kappa = 0.59) and fair for IRMA (average kappa = 0.21). Inter-observer agreement with red-free images was substantial for hard exudates (average kappa = 0.63) and moderate for detection of hemorrhages (average kappa = 0.56), SE (average kappa = 0.60), IRMA (average kappa = 0.50), NVE (average kappa = 0.44), and NVD (average kappa = 0.45). Digital red-free photography has a higher level of detection ability for all retinal lesions of diabetic retinopathy. More advanced grades of retinopathy are likely to be detected earlier with red-free imaging because of its better ability to detect IRMA, NVE, and NVD. Red-free monochromatic imaging of the retina is a more effective and less costly alternative for detection of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - Cone photoreceptors are required for color discrimination and high-resolution central vision and are lost in macular degenerations, cone and cone/rod dystrophies. Cone transplantation could represent a therapeutic solution. However, an abundant source of human cones remains difficult to obtain. Work performed in model organisms suggests that anterior neural cell fate is induced 'by default' if BMP, TGF beta and Wnt activities are blocked, and that photoreceptor genesis operates through an S-cone default pathway. We report here that Coco (Dand5), a member of the Cerberus gene family, is expressed in the developing and adult mouse retina. Upon exposure to recombinant COCO, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated into S-cone photoreceptors, developed an inner segment-like protrusion, and could degrade cGMP when exposed to light. Addition of thyroid hormone resulted in a transition from a unique S-cone population toward a mixed M/S-cone population. When cultured at confluence for a prolonged period of time, COCO-exposed hESCs spontaneously developed into a cellular sheet composed of polarized cone photoreceptors. COCO showed dose-dependent and synergistic activity with IGF1 at blocking BMP/TGF beta/Wnt signaling, while its cone-inducing activity was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by exposure to BMP, TGF beta or Wnt-related proteins. Our work thus provides a unique platform to produce human cones for developmental, biochemical and therapeutic studies and supports the hypothesis that photoreceptor differentiation operates through an S-cone default pathway during human retinal development.

AB  - The present study compares the serum cytokine levels between adolescent depression patients and healthy controls and assesses correlation between depression, anxiety scores and serum levels of eight cytokines. Study also checked the variation in serum levels with medication status (medication free/naive vs. patients on medication). Following clinical and psychometric assessment of 77 adolescent (aged 13 18 years) depression patients (49 males and 28 females; 56 medication free/naive) and 54 healthy controls (25 males, 29 females), eight cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta 1 and IL-17A {denoted IL-17 throughout}) were measured in serum using ELISA. Depressed adolescents had significantly high levels of IL-2 (p < 0.001) and IL-6 (p=0.03) as compared to controls. The female population skewed the result of one cytokine (IL-6) in patients. Anxiety scores showed positive correlation (only in female patients) with IL-1 beta, IL-10 and negative correlation with TGF-beta 1 and IL-17. The gender effect in relationship between anxiety and cytokines was not straightforward. On comparing study groups on the medication/naive status, IL-2 and TGF-beta 1 showed significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001, p=0.007 higher in medicated). Depression in adolescents was associated with elevation of proinflammatory serum cytokines with a gender bias for females. Anxiety scores correlated negatively with TGF-beta 1 and IL-17.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) in children is neglected, mainly due to lack of sensitive diagnostic tools. Recently Xpert MTB/RIF assay has revolutionized the diagnostic field, but its usefulness in pediatric TB has not been reported from India and no report is available on its use on long term archived samples.
   Methods: We recruited 130 pediatric patients with probable intrathoracic tuberculosis and their gastric aspirate (GA) and induced sputum (IS) samples on 2 consecutive days were collected between January 2009 and December 2012. All samples (n = 520) were subjected to smear examination, BACTEC-MGIT culture and in-house multiplex PCR. An aliquot of each sample was stored at -80 degrees C and tested in Xpert MTB/RIF assay in 2013.
   Results: Sample wise and patient wise detection rate of smear microscopy was 4.4 % and 10 %, while for BACTEC-MGIT culture this rate was 24.4 % and 46.9 %, respectively. Of the 130 day 1 GA samples, 31.5 % and 27.7 % day 2 GA samples were culture positive. Only 17.7 % GA samples were positive on both days. Of the 130 IS samples collected on day 1 and day 2, 15.4 % and 23.1 % samples were culture positive. A combination of GA and IS yielded best results. Combining both GA and IS, the overall sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF on smear and culture positive samples was 95.6 %. In smear negative and culture positive samples its sensitivity was 62.5 %. The duration of sample storage impacted the Xpert MTB/RIF test performance (p = 0.0001). In smear positive samples stored for 650-849 days, its sensitivity was 85.7 % and 77.1 % for IS and GA samples which dropped to 33.3 % and 50 %, respectively, if stored for more than 1050 days.
   Discussion: Confirmatory diagnosis of tuberculosis particularly in children is a medical challenge. No laboratory or radiological test can reach to a satisfactory level of diagnostic sensitivity. However, in this study we foundthat combination of multiple samples and multiple diagnostic tests can give much better yield, though notoptimum. In present study, combination of 2 gastric aspirates (GA) and 2 induced sputum (IS) samples collected on two consecutive days, and tested on three diagnostic methods yielded a significantly high detection rate. Despite long term storage, the overall sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF on smear and -culture positive samples remained very high. But after storing these samples under subfreezing conditions thesensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF decreased significantly. This is expected because even if the sample is smear and culture positive, the count of surviving mycobacteria goes down, after several years this count can reach to a undetectable level.
   Conclusion: This report shows that smear and culture positive samples stored at subfreezing conditions for several years can be used in the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, while maintaining appreciable diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Background Cardiopulmonary bypass initiates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Steroids suppress inflammatory responses and might improve outcomes in patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. We aimed to assess the effects of steroids in patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Methods The Steroids In caRdiac Surgery (SIRS) study is a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. We used a central computerised phone or interactive web system to randomly assign (1: 1) patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality from 80 hospital or cardiac surgery centres in 18 countries undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass to receive either methylprednisolone (250 mg at anaesthetic induction and 250 mg at initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) or placebo. Patients were assigned with block randomisation with random block sizes of 2, 4, or 6 and stratified by centre. Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if they had a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation of at least 6. Patients were excluded if they were taking or expected to receive systemic steroids in the immediate postoperative period or had a history of bacterial or fungal infection in the preceding 30 days. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and a composite of death and major morbidity (ie, myocardial injury, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure) within 30 days, both analysed by intention to treat. Safety outcomes were also analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00427388.
   Findings Patients were recruited between June 21, 2007, and Dec 19, 2013. Complete 30-day data was available for all 7507 patients randomly assigned to methylprednisolone (n= 3755) and to placebo (n= 3752). Methylprednisolone, compared with placebo, did not reduce the risk of death at 30 days (154 [4%] vs 177 [5%] patients; relative risk [RR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.70-1.07, p= 0.19) or the risk of death or major morbidity (909 [24%] vs 885 [24%]; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95-1.11, p= 0.52). The most common safety outcomes in the methylprednisolone and placebo group were infection (465 [12%] vs 493 [13%]), surgical site infection (151 [4%] vs 151 [4%]), and delirium (295 [8%] vs 289 [8%]).
   Interpretation Methylprednisolone did not have a significant effect on mortality or major morbidity after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The SIRS trial does not support the routine use of methylprednisolone for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

AB  - The ability to identify key biomolecules and molecular changes associated with cancer malignancy and the capacity to monitor the therapeutic outcome against these targets is critically important for cancer treatment. Recent developments in molecular imaging based on magnetic resonance (MR) techniques have provided researchers and clinicians with new tools to improve most facets of cancer care. Molecular imaging is broadly described as imaging techniques used to detect molecular signature at the cellular and gene expression levels. This article reviews both established and emerging molecular MR techniques in oncology and discusses the potential of these techniques in improving the clinical cancer care. It also discusses how molecular MR, in conjunction with other structural and functional MR imaging techniques, paves the way for developing tailored treatment strategies to enhance cancer care.

AB  - Background
   The monkey malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi also infect humans. There is a lack of information on the molecular mechanisms that take place between this simian parasite and its heterologous human host erythrocytes leading to this zoonotic disease. Therefore, we investigated here the binding ability of P. knowlesi tryptophan-rich antigens (PkTRAgs) to the human erythrocytes and sharing of the erythrocyte receptors between them as well as with other commonly occurring human malaria parasites.
   Methods
   Six PkTRAgs were cloned and expressed in E.coli as well as in mammalian CHO-K1 cell to determine their human erythrocyte binding activity by cell-ELISA, and in-vitro rosetting assay, respectively.
   Results
   Three of six PkTRAgs (PkTRAg38.3, PkTRAg40.1, and PkTRAg67.1) showed binding to human erythrocytes. Two of them(PkTRAg40.1 and PkTRAg38.3) showed cross-competition with each other as well as with the previously described P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens (PvTRAgs) for human erythrocyte receptors. However, the third protein (PkTRAg67.1) utilized the additional but different human erythrocyte receptor(s) as it did not cross-compete for erythrocyte binding with either of these two PkTRAgs as well as with any of the PvTRAgs. These three PkTRAgs also inhibited the P. falciparum parasite growth in in-vitro culture, further indicating the sharing of human erythrocyte receptors by these parasite species and the biological significance of this receptor-ligand interaction between heterologous host and simian parasite.
   Conclusions
   Recognition and sharing of human erythrocyte receptor(s) by PkTRAgs with human parasite ligands could be part of the strategy adopted by the monkey malaria parasite to establish inside the heterologous human host.

AB  - Background: High prevalence of reproductive morbidities is seen among adolescents in India. Health workers play an important role in providing health services in the community, including the adolescent reproductive health services. A study was done to assess the feasibility of training female health workers (FHWs) in the classification and management of selected adolescent girls' reproductive health problems according to modified WHO algorithms.
   Methods: The study was conducted between Jan-Sept 2011 in Northern India. Thirteen FHWs were trained regarding adolescent girls' reproductive health as per WHO Adolescent Job-Aid booklet. A pre and post-test assessment of the knowledge of the FHWs was carried out. All FHWs were given five modified WHO algorithms to classify and manage common reproductive morbidities among adolescent girls. All the FHWs applied the algorithms on at least ten adolescent girls at their respective sub-centres. Simultaneously, a medical doctor independently applied the same algorithms in all girls. Classification of the condition was followed by relevant management and advice provided in the algorithm. Focus group discussion with the FHWs was carried out to receive their feedback.
   Results: After training the median score of the FHWs increased from 19.2 to 25.2 (p = 0.0071). Out of 144 girls examined by the FHWs 108 were classified as true positives and 30 as true negatives and agreement as measured by kappa was 0.7 (0.5-0.9). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 94.3 % (88.2-97.4), 78.9 % (63.6-88.9), 92.5 % (86.0-96.2), and 83.3 % (68.1-92.1) respectively.
   Discussion: A consistent and significant difference between pre and post training knowledge scores of the FHWs were observed and hence it was possible to use the modified Job Aid algorithms with ease. Limitation of this study was the munber of FHWs trained was small. Issues such as time management during routine work, timing of training, overhead cost of training etc were not taken into account.
   Conclusions: Training was successful in increasing the knowledge of the FHWs about adolescent girls' reproductive health issues. The FHWs were able to satisfactorily classify the common adolescent girls' problems using the modified WHO algorithms.

AB  - Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a rare malignant neoplasm arising from the olfactory neuroepithelium. ENB constitutes only 3% of all malignant intranasal neoplasm. Because of the rarity, the number of patients of ENB treated in individual departments is small. Most of these patients presents in locally advanced stages and require multimodality treatment in form of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Multimodality approach with a risk-adapted strategy is required to achieve good control rates while minimizing treatment related toxicity.

AB  - The number of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) has increased markedly over the past few decades as a result of astounding successes in pediatric cardiac care. Nevertheless, it is now well understood that CHD is not cured but palliated, such that life-long expert care is required to optimize outcomes. All countries in the world that experience improved survival in CHD must face new challenges inherent to the emergence of a growing and aging CHD population with changing needs and medical and psychosocial issues. Founded in 1992, the International Society for Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ISACHD) is the leading global organization of professionals dedicated to pursuing excellence in the care of adults with CHD worldwide. Recognizing the unique and varied issues involved in caring for adults with CHD, ISACHD established a task force to assess the current status of care for adults with CHD across the globe, highlight major challenges and priorities, and provide future direction. The writing committee consisted of experts from North America, South America, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. The committee was divided into subgroups to review key aspects of adult CHD (ACHD) care. Regional representatives were tasked with investigating and reporting on relevant local issues as accurately as possible, within the constraints of available data. The resulting ISACHD position statement addresses changing patterns of worldwide epidemiology, models of care and organization of care, education and training, and the global research landscape in ACHD.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD), a complex metabolic disorder, is one of the largest causes of death worldwide. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of this metabolic disease. The gene environment interaction could lead to modulation of various metabolic pathways resulting in altered levels of various metabolites. Thus, identifying metabolites could aid in deciphering pathways that could be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. With the advent of high resolution mass spectrometry based methodologies, it is now possible to screen thousands of metabolites in a single snapshot thus, allowing the identification of potential disease metabolite markers. In this work, using an untargeted metabolomic approach, we attempted to identify metabolites that have altered levels in CAD patients. Using reverse phase and HILIC based chromatography followed by mass spectrometry we identified a total of 32 metabolites (2 fold; p < 0.05) in plasma whose levels were significantly altered in CAD samples. Further, we have validated the discriminative ability of these metabolites in an independent set of CAD and control samples using multivariate PLS-DA analysis. Interestingly, Lyso PC (18:0), Cortisol, Lyso PC (P-17:0), and glycerophosphocholine were among the top discriminators for CAD which implies involvement of phosphatidylcholine pathway in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
   Biological significance
   Herein, we report that an unbiased metabolomic study has the potential to identify newer markers which are involved in several important biological pathways like lipid metabolism, phosphatidylcholine pathway etc. which in turn are implicated in CAD. These markers could be of potential clinical importance for screening subjects at risk of CAD.

AB  - Cardiac autonomic dysfunction is an independent determinant of adverse outcomes in many diseases. The available literature on the relative changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic components in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is equivocal, the clinical and physiological correlates are poorly defined and association with markers of systemic inflammation has not been explored. As both autonomic dysfunction and systemic inflammation may contribute to cardiovascular morbidity in COPD, we hypothesized that these may be associated. Sixty three stable patients of COPD and 36 controls underwent spirometry, estimation of diffusion capacity, six-minute walk test and measurements of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-Reactive protein. Cardiac autonomic activity was evaluated by standard five-minute heart rate variability (HRV) recordings to obtain time- and frequency-domain indices and the averaged heart rate. We observed that HRV indices of overall autonomic modulation, the standard deviation of time intervals between consecutive normal beats (SDNN) and total power, were greater in patients with higher levels of indices of both parasympathetic and sympathetic activity. The heart rate was significantly higher in patients indicating an overall sympathetic dominance and was inversely correlated with diffusion capacity. Serum IL-6 was inversely correlated with pNN50, an index of parasympathetic activity, and positively with LF/HF ratio, a measure of sympathetic: parasympathetic balance. None of the HRV indices was significantly correlated with physiological measures of severity. It was concluded that patients with COPD have increased cardiac autonomic modulation with sympathetic dominance. This is associated with decreased lung diffusion capacity and systemic inflammation.

AB  - Traditional knowledge and nutritional value of indigenous foods of the Oraon tribal community in Jharkhand, India was explored. Focus group discussions were conducted with adult members to identify commonly consumed indigenous foods. Taxonomic classification and quantitative estimation of nutritive value were conducted in laboratories or utilized data from Indian food composition database. More than 130 varieties of indigenous foods were identified, many of which were rich sources of micronutrients like calcium, iron, vitamin A, and folic acid. Some were reported having medicinal properties. Utilization and ease of assimilation of indigenous foods into routine diets can be leveraged to address malnutrition in tribal communities.

AB  - Subfertility is one of the most common problems observed among Taurine x Indicine crossbred bulls in tropical countries; however, the etiology remain unknown in most of the cases. In present study, we compared the proteomic profile of spermatozoa from crossbred bulls (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) against their purebred parent lines (Holstein Friesian [Taurine] and Tharparkar [Indicine]) to find out alteration in expressions of proteins, if any. The proteomic profiles of freshly ejaculated spermatozoa from these breeds were compared by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, and differentially expressed proteins were identified through mass spectrometry. It was observed that compared to Holstein Friesian, nine proteins were underexpressed and eight proteins were overexpressed (P < 0.05) in the spermatozoa of crossbred bulls. Similarly, four proteins were overexpressed and four proteins were underexpressed (P < 0.05) in the spermatozoa of crossbred bulls compared to Tharparkar bulls. In concurrent three breed comparison, 14 proteins were found to be differentially expressed (P < 0.05) between these breeds. From the findings of the study, it is apparent that the expression levels of several functionally significant proteins are either upregulated or downregulated in spermatozoa of crossbred bulls, which might be related to high incidence of subfertility in these bulls.

AB  - AimTo analyze clinicopathological characteristics of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and to evaluate long-term outcome of these patients presented to single tertiary care center in India.
   MethodsWe evaluated outcomes of 480 patients (age 8-60 years), classified into good, intermediate and poor risk according to cytogenetic results. Standard 3+7 induction therapy with dose of daunorubicin ranging from 45 to 90mg/m(2) followed by two to three courses of high-dose cytarabine (12-18g/m(2)) as consolidation therapy was given to majority.
   ResultsThe complete remission rate of the treated population (407 patients) was 70% with 84.8% in good risk, 67.9% in intermediate risk and 54.2% in poor risk (P=0.0001). Induction mortality was 18.4%. One hundred twenty-nine patients relapsed with median treatment free interval of 10.4 months. At a median follow-up of 34.5 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 20.6 months with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 35.5%. No difference was found in OS between the three risk groups; however, patients with intermediate risk had a better leukemia-free survival (LFS) in comparison to good risk. Multivariate analysis showed age, performance status, treatment completion and hematopoietic stem cell transplant affecting OS, while only treatment completion affected LFS.
   ConclusionThis is one of the largest single-center studies reflecting more accurately the outcome of AML in India. These results are likely due to uniform treatment protocols, intensification of induction and post-remission treatments with comprehensive supportive care.

AB  - Background. Data regarding occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) and its effect on quality of life (QOL) in India are limited.
   Objectives/aims. To evaluate patients with OCD and record the outcome of treatment.
   Patients/materials/methods. All patients with OCD were evaluated for severity of disease (by the use of physician global assessment) and its effect on QOL (by use of the Dermatology Life Quality Index) questionnaire) at the first visit and after 3 months of treatment.
   Results. Among 117 patients with OCD, hand eczema was present in 81.2%. Positive patch test reactions were found in 76%. The most common allergens were Parthenium hysterophorus and potassium dichromate. The most frequent diagnosis was occupational allergic contact dermatitis (OACD) (57%), caused by farming and construction work, followed by occupational irritant contact dermatitis (OICD) (24%), caused by wet work. Severe psychosocial distress was recorded in 62.5% of patients. After 3 months of treatment, 83% improved significantly, and 54% had improvement in QOL.
   Conclusions. Farmers were most frequently affected, followed by construction workers and housewives. OACD was found at a higher frequency than OICD. The most frequent allergens were Parthenium hysterophorus in farmers, potassium dichromate in construction workers, and vegetables in housewives. OCD has a significant impact on QOL. Patch testing, in addition to standard treatment, improves the outcome considerably.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with a complex pathophysiology. Considered a rare disease in India in the past, studies over time suggest an increase in subjects with MS in India, although the observations are limited by the lack of formally conducted epidemiological studies and the absence of a nationwide registry. The current World Health Organization (WHO) Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) "Atlas of MS" 2013 estimates a prevalence rate of 5-20 per 100,000, which also seems an underestimate. Although there have been reports of phenotypic differences between MS in Indians and the Western counterparts, recent studies report a reasonable similarity in disease types and characteristics. A few studies on the genetics of MS have been reported, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations and non-major histopathology complex (MHC) disease loci. The current review discusses the pivotal studies of the past, newer observations on MS from India, and the need for a national registry.

AB  - Accurate localization of the "epileptogenic zone (EZ)" is an important issue in epilepsy surgery. The EZ is not discrete and focal; in fact, the epileptogenic networks can spread ictal activity to different regions of the brain. Changes in network characteristics and functional connectivity are shown to be associated with epilepsy. Seizures are thought to represent a hyper-synchronous state and presumable changes in synchronization between different brain regions underlie the mechanisms of seizure spread. Although presurgical evaluation of the epileptogenic network analysis can be carried out using existing investigative techniques like electroencephalogram (EEG), video-EEG, magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, and magnetoencephalography, advanced imaging techniques such as optical intrinsic spectroscopy, auto-fluorescence imaging, voltage sensitive dye imaging, and calcium imaging have the advantage of better spatiotemporal resolution over a large area of cortex. Understanding the wide-scale dynamic networks by analyzing the changes in the synchronization patterns using advanced imaging techniques will be instrumental in the presurgical analysis of the epileptogenic network and better localization of the EZs in the future.

   Objective. To evaluate outcomes of surgical decompression for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) at a global level.
   Summary of Background Data. CSM is a degenerative spine disease and the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction worldwide. Surgery is increasingly recommended as the preferred treatment strategy for CSM to improve neurological and functional status and quality of life. The outcomes of surgical intervention for CSM have never been evaluated at an international level.
   Methods. Between October 2007 and January 2011, 479 symptomatic patients with image evidence of CSM were enrolled in the prospective, multicenter AOSpine CSM-International study from 16 global sites. Preoperative and postoperative clinical status, functional impairment, and quality of life were evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Assessment Scale, Nurick Scale, Neck Disability Index, and Short-Form-36v2. Preoperative and 12- and 24-month postoperative outcomes were compared using mixed-model analysis of covariance for repeated measurements.
   Results. The study cohort consisted of 310 males and 169 females, with a mean age of 56.37 11.91 years. There were significant differences in age, etiology, and surgical approaches between the regions. At 24 months postoperatively, the mean modified Japanese Orthopaedic Assessment Scale score improved from 12.50 (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.24-12.76) to 14.90 (95% CI, 14.64-15.16); the Neck Disability Index improved from 36.38 (95% CI, 34.33-38.43) to 23.20 (95% CI, 21.24-25.15); and the SF36v2 Physical Component Score and Mental Composite Score improved from 34.28 (95% CI, 33.46-35.10) to 40.76 (95% CI, 39.71-41.81) and 39.45 (95% CI, 38.25-40.64) to 46.24 (95% CI, 44.94-47.55), respectively. The rate of neurological complications was 3.13%.
   Conclusion. Surgical decompression for CSM is safe and results in improved functional status and quality of life in patients around the world, irrespective of differences in medical systems and sociocultural determinants of health. Level of Evidence: 3

AB  - Objective
   Clinical studies of patients with bone sarcomas have been challenged by insufficient numbers at individual centres to draw valid conclusions. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether a five-day regimen of post-operative antibiotics, in comparison to a 24-hour regimen, decreases surgical site infections in patients undergoing endoprosthetic reconstruction for lower extremity primary bone tumours.
   Methods
   We performed a pilot international multi-centre RCT. We used central randomisation to conceal treatment allocation and sham antibiotics to blind participants, surgeons, and data collectors. We determined feasibility by measuring patient enrolment, completeness of follow-up, and protocol deviations for the antibiotic regimens.
   Results
   We screened 96 patients and enrolled 60 participants (44 men and 16 women) across 21 sites from four countries over 24 months (mean 2.13 participants per site per year, standard deviation 2.14). One participant was lost to follow-up and one withdrew consent. Complete data were obtained for 98% of eligible patients at two weeks, 83% at six months, and 73% at one year (the remainder with partial data or pending queries). In total, 18 participants missed at least one dose of antibiotics or placebo post-operatively, but 93% of all postoperative doses were administered per protocol.
   Conclusions
   It is feasible to conduct a definitive multi-centre RCT of post-operative antibiotic regimens in patients with bone sarcomas, but further expansion of our collaborative network will be critical. We have demonstrated an ability to coordinate in multiple countries, enrol participants, maintain protocol adherence, and minimise losses to follow-up.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of non-anesthesia provider (NAAP)-administered propofol sedation for advanced endoscopic procedures with those of anesthesia provider (AAP).
   PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for prospective observational trials involving advanced endoscopic procedures. From a total of 519 publications, 26 were identified to meet inclusion criteria (10 AAPs and 16 NAAPs) and were analyzed. Data were analyzed for hypoxia rate, airway intervention rates, endoscopist, and patient satisfaction scores and total propofol administered.
   Total number of procedures in NAAP and AAP groups was 3018 and 2374, respectively. Pooled hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than 90 %) rates were 0.133 (95 % CI 0.117-0.152) and 0.143 (95 % CI 0.128-0.159) in NAAP and AAP, respectively. Similarly, pooled airway intervention rates were 0.035 (95 % CI 0.026-0.047) and 0.133 (95 % CI 0.118-0.150), respectively. Pooled patient satisfaction rate, pooled endoscopist satisfaction rate, and mean propofol administered dose for NAAP were 7.22 (95 % CI 7.17-7.27), 6.03 (95 % CI 5.94-6.11), and 251.44 mg (95 % CI 244.39-258.49) in that order compared with 9.82 (95 % CI 9.76-9.88), 9.06 (95 % CI 8.91-9.21), and 340.32 mg (95 % CI 327.30-353.33) for AAP.
   The safety of NAAP sedation compared favorably with AAP sedation in patients undergoing advanced endoscopic procedures. However, it came at the cost of decreased patient and endoscopist satisfaction.

AB  - Objective: This is a retrospective chart review of consecutive children with acquired demyelinating disorders presenting to a north Indian tertiary care hospital over 4 years. The aim of this review is to describe all the patients (with single event as well as those with recurrences) with detailed description of those who recurred. Materials and Methods: Overall 35 cases were reviewed and their clinical presentations, diagnosis, management, and follow-up are being presented. Results: Out of 35 cases, 24 did not show any recurrences (seven acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and 17 clinically isolated syndromes). Amongst the 11 patients with recurrent demyelination, majority were multiple sclerosis (8/11, 72.7%) followed by neuromyelitis optica (NMO; 2/11), and multiphasic ADEM (1/11). The median disease duration and follow-up since onset for those with recurrent episodes is 4 years (2.5-4.5 years). Steroids caused significant improvement in acute episodes of demyelination. However, recurrent demyelinating disorders like multiple sclerosis and NMO required long-term immunomodulation. Azathioprine currently is the most favored long-term immunomodulator used in NMO. Interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate are currently recommended for multiple sclerosis. However, azathioprine may be a suitable alternative in a resource-limited setting. Conclusion: The consensus definitions for these groups of disorders need further validation in the pediatric age group. Studies with larger population size are required to characterize features that predict future recurrences.

AB  - The introduction of biologic therapy has revolutionized the treatment of many chronic diseases, including several dermatological disorders. Biological agents promise to satisfy medical needs previously unmet by conventional medicines. Unfortunately, these agents are expensive and out of reach for the majority of patients who need them. Biosimilars are copies of the innovator biological agents and represent an important advance in the field of biological therapeutics. Although they are similar to the original biologic, differences in terms of structure, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity remain a concern. Thus, biosimilars cannot be regarded as bio-generics. Awareness of the key differences between a biosimilar and its reference biological agent is essential for optimal treatment and safety of patients. The increasing availability of biosimilars provides patients and doctors with less expensive alternatives and increases the accessibility of biologic therapy to needy patients. In this review, we discuss the concept of biosimilars, the need for appropriate regulatory pathways and their current status in dermatology.

AB  - In dialyzed patients, preservation of residual renal function is associated with better survival, lower morbidity, and greater quality of life. To analyze the evolution of residual diuresis over time, we prospectively monitored urine output in 401 pediatric patients in the global IPPN registry who commenced peritoneal dialysis (PD) with significant residual renal function. Associations of patient characteristics and time-variant covariates with daily urine output and the risk of developing oligoanuria (under 100 ml/m(2)/day) were analyzed by mixed linear modeling and Cox regression analysis including time-varying covariates. With an average loss of daily urine volume of 130 ml/m(2) per year, median time to oligoanuria was 48 months. Residual diuresis significantly subsided more rapidly in children with glomerulopathies, lower diuresis at start of PD, high ultrafiltration volume, and icodextrin use. Administration of diuretics significantly reduced oligoanuria risk, whereas the prescription of renin-angiotensin system antagonists significantly increased the risk oligoanuria. Urine output on PD was significantly associated in a negative manner with glomerulopathies (-584 ml/m(2)) and marginally with the use of icodextrin (-179 ml/m(2)) but positively associated with the use of biocompatible PD fluid (+111 ml/m(2)). Children in both Asia and North America had consistently lower urine output compared with those in Europe perhaps due to regional variances in therapy. Thus, in children undergoing PD, residual renal function depends strongly on the cause of underlying kidney disease and may be modifiable by diuretic therapy, peritoneal ultrafiltration, and choice of PD fluid.

AB  - Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term visual outcomes in patients with aniridic glaucoma.Design:Retrospective noncomparative observational case series.Materials and Methods:A review of medical records of 128 eyes of 64 consecutive patients with aniridic glaucoma, diagnosed after the age of 5 years was analyzed. The parameters studied included age at presentation, family history, baseline intraocular pressure (IOP), type and the number of surgical interventions, and associated comorbidities.Primary Outcome Measure:Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the better eye.Results:Mean age at presentation was 15.8610.11 years (range, 5 to 47 y). The average follow-up was 7.69 +/- 4.98 years (range, 1 to 17 y). At the final follow up only 18 patients had BCVA better than 6\60 and only 5 patients had BCVA of >6/18. Seventeen of the 64 (26.5%) patients developed phthisis in 1 eye. The final visual outcomes were not associated with age at presentation (P=0.64) or sex (P=0.76); however, those with a higher baseline IOP (P=0.017), those with familial aniridia (P=0.037), and those who underwent more number of surgical interventions had poorer visual outcomes (P=0.004). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the probability of bilateral blindness to be 69.8% and 97.6% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.Conclusions:Long-term visual outcomes after therapy among aniridic glaucoma patients remain poor. Higher baseline IOP, the presence of familial aniridia, and a history of greater number of surgical interventions are associated with poorer long-term visual outcomes.

AB  - The objective of the study was to compare the effect of umbilical cord milking (UCM) and delayed cord clamping (DCC) on hematological parameters (serum ferritin and hemoglobin) at 6 weeks of life in term neonates. It was a randomized controlled trail conducted at a teaching hospital in North India during August 2012 to August 2013. Babies born at > 36 weeks of gestation were randomized in two groups, UCM and DCC (100 in each group). Umbilical cord milking was done after cutting and clamping the cord at 25 cm from the umbilicus. In DCC group, clamping was delayed by 60 to 90 s before cutting the cord. The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. Mean serum ferritin (134.0 ng/ml [89.8]) and mean hemoglobin (11.0 gm/dl [2.4]) in umbilical cord milking group was comparable to mean serum ferritin (142.7 ng/ml [87.1]) and hemoglobin (11.3 gm/dl [2.6]) in DCC group at 6 weeks of age. There was no difference in hemodynamic status, cranial Doppler indices, and adverse neonatal outcomes among the two groups.
   Conclusion: In term neonates, the DCC and UCM had comparable effect on hematological parameters at 6 weeks of life.

AB  - We aimed to assess the additional value of SPECT/CT over planar lymphoscintigraphy (PI) in sentinel node (SN) detection in malignancies with different lymphatic drainage such as breast cancer, melanoma, and pelvic tumors. Methods: From 2010 to 2013, 1,508 patients were recruited in a multicenter study: 1,182 breast cancer, 262 melanoma, and 64 pelvic malignancies (prostate, cervix, penis, vulva). PI was followed by SPECT/CT 1-3 h after injection of Tc-99m-colloid particles. Surgery was performed the same or next day. Results: Significantly more SNs were detected by SPECT/CT for breast cancer (2,165 vs. 1,892), melanoma (602 vs. 532), and pelvic cancer (195 vs. 138), all P < 0.001. The drainage basin mismatch between PI and SPECT/CT was 16.5% for breast cancer, 11.1% for melanoma, and 51.6% for pelvic cancers. Surgical adjustment was 17% for breast cancer, 37% for melanoma, and 65.6% for pelvic cancer. Conclusion: SPECT/CT detected more SNs and changed the drainage territory, leading to surgical adjustments in a considerable number of patients in all malignancies studied but especially in the pelvic cancer group because of this group's deep lymphatic drainage. We recommend SPECT/CT in all breast cancer patients with no SN visualized on PI, all patients with melanoma of the head and neck or trunk, all patients with pelvic malignancies, and those breast cancer and melanoma patients with unexpected drainage on PI.

AB  - Cystic neoplasms of the kidney are rare, and present a unique diagnostic challenge. We report the case of an elderly male who presented with a large cystic neoplasm, which was a diagnostic dilemma clinically and radiologically. Histopathological examination showed a tumour composed of variably sized tubules lined by atypical cells having large round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Hobnailing was seen at places. Tumour cells were immunopositive for pancytokeratin, vimentin, CD10, CK19 and AMACR, confirming a diagnosis of tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma (TC-RCC).

AB  - This aim of this study was to use ovarian cancer cells shed in ascitic fluid to establish primary cultures and subsequently use it to detect drug resistance to paclitaxel. Survivin siRNA was used to down regulate survivin expression and effect on paclitaxel resistance was also evaluated.
   Ascitic fluid along with corresponding primary tumor tissue was collected from twenty untreated epithelial ovarian cancer patients. Ten primary cultures were established from ascites obtained from untreated ovarian cancer patients in MCDB 105 and M199 medium (ratio 1:1). Knockdown of survivin was done using siRNA and sensitivity to paclitaxel was evaluated by MTT assay.
   Grape-like clusters of ovarian cancer cells present in ascites attached and gave a characteristic cobble stone appearance. Treatment with survivin siRNA resulted in a fivefold decrease in survivin expression in primary cultures. Survivin siRNA treatment significantly increased the sensitivity of the primary ovarian cancer cell cultures to paclitaxel.
   Ascitic cancer cells reflect the molecular profile of tumor and can be used to diagnose resistance to chemotherapy. This study also establishes that high survivin expression is also responsible for resistance to paclitaxel.

AB  - Background:To evaluate structural changes in the retina and correlate those with visual function measurements in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).Methods:A cross-sectional comparative study of 20 patients with PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls was conducted. Visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, pattern visual-evoked response (VER), and multifocal electroretinogram were recorded to determine functional change, whereas structural changes were evaluated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, macular thickness, macular volume, and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer complex (GCL-IPL) thickness using spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT).Results:PD patients ranged from Stage 1-3, with median Stage 2 (Hoehn and Yahr Classification) with mean Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III score of 19 10.42, and average disease duration of 5.8 +/- 2.78 years. Visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields were unaffected but contrast sensitivity was significantly worse than controls (P < 0.001). Multifocal electroretinogram values in the central 2 degrees field revealed decreased foveal electrical activity, with increased pattern VER amplitude and latency. Significant RNFL thinning was observed in the average RNFL (P = 0.033), superior (P = 0.018), and temporal (P = 0.036) quadrants. Significant ganglion cell layer loss was captured on SD-OCT with average, minimum GCL-IPL, and all 6 sectors showing thinning (P 0.003). The functional changes correlated significantly with structural changes, disease duration, and severity. There was no correlation between structural changes in the retina and disease duration or severity.Conclusions:Subclinical visual dysfunction was observed in patients with PD with good structural-functional correlation. GCL-IPL thinning may be a more reliable parameter than RNFL thickness for structural alterations of the retina in patients with PD.

TI  - Erythema nodosum leprosum on glans penis: unusual manifestation of common disease
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundErythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) classically presents as tender evanescent skin nodules involving extremities, trunk, and face but may appear at any site. Mucosal involvement in ENL is uncommon, and its occurrence over glans is extremely rare.
   MethodWe describe two interesting cases of ENL involving the glans penis and prepuce with different presentations.
   ResultThe first case had lepromatous leprosy with ENL with involvement of the glans penis in the form of a painful ulcer with necrotic slough. The second case had borderline lepromatous leprosy with ENL with involvement of glans in the form of a single painful nodule. Histopathology showed features of ENL, and Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed numerous acid fast bacilli.
   ConclusionWe should be aware of genital involvement of ENL, which is a rare presentation and needs to be differentiated from other conditions requiring a different management approach.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic residual haemothorax (RH) is common and carries significant morbidity. However, its optimal treatment is not clear.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to find the extent of this problem and the choice of treatment between VATS and intra-pleural streptokinase instillation (IPSI).
   Material and methods: This RCT, conducted over 18 months period, included all patients of chest trauma between 18 and 70 years of age, admitted with haemothorax or haemopneumothorax requiring intercostal drain (ICD) insertion. 154 events of haemothorax/haemopneumothorax requiring ICD insertion were enrolled. RH was seen in 48 (31%) patients: 13 patients were excluded from RCT after refusal for treatment. Seventeen (49%) patients of remaining 35 RH cases were randomized to IPSI group and 18 (51%) patients were randomized to VATS group. The outcome parameters were resolution of RH and treatment related complications.
   Results: RH resolved equally well in VATS and IPSI group [ 13 patients (72%) versus 12 patients (71%), respectively; continuity-adjusted p = 1]. Morbidity wise no difference (p-value 0.529) was seen in the two groups.
   Conclusion: Post-traumatic RH is seen in 1/3rd patients and is equally well treated by VATS and IPSI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. The duration of treatment of gastrointestinal tuberculosis continues to be a matter of debate. The World Health Organization advocates intermittent directly observed short-course therapy (DOTs), but there is a lack of data of its efficacy in abdominal tuberculosis. We therefore conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare 6 months and 9 months of antituberculosis therapy using DOTs.
   Methods. One hundred ninety-seven patients with abdominal tuberculosis (gastrointestinal, 154; peritoneal, 40; mixed, 3) were randomized to receive 6 months (n = 104) or 9 months (n = 93) of antituberculosis therapy using intermittent directly observed therapy. Patients were followed up 1 year after completion of treatment to assess recurrence. Patients were evaluated for primary endpoint (complete clinical response, partial response, and no response) and secondary endpoint (recurrence of the disease at the end of 1 year of follow-up).
   Results. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 randomized groups. There was no difference between the 6-month group and 9-month group in the complete clinical response rate on per-protocol analysis (91.5% vs 90.8%; P = .88) or intent-to-treat analysis (75% vs 75.8%; P = .89). Only 1 patient in the 9-month group and no patients in the 6-month group had recurrence of disease. Side effects occurred in 21 (21.3%) and 16 (18.2%) patients in the 6-month and 9-month groups, respectively.
   Conclusions. There was no difference in efficacy of antituberculosis therapy delivered for either 6 months or 9 months in either gastrointestinal or peritoneal tuberculosis, confirming the efficacy of intermittent directly observed therapy.

AB  - Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a rare and distinct clinicopathologic variant of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This study aims to evaluate the histomorphology, proliferative activity, level of angiogenesis, and DNA ploidy of these pathological entities. This was a retrospective-prospective study of 18 cases of verrucous hyperplasia (VH), 41 cases of VC, and 44 cases of SCC. Immunohistochemical analysis for Ki-67 (MIB-1) and CD34 were performed. The tumor proliferative index, endothelial proliferative index and microvascular density were calculated. DNA ploidy was determined using image cytometry. The age range and gender ratio were similar in all three groups. The differences in MIB-1 labeling index (p = 0.0001), microvascular density (p = 0.01), and endothelial proliferative index (p = 0.001) between VC and SCC were found to be statistically significant. A non-significant increasing trend was observed in all of these parameters between VH and VC. On ploidy analysis, 100 % of SCC cases were aneuploid, compared to 39 % of VH and 86 % of VC cases. Our study demonstrates a significant difference in tumor proliferation, microvessel density, and ploidy between VC and SCC while increasing trend between VH and VC. These parameters, along with morphological findings, may be useful in differentiating these entities in small mucosal biopsies.

KW  - PROPOSALS
AB  - Objectives: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) detection either by enzyme cytochemistry (cMPO) or flow cytometry (fMPO) plays a major role in acute leukaemia (AL) diagnosis as per World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification. Although 3% cMPO was recommended as positivity, no specific cut-off had been mentioned by WHO for fMPO. Various authors recommend different cut-offs ranging from 3 to 28% for fMPO. The aim of this study was to analyse fMPO cut-offs ranging from 3 to 10% in classifying AL and to assess whether a new cut-off could be suggested.
   Methods: Totally, 216 cases of AL were retrospectively analysed for fMPO ranging from 3 to 10% and compared with gold standard. Presence of cMPO (>= 3%) and/or expression of two or more pan-myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, and CD117) in the absence of CD19 and CD3 were kept as gold standard for diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
   Results: Sensitivities for classifying AL as AML/mixed phenotypic acute leukaemia (MPAL) at 3, 5.4, and 10% were 98.3, 98.3, and 96.6%, respectively, whereas specificities at this cut-off were 22.2, 91, and 71%, respectively. Discussion: Only few studies have been done in this aspect to define a consistent cut-off for fMPO for proper classification of acute leukaemias. This was one of the largest and few studies available till date in this regard.
   Conclusion: The newer cut-off for fMPO (5.4%) emerged out from our study with best sensitivity and specificity for accurately classifying AL cases into acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, AML, and MPAL.

AB  - Background: Fat mass (FM) has been shown to have an effect on bone mass accrual. Though gender and ethnic differences in body composition and bone accrual during puberty have been reported, there are limited data available for Indian children and adolescents.
   Objective: To generate age and gender based percentile charts of FM among urban Indian children and adolescents and to evaluate the relationship with pubertal status and bone mineral content (BMC).
   Subjects: There were 1403 children and adolescents (boys: 826; girls: 577) in the study.
   Methods: Total and regional FM, BMC, and pubertal staging were assessed. Fat mass index (FMI), FM/height ratio and BMC/FM ratio, were calculated.
   Results: The age of the study population ranged from 5 to 18 years, with a mean age of 13.2 +/- 2.7 years (boys: 13.0 +/- 2.7; girls: 13.4 +/- 2.8 years). Total and regional FM as well as FMI increased with increasing age in both genders. The highest percent increase in mean total FM occurred in the age group >8-11 years and decreased thereafter. The total and regional FM was higher in more advanced stages of pubertal maturation. There was no difference in total and regional FM between genders in prepubertal group. The age and pubertal associated increase in FM was significantly higher in girls than boys (p < 0.0001). Total as well as regional FM and FMI were positively correlated with age, body mass index, total lean mass, and BMC even after adjusting for age, lean mass, and biochemical parameters.
   Conclusions: Total and regional FM increased with age and pubertal maturation in both genders. FM was positively correlated with BMC.

AB  - Objective To find out various life stressors of adolescents, coping strategies adopted by them and the impact of stress on adolescent mental health.
   Methods A descriptive, cross sectional study was conducted in the schools in south zone of Delhi, capital city of the country. Data was collected on 360 adolescents between the age group of 13-17 y on socio-demographic profile, Adolescent Life Event Stress Scale, Brief Cope and Youth Self Report for ages 11-18 y.
   Results Stress related to uncontrollable events such as family events, relocation events, accident events, ambiguous events and controllable events such as sexual events, deviance events and autonomy events was significantly higher as compared to distressful events (p<0.0) such as death of a pet, arguments with friends, appearing for exams, failure or low grades. Adolescent stress was significantly correlated with various demographic variables in the study. The most frequently used coping strategies by the adolescents were positive reframing, planning, active coping, and instrumental support. It has also been found that stress has a significant impact on adolescent mental health in the form of either internalizing problems such as anxiety, withdrawal and somatic problems or externalizing problems such as rule breaking and aggressive behaviors.
   Conclusions A significant correlation was found between most of the stressful life event domains and the syndrome subscale of the youth self report form which indicate that out of the total sample of 360 adolescents 150 were identified as having psycho-social morbidity, including 59 borderline cases and 91 high-risk cases. The study pointed out the need for mental health screening among the adolescents and also indicated the need for mental health inputs in educational institutions.

AB  - The increasing use of wireless communication devices has raised major concerns towards deleterious effects of microwave radiation on human health. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the effect of low-intensity microwave radiation on levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and gene expression of their key regulating enzymes in brain of Fischer rats. Animals were exposed to 900 MHz and 1800 MHz microwave radiation for 30 days (2 h/day, 5 days/week) with respective specific absorption rates as 5.953 x 10(-4) and 5.835 x 10(-4) W/kg. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters viz. dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and serotonin (5-HT) were detected using LC-MS/MS in hippocampus of all experimental animals. In addition, mRNA expression of key regulating enzymes for these neurotransmitters viz. tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (for DA, NE and E) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1 and TPH2) (for serotonin) was also estimated. Results showed significant reduction in levels of DA, NE, E and 5-HT in hippocampus of microwave-exposed animals in comparison with sham-exposed (control) animals. In addition, significant downregulation in mRNA expression of TH, TPH1 and TPH2 was also observed in microwave-exposed animals (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results indicate that low-intensity microwave radiation may cause learning and memory disturbances by altering levels of brain monoamine neurotransmitters at mRNA and protein levels.

KW  - DISSECTION
AB  - Context: Pterional or fronto-temporal craniotomy, developed by Prof. M. G. Yasargil, is among the most familiar skull base surgery techniques. The cranio-orbito zygomatic (COZ) approach evolved to address the significant limitations of the pterional exposure in excising some parasellar lesions. Although extremely versatile, the COZ technique involves extensive dissection of the cranio-facial soft tissue and reconstruction towards the end of the procedure. The zygomatic reshaping is a minor modification of the pterional approach, which enhances the exposure possible through the classical approach and often circumvents the need for an orbito-zygomatic osteotomy.
   Aims: To demonstrate the technique of reshaping of the zygomatic complex for an optimum surgical exposure and cosmetic results.
   Materials and Methods: Between April 2013 and December 2014, 8 patients with various middle and anterior skull base lesions were operated using this technique. These patients form the clinical material for this study. The clinical details, radiological images and follow-up data of these patients were collected for this clinical series.
   Results: No mortality or significant morbidity were noted in this series. The post-operative cosmetic results were also acceptable.
   Conclusions: A quick and easy modification of the classical pterional approach through zygomatic reshaping has the potential to provide a significantly enhanced surgical exposure for parasellar lesions. Using this approach, it might be possible to avoid an extensive orbito-zygomatic osteotomy in suitable lesions.

AB  - Background: Despite a number of studies comparing postoperative stability and function after anatomic single bundle and double bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, it remains unclear whether double bundle reconstruction has better functional outcome than single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
   Purpose: To compare the subjective functional outcome as well as clinical stability in patients treated with either anatomic single bundle or anatomic double bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in the postoperative functional outcome and clinical stability between anatomical double bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions when compared to single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions.
   Methods: We prospectively followed 40 patients out of which, 20 patients were operated for anatomic single bundle ACL reconstruction and other 20 patients underwent anatomic double bundle ACL reconstruction. Patient evaluation using the laxity tests and outcome scales was done preoperatively and at 12, 24 and 48 months after the surgery. Clinical stability was assessed by Lachman test, Pivot shift test and Delhi active test. Functional outcome was assessed by International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm and Modified Cincinnati scores. Patients in both groups were evaluated at regular intervals for a minimum period of 48 months (mean 51 months, range 48-56 months).
   Results: For all subjective scores, double bundle group patients reported statistically significant higher scores compared to single bundle group patients. Graded stability results of the Lachman, and Pivot shift tests were significantly higher in the anatomically reconstructed double bundle patient group.
   Conclusion: We suggest that functional outcome and clinical stability may be better with anatomical double bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction as compared to anatomical single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

AB  - Statement of problem. Tooth wear is a complex process, which, if not prevented, may adversely affect the integrity of the stomatognathic system. Different restorative dental materials may affect the amount of wear on natural enamel antagonists.
   Purpose. The purpose of this in vivo study was to evaluate and compare the wear of enamel opposing natural enamel, zirconia, and metal ceramic crowns after 1 year.
   Material and methods. Ten participants between 18 and 35 years of age requiring 2 complete crowns, 1 on either side of maxillary or mandibular molar region, and having healthy natural teeth in the opposing arch were selected. For each participant, 1 monolithic polished zirconia crown and 1 glazed metal ceramic crown were fabricated and cemented. To evaluate the wear of the antagonistic natural enamel (premolar and molar), polyvinyl siloxane impressions were made immediately (baseline) and at 1 year after cementation. The wear of natural enamel against natural enamel was evaluated as the control. The resulting casts were scanned (using a 3D white light scanner), and 3D software was used to calculate the maximum amount of linear wear.
   Results. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to analyze data. Mean +/- SD occlusal wear of the antagonistic enamel 1 year after the cementation of metal ceramic crowns was 69.20 +/- 4.10 mu m for premolar teeth and 179.70 +/- 8.09 mu m for molar teeth, whereas for zirconia crowns, it was 42.10 +/- 4.30 mu m for premolar teeth and 127.00 +/- 5.03 mu m for molar teeth. Occlusal wear of natural enamel opposing natural enamel was 17.30 +/- 1.88 mu m in the premolar region and 35.10 +/- 2.60 mu m in the molar region. The Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that the occlusal wear of antagonistic enamel 1 year after the cementation of a metal ceramic crown was significantly higher (P<.001) than that of an opposing zirconia crown or natural enamel.
   Conclusions. Zirconia crowns led to less wear of antagonist enamel than metal ceramic crowns, but more than natural enamel.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize differences in the prevalence of hereditary and acquired thrombophilia in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). A total of 88 consecutive patients with SVT, including Budd Chiari Syndrome (n = 47) and portal extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (n = 41), underwent comprehensive thrombophilia testing, including testing for heritable and acquired causes. In 33 (37.5%) patients, etiology could be explained by at least 1 of the heritable etiologic factors, and 31 (35.2%) patients could be explained by at least 1 of the acquired causes studied. The combination of multiple concurrent factors was present in 9 (11.4%) patients. Among the heritable causes, the risk of SVT was found increased in the presence of thrombophilia resulting from the deficiencies of the naturally occurring anticoagulant proteins, and the acquired thrombogenic factors were significantly associated with causation of thrombosis in adult patients with SVT.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of phacoemulsification with tonic intraocular lens implantation vs phacoemulsification with monofocal intraocular lens implantation followed by photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for correction of pre-existing astigmatism.
   DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, 6-month study.
   METHODS: SETTING: Institutional. STUDY POPULATION: Sixty eyes of 52 patients with age-related senile cataract and regular corneal astigmatism ranging from 1.50 to 3.00 diopters, enrolled and randomly allocated in 2 groups based on computer-generated random number table. INTERVENTION: Group 1 patients underwent phacoemulsification with tonic intraocular lens (IOU implantation and Group 2 patients underwent phacoemulsification with monofocal IOL implantation followed by PRK 3 months later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), residual cylinder, contrast sensitivity, glare acuity, pain score, and higher-order aberrations.
   RESULTS: At 6 months 53.3% of eyes in the tonic IOL and 60% eyes in the monofocal IOL with PRK group attained UDVA of 20/20. Median residual refractive cylinder value was higher in the toric IOL group (tonic IOL= -0.5, monofocal IOL with PRK= 0; P=.02). Mean root mean square value of total aberrations (5 mm pupil) was higher in monofocal IOL with PRK eyes (tonic IOL= 1.02 +/- 0.44, monofocal IOL with PRK= 1.28 +/- 0.5; P=.04). Mean contrast sensitivity values were comparable. Mean toric IOL rotation was 1.3 +/- 2.1 degrees. Mean glare acuity was better in toric IOL eyes (toric IOL = 0.46 +/- 0.16, monofocal IOL with PRK = 0.73 +/- 0.12; P<.001). Median postoperative pain scores were higher in monofocal IOL with PRK eyes.
   CONCLUSION: PRK yields lesser residual cylinder compared to toric IOL. However, it causes greater postoperative pain and corneal aberrations, and poor glare acuity. (C)2015 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose:
   To evaluate outcomes of motorized diamond burr polishing versus manual polishing after pterygium excision.
   Setting:
   Dr. Rajendra Prasad Center for Ophthalmic Sciences, New Delhi.
   Design:
   A randomized, interventional observer-masked controlled trial.
   Methods:
   Forty consecutive eyes underwent pterygium excision with fibrin, glue-assisted conjunctival autograft. In group 1 (20 eyes), polishing of the corneal bed was done using a crescent blade, and in group 2 (20 eyes), using a motorized diamond burr.
   Results:
   There was no difference in the 2 groups with respect to mean age (P=0.08), gender (P=0.3), preoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) (P=0.45), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (P=0.52), spherical equivalent (P=0.5), mean astigmatism (P=0.7), tear function tests like tear break-up time, tear film meniscus height, Schirmer I and II (P=0.6, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 respectively), pterygium dimension (P=0.4), and conjunctival autograft size (P=0.24). Mean intraoperative surgical time was significantly more in group 1 (16.9 +/- 2.85 min) as compared with 12.25 +/- 1.88 min in group 2 (P=0.0001). Postoperatively, there was a statistically significant reduction in astigmatism and improvement in UCVA, BCVA, spherical equivalent in all eyes. No difference was found in mean epithelial defect healing time, UCVA, BCVA, astigmatism, tear film break-up time, Schirmer I and II, and tear meniscus height at 6 months between 2 groups; however, significantly better UCVA was found in group 2 at 3 months (P=0.04). Surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) was significantly more in group 2 as compared with group 1 at 6 months (P=0.0006).
   Conclusions:
   Motorized diamond burr polishing of the corneoscleral bed during primary pterygium excision in comparison with manual polishing requires significantly lesser surgical time with better UCVA, decreased astigmatism, and greater SIA at 6 months, which indicates greater astigmatic correction.

AB  - Introduction: Primary salivary gland type tumors of lung (PSGTTL) are rare intra-thoracic malignant neoplasm. Their description in literature is largely limited to a few case series/case reports. We herewith present our surgical experience of and review its clinical presentation, management options and survival outcomes.
   Methods: This retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained computerized data-base of patients was conducted in a tertiary teaching oncology centre in North India. The case records of all the patients who underwent surgery for PSGTTL were reviewed. Details concerning the clinical presentation, preoperative therapy, operative procedure, histopathological examination, postoperative complications and outcome were retrieved from the case records.
   Results: There were seven patients who underwent surgery for PSGTTL during the period from January 2012 to December 2014. Hemoptysis (n = 6, 85.7%) and dyspnoea (n = 6, 85.7%) were common presenting clinical features. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy revealed endobronchial growth in all patients - five patients had growth in left main bronchus while one each had growth in right main bronchus and right intermediate bronchus. Biopsy confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma in 4 (57.1%) and muco-epidermoid carcinoma in 3 (42.9%) patients. All but one had R'0' resection - pneumonectomy in five and bilobectomy in one patient; one patient was found to be unresectable in view of dense adhesions between lung and heart. Median pathological tumor size was 3.5 cm; none of the patient was found to have metastatic spread to lymph nodes. Overall, six patients are alive after a median follow up of 5 months (range 1-30).
   Conclusion: Radical surgery to achieve R'0' resection is the main stay of treatment of PSGTTL to achieve prolonged survival. (C) 2015 IJS Publishing Group Limited. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A 20-year-old man presented with proptosis, nasal obstruction, vision loss and cavernous sinus syndrome, ongoing for 6 years. Imaging and biopsy confirmed a middle skull base epithelioid hemangioendothelioma arising from the left sphenopetroclival region with infratemporal fossa and intracranial-intradural extension into the left temporal lobe. Preoperative embolization of the left internal maxillary artery followed by a combined neurosurgical (front-temporal orbito-zygomatic craniotomy) and otorhinolaryngology (maxillary swing) approach was performed for tumor debulking. Postoperative radiotherapy and maintenance interferon chemotherapy was given to achieve a favorable outcome at 6 months follow-up. We describe the pertinent clinical, genetic, radiological and histopathological features, along with the available therapeutic modalities for a primary giant skull base hemangioendothelioma.

AB  - IntroductionParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder, which is diagnosed on the basis of clinical history and examination alone as there are no diagnostic tests available. However, the current diagnosis highly depends on the knowledge and experience of clinicians and hence subjective in nature. Thus, the focus of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate PD from controls.
   Method:The proposed method utilizes graph-theory-based spectral feature selection method to select a set of discriminating features from whole brain volume. A decision model is built using support vector machine as a classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. The performance measures, namely, sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy, are utilized to evaluate the performance of the decision model. The efficacy of the proposed method is checked on volumetric 3D T1-weighted (1mm iso-voxel) MRI dataset of 30 PD patients and 30 age and gender matched controls acquired with 1.5T MRI scanner.
   Results:Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to differentiate PD from controls with an accuracy of 86.67%, which encourages the use of CAD. The performance of the proposed method outperforms the existing methods except one. In addition, it is observed that the maximum number of selected features belong to caudate region followed by cuneus region. Thus, these regions may be considered as potential biomarkers in diagnosis of PD.
   ConclusionThe proposed method may be utilized by the clinicians for diagnosis of PD. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Imaging Syst Technol, 25, 245-255, 2015

AB  - Nanocrystalline samples of Mn-doped CaF2 were synthesized by chemical coprecipitation method. The impurity concentration was varied in the range of 0.5-4.0 mol%. The structure of the synthesized material was confirmed using powder XRD analysis. TEM images of the nanoparticles show their size occurring mostly in the range of 35-40 nm, with clusters of some impurity phases formed on annealing of the material at higher temperatures. Detailed studies on TL showed that the structures of glow curves depend on Mn concentrations and annealing temperatures. Optimization of the concentration and annealing temperature showed that the sample (doped with 3.0 mol% and annealed at 673 K) has almost a single dosimetric glow peak appearing at around 492 K. EPR and PL spectra were further studied to understand the reasons for changes in the glow curve structures. All detailed studies on TL, PL and EPR showed that the changes in glow curve structures are caused not only by the stress connected with the difference in ionic radii of host Ca2+ and the guest impurity Mn3+ Mn2+, but are also governed by other reasons, like diffusion of atmospheric oxygen and formation of impurity aggregates, such as, MnO2, Mn3O4, etc. This is true not only for nanocrystalline CaF2:Mn but could also be so for the bulk CaF2:Mn (TLD-400) and would thus help in understanding complex glow curve structure, high fading and the loss of reusability on annealing beyond 673 K.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the use of pulse oximetry as a screening tool for detecting major congenital heart defects (CHDs) in Indian newborns.
   Design Cross-sectional observational study. Patients In a community hospital of north India, babies born during a specific 8 h period of the day were recruited over a period of 3 years. Newborns with incomplete documentation were excluded.
   Intervention Routine clinical examination, pulse oximetry and bedside echocardiography.
   Outcome measures Any abnormalities in clinical examination and pulse oximetry were recorded. CHDs were diagnosed using bedside echocardiography. Accuracy of pulse oximetry, clinical examination and their combination for detecting major CHDs was calculated.
   Results Among the 19 009 newborns screened, 70 had major CHDs at birth (44 serious, 26 critical). Pulse oximetry detected 39 major (sensitivity 55.7%, 95% CI 44.1% to 66.8%; specificity 68.3%, 67.6% to 68.9%) and 22 critical CHDs (sensitivity 84.6%, 66.5% to 93.9%; specificity 68.3%, 67.6% to 68.9%). Addition of pulse oximetry to clinical examination significantly improved sensitivity for major CHDs (35.7% (25.5% to 47.4%) to 75.7% (64.5% to 85.3%), p<0.01) and critical CHDs (11.5% (4.0% to 29.0%) to 84.6% (66.5% to 93.9%), p<0.01).
   Conclusions Pulse oximetry is a sensitive screening tool for detecting major CHDs in Indian newborns. It adds significant value to the current practice of using clinical examination as a sole screening tool for detecting major CHDs. However, specificity of pulse oximetry was much lower in our study. Possible reasons for low specificity could be non-repetition of pulse oximetry in newborns with initial lower saturations, high prevalence of infections and respiratory issues in our cohort and use of non-motion tolerant oximeter.

AB  - Childhood cancers are rare but an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children younger than 15y of age. Common childhood malignancies include leukemias (commonest, 30-40%), brain tumors (20%) and lymphoma (12%) followed by neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and tumors arising from soft tissues, bones and gonads. Leukemias, the commonest childhood cancer, arise from clonal proliferation of abnormal hematopoietic cells leading to disruption of normal marrow function and marrow failure. The various clinical manifestations of leukemia result from unregulated proliferation of the malignant clone and bone marrow failure. There are two main subtypes, the commoner, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A small proportion may have chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). A systematic approach is necessary for diagnosis. Treatment should be initiated as early as possible to avoid complications. A timely referral to a cancer center must be done if facilities for diagnosis/treatment, management of complications and provision for supportive care are not available at the treating center.

AB  - Purpose:To evaluate the role of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) in the detection and management of Descemet membrane detachment (DMD) in cases of persistent corneal edema after intraocular surgery. An ASOCT-guided new algorithm for the management of such DMDs is described.Methods:Thirty-seven consecutive cases of persistent corneal edema of more than 2-week duration after intraocular surgery were included. All cases referred had no response to medical therapy. ASOCT was performed in all eyes. DMDs that were in the superior half of the cornea with a planar configuration alone were managed using intracameral air, and those with scrolled edges were managed using intracameral 14% perfluoropropane (C3F8). DMDs that were in the inferior half of the cornea with planar or scrolled edges were managed using intracameral C3F8 injection. The parameters evaluated were the type and morphology of DMD, resolution of DMD, and best-corrected visual acuity.Results:Using ASOCT, DMD was found to be present in 25 eyes. All cases had planar edges, and 52% (13/25) cases had scrolled edges. In 48% (12/25) cases, DMD was peripheral. Descemetopexy with intracameral air or 14% C3F8 gas showed resolution in all cases with the mean time to resolution being 16.0 7.1 days.Conclusions:ASOCT is a useful tool for timely diagnosis, characterization, and management of DMD in cases of nonresolving postoperative corneal edema. A new algorithm for intracameral injection of air or C3F8 in these cases helps to defer corneal transplantation.

TI  - Incision-Site Descemet Membrane Detachment During and After Phacoemulsification: Risk Factors and Management
T2  - EYE & CONTACT LENS-SCIENCE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE
KW  - STROMAL HYDRATION
KW  - SURGERY
AB  - Objective:
   To evaluate the occurrence of localized incision-site Descemet membrane detachment (DMD) during and after phacoemulsification and to study its relationship with phacoemulsification parameters.
   Methods:
   Forty-three, consecutive uneventful cases of phacoemulsification through 2.8-mm clear corneal incision were included in this prospective study. Preoperatively, the grade of cataract was assessed. The phacoemulsification parameters noted were phacoemulsification time, aspiration time, cumulative dissipated energy (CDE), ultrasound time, and total fluid volume. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was performed on postoperative days 1 and 7 to study the course of the incision-site DMD.
   Results:
   Fourteen of 43 cases (32%) showed localized incision-site DMD either intraoperatively or on AS-OCT on the first postoperative day. Of these, nine cases were detected intraoperatively, and six cases were detected on AS-OCT on the first postoperative day. All cases were of planar type and resolved spontaneously. A single case showed a concurrent DMD involving central cornea, which resolved without any surgical intervention. The occurrence of DMD was significantly higher in those with the total ultrasound time greater than 60 sec (P=0.038) (odds ratio: 7.639). The CDE was higher in cases with DMD; however, the result was not statistically significant (P=0.062). Torsional equivalent in level-3, total torsional time, equivalent torsional time, aspiration time, and the total fluid volume were comparable (P>0.05) between cases with and without incision-site DMD.
   Conclusion:
   Postphacoemulsification incision-site DMD may occur in up to one third of cases and is associated with increase in the total ultrasound time.

Apart from the F-18-FDG avid primary breast tumor, F-18-FDG avid thyroiditis, F-18-FDG avid right paratracheal tubercular lymphadenitis, and non-F-18-FDG avid pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor were seen on PET/CT. All the lesions were confirmed with fine-needle aspiration cytology. This interesting case demonstrates a spectrum of true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative lesions on a single F-18-FDG PET/CT examination.

AB  - Background. Circadian rhythm sleep disorder advanced sleep-phase type is a relatively uncommon disorder, mostly seen among the elderly population. Impaired circadian rhythms have been reported in neurodegenerative conditions; however, there are no reports of any circadian rhythm sleep disorder among patients with Parkinsonian syndromes. We report two patients who presented with this circadian rhythm disorder, and were then diagnosed with a Parkinsonian syndrome.
   The cases. A 65-year-old retired man presented with history of abrupt change in sleep schedules, sleeping around 6.30-7 p.m. and waking up around 3-4 a.m. for the last 2 months. On detailed examination, the patient was observed to have symmetrical bradykinesia and cogwheel rigidity of limbs. A diagnosis of multiple system atrophy was made, supported by MRI findings and evidence of autonomic dysfunction. Symptoms of change in sleep wake cycles resolved over the next 1 year, while the patient was treated with dopaminergic therapy.
   A 47-year-old man, who was being evaluated for presurgical investigation for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, presented with complaints suggestive of dysarthria, bradykinesia of limbs and frequent falls for 5 months. Simultaneously, he began to sleep around 7 p.m. and wake up at about 2-3 a.m. Examination revealed severe axial rigidity, restricted vertical gaze and bradykinesia of limbs. A diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was made.
   Conclusion. This is the first report of Parkinson's plus syndromes presenting with a circadian rhythm sleep disorder advanced sleep-phase type. More prospective assessment for circadian sleep disorders may introduce useful insights into similar associations.

AB  - HMGB1 is considered to be DNA chaperone as it binds without any specificity. It is the structural protein which alters nuclear homeostasis and genomic stability of chromatin. Its role in retinoblastoma (Rb) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of HMGB1 protein in primary enucleated retinoblastomas. Expression of HMGB1 in 69 prospective cases of primary retinoblastoma were assessed by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) technique and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Immunohistochemical staining revealed expression of HMGB1 in 55.07 % (38/69) cases. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on 31 fresh tumor tissues. mRNA expression was observed in 77.41 % (24/31) cases. Expression of HMGB1 was statistically significant with poor tumor differentiation (p = 0.0440) & optic nerve invasion (p = 0.0128). HMGB1 expression was frequently seen in poorly differentiated tumors and those with histopathological high risk factors. Therefore, HMGB1 may contribute to tumor invasiveness and could serve as a poor prognostic marker in Rb.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism is known to be a complex interaction of genetic and acquired factors leading to thrombosis. JAK2V617F mutation is believed to contribute to a thrombophilic phenotype, possibly through enhanced leukocyte-platelet interactions in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Several studies have focused on the importance of screening for JAK2V617F mutation in patients with splanchnic venous thrombosis (VT) for the detection of nonovert MPNs. The role of JAK2V617F mutation in VT outside the splanchnic region is still widely unsettled. The primary aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of JAK2V617F mutation in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), its clinical significance as a prothrombotic risk factor, and its possible interactions with other genetic thrombophilic risk factors. A total of 148 patients with idiopathic, symptomatic DVT were evaluated. Median age of presentation was 32 years (range 15-71 years) with a sex ratio of 1.3:1. Overall, the most common genetic prothrombotic factor was factor V Leiden mutation, found in 10.8% (16 of 148) of patients who also showed strong association with increased risk of thrombosis (odds ratio 5.94, confidence interval 1.33-26.4, P = .019). Deficiencies in protein C, protein S, and antithrombin were seen in 8 (5.4%), 10 (6.7%), and 8 (5.4%) patients, respectively. It was observed that the frequency of JAK2V617F mutation was lower in Indian patients, and it also showed weaker association with risk of thrombosis, at least in cases of venous thrombosis outside the splanchnic region.
