AB  - Caudal duplication syndrome is a rare and interesting entity with a reported prevalence of <1/100,000 births. Caudal duplication syndrome encompasses a diverse spectrum of anomalies primarily involving partial or complete duplication of organs comprising the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and distal neural tube systems. The term 'caudal duplication syndrome' was coined by Dominguez et al. in 1993, in a case series of six patients presenting with findings pertaining to duplication anomalies of genitourinary system, hindgut, lumbosacral spine and cord. We here report a unique case of caudal duplication presenting in late adolescence and briefly review the available literature on this rare abnormality.

AB  - Purpose: We describe a simple technique for achieving radial and equally spaced sutures by novice corneal surgeon in cases of large penetrating keratoplasties. Method: A simple mathematical equation was derived for precise calculation of spacing between interrupted sutures in large grafts (n = 50). The ubiquitous and easily available Castroviejo calipers were used to mark the donor cornea according to the derived formula. Interrupted sutures were passed over the pre-marked points and tied. Radiality was assessed in the post-operative period. Results: A total of 50 eyes undergoing therapeutic keratoplasty with graft size between 9 and 12 mm were enrolled. Equally spaced and radially aligned sutures were achieved in all cases postoperatively with watertight apposition of the graft host junction using our simple technique. Conclusion: The Castroviejo caliper can be effectively used for equidistant spacing of interrupted sutures in large therapeutic grafts by a novice surgeon thereby simplifying the procedure and reducing the surgical time.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is one of the common reasons for acute kidney injury (AKI) and we need to develop effective therapies for treating AKI. We investigated the role of fenofibrate against I/R-induced AKI and associated hepatic dysfunction in rats. In male wistar albino rats, renal pedicle occlusion for 40 min and 24 h reperfusion resulted in AKI. I/R-induced AKI was demonstrated by measuring serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urea, uric acid, potassium, fractional excretion of sodium and urinary microproteins. Oxidative stress in rat kidneys was quantified by assaying superoxide anion generation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and reduced glutathione levels. AKI-induced hepatic damage was quantified by assaying serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels. Moreover, serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein and triglycerides were quantified. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of renal and hepatic tissues was done and the kidney and liver injury scores were determined. Immunohistology of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was done in rat kidneys. Fenofibrate was administered for 1 week before subjecting rats to AKI. In separate group, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was administered prior to fenofibrate treatment. In I/R group, significant alteration in the serum/urine parameters indicated AKI and hepatic dysfunction along with marked increase in kidney and liver injury scores. Treatment with fenofibrate attenuated AKI and associated hepatic dysfunction. Moreover, I/R-induced decrease in renal eNOS expression was abrogated by fenofibrate. Pre-treatment with L-NAME abolished fenofibrate mediated reno- and hepato-protective effects. In conclusion, fenofibrate attenuates I/R-induced AKI and associated hepatic dysfunction putatively through modulation of eNOS expression.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis We aimed to estimate the lifetime risk of diabetes and diabetes-free life expectancy in metropolitan cities in India among the population aged 20 years or more, and their variation by sex, age and BMI. Methods A Markov simulation model was adopted to estimate age-, sex- and BMI-specific lifetime risk of developing diabetes and diabetes-free life expectancy. The main data inputs used were as follows: age-, sex- and BMI-specific incidence rates of diabetes in urban India taken from the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (2010-2018); age-, sex- and urban-specific rates of mortality from period lifetables reported by the Government of India (2014); and prevalence of diabetes from the Indian Council for Medical Research INdia DIABetes study (2008-2015). Results Lifetime risk (95% CI) of diabetes in 20-year-old men and women was 55.5 (51.6, 59.7)% and 64.6 (60.0, 69.5)%, respectively. Women generally had a higher lifetime risk across the lifespan. Remaining lifetime risk (95% CI) declined with age to 37.7 (30.1, 46.7)% at age 60 years among women and 27.5 (23.1, 32.4)% in men. Lifetime risk (95% CI) was highest among obese Indians: 86.0 (76.6, 91.5)% among 20-year-old women and 86.9 (75.4, 93.8)% among men. We identified considerably higher diabetes-free life expectancy at lower levels of BMI. Conclusions/interpretation Lifetime risk of diabetes in metropolitan cities in India is alarming across the spectrum of weight and rises dramatically with higher BMI. Prevention of diabetes among metropolitan Indians of all ages is an urgent national priority, particularly given the rapid increase in urban obesogenic environments across the country.

AB  - Purpose In the present study, we aimed at assessing the effect of femoral and tibial coronal bowing on varus malalignment and Oxford knee score (OKS) at different grades of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Materials and Methods This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary referral centre in New Delhi, India. Consecutive patients presenting to the "knee OA" outpatient clinics were invited to take part in the study conducted over a 12-month period. All consented patients underwent long-leg standing alignment radiographs using standardised technique and patient reported knee pain and function were recorded using Oxford knee score. The following radiological parameters were measured from weight-bearing long-leg radiographs of 824 varus aligned limbs via a morphometric software (Matlab R2009a) (1) hip-knee-ankle angle (HKAA), (2) femoral bowing, (3) tibial bowing. The knees were graded according to Kellegren and Lawrence grade (K&L) and OKS was recorded. 3 groups of HKAA were made based on the angle, A (0 degrees to - 3 degrees), B (- 3 degrees to - 10 degrees) and C (< - 10 degrees). Both the femoral and tibial bow were also categorized into three groups depending upon the angle; in-range (- 2 degrees to + 2 degrees), varus (< - 2 degrees), valgus (> + 2 degrees). Results The mean (+/- SD) of HKAA, femoral bow and tibial bow of the whole cohort was - 6.97 degrees +/- 5.64 degrees, - 1.54 degrees +/- 4.31 degrees and - 1.96 degrees +/- 3.5 degrees, respectively. An increase in the lateral bow of both femur and tibia was seen with an increase in the severity of OA. A consequent increase in the varus malalignment was observed with an increase in the lateral bow of both femur as well as the tibia at all grades of OA, with significant correlation observed between HKAA with Femoral bowing and HKAA with tibial bowing. The mean OKS for femoral bow, in-range, varus and valgus was 30.6 +/- 11.5, 21.3 +/- 11.5 and 35.3 +/- 11.4, respectively, and for tibial bow, in-range, varus and valgus was 27.6 +/- 11.5, 26. +/- 11.5 and 28 +/- 11.4, respectively. The difference in the mean OKS was observed to be significant when the varus bow group was compared to in range as well as valgus group (p < 0.01) for both femur and tibia for all the grades of OA. Conclusion The present study shows a significant correlation between varus malalignment and the bowing of extremities. Varus coronal bowing of both femur and tibia were seen to have significantly lower mean OKS as compared to valgus bowing or in-range bowing at all grades of knee OA.

TI  - Tele-Medicine Services in Hematological Practice During Covid Pandemic: Its Feasibility and Difficulties
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION
KW  - COVID 19 pandemic

KW  - Hematological diseases
AB  - In COVID 19 pandemic, delivery and access of health care services have become challenging. Telemedicine services can be considered for management of patients with hematological diseases. This study included all patients who enrolled for telemedicine facility for hematology from May 15 to July 15, 2020. Patient's demographic and disease related parameters were recorded during the teleconsultation call. Overall satisfaction of attending doctor and patients were also recorded. A total of 1187 teleconsultation appointments were taken, of which 944 (79.6%) were successfully attended. Median age of patients was 38 years (range- 0.5-78 years), with 38% females. 55% of successful calls were from patients suffering a malignant hematological disorder. 24% had an active complaint pertaining to their disease or treatment. Of these, 162 (17%) were asked for a physical consultation. A significant association was found between the requirement of physical consultation and diagnosis (p < 0.001), absence of active complaint (< 0.0001) and education level of responder (p = 0.008). Patients understand that teleconsultation is helpful in preventing COVID-19 infection (71.4%) and avoids outpatient department rush (14.5%) associated with physical appointments; and around 80% patients were satisfied with the teleconsult. With the emergence of COVID 19, many localities under partial lockdown with constant fear of contacting virus amongst patients and health care providers, we can clearly see the advantages as well as feasibility of telemedicine services for our patients. The acute surge in telemedicine could be harnessed in the future to provide comprehensive and integrated care to patients of hematological disorders.

AB  - Azathioprine, a purine synthesis inhibitor is widely used as an effective immunosuppressant in several immune mediated diseases, usually in a dose of 2 to 2.5 mg/kg per day. The pulse dose of azathioprine is an unique once weekly dosing regimen, which has been used as an alternative to daily dose regimen in some immune mediated dermatologic disorders. In this review, we looked at a specific dosing regimen, "weekly azathioprine pulse" with respect to its efficacy and safety in the treatment of dermatologic diseases. We performed a literature search for studies on azathioprine weekly pulse in dermatology in various scientific databases using keywords "azathioprine-pulse", "dermatology", "weekly azathioprine", and so on. Dosing regimens, indications, efficacy, monitoring, and side effect profile as described in these studies were recorded. Evidence level of the regimens used in various indications was also calculated. We could find six published studies using azathioprine weekly pulse, of which three were randomized comparative clinical trials. Azathioprine pulse was administered in a dose of 300 mg (6 tablets of 50 mg each) every week in all the studies. It has been found to be effective in management of contact dermatitis due to parthenium (IB), chronic plaque psoriasis (IIB), and alopecia areata (IB). Adverse effect profile was found to be almost similar to daily azathioprine. Weekly azathioprine pulse, therefore, appears to be an effective and safe alternative to daily azathioprine in the management of immune mediated disorders in dermatology. Although studies are limited, this regimen seems promising and further studies are warranted.

AB  - Understanding the predictors of weight loss with lifestyle interventions can help to ascertain the probable outcomes of individuals with obesity who undergo such interventions. This systematic review assessed the evidence of predictors of successful weight loss among individuals who are overweight or with obesity undergoing lifestyle interventions. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, PsychInfo and Wiley) were searched to find relevant literature published in the past 20 years. A total of 1351 titles were identified in the initial search, of which 23 studies were finally included. Predictors were synthesized in the domains of socio-demographic factors, anthropometric parameters, psychological and behavioural factors and intervention-based factors. The overall quality of evidence on predictors was then appraised using an adapted GRADE approach. Patient-specific factors such as being male, older in age, having existing cardiometabolic comorbidities and limited fat intake were significantly associated with weight loss success. Amongst intervention specific predictors, greater initial weight loss and higher adherence to lifestyle advice were associated with greater weight loss success. In this review, initial weight loss came out to be as the most important predictor of successful weight loss outcome.

AB  - Objectives-To evaluate the various quantitative parameters of Doppler ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and shear wave elastography (SWE) of graft kidneys in the early postoperative period and to explore their utility in the diagnosis of parenchymal causes of graft dysfunction.
   Methods-In this ethically approved study, consecutive patients who underwent renal transplantation from March 2017 to August 2018 were recruited, and those with urologic or vascular complications and those who denied consent were excluded. All patients underwent ultrasound with Doppler, SWE, CEUS (using sulfur hexafluoride), and renal scintigraphic examinations 3 to 10 days after transplantation. A composite reference standard was used, including the clinical course, renal function test results, urine output, and histopathologic results for graft dysfunction. Cortical SWE values, quantitative CEUS parameters (generated from a time-intensity curve), and their ratios were analyzed to identify graft dysfunction and differentiate acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from acute rejection (AR).
   Results-Of the 105 patients included, 19 developed graft dysfunction (18.1%; 12 ATN, 5 AR, and 2 drug toxicity) in the early postoperative period. The peak systolic velocity in the interpolar artery showed a significant difference between control and graft dysfunction groups (P < .001) as well as between ATN and AR (P = .019). Resistive indices and SWE did not show significant differences. Ratios of the time to peak showed a significant difference between control and graft dysfunction groups (P < .05). The rise time and fall time of the large subcapsular region of interest and the rise time ratio were significantly different between ATN and AR (P = .03).
   Conclusions-Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used to diagnose parenchymal causes of early graft dysfunction with reasonable diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Background The integration of machine learning algorithms in decision support tools for physicians is gaining popularity. These tools can tackle the disparities in healthcare access as the technology can be implemented on smartphones. We present the first, large-scale study on patients with skin of colour, in which the feasibility of a novel mobile health application (mHealth app) was investigated in actual clinical workflows.
   Objective To develop a mHealth app to diagnose 40 common skin diseases and test it in clinical settings.
   Methods A convolutional neural network-based algorithm was trained with clinical images of 40 skin diseases. A smartphone app was generated and validated on 5014 patients, attending rural and urban outpatient dermatology departments in India. The results of this mHealth app were compared against the dermatologists' diagnoses.
   Results The machine-learning model, in an in silico validation study, demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 76.93 +/- 0.88% and mean area-under-curve of 0.95 +/- 0.02 on a set of clinical images. In the clinical study, on patients with skin of colour, the app achieved an overall top-1 accuracy of 75.07% (95% CI = 73.75-76.36), top-3 accuracy of 89.62% (95% CI = 88.67-90.52) and mean area-under-curve of 0.90 +/- 0.07.
   Conclusion This study underscores the utility of artificial intelligence-driven smartphone applications as a point-of-care, clinical decision support tool for dermatological diagnosis for a wide spectrum of skin diseases in patients of the skin of colour.

AB  - Background Metallothionein (MT), a cysteine rich protein is involved as a radical scavenger in several pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress; however, its role in periodontal disease still remains elusive. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to determine the serum, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of MT in smokers (S) and non-smokers (NS) with chronic periodontitis (CP), and compare them with those of periodontally healthy (PH) individuals.
   Methods A total of 85 participants were enrolled: 45 patients with CP (23 S [CP+S] and 22 NS [CP+NS]) and 40 PH individuals (20 S [PH+S] and 20 NS [PH+NS]). In all the study participants, clinical periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level) were recorded and samples of serum, saliva and GCF were collected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the levels of MT in the samples.
   Results All periodontal clinical parameters were significantly higher in the CP groups as compared to PH groups (P < 0.05). MT levels in CP+S group were significantly raised in comparison to other three groups. There was no statistically significant difference in MT levels among CP+NS and PH+S groups (P > 0.05); however, relatively higher levels were observed in GCF and saliva in CP+NS group. When all the study groups were observed together, MT levels were positively correlated with clinical parameters.
   Conclusions Results of present study suggest that smoking and CP can induce the synthesis of MT owing to increased oxidative stress and heavy metals intoxication. Further longitudinal studies with large sample size and an interventional arm are needed to substantiate the role of MT as a potential biomarker in periodontitis.

AB  - Introduction
   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating inflammatory disorder with variable clinical and pathologic characteristics reflecting multiple underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Repositioning of existing drugs for the new indications offers several advantages including significant reduction in the cost and time of drug development and exemption from early phase clinical trials. Minocycline has been reported to exhibit immunomodulation in several pre-clinical and clinical studies through suppression of migratory inflammatory cells, modulation of peripheral immune response, and inhibition of microglial activation within the CNS.
   Areas covered
   Here, the authors review the repositioning potential of minocycline for the treatment of MS along with appraisal of the evidence obtained from preclinical and clinical research. The authors also discuss the advantages and potential safety concerns related to the use of minocycline for the management of MS.
   Expert opinion
   Minocycline offers several distinct advantages in terms of well-known safety profile, lower cost of therapy, widespread availability, and being available as an oral formulation. The authors call upon the public and private funders to facilitate well designed and adequately powered randomized clinical trials that can provide conclusive evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of minocycline in patients with MS.

AB  - Purpose Medial pivot (MP) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) aims to restore native knee kinematics due to highly conforming medial tibio-femoral articulation with survival comparable to contemporary knee designs. Posterior stabilized (PS) TKAs use cam-post mechanism to restore native femoral rollback. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the reported patient satisfaction with MP TKA designs when compared to PS TKAs. The primary aim of this study is to compare the patient satisfaction between MP and PS TKA and the secondary aim is to establish potential reasons behind any differences in the outcomes noted between these two design philosophies. Methods In this IRB-approved single surgeon, single centre prospective RCT, 53 patients (mean age 62 years, 42 women) with comparable bilateral end-stage knee arthritis undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA were randomized to receive MP TKA in one knee and PS TKA in the contralateral knee. At 4 years post-surgery, all patients were assessed using Knee Society Score (KSS)-Satisfaction and -Expectation scores, and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). In addition, all the patients underwent standardized radiological and in vivo kinematic assessment. Results Patients were more satisfied with the MP TKA as compared to PS TKA: mean KSS-Satisfaction [34.5 +/- 3.05 in MP and 31.7 +/- 3.16 in PS TKAs (p < 0.0001)] and mean KSS-Expectation scores [12.5 +/- 1.39 in MP TKAs and 11.2 +/- 1.41 in PS TKAs (p < 0.0001)]. No significant difference was noted in any other clinical outcomes. The in vivo kinematics of MP TKAs was significantly better than those of PS TKAs. Conclusion MP TKAs provide superior patient satisfaction and patient expectations as compared to PS TKA. This may be related to better replication of natural knee kinematics with MP TKA.

AB  - There is paucity of data on outcomes of MSD-HSCT in children with relapsed or high-risk AML from developing countries, which have unique challenges including adverse host factors and resource constraints. We retrospectively reviewed records of children (age <= 18 years) who underwent MSD-HSCT for AML at our center from 2009 to 2019 to evaluate clinical outcome and its predictors using Cox proportional hazards model. There were 46 children (36 boys and 10 girls) with mean age 10.7 +/- 4.8 years. Indication for HSCT was relapsed AML in CR2 (n = 37), primary refractory (n = 3), or relapsed refractory disease (n = 3); high-risk (n = 1) or secondary (n = 2) AML in CR1. Five-year EFS and OS were 33.3 +/- 7.2% and 36.3 +/- 7.6%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, CR1 duration less than 12 months, presence of active disease at transplant, and use of bone marrow stem cell graft were associated with poorer EFS and OS. There was one (2.2%) TRM, while disease relapse occurred in 20/40 patients who underwent HSCT in remission. Though the 5-year EFS and OS were inferior to results reported from high-income countries, relapse (and not TRM) was the major cause of treatment failure. A well-sustained CR1, achievement of disease remission, and use of peripheral blood allograft seem imperative to a successful transplant. Targeted therapy along with HSCT may be the option for those with early relapse.

AB  - Aim Achievement of treatment targets among individuals with diabetes remains suboptimal in many parts of the globe. We aimed to assess changes in diabetes prevalence and achievement of diabetes care goals in South Asia using two consecutive cross-sectional population-based surveys.
   Methods Two representative samples of South Asian adults were recruited using identical methods from Chennai, Delhi, and Karachi in 2010-11 (n = 16,288; response rate-94.7%) and 2015-16 (n = 14,587; response rate-94.0%) through the Center for Cardio-metabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) Study. Quality of care goals were defined as HbA1c <53 mmol/mol (7.0%), blood pressure (BP) control: <140/90 mmHg, lipid control: LDL cholesterol <2.56 mmol/l (100 mg/dl), and self-reported non-smoking.
   Results Weighted prevalence of self-reported diabetes increased by 9.0% [13% (95%CI: 13-14) to 15% (14-15)] while that of newly diagnosed diabetes decreased by 16% [6.1% (5.7-6.6) to 5.1% (4.6-5.6)]. There were improvements in achieving glycaemic (25% to 30%, p = 0.002) and lipid (34% to 45%, p < 0.001) goals, but no notable improvements in BP control or smoking status. The proportion of individuals with self-reported diabetes meeting more than one target also increased.
   Conclusions Diabetes prevalence continues to grow among urban South Asians and large gaps still exist in the attainment of treatment targets. Concerted policy, systemic, clinical and individual efforts are needed to close these care gaps.

AB  - The PFA molecular subgroup of posterior fossa ependymomas (PF-EPNs) shows poor outcome. H3K27me3 (me3) loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a surrogate marker for PFA wherein its loss is attributed to overexpression of Cxorf67/EZH2 inhibitory protein (EZHIP), C17orf96, and ATRX loss. We aimed to subgroup PF-EPNs using me3 IHC and study correlations of the molecular subgroups with other histone related proteins, 1q gain, Tenascin C and outcome. IHC for me3, acetyl-H3K27, H3K27M, ATRX, EZH2, EZHIP, C17orf96, Tenascin-C, and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation for chromosome 1q25 locus were performed on an ambispective PF-EPN cohort (2003-2019). H3K27M-mutant gliomas were included for comparison. Among 69 patients, PFA (me3 loss) constituted 64%. EZHIP overexpression and 1q gain were exclusive to PFA seen in 72% and 19%, respectively. Tenascin C was more frequently positive in PFA (p = 0.02). H3K27M expression and ATRX loss were noted in one case of PFA-EPN each. All H3K27M-mutant gliomas (n = 8) and PFA-EPN (n = 1) were EZHIP negative. C17orf96 and acetyl-H3K27 expression did not correlate with me3 loss. H3K27me3 is a robust surrogate for PF-EPN molecular subgrouping. EZHIP overexpression was exclusive to PFA EPNs and was characteristically absent in midline gliomas and the rare PFA harbouring H3K27M mutations representing mutually exclusive pathways leading to me3 loss.

AB  - Covid-19 disease can involve any organ system leading to myriad manifestations and complications. Cardiovascular manifestations are being increasingly recognised with the improved understanding of the disease. Acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy; heart failure and thromboembolic disease have all been described. The elderly and those with prior cardiac diseases are at an increased risk of mortality. Overlapping symptomatology, ability of drugs to cause QTc interval (start of Q wave to the end of T wave) prolongation on electrocardiogram and arrhythmias, potential drug interactions, the need to recognise patients requiring urgent definitive management and provide necessary bedside interventions without increasing the risk of nosocomial spread have made the management challenging. In the background of a pandemic, non-Covid-19 cardiac patients are affected by delayed treatment and nosocomial exposure. Triaging using telemedicine and artificial intelligence along with utilization of bedside rapid diagnostic tests to detect Covid-19 could prove helpful in this aspect.

AB  - Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic agent with excellent analgesic properties and a favorable safety profile. The feasibility and efficacy of various routes of administration have been established, including intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), oral, intranasal, rectal, and transdermal routes. The advent of newer anesthetic agents has led to a decline in the use of ketamine as an anesthetic, but its utility in short-term sedation and analgesia has expanded. Its value for chronic pain management in children with cancer is being increasingly recognized but requires more evidence. The use of topical ketamine is largely in investigational stages. Medical use of ketamine is, to a great extent, free from significant long-term neurological side effects. The objective of this review is to provide a brief account of the pharmacology of ketamine and primarily focus on the clinical applications of ketamine in pediatric oncology.

AB  - Background Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and transesophageal bronchoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) are established modalities for evaluation of mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy in adults. Limited literature is available on the utility of these modalities in the pediatric population. Herein, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the yield and safety of EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA in children.
   Methods We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases to extract the studies reporting the utilization of EBUS-TBNA/EUS-B-FNA in children (<18 years of age). The pooled diagnostic yield and sampling adequacy (proportions with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were calculated using meta-analysis of proportions using the random effects model. Details of any procedure-related complications were noted.
   Results The search yielded 12 relevant studies (5 case series and 7 case reports on EBUS-TBNA/EUS-B-FNA, 173 patients). Data from five case series (164 patients) were summarized for the calculation of the sampling adequacy and diagnostic yield. Safety outcomes were extracted from all publications. The pooled sampling adequacy and combined diagnostic yield of EBUS TBNA/EUS-B-FNA were 98% (95% CI, 92%-100%) and 61% (95% CI, 43%-77%), respectively. A procedure-related major complication was reported in one patient (1/173, a major complication rate of 0.6%), and minor complications occurred in six patients (6/173, a minor complication rate of 3.5%).
   Conclusions EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA are safe modalities for evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the pediatric population. EBUS-TBNA/EUS-B-FNA may be considered as the first-line diagnostic modalities for this indication, as they have a good diagnostic yield and can avoid the need for invasive diagnostic procedures.

TI  - Perioperative Analgesia in Neurosurgery (PAIN): A national survey of pain assessment and management among neuroanesthesiologists of India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
KW  - POST-CRANIOTOMY ANALGESIA
KW  - CENTERS
AB  - Background Perioperative pain assessment and management in neurosurgical patients varies widely across the globe. There is lack of data from developing world regarding practices of pain assessment and management in neurosurgical population. This survey aimed to capture practices and perceptions regarding perioperative pain assessment and management in neurosurgical patients among anesthesiologists who are members of the Indian Society of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care (ISNACC) and evaluated if hospital and pain characteristics predicted the use of structured pain assessment protocol and use of opioids for postoperative pain management.
   Methods A 26-item English language questionnaire was administered to members of ISNACC using Kwiksurveys platform after ethics committee approval. Our outcome measures were adoption of structured protocol for pain assessment and opioid usage for postoperative pain management.
   Results The response rate for our survey was 55.15% (289/524). One hundred eighteen (41%) responders informed that their hospital setup had a structured pain protocol while 43 (15%) responders reported using opioids for postoperative pain management. Predictors of the use of structured pain protocol were private setup (odds ratio [OR] 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52-4.59; P = .001), higher pain intensity (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.21-0.64; P < .001) and use of pain scale (OR 7.94; 95% CI 3.99-15.81; P < .001) while availability of structured pain protocol (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.02-4.05; P = .043) was the only significant variable for postoperative opioid use.
   Conclusions Less than half of the Indian neuroanesthesiologists who are members of ISNACC use structured protocol for pain assessment and very few use opioids for postoperative pain management in neurosurgical patients.

AB  - Aims/Introduction This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of and factors associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Indian women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosed using International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria.
   Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study (2018-2019) enrolled women with and without prior GDM. Study participants underwent detailed assessments, including relevant medical, obstetric and demographic details; 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with glucose and insulin estimation at 0, 30 and 120 min; and other relevant biochemical and anthropometric measurements. NAFLD status was defined by ultrasonography.
   Results We evaluated a total of 309 women (201 and 108 with and without prior GDM, respectively) at a mean age of 31.9 +/- 5.0 years and median of 16 months (interquartile range 9-38 months) following the index delivery. The prevalence of NAFLD was significantly higher in women with prior GDM (62.7% vs 50.0%, P = 0.038; grade 2 and 3 disease, 13.9% vs 6.5%). On logistic regression analysis (fully adjusted model), the odds of NAFLD were 2.11-fold higher in women with prior GDM (95% confidence interval 1.16-3.85, P = 0.014). Overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes and homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance (a measure of insulin resistance) were positively associated with NAFLD, whereas the Matsuda index (a measure of insulin sensitivity) showed a negative association with NAFLD.
   Conclusions The prevalence of NAFLD is high in women with prior GDM. Such women also have a high burden of cardiometabolic risk factors. Future studies should evaluate the intermediate and long-term hepatic and cardiovascular risk, and the impact of lifestyle interventions in reducing morbidity in such women.

AB  - Introduction Numerous concerns regarding maintenance of blood inventory have been raised after SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak. These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory.
   Methods Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied.
   Results A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period.
   Discussion A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.

TI  - An Analysis of 30-Day in-Hospital Trauma Mortality in Four Urban University Hospitals Using the Australia India Trauma Registry
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
KW  - VITAL SIGNS
AB  - Background India has one-sixth (16%) of the world's population but more than one-fifth (21%) of the world's injury mortality. A trauma registry established by the Australia India Trauma Systems Collaboration (AITSC) Project was utilized to study 30-day in-hospital trauma mortality at high-volume Indian hospitals. Methods The AITSC Project collected data prospectively between April 2016 and March 2018 at four Indian university hospitals in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. Patients admitted with an injury mechanism of road or rail-related injury, fall, assault, or burns were included. The associations between demographic, physiological on-admission vitals, and process-of-care parameters with early (0-24 h), delayed (1-7 days), and late (8-30 days) in-hospital trauma mortality were analyzed. Results Of 9354 patients in the AITSC registry, 8606 were subjected to analysis. The 30-day mortality was 12.4% among all trauma victims. Early (24-h) mortality was 1.9%, delayed (1-7 days) mortality was 7.3%, and late (8-30 days) mortality was 3.2%. Abnormal physiological parameters such as a low SBP, SpO2, and GCS and high HR and RR were observed among non-survivors. Early initiation of trauma assessment and monitoring on arrival was an important process of care indicator for predicting 30-day survival. Conclusions One in ten admitted trauma patients (12.4%) died in urban trauma centers in India. More than half of the trauma deaths were delayed, beyond 24 h but within one week following injury. On-admission physiological vital signs remain a valid predictor of early 24-h trauma mortality.

AB  - Poor oral health has broad consequences that can be seen at personal as well as societal levels, especially in developing countries like India. We have limited information on the healthy oral cavity's inhabitant microorganisms that play a crucial role in overall oral health. In a comprehensive culture-independent approach, the bacterial composition of healthy human oral cavities was determined from a sub-population of northern India. During this study, 20 mouthwash-derived metagenomes were explored for identifying bacterial diversity using the 16S rRNA hypervariable V3 region with the MiSeq Illumina platform. On the taxonomy assignment of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 20 assigned phyla and 162 genera were recovered among the participants. The mean relative abundance revealed thatStreptococcuswas the dominant genera among the participants. However, at inter-individual analysis,NeisseriaandHaemophilusexhibited first-order dominance among five and three healthy individuals, respectively. Correlation studies indicate thatStreptococcusshares a strong relationship withRothia,Corynebacterium,Prevotella, andVeillonella, whereas it was negatively correlated withNeisseria,Aggregatibacter,Porphyromonas, andFusobacterialike Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial diversity showed insignificant differences at the level of age and gender within and between the participants. The results support several of the major findings of previous reports on the healthy oral microbiome of the Indian population, however, the present investigation further illustrates that demographic region leaves an impact on overall bacterial composition. The study will assist in a better understanding of the oral microbiome from region-specific Indian population that was otherwise highly under-represented.

AB  - The efficacy of MRI-based statistical texture analysis (TA) in predicting chemotherapy response among patients with osteosarcoma was assessed. Forty patients (male: female = 31:9; age = 17.2 +/- 5.7 years) with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were analyzed in this prospective study. Patients were scheduled for three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition at three time points: at baseline (t0), after the first NACT (t1) and after the third NACT (t2) using a 1.5 T scanner. Eight patients (nonsurvivors) died during NACT while 34 patients (survivors) completed the NACT regimen followed by surgery. Histopathological evaluation was performed in the resected tumor to assess NACT response (responder [<= 50% viable tumor] and nonresponder [>50% viable tumor]) and revealed nonresponder: responder = 20:12. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters, diffusion coefficient(D), perfusion coefficient (D*) and perfusion fraction (f) were evaluated. A total of 25 textural features were evaluated onADC, D, D*andfparametric maps and structural T1-weighted (T1W) and T2-weighted (T2W) images in the entire tumor volume using 3D TA methods gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), neighborhood gray-tone-difference matrix (NGTDM) and run-length matrix (RLM). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis was performed on the selected textural feature set to assess the role of TA features (a) as marker(s) of tumor aggressiveness leading to mortality at baseline and (b) in predicting the NACT response among survivors in the course of treatment. Findings showed that the NGTDM features coarseness, busyness and strength quantifying tumor heterogeneity inD, D*andfmaps and T1W and T2W images were useful markers of tumor aggressiveness in identifying the nonsurvivor group (area-under-the-curve [AUC] = 0.82-0.88) at baseline. The GLCM features contrast and correlation, NGTDM features contrast and complexity and RLM feature short-run-low-gray-level-emphasis quantifying homogeneity/terogeneity in tumor were effective markers for predicting chemotherapeutic response usingD(AUC = 0.80),D*(AUC = 0.80) and T2W (AUC = 0.70) at t0, andD*(AUC = 0.80) andf(AUC = 0.70) at t1. 3D statistical TA features might be useful as imaging-based markers for characterizing tumor aggressiveness and predicting chemotherapeutic response in patients with osteosarcoma.

AB  - The spontaneous activity of the brain is dynamic even at rest and the deviation from this normal pattern of dynamics can lead to different pathological states. EEG microstate analysis of resting-state neuronal activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) could provide insight into altered brain dynamics of patients exhibiting dementia. Resting-state EEG microstate maps were derived from 128 channel EEG data in 20 PD without dementia (PDND), 18 PD with dementia (PDD) and 20 Healthy controls (CON) using Cartool and sLORETA softwares. Microstate map parameters including global explained variance, mean duration, frequency of occurrence (TF) and time coverage were compared statistically among the groups. Eight maps that explained 72% of the topographic variance were identified and only three maps differed significantly across the groups. TF of Map1 was lower in both PDND and PDD (p < 0.001) and that of Map3 (p = 0.02) in PDND compared to control. Cortical sources showed higher activation in precuneus, cuneus and superior parietal lobe (Threshold: Log-F = 1.74,p < 0.05) with maximum activity in the precuneus region (MNI co-ordinates: - 25, - 75, - 40; Log-F = 1.9) in PDND compared to control only for Map1. Lower TF of Map1 (prototypical microstate D) may potentially serve as a biomarker for PD with or without dementia whereas higher activation of precuneus, cuneus and superior parietal lobe at resting-state could favour signal processing, lack of which could be associated with dementia in Parkinson's disorder.

AB  - Objective We evaluate the potential utility of F-18 FDG-PET in addition to MRI in the diagnostic work-up of patients with autoimmune epilepsy (AE) and propose the inclusion of functional imaging in the antibody prevalence in epilepsy (APE) scoring system. Methods This was a retrospective analysis in 60 patients, diagnosed and treated for AE, of whom 40 were antibody negative (presumed AE) and 20 were antibody positive (definitive AE). All patients had undergone a dedicated brain and whole body FDG-PET in the department of Nuclear Medicine. Results In the antibody negative group, MRI supported a diagnosis of AE in 23 patients. Both MRI and PET were indicative in 12 cases, and standalone PET was positive in 8. While MRI alone was diagnostic in 57% (23/40), the combined yield of both modalities was 77% (31/40). When PET scores were added to assign the APE score in MRI negative cases, average APE score was 5.4. In the antibody positive group, MRI supported the diagnosis of AE in 7 patients. Both MRI and PET were positive in 4 patients and standalone PET was positive in 5 patients. While MRI alone was diagnostic in 35% (7/20), the combined yield of both modalities was 60% (12/20). When PET scores were added to assign the APE score in MRI negative cases, average APE score was 6.1. Conclusion The inclusion of metabolic information from PET distinctly improved (the sensitivity of) APE scores to predict autoimmune origin even in antibody negative cases. A larger prospective study of similar type could justify adoption of FDG-PET into the standard diagnostic procedure.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the imaging characteristics and associations in patients with isolation of arch vessels on multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA). Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed all multidetector CTA studies performed for the evaluation of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) at our institution from January 2014 to June 2020. Cases with isolation of arch vessels were identified. The isolated arch artery and its relationship with patent arterial duct, pulmonary artery, and aortic arch were characterized in addition to other associated intra- and extracardiac anomalies. Results Isolation of arch vessels was seen in 14/3926 (0.36%) patients. Left subclavian artery (SCA) was the commonest isolated arch vessel, involved in 7/14 (50%) cases. Isolation of right SCA, left brachiocephalic artery, and left common carotid artery was seen in 4 (28.6%), 2 (14.3%), and 1 (7.1%) patient, respectively. The isolated arch vessel was seen associated with right aortic arch in 10/14 (71.4%) cases and was on the opposite side of aortic arch in all 14 (100%) patients. Right-sided nonrestrictive patent arterial duct was seen in 3/14 (21.4%) cases, left-sided nonrestrictive patent arterial duct was seen in 1/14 (7.1%) while a left-sided restrictive patent arterial duct was seen in 3/14 (21.4%) cases. Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) was the commonest associated anomaly seen in 8/14 (57.1%) patients. Conclusion Isolation of aortic arch branch vessels is rare, seen most commonly associated with ToF. Left SCA is the commonest involved vessel. CTA is useful not only in the diagnosis of isolation of arch vessels, but also in the presence or absence of associated anomalies which may impact the symptomatology, prognosis, and surgical management.

AB  - Haemolacria is a rare condition that usually occurs secondary to a hidden pathology. On rare occasions when no underlying cause may be found, it is called essential idiopathic haemolacria. Here the authors report a case of a 13-year-old girl presented to the ophthalmology emergency department with spontaneous bloody tears from both eyes for the past six months. There was associated bleeding from the ear. The rest of the systemic and ophthalmology examinations were within normal limits. She was investigated systemically to look for any underlying pathology; however, her blood investigations, radiological imaging and local examinations performed by the Otorhinolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Gynaecology and Internal Medicine departments were all normal. A final diagnosis of bilateral essential haemolacria was made.

AB  - Background The impact of bariatric surgery on atherosclerosis is a relatively less studied subject. Obesity has been identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis and risk of CVD, has been found to be associated with obesity. Recent literature has shown that there is significant reduction in CIMT following bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on CIMT and risk of CVD in an Indian population. Methods This is a prospective study conducted in a tertiary referral centre in India. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery from December 2017 to September 2019 were included. CIMT measurements and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)-pooled cohort CVD risk scores were done before and at 6 months and 12 months after surgery. Results Fifty-four patients were enrolled, of which 70% were females. Mean age was 40.8 +/- 10.7 years. Mean pre-operative weight and mean BMI were 115.2 +/- 21.9 kg and 45.9 +/- 6.5 kg/m(2), respectively. Patients who completed 12-month follow-up were considered for analysis of outcomes. There was significant reduction in BMI to 33.1 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2)at 12 months after surgery (p < 0.0001). Mean CIMT reduced significantly from 0.58 +/- 0.08 mm at baseline to 0.52 +/- 0.10 mm at 12 months. Lipid profile, fasting blood sugar and HbA(1C)also improved, which resulted in reduction of lifetime and 10-year CVD risk from 42.3 to 26% and 4 to 1.5%, respectively, at 12 months after surgery. Conclusions Bariatric surgery results in significant reduction in CIMT and CVD risk in patients with morbid obesity.

AB  - Among conventional fabrication techniques, freeze-drying process has widely been investigated for polymeric implants. However, the understanding of the stem cell progenitor-dependent cell functionality modulation and quantitative analysis of early osseointegration of highly porous scaffolds have not been explored. Here, we developed a novel, highly porous, multimaterial composite, chitosan/hydroxyapatite/polycaprolactone (CHT/HA/PCL). The in vitro studies have been performed using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from three tissue sources: human bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs), and Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs). Although cell attachment and metabolic activity [3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl-(2,5 diphenyl-2H-tetrazoliumbromide) assay] were ore enhanced in WJ-MSC-laden CHT/HA/PCL composites, scanning electron microscopy, real-time gene expression (alkaline phosphatase [ALP], collagen type I [Col I], osteocalcin [OCN], and bone morphogenetic protein 4 [BMP-4]), and immunostaining (COL I, beta-CATENIN, OCN, and SCLEROSTIN [SOST]) demonstrated pronounced osteogenesis with terminal differentiation on BM-MSC-laden CHT/HA/PCL composites only. The enhanced cell functionality on CHT/HA/PCL composites was explained in terms of interplay among the surface properties and the optimal source of MSCs. In addition, osteogenesis in rat tibial model over 6 weeks confirmed a better ratio of bone volume to the total volume for BM-MSC-laden composites over scaffold-only and defect-only groups. The clinically conformant combination of 3D porous architecture with pore sizes varying in the range of 20 - 200 mu m together with controlled in vitro degradation and early osseointegration establish the potential of CHT/HA/PCL composite as a potential cancellous bone analog.

AB  - Purpose To present a radiographic analysis of the anatomy of the lumbar plexus and retroperitoneal blood vessels with respect to psoas morphology and safe working zones (SWZ) for LLIF. Methods A retrospective radiographic analysis of 158 MRI scans was performed. Selected morphometric measurements were performed at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels: disc anteroposterior distance, psoas anteroposterior distance, lumbar plexus-anterior disc distance, lumbar plexus-anterior psoas distance, vena cava-anterior disc distance and calculation of SWZ in psoas on both left and right sides. The morphometric measurements were analysed for differences with sex and the level. Results All the morphometric parameters differed significantly at all levels between males and females. The SWZ was significantly wider on the left side compared to the right-at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels in females and at L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels in males. The SWZ at L4-L5 was narrowest on both left and right sides-and significantly reduced compared to other levels. 6.9% patients had a SWZ > 20 mm on the left side, and 44.9% patients had SWZ < 20 mm on the right side. With caudal progression of levels, the lumbar plexus and psoas muscle migrated anteriorly and the vena cava/right iliac vein migrated posteriorly. Conclusion A detailed study of preoperative MRI scans should be carried out in patients planned for LLIF-particularly, at L4-L5 level and in females. A left-sided trans-psoas approach is safer to perform compared to the right side-a right-sided approach should be avoided at L4-L5 considering the narrow SWZ at that level.

AB  - Urogenital tuberculosis is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Genital organ involvement occurs as a continuum of urinary tract tuberculosis and often presents a diagnostic challenge due to the non-specific nature of the symptoms. Delay in diagnosis may lead to complications such as infertility and perineoscrotal sinuses. Imaging plays an important role in raising timely suspicion of tuberculosis. In this article, we describe the imaging findings of male genital tuberculosis and the differential diagnosis. High-resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) is the best modality for assessing the epididymis, testis, scrotum and vas deferens, whereas MRI is optimal for evaluating the prostate, seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts. Epididymis is the most common site of genital tuberculosis, and presents as a nodular lesion limited to the tail or as diffuse enlargement. The proximal vas deferens is also frequently involved due to anatomical contiguity and shows diffuse or nodular thickening. Advanced cases may show pyocele formation and scrotal wall sinuses. Testicular involvement is almost always secondary to epididymal tuberculosis and presents as single or multiple nodules, diffuse enlargement, or the 'miliary' pattern. Isolated testicular involvement should raise suspicion of malignancy. Tuberculosis of the prostate is often asymptomatic. The most common imaging manifestations are nodules and the diffuse forms, which may later evolve into abscesses. Fibrosis and calcification occur with healing. Seminal vesicle and ejaculatory duct involvement with fibrosis may cause infertility. Awareness of the imaging findings would enable the radiologist to raise timely suspicion, so that prompt treatment is initiated and complications are prevented.

AB  - Obese individuals are prone to vitamin D deficiency because of sequestration of vitamin D in their body fat. We planned to evaluate the rise in serum 25(OH)D levels in vitamin D-deficient obese vs normal body mass index(BMI) children, after administration of identical single dose of vitamin D. Twenty-two obese and 22 normal BMI children with serum 25 (OH)D < 20 ng/mL were given single oral dose 150,000 IU vitamin D, and 25 (OH)D levels were measured at 1 week and 1 month post-intervention. Results show that rise in 25(OH)D level from baseline was about 2.2 times lesser in obese compared with children with normal BMI, both at 1 week and at 1 month. The rise in 25(OH)D from baseline to 1 month was inversely correlated to BMI (r = - 0.56,p = < 0.001), waist circumference (r = - 0.48,p = 0.001), total fat mass (r = - 0.58,p < 0.001), and fat mass index (r = - 0.59,p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The obese children have a 2.2 times lower rise in serum vitamin D levels as compared with the normal BMI children for the same dose of vitamin D supplementation.

AB  - Misdiagnosed PAS confirmed at medicolegal autopsy Pulmonary artery sarcoma (PAS) is a rare disease and usually indistinguishable from acute or chronic thromboembolic disease of the pulmonary arteries. We present a case of pulmonary artery sarcoma in a 54-year-old male, who was clinically misdiagnosed as pulmonary thromboembolism. The patient died of disease; however, the actual diagnosis of PAS was made after a medicolegal autopsy. PAS can be a diagnostic challenge for both clinicians and pathologists. In an autopsy case with a clinical suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism, if there is an abnormal gross appearance in the pulmonary artery, the forensic pathologist should have a high index of suspicion of PAS, which should be ruled out by a histopathologic examination.

AB  - We conducted a prospective, observational study to assess the serum chymase level, a mast cell derived protease, as a predictor of dengue severity. NS1-positive non-severe dengue patients of age >= 14 years with duration of fever <= 4 days were included in the study. At the time of admission, the serum sample was taken for chymase estimation. Patients were followed up to four days after they became afebrile to find out the final diagnosis. Total of 338 non-severe dengue patients were recruited (mean age: 29.15 years; male: 66%). On follow-up, 26 patients (7.8%) developed severe dengue. Only chymase level (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.787; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.309-2.440) and platelet count at admission (aOR: 0.981; 95% CI: 0.968-0.993) were able to predict the severity after adjustment for all variables. But, for prediction of severe dengue, the area under receiver ' s operating curve of chymase was 0.835 (95% CI: 0.765-0.905), which was significantly higher than that of the platelet count at admission (0.760, 95% CI: 0.650-0.870) (p < .001). Patients who developed severe dengue in due course of illness had significantly higher serum chymase level at admission as compared with the rest of the patients. Similar findings were noted across all age-groups. At an optimum cut-off value of 1.35 ng/ml, chymase had a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 3.5 and a negative LR of 0.15, for predicting severe dengue. This study demonstrated the potential ability of serum chymase levels at admission, as a biomarker for prediction of severe dengue in due course of illness.

AB  - Objective To assess the oral health status, perception and dental treatment needs in patients of schizophrenia in the hospital set-up in Rohtak district, Haryana. Methods and result A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the oral health in patients of schizophrenia at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana amongst patients with <= 48 score on BPRS. A modified Dental Coping Belief Scale along with a structured questionnaire and clinical examination were recorded. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in relation to demographic variables. Amongst 111 subjects, 74.4% were males and the mean age was 34.73 +/- 9.9 years. Around 77.5% had habit of regular mouth rinsing, 72% and 3% brushed their teeth once and twice daily, respectively. Subjects had high negative oral health beliefs and external locus of control for oral health. Compared to the general population, mean OHI (8.4 +/- 2.5) and DMFT (3.09 +/- 2.9) scores were higher. Nearly, 66% patients had gingival pockets and around 7% showed attachment loss above 3 mm or gingival recession. Conclusion Patients with schizophrenia have much poorer oral health as compared to general population. They are aware of their poor oral hygiene but are not motivated enough to take care of their oral health. A multifaceted approach is required to plan and undertake effective oral health preventive and rehabilitative measures for this special group.

AB  - Background Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is typically caused by defects inATP6V0A4,ATP6V1B1, andSLC4A1, accounting for 60-80% of patients.Genes recently implicated includeFOXI1,ATP6V1C2, andWDR72, of whichWDR72is associated with dental enamel defects. Methods We describe 4 patients, from three unrelated consanguineous families, with RTA and amelogenesis imperfecta. Distal tubular acidification was evaluated by furosemide-fludrocortisone test, urine-to-blood PCO2 gradient and fractional excretion of bicarbonate. Exome sequencing was performed using a panel of genes implicated in human disease. Results Patients had polyuria, hypokalemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis, but metabolic acidosis varied in severity. Although all patients acidified urine to pH < 5.3 during furosemide-fludrocortisone test, urine-to-blood PCO(2)gradient was < 20 mmHg during bicarbonate loading. All patients had transient proximal tubular dysfunction with urinary losses of phosphate and beta-2-microglobulin, and generalized aminoaciduria. Homozygous pathogenic truncating variants inWDR72was detected in all probands. Conclusion Patients withWDR72mutations show mild rate-dependent distal RTA with variable metabolic acidosis, and intact ability to acidify the urine on provocative testing. Concomitant proximal tubular dysfunction may be present. Mutations inWDR72should be considered in patients with suspected distal RTA, especially if associated with dental defects.

AB  - Arsenic exposure is well documented to cause serious health hazards, such as cardiovascular abnormalities, neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In the present study, we intended to explore the role of bosentan, an endothelial receptor antagonist, against sodium arsenite-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in rats. Sodium arsenite (5 mg/kg, oral) was administered for 4 weeks to induce renal dysfunction in rats. Sodium arsenite intoxicated rats were treated with bosentan (50 and 100 mg/kg, oral) for 4 weeks. Arsenic led renal damage was demonstrated by significant increase in serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, potassium, fractional excretion of sodium, microproteinuria and decreased creatinine clearance in rats. Sodium arsenite resulted in marked oxidative stress in rat kidneys as indicated by profound increase in lipid peroxides, and superoxide anion generation alongwith decrease in reduced glutathione levels. Hydroxyproline assay highlighted arsenic-induced renal fibrosis in rats. Hematoxylin-eosin staining indicated glomerular and tubular changes in rat kidneys. Picrosirius red staining highlighted collagen deposition in renal tissues of arsenic treated rats. Immunohistological results demonstrated the reduction of renal eNOS expression in arsenic treated rats. Notably, treatment with bosentan attenuated arsenic-induced renal damage and resisted arsenic-led reduction in renal eNOS expression. In addition, sodium arsenite-induced alteration in hepatic parameters (serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), oxidative stress and histological changes were abrogated by bosentan treatment in rats. Hence, we conclude that bosentan treatment attenuated sodium arsenite-induced oxidative stress, fibrosis and reduction in renal eNOS expression in rat kidneys. Moreover, bosentan abrogated arsenic led hepatic changes in rats.

AB  - We report a 2-year-old child with congenital hydrocephalus who presented with a frontal meningocoele due to ventriculo-subgaleal fistula secondary to hydrocephalus (internal rupture), which gradually ruptured spontaneously through the skin. This case is unique given its association with occipital encephalocele and is only the second case to present with external rupture beyond the age of 1 year. Further, the ventricles have ruptured through the skull, after the closure of anterior fontanelle, into the subgaleal space. It challenges the present understanding that external rupture occurs only through an open anterior fontanelle.

AB  - Introduction Ideal surgical positioning and placement of implants during arthroplasty are crucial for long-term survival and optimal functional outcomes. Inadequate bone stock or defects, and anatomical variations can influence the outcomes. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is an evolving technology that could provide patient-specific instrumentation and implants for arthroplasty, taking into account anatomical variations and defects. However, its application in this field is still not adequately studied and described. The present review was conceptualised to assess the practicality, the pros and cons and the current status of usage of 3DP in the field of hip and knee arthroplasties and joint reconstruction surgeries. Methods A PubMed database search was conducted and a total number of 135 hits were obtained, out of which only 30 articles were relevant. These 30 studies were assessed to obtain the qualitative evidence of the applicability and the current status of 3D printing in arthroplasty. Results Currently, 3DP is used for preoperative planning with 3D models, to assess bone defects and anatomy, to determine the appropriate cuts and to develop patient-specific instrumentation and implants (cages, liners, tibial base plates, femoral stem). Its models can be used for teaching and training young surgeons, as well as patient education regarding the surgical complexities. The outcomes of using customised instrumentations and implants have been promising and 3D printing can evolve into routine practice in the years to come. Conclusion 3D printing in arthroplasty is an evolving field with promising results; however, current evidence is insufficient to determine significant advantages that can be termed cost effective and readily available.

AB  - Objective To compare fibrin glue (with three cardinal sutures) (FG) and polygalactin suture (PS) for mucous membrane grafting (MMG) in terms of graft apposition and recurrence of lid margin keratinization (LMK) and metaplastic lashes (ML) in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Design Prospective randomized comparative interventional study. Methods Twenty patients diagnosed with SJS and lid margin abnormalities including LMK with or without ML were randomized to undergo either fibrin glue (FG)-assisted MMG (n = 10) or continuous 8-0 polygalactin suture (PS)-assisted MMG (n = 10). They were evaluated preoperatively and during follow-up at 1 week and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. The parameters assessed were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer-1 test, corneal and conjunctival complications, graft apposition and width (GW), LMK, ML, impression cytology, and operative time. The primary outcome measures are incidence of graft displacement and recurrence of LMK and ML. Results None of the eyelids in FG group (0/40) and 1 eyelid in PS group (1/40) had graft displacement. Recurrence of LMK occurred in 7.5% of eyelids (3/40) in both the study groups. Recurrence of ML occurred in 2.5% (1/40) in FG group and 5% (2/40) in PS group. The mean operative time for MMG in FG group was 39.5 +/- 2.40 min and in PS group was 56 +/- 1.63 min (p = 0.001). Conclusions As graft apposition with suture involves significantly longer intraoperative time, if cost is not a limiting factor then fibrin glue is a viable option for the MMG for lid margin pathologies.

AB  - Introduction The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has led to severe disruption of healthcare services worldwide. We conducted this study to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients who were enrolled in the nation-wide inception cohort. Methods A questionnaire was administered to the SLE patients enrolled in the inception cohort. Questions related to the effect on disease activity, preventive measures adopted against COVID-19, the incidence of COVID-19, hardships faced in getting access to health care professionals and availability of medicines, adherence, fear of COVID-19 and the potential benefits of being part of the registry. Results A total of 1040 (90% females) patients completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 27.5 +/- 19.1 years and the mean disease duration was 1.25 years. Twenty-Four (2.3%) patients had developed fever (>1 day) during this period, including one patient with additional symptoms of diarrhoea and anosmia, however, none of the patients developed COVID-19 infection. 262 patients (25.2%) reported financial difficulty during this period and patients reported an average excess expenditure of at least 2255.45 INR ($30) per month. 378 patients (36%) reported problems in getting their prescribed medicines due to lockdown. Of these, 167 (40%) patients needed to change their medication schedule due to this non-availability. Almost 54% of patients missed their scheduled follow up visits during the lockdown period and 37% of patients were unable to get their investigations done due to closure of laboratories and hospitals. 266 patients (25.5%) reported worsening of various symptoms of SLE during this period. Almost 61% patients felt confident that being associated with the inception cohort had helped them in managing their disease better during this period of lockdown as they received help in the form of timely and frequent telephonic consults, assistance in making the medicines available, and regular counselling resulting in abetment of their fears and anxieties. Conclusion The current COVID-19 pandemic has made a huge impact on our SLE patients. Patients faced difficulty in the availability of medicines, missed the doses of medicines, had financial constraints, and spent more money on health during the pandemic.

AB  - Background/Aims Evidence mapping of systematic reviews (SRs) systematically and comprehensively identifies, organizes, and summarizes the distribution of scientific evidence in a field. The aims of this study were to delineate domains in dental traumatology (DT), evaluate the existing SRs within the domains, and identify the paucity of evidence for future research. Methods Domains and sub-domains of DT were established according to the methods of qualitative research. The protocol for evidence mapping was prepared as per the guidelines of GEM and PRISMA. The search strategy was formulated using words and MeSH terms in eight databases without restriction of languages and year of publication. Gray literature, protocol registries, and references of selected articles were also searched. Duplicates were removed, and the final selection of SRs was completed. Data extraction and quality analysis using the ROBIS tool and the PRISMA checklist were performed. Results The overall search resulted in 64 SRs from 1999 to 2020 with 44 published in last six years. The highest number of SRs had been performed in the Prognostic domain (n = 19) followed by the domains of Epidemiology (n = 15), Therapeutics (n = 10), Oral Biology (n = 7), Diagnostics (n = 6), Preventive (n = 5), and Research Methods (n = 2). Within each domain, there were variabilities in the number of reviewers, a priori protocols, search limitations, risk of bias methods, and meta-analysis. Of the SRs, including 4 Cochrane reviews, 28.4% were inconclusive. A low risk of bias was found in 48.4% of the SRs. Among the registered and ongoing SRs, six were from the domain of epidemiology, two in the domain of therapeutics, five from prognostics, and one each in the domains of prevention and research methods. Conclusion The SRs in DT could be mapped in seven domains with variabilities in the methods. The majority had an a priori registered protocol and a low risk of reporting errors. Within the Epidemiology and Preventive domains, SRs were present in all the sub-domains with the majority demonstrating low-risk of bias (ROB). The domain of prognosis had SRs in most sub-domains but with a high ROB. Insufficient numbers of SRs were present in most sub-domains of the Diagnostics, Therapeutics, Research Methods and Oral Biology domains.

AB  - Objectives To ascertain if topical lignocaine application in oropharynx prior to swab sampling to test for COVID-19 improves a patient's comfort and to assess its effect on the swab sample taken to conduct the RT-PCR. Methods Adult patients testing positive on the RT-PCR COVID-19 test were sampled again within 48 h after administering topical oropharyngeal anaesthesia. Patients were asked to rate their discomfort on a visual analog scale (VAS) for both sample A and B. A qualitative real-time RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, was performed, and the cycle threshold value (Ct), used as a surrogate marker for the viral load, was measured for the sample taken without lignocaine (sample A) and the sample taken post-lignocaine application (sample B). The difference in Ct values of both the groups was checked for any statistical significance using paired t-test. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used on VAS scores to determine any significant decrease in discomfort. Results Forty patients were included in the study. Twenty-nine patients (72.5%) reported the procedure to be more comfortable post-lignocaine application. Median (IQR) discomfort on VAS decreased from 7 (1) to 5 (2) after lignocaine use, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean Ct value for sample A was 17.21 +/- 5.25 and for sample B was 18.44 +/- 4.8 (p > 0.05), indicating a non-significant effect of lignocaine on SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the sample. Conclusion Topical lignocaine, while improving the comfort of the procedure of oropharyngeal sampling for patient did not alter the SARS-CoV-2 viral load that was detected in nasal and oropharyngeal samples taken together.

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - Steroids may play a critical role in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), given the dearth of specific therapeutic options. This review was conducted to evaluate the impact of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with COVID-19 based on the publications reported to date. A comprehensive screening was conducted using electronic databases up to August 19, 2020. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of steroids in patients with COVID-19 are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved twelve studies, including two RCTs and 10 cohort studies, with a total of 15,754 patients. In patients with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid neither reduce mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-3.4,I-2 = 96%), nor the duration of hospital stay (mean difference [MD] = 1.18 days, 95% CI: -1.28 to 3.64,I-2 = 93%) and period of viral shedding (MD = 1.42 days, 95% CI: -0.52 to 3.37,I-2 = 0%). Systemic steroid therapy may not be effective for reducing mortality, duration of hospitalization, and period of viral shedding. Studies are mostly heterogeneous. Further RCTs are required.

AB  - Purpose: We describe a single sitting modified technique of pterygium surgery along with corneal tattooing for combined cosmetic rehabilitation in eyes with corneal opacity and pterygium or pseudopterygium. Method: Five patients with corneal opacity due to healed keratitis/optically failed therapeutic grafts along with pterygium or pseudopterygium underwent combined pterygium surgery by head inversion technique and corneal tattooing in the same sitting. All patients had no visual prognosis in that eye and surgery was indicated for cosmetic reasons only. Results: At 6 months follow up no complications of pterygium surgery like recurrence, thinning, dellen, infections were noted in any patient. The dye was retained in the cornea and the cosmetic rehabilitation was excellent in all patients. Discussion: Corneal tattooing combined with pterygium/pseudopterygium surgery can be performed in a single sitting with this novel technique in eyes with no visual potential. This is particularly suitable for eyes with limbal stem cell deficiency or large pterygia/pseudopterygia where conjunctival autograft is not advisable. These patients are often apprehensive for an allograft from their only seeing other eye

AB  - Introduction Up to 10% of patients with lichen planus (LP) have nail involvement; still there is a paucity of studies on histopathological features. Nevertheless, nail biopsy is the diagnostic standard, especially for isolated nail LP. Methodology Nails of 45 patients with nail LP were evaluated clinically and biopsies taken from most involved nail (25 nail bed and 20 matrix biopsies). Correlation of clinical and histopathological features was also done. Results The mean age of the study group participants was 36.91 +/- 18.27 years with a M:F ratio of 1.81:1. The most common clinical variant of LP seen was oral LP (51%), with isolated nail involvement in 29%. Clinically, major features were onychorrhexis (92.3%), longitudinal melanonychia (74.3%), and nail bed erythema (54%). Histopathologically, hypergranulosis of nail matrix and bed epithelium (51.1%), followed by sawtooth acanthosis (44.4%) and lichenoid band (24.4%) were most common. A diagnosis using prevalent diagnostic criteria was confirmed in 51.1% biopsies. Distinctive "fraying of nail plate," a change not previously described, was noted in 33.3% cases. Conclusion Histopathology of nail LP has been attributed a diagnostic role; however, existing diagnostic criteria are not sensitive enough and need refinement. Not hitherto described features like fraying of nail plate are seen in a significant number of cases.

AB  - Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a group of neoplasms arising from the diffuse endocrine system (DES). The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the most common site of NEN. The WHO classification divides NEN into three broad categories viz. well-differentiated NENs, poorly differentiated NENs, and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms. All GIT NEN have the potential to synthesize and secrete various bioactive substances which may lead to various clinical syndromes. The NEN may occur anywhere in the GIT and exhibit varying clinical presentation, prognosis, and metastatic potential. Further, some tumors show association with familial syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 1. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography-CT are the imaging modalities useful in the diagnosis, localization, and staging of GIT NEN. Management depends on the site, size, grade, and stage of the tumor with interventional radiology playing a significant role in some cases. This imaging review describes the role of a radiologist in the management of GIT NEN.

AB  - Background Two-dimensional high-definition (2D HD) endovision system is preferred for laparoscopic surgery. Recently, new generation three-dimensional (3D) HD and ultra-HD (4K) endovision systems are introduced to improve the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic surgery. There is limited evidence on superiority of one technology over the others. This experimental trial was designed to evaluate 2D HD, 3D HD and 4K HD endovision systems in performance of standardized tasks. Methods This was a randomized, cross-over experimental study. Twenty-one surgical residents who were exposed to laparoscopic surgery were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned into three groups. Each group performed standardised tasks i.e. peg transfer, precision cutting, navigating in space and intra-corporeal suturing using 2D HD, 4K HD and 3D HD endovision systems on a box trainer. Procedures were recorded as 2D HD videos and analysed later. Participant's perceived workload was assessed using Surg-TLX questionnaire. Primary endpoints were execution time in seconds and error score. Secondary endpoint was workload assessment. Results The 3D HD had shorter execution time compared to 2D HD and 4K HD in all tasks except precision cutting (p = 0.004, 0.03, 0.001, 0.001 andp = 0.002, 0.191, 0.006, 0.005 in peg transfer, precision cutting, navigating in space and intra-corporeal suturing respectively). The 4K HD was significantly faster than 2D HD only in navigating in space task (p = 0.002). The error score between 3D HD and 4K HD were comparable in all tasks. The 2D HD had significantly more error scores compared to 4K HD, 3D HD in peg transfer task (p = 0.005, 0.014, respectively). 3D HD had significantly less workload than 2D HD and 4K HD in most of the dimensions of Surg-TLX Conclusions 3D HD endovision system in comparison to 2D HD and 4K HD, may lead to faster execution without compromising safety of a task and is associated with less workload.

AB  - Introduction The AJCC 8th edition TNM classification for lung cancer was released in 2017. This edition has made major changes in many tumor descriptors including sites of metastasis. The new staging system has been a subject of multiple validation studies, of which many have had mixed results. The present study is designed to critically evaluate the results of these external validation studies. Methods A metaanalysis of these external validation studies was performed to critically evaluate the new staging system. Out of 12 studies, 8 were found to fulfill the eligibility criteria, with 654,185 patients being included in the analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) extracted from these studies were utilized for analysis. The primary outcomes were survival discrimination and prognostic ability of the 8th edition compared with the 7th edition. Results The HRs for the 8th edition staging system were 1.41 in IB, 1.64 in IIA, 1.24 in IIB, 1.95 in IIIA, 3.96 in IIIB, and 4.82 in IIIC compared with IA. The new edition fared better than the 7th edition in survival discrimination in all but stage IIA and IIB. TheC-index of the 8th and 7th editions was 0.690 and 0.688, respectively, suggesting almost similar prognostic values. Conclusions This study shows that the survival discrimination of the 8th edition fared better than the 7th edition in all but stage IIA and IIB. The prognostic value of the two staging systems is similar, with no added advantage of the new edition.

AB  - Purpose Accurate diagnosis is required for management of Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The conventional method for detection of mutations in theCYP21A2gene is targeted capillary sequencing which is labor intensive and has limited multiplexing capability. Next generation sequencing (NGS) provides data with high sequence coverage and depth. Our objective was to develop an accurate NGS-based assay to characterize the mutation spectrum inCYP21A2gene in Indian patients suspected to have 21-OH CAH. Methods Cases with 21-OH CAH from 12 endocrine units across India were studied. DNA was extracted from proband's and parent's(subset) blood. Locus-specific long-range PCR and gel electrophoresis of amplicons was followed by NGS where no visible 30 kb homozygous/whole gene deletion was observed. Orthogonal confirmation was performed by capillary sequencing (ABI 3500) and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA, MRC-Holland). PCR products were purified and individual libraries were pooled and sequenced (Illumina). Results Of the 310 CAH cases, biallelic mutations (pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variants involving bothCYP21A2gene copies) were detected in 256 (82.6%), heterozygous mutations in 13 (4.2 %), and none in 41 (13.2%). Most common mutation was c.293-13A/C>G (29.03%), followed by 30 kb deletion (18.24%). Thirty samples tested orthogonally (by capillary sequencing or MLPA) showed 100% concordance with NGS assay. Nine novel variants were identified. Conclusions We have developed and validated a comprehensive NGS-based assay for detection of variants inCYP21A2gene in patients with 21-OH CAH. We describeCYP21A2mutation spectrum and novel variants in a large cohort of Indian patients with CAH.

AB  - Background Bariatric surgery is associated with a positive impact on the degree of hepatic steatosis and inflammation in nonalcoholic associated fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although its effect on fibrosis is contentious. The role of Fibroscan in the post-bariatric assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis is unclear. Objectives This work aims to study the impact of bariatric surgery on the course of NAFLD using both invasive (liver biopsy) and non-invasive tests (biochemical parameters and Fibroscan). Methods In this prospective study, the impact of bariatric surgery on the course of NAFLD was assessed using paired liver biopsy (intra-operative and post-bariatric surgery 1-year follow-up). The liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) cutoffs for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, respectively, were calculated in both pre- and post-bariatric settings. Results Fifty-eight patients (70.7% females, mean age 39.2 years) underwent paired liver biopsy. Post-bariatric surgery 1-year liver biopsy showed significant improvement in all the histopathological parameters of NAFLD. The mean NAFLD Activity Score declined from 2.81 (+/- 1.08) to 1.31 (+/- 1.39) post-bariatric surgery. Thirty (51.7%) patients showed improvement in fibrosis, eighteen (31%) no change, and ten (17.2%) had worsening. Worsening of fibrosis was associated with a higher median age of 44.5 versus 38 years (pvalue = 0.033). The CAP cutoff values for the various stages of hepatic steatosis were higher pre-operatively as compared with those obtained post-bariatric surgery. Conclusions Bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvement in histopathological parameters of NAFLD. Fibroscan shows good diagnostic accuracy in detecting advanced stage and grade of NAFLD.

AB  - Hemostasis is dependent on sufficient quantity and quality of circulating functional platelets. Platelet function in trauma patients with thrombocytopenia and its impact on the clinical outcome is not adequately explored. Whether platelet dysfunction has a role in the pathogenesis of acute traumatic coagulopathy needs to be studied. Blood samples were collected from 70 thrombocytopenic trauma patients before transfusing platelets and assessed for platelet activation and platelet aggregation using flowcytometry. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Platelet dysfunction was identified in 57.1% of thrombocytopenic trauma patients. A weak inverse correlation between percentage of activated platelets and APTT was observed (Spearman coefficient - 0.25, p = 0.03). A sensitivity and specificity of 66.6% was achieved for a cut off of <= 6.5% of platelet activation post trauma with ROCAUC of 0.658 for identifying coagulopathy. No correlation with mortality however was observed (p > 0.05). Platelet dysfunction had a weak association with coagulopathy suggesting limited contribution of platelet dysfunction in pathogenesis of acute traumatic coagulopathy and warrants further research.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the benefits of myoinositol plus metformin versus myoinositol alone in infertile polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women undergoing ovulation induction cycles. Materials and methods Total 116 infertile PCOS women were randomized: Group I (n = 57): metformin (1500 mg) plus myoinositol (4 g) per day; Group II (n=59): myoinositol 4 g per day. Subjects were advised to try for spontaneous conception. Those who did not conceive after three months were given three cycles of ovulation induction. Primary outcome was clinical pregnancy rate after 6 months. Secondary outcomes were improvement in metabolic and endocrine parameters, ongoing pregnancy, abortion and multiple pregnancy rate. Results Baseline demographic, metabolic and hormonal parameters were comparable in two groups. After 3 months of therapy, both study groups had comparable improvement in metabolic and hormonal parameters. After 6 months, clinical pregnancy rate was 42.0% in Group I and 45.5% Group II respectively (RR 0.92(95% CI:0.60-1.43) (p > .05). Side-effects (mainly gastrointestinal) were significantly higher in Group I than group II. Conclusions Myoinositol (4 g) might be used alone as an insulin sensitizer to improve metabolic, hormonal and reproductive outcome in infertile PCOS women. Further studies with large numbers are warranted to confirm the role of myoinostiol as a sole insulin sensitizer.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA), a disorder of joints, is prevalent in older age. The contemporary cure for OA is aimed to confer symptomatic relief, consisting of temporary pain and swelling relief. In this paper, we discuss various modalities responsible for the onset of OA and associated with its severity. Inhibition of chondrocytes receptors such as DDR2, SDF-1, Asporin, and CXCR4 by specific pharmacological inhibitors attenuates OA, a critical step for finding potential disease modifying drugs. We critically analyzed recent OA studies with an emphasis on intermediate target molecules for OA intervention. We also explored some novel and safe treatments for OA by considering disease prognosis crosstalk with cellular signaling pathways.

AB  - A six-month-old girl was taken from her mother's lap by a macaque monkey (Macaca) that had entered the room through an open door. The monkey escaped with the infant but subsequently dropped her from a rooftop terrace. Death occurred soon after impact with the ground, and was found at autopsy to be due to blunt cranio-cerebral trauma with skull fractures and intracranial haemorrhage. Monkeys and apes may cause a variety of serious and potentially life-threatening injuries and may manifest quite unpredictable and aggressive behaviour around humans. The very young are particularly vulnerable to primate attacks, and 'baby theft' by apes and monkeys is an event that has now been reported, albeit rarely, in a number of different countries around the world. The fatally injured infants have died from bites, falls and drowning. Chimpanzees in the wild may also specifically hunt human infants for food.

AB  - Background and Aim Although the gut microbiome of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has been characterized, no study has characterized the gut microbiome in acute severe colitis (ASC). We compared the gut microbiome of patients with UC, ASC, and healthy controls (HCs). Methods Patients with mild to moderate UC (n = 24), ASC (n = 19 with 21 episodes) and HCs (n = 50) were recruited prospectively. A 16SrDNA amplicon approach was used to explore gut microbial diversity and taxonomic repertoires. UC was diagnosed using European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidelines, and ASC was diagnosed using Truelove and Witts' criteria. Results The normalized alpha diversity was significantly lower in ASC than mild-moderately active UC (P < 0.05) or HC (P < 0.001). The gut microbiome in ASC was highly unstable, as characterized by high intracohort variation (analyzed using J-divergence measure), which was significantly greater than in UC or HC. On principal coordinate analysis, the microbiome of HC and UC were similar, with the ASC cohort being distinct from both. Comparison of ranked abundances identified four distinct clusters of genera (G1, G2, G3, and G4), with specific trends in their abundance across three groups: G1/G2A clusters had the least, whereas G3 had the highest abundance in the ASC cohort. Conclusions Gut microbial diversity is lower in ASC than mild-moderate UC or HCs. Gut microbiome composition is increasingly unstable in ASC, with a distinct abundance of specific genera varying between HCs and ASC. Mild-moderate UC lies within the spectrum.

AB  - Bacopa monnieri(L.) Wettst. (BM) has been traditionally used in Ayurveda for improving memory and cognitive deficits which is also evidenced through experimental and clinical studies. The neuropharmacological properties of BM are attributed to "bacosides", a complex mixture of saponin compounds. BM extracts enriched with bacosides offers commercial advantage due to perceived higher efficacy. However, there is no scientific data to support the same. In the present study, methanolic extract of BM (BME) was compared with bacosides enriched (BME-EF) vis a vis bacosides free fraction (BME-FF). Potential antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity has been evaluated usingin vitroandin vivomethods. BME showed not only the highest anti-amnesic efficacy but also antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity, followed by either BME-FF or BME-EF. Interestingly, no significant differences were found in between the groups. These findings dispel the notion that bacosides enrichment enhances anti-amnesic efficacy and also suggests the contribution of other components.

AB  - Background Targeted anti-IL-1 beta therapy may be a valuable option for the management of gouty arthritis. The present meta-analysis has evaluated the effect of canakinumab, an anti-IL-1 beta monoclonal antibody in gouty arthritis. Methods A standard meta-analysis protocol was developed and after performing a comprehensive literature search in MEDLINE, Cochrane, and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data from three relevant articles. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size as the mean difference in Visual Analouge Scale (VAS) score, serum hsCRP, serum Amyloid A, and risk ratio for global assessment between the groups. Quality assessment was done using the risk of bias assessment tool and summary of findings was prepared using standard Cochrane methodology with GradePro GDT. Results Treatment with canakinumab showed a mean reduction of VAS score by 14.59 mm [95% CI - 19.42 to - 9.77], serum hsCRP by 15.36 mg/L [95% CI 1.62-29.11], serum Amyloid A by 67.18 mg/L [95% CI 17.06-117.31], and improvement in patient global assessment (RR = 1.478; 95% CI 1.29-1.67) and physician global assessment (RR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.28-1.61). The probability that future studies may have a mean difference in VAS score less than zero has been calculated to be 27.3% using a cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculator. Conclusion This meta-analysis shows the beneficial effect of canakinumab over triamcinolone by reducing VAS score, serum hsCRP, serum amyloid A, and improvement in global assessments in acute gouty arthritis.

AB  - Imaging devices in ophthalmology are numerous, and most of them are sophisticated and specialized for specific regions of the eye. In addition, these are fixed and involve close interaction of the patient and the examiner; therefore, simple, portable and tele facility-imbibed imaging tools can be considered optimal alternatives to routine exercises. In the last 10 years, utility of smartphones in ophthalmology is being continuously explored to unearth their potential benefits. In this direction, a smartphone device with/without simple attachments has been noted to aid in detailed, high-quality imaging of the ocular adnexa, cornea, angle, iris, lens, optic disc, and the retina including its periphery. In addition, such utility has also been extended in strabismology workup and intraocular pressure measurements. Hence, using these clinician friendly tools and techniques or by devising newer and more comprehensive tool kits, ophthalmic care can be well-managed with apt use of technology. Also, the smartphone companies are encouraged to collaborate with the medical experts to endeavor more, and help and serve the people better.

AB  - Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is the result of a clonal plasma cell disorder which causes organ damage by deposition of misfolded light chains. Kidney is a common site of amyloid deposition. Proteinuria, usually in nephrotic range and unexplained renal insufficiency are the main manifestations of renal injury. We report a unique case of renal involvement by AL amyloidosis masquerading as metabolic bone disease. 38 year old male patient presented with progressively increasing diffuse bony pains, low backache and proximal weakness of both lower limbs since two years. On investigation, he was detected to have hypophosphatemic osteomalacia due to renal phosphate loss which was fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)- independent. He also had nephrotic range low molecular weight proteinuria. Renal biopsy to ascertain the aetiology revealed deposition of amyloid fibrils in the glomerular mesangium on electron microscopy. Its characterization by immunofluorescence (IF) was consistent with immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis. In the absence of a demonstrable plasma cell clone on bone marrow biopsy, we made a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). He was treated with chemotherapy following which there was symptomatic improvement and reduction in phosphaturia. This case describes a unique presentation of renal injury due to AL amyloidosis masquerading as hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. The aim of this report is to highlight that hypophosphatemia in adults is usually acquired and treatment of underlying etiology results in cure, unlike in children where genetic counseling and phosphate replacement is the mainstay of treatment.

AB  - Chronic subdural hematoma is a common neurosurgical pathology, which is more commonly seen in the elderly age group. Few patients with chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) can have seizures-either before or after surgical intervention. Reported incidence of seizures varies from 0.7-18.5% in patients with cSDH. Many factors which have been proposed to increase the risk of seizures in these patients include the presence of encapsulated membranes, occult cortical injury, mass effect, or an acute hemorrhage. The role of prophylactic antiepileptic drugs is not very clear in cSDH. We reviewed the currently available evidence for the use of prophylactic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients with cSDH. We included 13 studies in the systematic review and 6 studies compared the incidence of seizures in patients who received antiepileptic drugs with those who did not. Our review did not find any significant reduction in the incidence of seizures in patients with cSDH following administration of antiepileptic drugs.

AB  - We determined the clinical and molecular epidemiology of emerging nosocomial vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faecium(VREfm)-causing serious bloodstream infections (BSIs) and the correlations between antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants among isolates. All isolates were confirmed by molecular methods (16SrRNAandE. faecium ddlgenes) and tested for disk diffusion. PCR was used to detectaac(6 ')-aph(2 ''),vanA andvanB resistance genes, andasa1,cylA,ace,esp,gelEandhylvirulence genes. VREfm and high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) representative isolates were selected to characterize by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Of 173 isolates, 73 (42.2%), 146 (84.4%), and 0 (0.0%) werevanA-containing VREfm,aac(6 ')-aph(2 '')-positive HLGR, andvanB-positive. Independent predictors of VREfm infection were hematological malignancies (P= 0.001) and previous hospitalizations (P= 0.007). Observed mortality rate was 34.7%. Independent predictors of BSI-related mortality were endotracheal intubations (P< 0.001), gastrointestinal diseases (P =0.002), and pulmonary disease (P <0.001). All VREfm were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. Theesp,hyl,ace,asa1,cylA, andgelEgenes were detected at 55.9, 22.5, 2.9, 2.3, 1.7, and 1.2%, respectively. Theespgene was significantly associated with VREfm compared to VSEfm (P= 0.001). PFGE analysis revealed 23 clones, with 7 major clones. The MLST analysis revealed the following five sequence types: ST80, ST17, ST117, ST132, and ST280, all belonging to CC17. The emergence and expansion of VREfm CC17 with limited antibiotic options in our hospital present a serious public health menace and represent challenges to infection control.

AB  - Background Quality improvement (QI) methods represent a vehicle for fostering locally initiated innovation cycles. We partnered with palliative care services from seven diverse practice settings in India to foster locally initiated improvement projects. Objective To evaluate the implementation experiences of locally initiated palliative care improvement projects at seven diverse sites and understand the barriers and facilitators of using QI to improve palliative care in India. Participants We use a quota sampling approach to capture the perspectives of 44 local stakeholders in each of the following three categories (organizational leaders, clinic leaders, and clinical team members) through a semi-structured interview guide informed by the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR). We use standard qualitative methods to identify facilitators and barriers to using QI methods in seven diverse palliative care contexts. Results Across all sites, respondents emphasized the following factors important in the success of quality improvement initiative: leveraging clinic level data, QI methods training, provider buy-in, engaged mentors, committed leadership, team support, interdepartmental coordination, collaborations with other providers, local champions, and having a structure for accountability. Barriers to using QI methods to improve palliative care services included lack of designated staff, high patient volume, resources, patient population geographic constraints, general awareness and acceptance of palliative care, and culture. Conclusions Empowering local leaders and medical personnel to champion, design, and iterate using QI methods represents a promising powerful tool to spread palliative care services in developing countries.

AB  - Background Single donor apheresis platelets are superior in quality, but their usage is limited in a developing country due to cost and time constraints. Hence the product obtained must exceed in terms of yield, donor safety and technical convenience. Previous literature available on cell separators is on older versions. Aims Prospective comparison of 5 latest cell separators (AmiCORE, COM.TEC, Haemonetics MCS+, SpectraOptia and TrimaAccel) for product yield, performance variables and donor adverse effects. Material & Methods From October 2019 - March 2020, 1108 donors were randomly allotted to a cell separator. Post-donation sample was taken from the donor 15-20 minutes after procedure completion. The platelet yield from the product collected was measured twice (day 0 and day 1). Donor demography, pre-and post-procedural donor peripheral blood values, performance and product variables were statistically analyzed. Results AmiCORE had an optimal collection efficacy (44.6%) and collection rate (0.037 x 1011/minute). Haemonetics MCS+ had a better collection efficacy (48.4%) and rate (0.038 x 1011/minute). Spectra Optia achieved least procedural time (59.5 minutes), donor adverse effects (6.3%); highest collection efficacy (52.8%) and rate (0.056 x 1011/minute). Trima Accel achieved highest collection rate (0.056 x 1011/minute) and the least product volume (228 ml). Conclusion Highest collection efficacy was achieved by Trima Accel, highest collection rate by Trima Accel and Spectra Optia, lowest donor adverse effects by Spectra Optia and least number of procedural troubleshooting by COM.TEC. Apart from this, fiscal factors and service availability also need to be considered before choosing a cell separator.

AB  - Gubernaculum testes is the most important parameter in testicular migration. At the end of migration, it is described as scrotal ligament, which has implications in testicular torsion. The present study aims to examine the structure of scrotal ligament and compare it with gubernaculum. Sixteen adult cadaveric testicular specimens and fourteen fetal testicular specimens of different age groups were examined after getting ethical clearance from the institute ethics committee and consent from the parents. Meticulous dissection was done. The length, site of proximal, and distal attachment of scrotal ligament and gubernaculum were noted and histologically evaluated. A separate scrotal ligament could not be delineated in any adult specimens. It merged with testicular coverings. Histological examination showed the presence of patchy areas of dense collagen fibres of variable density amidst loose areolar connective tissue. In contrast, fetal specimens showed the presence of a definitive gubernaculum testes and revealed the presence of mesenchymal tissue, collagen, elastic fibres, and myocytes which varied according to gestational age of fetuses. Structure of scrotal ligament and gubernaculum testes is highly variable. Description of scrotal ligament as a firm attachment from lower pole of testes to scrotum is controversial, questioning its role as protective factor in testicular torsion.

AB  - Rhinophyma is a progressive and disfiguring thickening of the nasal skin. It is typically found in middle-aged or elderly Caucasian males. The exact cause of the disease is unknown. There is excessive formation of scar-like tissue and hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands. This article will demonstrate our experience of treating rhinophyma using a combined surgical approach and propose a novel classification system. This is a retrospective analysis of cases operated by a single surgeon over 9 years using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) tool. Thirty-three patients were identified. Twenty-nine patients had three techniques used in one sitting, two patients had two techniques used, and two further patients had one technique used. Total GBI showed a +50.99 result following surgery. Rhinophyma treatments can benefit patients as demonstrated by the GBI outcome. This can improve the patients' quality of life. The use of more than one technique in the same sitting potentially improves the outcome. Our classification system helps categorize the disease better as well as choosing the treatment and comparing disease and treatment. The Level of Evidence for the study is 4.

AB  - Background Data on therapy and outcome of dense deposit disease (DDD), C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN), and immune-complex MPGN (IC-MPGN) in children are limited. Methods In this retrospective single-center study from 2007 to 2019, kidney biopsies were reviewed to include patients aged <18-years with C3 glomerulopathy and IC-MPGN. Initial immunosuppression comprised prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (n = 51), tacrolimus (n = 11), and/or IV cyclophosphamide (n = 20). Clinicopathological features, response to therapy, and adverse outcome (eGFR(cr) < 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2)or death) were evaluated. Results A total of 92 patients were classified as DDD (n = 48, 52.2%), C3GN (n = 26, 28.3%), and IC-MPGN (n = 18, 19.6%) by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy; 8 patients with DDD were misclassified as IC-MPGN on immunofluorescence. At last follow-up (median 4.3 years), complete or partial remission occurred in 28.5, 36.1, and 16.7% patients with DDD, C3GN, and IC-MPGN, respectively. Serum albumin at onset < 2.5 g/dL (HR = 0.29,P = 0.005) and persistently low serum C3 (HR = 0.34,P = 0.02) were associated with lack of remission. The 5-year kidney survival was 62.6, 85.5, and 88.5% in patients with DDD, C3GN, and IC-MPGN, respectively (log-rank,P = 0.006). Presentation as rapidly progressive GN (HR = 11.2,P < 0.001), age > 10 years at onset (HR = 4.0,P = 0.004), and DDD (HR = 4.2,P = 0.02) were independently associated with adverse outcome; achieving remission was protective (HR = 0.04;P < 0.001). Conclusion Outcome in patients with C3 glomerulopathy and IC-MPGN was unsatisfactory, and only a small proportion of patients achieved complete or partial remission. Patients with DDD were more likely to present with rapidly progressive GN and were at higher risk of adverse outcomes, including kidney failure.

AB  - The use of cyclosporine A (CsA) as an immunosuppressive agent is often limited owing to its hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic properties. The present study was designed to evaluate the protective effect of metformin and silymarin in a rat model of CsA induced hepatorenal toxicity. The study included seven groups of Wistar albino rats (n = 6 per group): normal control, experimental control (CsA alone, 25 mg/kg), CsA + metformin (50 and 500 mg/kg), CsA + silymarin (50 and 200 mg/kg) and CsA + vitamin E (100 mg/kg). All the drugs were given daily for a period of 21 days by oral gavage and their effect was evaluated on serum levels of organ function markers (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, bilirubin, urea/blood urea nitrogen, creatinine), markers of oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, glutathione, superoxide dismutase), inflammation (nitrite, myeloperoxidase, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E-2), apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling positivity) in addition to tissue histology, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunoreactivity. Administration of metformin and silymarin along with CsA ameliorated functional damage to liver and kidneys in a dose-dependent manner. Significant and comparable improvement in the tissue levels of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptotic markers was also observed following treatment with both the test drugs. Normalization of histology scores, as well as COX-2 and iNOS immunoreactivity scores, further strengthened these findings. The hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects of metformin and silymarin were comparable and matched with that of reference drug, vitamin E. The findings of the present study suggest that both metformin and silymarin have a potential for clinical use in patients receiving long-term CsA treatment to maintain their liver and kidney functions.

AB  - Background Minimal access surgery has fast become the standard of care for many operative procedures, but is associated with lot of ergonomic stress to the surgeons performing these procedures, which may result in reduction in surgeon's performance and work capacity. In this study, we evaluated the impact of structured training program in improving the ergonomic stress in trainee laparoscopic surgeons. Methods Laparoscopic surgeons were divided in 2 groups: trainee surgeons (ten) and expert surgeons (three). Baseline surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected from bilateral deltoid, biceps brachii, forearm extensors, and pronator teres during a predefined suturing task on Tuebingen trainer with integrated porcine organs in both the groups. Trainee surgeons underwent 20 h of laparoscopic intra-corporeal suturing training and surface electromyography data were recorded at the end of training again and compared with baseline. Results Experts were found to have lower muscle activation (p < 0.05) and muscle work (p < 0.05) and better bimanual dexterity than the trainee surgeons at baseline. After training, the trainee surgeons showed significant improvement (p = 0.01), but still did not reach the values of the expert surgeons (p = 0.01). Right deltoid and pronator teres muscles were found to have maximal activity while performing intra-corporeal suturing. Conclusion Structured and focused training outside operation theater can significantly reduce unnecessary muscle activation of trainee laparoscopic surgeons and better dexterity leading on to lesser ergonomic stress and thus possibly may reduce the risk of development of future musculo-skeletal disorders.

AB  - Background To evaluate the relationship between superficial, deep foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and foveal cyst areas in eyes with cystoid macular oedema (CMO) associated with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GA). Methods This is a retrospective collaborative multicenter study of optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA) images in GA. Superficial and deep FAZ and foveal cyst were measured using Image J by two independent experts. Values were corrected for myopia magnification. These values were compared with age-matched controls from normative data. Results Twenty-three eyes from 12 patients with GA and CMO were included in the study. The mean +/- standard deviation age was 22 +/- 19.7 years, mean Snellen spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 20/70 with mean myopia of 5.7 +/- 4.1 dioptres. Qualitatively, no focal occlusion of superficial and deep capillary plexus was noted. Mean superficial FAZ area (0.484 +/- 0.317 mm(2)), deep FAZ area (0.626 +/- 0.452 mm(2)), and foveal cyst area (0.630 +/- 0.503 mm(2)) were significantly larger than superficial and deep FAZ areas in controls of same age range (p < 0.001). Macular cyst area correlated with superficial FAZ area (R = 0.59;p = 0.0057) and more strongly with deep FAZ area (R = 0.69;p < 0.001). Conclusions The superficial and deep FAZ area in GA-associated CMO were noted to be significantly larger than in controls. It seems that RPE dysfunction leads to foveal cyst enlargement displacing the capillary plexus with resultant enlarged superficial and deep FAZ area.

AB  - Splenic infarction is encountered rarely in clinical practice. The wide spectrum of clinical presentation makes its diagnosis elusive. It usually responds to conservative management but rarely surgical intervention is needed if it is refractory symptoms or secondary complication. We present our experience of splenectomy performed for splenic infarct which failed to respond to medical management over the last 5 years from 2015 to 2019. We performed 9 splenectomies (7 laparoscopic and 2 open). Most of these patients were young females (66.7%, 6/9). Mean age of patients in our series was 31.1 years (+/- 15.8 years). Fever (77.8%) and abdominal pain (66.7%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Diagnosis was made on the basis of contrast-enhanced CT scan of abdomen. Infective endocarditis (33.3%, 3/9) was the most common underlying aetiology. All of these patients initially received a trial of conservative management for a median duration of 19 days. Post-operative course was uneventful for most of these patients with a resolution of symptoms in post-operative period. There were two patients who developed surgical site infection and one who developed subdiaphragmatic collection which was drained percutaneously via a pigtail insertion. Patients were discharged after a median duration of 4 days after surgery and referred for post-splenectomy vaccination in haematology clinic. There is scarcity of literature on role of surgical intervention in symptomatic splenic infarct refractory to conservative management. How long should these patients be managed before considering them for splenectomy is a question worth exploring.

KW  - Postgraduation
KW  - Logbook
AB  - Background Orthopaedic residency training is a 3-year period of preparation that converts a raw medical student into a proficient orthopaedic surgeon. Due to wide variations at different centers in India, the program in a tertiary hospital is presented, in an attempt to improve the overall levels of training. Materials and Methods PGIMER has produced many good surgeons who are well settled across the country and the world. A survey of the postgraduates of the last 30 years was done to highlight the perceptions about the program. An overview of the program was also added to the narrative to highlight the positive aspects of the training. Results 132 Orthopaedic passed-out residents from PGIMER could be contacted. 97% of them rated their residency experience as excellent or good, and stated that they would recommend this program to new residents. Key points highlighted by them were the readiness of trainees for any surgical contingency after graduation, continuation of the mindset for research, and their prompt acceptability into their subsequent places of work due to their place of graduation. Discussion Converting an orthopaedic resident into a competent surgeon involves knowledge upgrades and impartation of skills; these are not limited to the theory of orthopaedics, but involve the thought processes and the planning as a surgeon, the attitude towards patient management, and a continuously inquisitive scientific mind. The shortcomings and strengths of the residency program in PGIMER are discussed; international standard methodology limited to this institute like formal log books, mentorship program, hands-on skill development through courses, etc. is something that is recommended to be mandatory in all residency programs. Conclusion The PGIMER Orthopaedic residency program could act as a basic model for other Indian medical schools, with any appropriate modifications. Standardization of Orthopaedic residency programs could allow upgrading to International levels.

AB  - Background and Aim Short stature is a common extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease (CeD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the global prevalence of CeD in patients presenting with short stature. Methods We searched Medline and EMBASE databases for the keywords "celiac disease, coeliac disease, anti-gliadin, tissue transglutaminase antibody, anti-endomysial antibody, short stature and growth retardation." All the studies published from January 1991 to May 2020 were included. Patients without any prior evaluation for short stature were classified as all-cause short stature, while prior evaluated patients, where no cause was found for short stature, were classified as idiopathic short stature. The diagnosis of CeD was based on the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines. A random-effects model was used to pool the data. Results Seventeen studies screening 3759 patients (1582 with all-cause short stature and 2177 with idiopathic short stature) were included. The pooled seroprevalence of CeD based on positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody and anti-endomysial antibody was 11.2% (95% CI 4.0-21.2%;I-2 = 86%) and 9.7% (95% CI 2.7-20.2%;I-2 = 95%) for all-cause and idiopathic short stature, respectively. Similarly, pooled prevalence of biopsy-confirmed CeD was 7.4% (95% CI 4.7-10.6%;I-2 = 76%) and 11.6% (95% CI 4.1-22.2%;I-2 = 97%), for all-cause and idiopathic short stature, respectively. There was an overall severe risk of selection bias and significant heterogeneity in the pooled results. Conclusions Approximately one in 14 patients with all-cause short stature and one in nine patients with idiopathic short stature had biopsy-confirmed CeD. Therefore, evaluation for CeD may be prudent in all patients with short stature.

AB  - Background The accurate preoperative identification of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is challenging due to the rarity of tumor and variable cytologic appearance. The Asian experience with diagnosing MTC by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was scarcely reported. Methods Cases of MTC with available FNA slides were enrolled from 13 hospitals representing 8 Asia-Pacific countries. Clinicopathological information, including sample preparation technique, staining method, original cytologic diagnosis and review diagnosis were collected. Results Of a total of 145 MTC cases retrospectively recruited, 99 (68.3%) were initially interpreted as MTC/suspicious for MTC (S-MTC). The distribution of original FNA diagnostic categories was not associated with the staining method or sample preparation technique. The staining methods used were Papanicolaou, hematoxylin-eosin and Romanowsky stains. Liquid-based cytology (LBC) was used only in three countries. After reviewing all cases, the diagnostic rate of MTC/S-MTC increased to 91.7% (133/145). Cases with initially unrecognized MTC had either marked pleomorphism or cytology mimicking papillary carcinoma or follicular neoplasm. Although LBC provided certain benefits, there was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between conventional smear and LBC. Immunocytochemistry was available in 38 cases (26.2%), all of which were correctly recognized as MTC. Conclusion Our report summarizes how MTC is handled in contemporary Asian thyroid FNA practice. Although the detection rate of MTC by cytology alone is less satisfactory, integration with ancillary tests could achieve an excellent performance. The recognition of constitutive cytomorphologic features is needed for each cytopreparatory method, which may result in a lower threshold to initiate further workup for MTC.

AB  - In the absence of definitive therapy for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) may be a critical therapeutic option. This review was conducted to evaluate the impact of CPT in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported to date. A robust screening of electronic databases was conducted up to 10th July 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series with a control group evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CPT in patients with COVID-19 are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved seven studies, including two RCTs and five cohort studies, with a total of 5444 patients. In patients with COVID-19, the use of CPT reduces mortality (odd's ratio [OR] 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77), increases viral clearance (OR, 11.29; 95% CI, 4.9-25.9) and improves clinically (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.9). However, the evidence is of low quality (mortality reduction, and viral clearance), and very low quality (clinical improvement). CPT may be beneficial for reducing mortality, viral shedding and improving clinical conditions in COVID-19 patients. However, further randomized control trials (RCT) are required to substantiate the safety margin, initiation, optimal dosage, titre and duration of CPT.

AB  - Background Lung adenocarcinomas present as tight clusters and three-dimensional balls in effusion specimens. Unlike carcinomas of breast and stomach where singly lying malignant cells are seen in effusion samples, lung adenocarcinomas usually show cohesive morphology. This single-cell pattern may also be confused with reactive mesothelial cells. We studied the frequency of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with single-cell pattern cytomorphology in pleural effusion specimens. Materials and Methods All cases reported as either suspicious or positive for malignancy on pleural effusion cytology (PFC) over the past 1 year were retrieved. The clinical details were obtained from requisition forms. Cases with predominant single-cell pattern, clinically suspicious of carcinoma lung were segregated. These were de-stained and immunocytochemistry (ICC) for TTF-1 was performed. Results Of 103 cases reported as either suspicious or positive for malignancy on PFC, 29 had a predominant single-cell pattern. Of these, 13 (44.8%) were primary lung carcinoma. The rest were metastasis from ovary (5; 17.2%), breast (2; 6.9%), stomach (2; 6.9%), lymphoma (1; 3.5%), and Ewing's sarcoma (1; 3.5%). Five (17.2%) were those with unknown primary. All cases of lung carcinoma were positive for TTF-1 ICC. Conclusion Single-cell pattern of pulmonary adenocarcinoma is commoner than popularly believed. This pattern may be difficult to differentiate from carcinoma cells of other sites as well as from reactive mesothelial cells. A high degree of suspicion is therefore needed to perform relevant ICC to clinch the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Thalassemia major can affect physical, psycho-social and economic life of patients and their parents. The aim of the study was to assess the disease knowledge and general self-efficacy among adolescents with Thalassemia major and their parents' perspective with a view to develop an informational booklet on thalassemia. In a cross-sectional study 50 adolescents along with 48 parents were recruited from the hematology day care centre of a tertiary care facility. Ethical clearance from institute ethics committee, written informed consent from parent and assent from the adolescent were taken. Consecutive participants those who consented were enrolled in the study. Adolescents between the age group of 10-18 years, and their parents completed the self-developed subject data sheet, knowledge questionnaire and standardized general self-efficacy tools. The mean knowledge scores of the adolescent and their parents related to thalassemia were 13.9 +/- 2.9 and 13.7 +/- 3.6 respectively, while the perceived GSE scores of the adolescent along with the parents' perspective were 30.1 +/- 6.1 and 29.3 +/- 6.5. Positive correlation between the adolescents' knowledge with GSE (r = 0.464,p = 0.007) was observed. The knowledge of the adolescents and their parents showed significant association with the education (p = 0.001,p = 0.002) residence (p = 0.04 andp = 0.01) and parents' employment (p = 0.04). The knowledge of adolescents with thalassemia and their parents is limited. There is need to counsel the adolescents and their parents about the disease and its management in order to improve the GSE of these adolescents.

AB  - Objectives Activated macrophages expressing CD163 (M2) are the most abundant macrophage subtype in renal biopsies from lupus nephritis (LN) patients. We studied the role of proteolytically cleaved soluble CD163 (sCD163) as a biomarker of LN disease activity.
   Methods SLE patients were classified as active LN (AN), inactive disease (ID), and active non-renal disease (ANR). Urine and plasma samples were collected at baseline from all patients and at 3 monthly follow-up from AN patients. sCD163 was measured by ELISA. Urine values were normalized to urinary creatinine excretion and expressed as pg/mg. Urine samples from 25 healthy controls (HC) and 20 rheumatoid arthritis patients served as disease controls (DC).
   Results Among the 122 patients studied (114 females, 57 AN, 42 ID, 23 ANR), baseline median urinary sCD163 in the AN group (114.01 pg/mg) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) as compared with ID (10.34 pg/mg), ANR (3.82 pg/mg), HC (0 pg/mg), and DC (7.56 pg/mg) groups and showed modest correlation with renal SLEDAI (r = 0.47;p < 0.001). Urinary sCD163 performed the best on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis (AUC = 0.76) at baseline to differentiate between AN and ANR as compared with plasma sCD163, anti-ds DNA antibodies, and C3 and C4.
   In follow-up study, urinary sCD163 decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in AN patients at 3 (22.07 pg/mg), 6 (12.7 pg/mg), 9 (11.09 pg/mg), and 12 months (7.2 pg/mg). In 4 patients who had either relapse or developed CKD, urinary sCD163 levels correlated with the changing disease activity.
   Conclusions Urinary sCD163 is a good biomarker of LN disease activity.

AB  - Novel energy devices such as ultrasonic shears (US) are widely used in laparoscopic surgery due to convenience and outcomes. However, these are expensive and add to the procedure cost. Electrocautery (EC) can often provide similar surgical outcomes and existing literature in unclear on the benefits of one over the other. We conducted a randomized trial between US and EC use in laparoscopic nephrectomy. Twenty patients undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy between January 2019 and January 2020 at our tertiary referral center were included. Patients were randomly allocated in 2 groups according to energy used, i.e., EC and US. We assessed operative time, blood loss, intra- and postoperative complications, drain output and duration, hospital stay, readmission rates within 30 days of discharge, and surgeon satisfaction with the instruments used. The mean operative time and estimated blood loss were 113 min and 170 ml in EC group while 106 min and 180 ml in US group (p > 0.05). The mean change in hematocrit values after surgery were 6.12% and 5.27% in EC and US group, respectively (p = 0.812). There were no significant differences in mean hospital stay (2.7 in EC group, 2 days in US group), drain output (35.6 ml in EC and 26.3 ml in US group), and drain duration (1.7 days in EC and 1.9 days in US group). One patient in EC group had retroperitoneal hematoma due to Veress needle injury. Similarly only 1 patient in US group had severe intraoperative bleeding requiring conversion to open procedure. Two patients in the EC group had postoperative complications, i.e., fever and purulent collection under surgical site. Electrocautery and ultrasonic shears appear to be comparable in efficacy and safety in laparoscopic nephrectomy. However larger prospective studies are required to confirm our findings.

AB  - Background NUT carcinoma (NC) is an aggressive neoplasm that often presents with alarge tumor burden and metastases; cytology is frequently one of the primary diagnostic modalities. Primary pulmonary NCs are very rare and cytology descriptions are limited. The current study was performed to analyze the cytomorphological features of primary pulmonary NCs in different cytology samples and preparations. Methods A total of 15 cytology specimens from 10 patients with primary pulmonary NCs diagnosed primarily on histology were retrieved and reviewed. Results Fifteen cytology samples, including aspirates from primary (5 samples) and metastatic (5 samples) sites, sputum (1 sample), and effusions (4 samples), that were prepared as direct smears, centrifuged smears, and cell blocks were reviewed. Aspirate smears from all cases were cellular and demonstrated fragments and cohesive clusters of primitive tumor cells with scant cytoplasm, ovoid nuclei with coarse granular chromatin, and consistently conspicuous single nucleoli in a frequently neutrophil-rich necrotic background with dispersed bare tumor nuclei. In fluid cytology, tight, 3-dimensional tumor clusters and singly lying tumor cells were observed. Squamous differentiation in the form of sheets and singly lying polygonal tumor cells with abundant dense cytoplasm was noted focally in rare cases. The diagnoses during original sign-outs were poorly differentiated carcinoma, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant small round cell tumor. NUT-1 (NUT family member 1 protein) immunocytochemistry performed on cell blocks demonstrated characteristic speckled nuclear staining in tumor cells. Conclusions Pulmonary NC presents as a poorly differentiated carcinoma with focal to absent squamous differentiation on cytology. Cellular fragments of primitive tumor cells with conspicuous nucleoli should raise suspicion of NUT carcinoma and prompt ancillary testing.

AB  - Renal cysts can be focal or diffuse and unilateral or bilateral. In childhood, most renal cysts are due to hereditary diseases rather than simple cysts or acquired cystic diseases, unlike adults. Inherited cystic diseases can be ciliopathies due to a primary ciliary defect (as in polycystic kidney diseases and nephronophthisis). Acquired causes include obstructive cystic dysplasia, dyselectrolytemia, and acquired cysts in renal replacement therapy. The final diagnosis requires a multispecialty approach, including radiology, pathology, and genetics. Imaging is a very important component in treating patients with cystic renal diseases. This article discusses the ultrasound findings of cystic renal diseases in children, along with a brief discussion of other imaging modalities and a suggested ultrasound reporting format.

AB  - Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a vital aspect of management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and should be tailored to ethnic and family traditions and the socioeconomic and educational status of the patient. In this article, we discuss the unique aspects of MNT in children and adolescents with T1DM in the Indian setting, with focus on the challenges faced by patients, dieticians and physicians and how these can be overcome. The authors reviewed the available literature on MNT in T1DM from India and prepared the document based on their vast collective clinical experience in treating patients with T1DM from different regions in India. Indian diets are predominantly carbohydrate-based with high glycemic index (GI) and low protein content. Various methods are available to increase the protein and fiber content and reduce the GI of food in order to limit glycemic excursions. Insulin regimens need to be tailored to the child's school timings, meal schedule, and the availability of a responsible adult to supervise/administer insulin. All patients, irrespective of economic and education background, should be taught the broad principles of healthy eating, balanced diet and carbohydrate counting. There are various barriers to dietary compliance, including joint family system, changing lifestyles, and other factors which need to be addressed. There is a need to customize dietary management according to patient characteristics and needs and develop standardized patient educational material on principles of healthy eating in various regional languages.

AB  - Significance:Wound dressing based on naturally derived polymer provides a useful platform for treatment of skin injuries. Owing to the high mechanical strength and tunable structural and physicochemical properties of human elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), they may be used as excellent materials for fabricating biocompatible scaffolds and other products for wound management.
   Recent Advances:Designing recombinant ELPs mimicking natural elastin to fabricate synthetic polymers suitable for human health care has generated significant interest. ELP-based cell-adhesive biopolymers have been used as an alternative for successful sutureless wound closure due to the physicochemical characteristics of the extracellular matrix.
   Critical Issues:Different systems of ELPs are being developed in the form of scaffolds, films, hydrogels, photo-linkable sheets, and composites linked with various types of growth factors for wound healing application. However, optimizing the quality and safety attributes for specific application needs designing of recombinant ELPs with structural and functional modifications as needed for the intervention.
   Future Direction:Chronic wounds are difficult to treat as the wound repair process is interrupted by conditions such as excessive inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix formation, and persistent infections. Conventional therapies such as skin substitutes or autologous skin grafts, in many cases, are unable to reestablish tissue homeostasis and proper healing. The development of innovative materials could induce a better regenerative healing response. In this study, we are reviewing different types of elastin-based materials for wound care application and their future prospects in regenerative medicine.

KW  - Wooden foreign body
KW  - orbital trauma
KW  - globe-sparing trauma
AB  - Orbital trauma is often associated with foreign bodies. Wooden foreign bodies pose an urgent need for removal owing to their reactive nature and the high risk for infection. Though visual prognosis depends on associated ocular trauma, in selected cases, excellent visual and cosmetic outcomes are possible. An 18-year-old woman presented to our trauma facility with a history of fall directly onto a wooden stick from a height. On examination, there was a large wooden foreign body in the left medial orbit, extending into the ethmoidal sinus as visualised on imaging. After administration of perioperative antibiotics, the foreign body was removed in toto using careful tissue dissection and the soft tissue was closed in layers. Postoperatively at six months, the vision in the left eye was 20/20 with mild ptosis. Early surgery, careful dissection of soft tissues and adequate infection prophylaxis can lead to good outcomes in such cases.

AB  - A 26-year-old young man died shortly after he had suffered craniocerebral impalement from a metal chair leg during an affray at an airport bar. At autopsy a 25 mm diameter circular wound was present in the left parietal region with protruding brain tissue. Death was due to craniocerebral trauma from a penetrating injury to the head. Examination of the chair used in the assault showed a metal chair with smeared blood on the front right leg that matched the blood group of the decedent. The fatal wound had been inflicted by the assailant with the victim leaning forward while kneeling on the floor. The assault had produced an unusual circular patterned defect in the left parietal bone with dimensions corresponding to the chair leg. The location of the defect and the use of a chair leg were two very unusual features in this homicide.

AB  - Hand exercise is advised for newly placed arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis because of its effects on vein diameter and fistula maturation, however with controversy and inconsistent results. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of post-operative handgrip exercise on the maturation of arteriovenous fistula (AVF). A single institution, single surgeon, in-hospital, two arm, open-labeled randomized control trial, comparing exercise group and control group, was conducted between 2017 and 2018. Clinical maturation was defined as the use of AVF for repetitive hemodialysis. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) maturation was defined as the cross-sectional luminal diameter of draining vein > 4 mm and intra-access flow rate > 500 ml/min. Out of 200 patients recruited, 98 were randomized to exercise group and 96 to control and 6 were excluded as they were lost to follow-up. Mean age was 40 +/- 13 years, with 71.6% males. Radiocephalic AVF was created in 130/194 (67%) patients. In RCAVF, 104/130 (80%) achieved clinical maturation, 59/104 (56.7%) in exercise group, and 45/104 (43.26%) in control group (p = 0.043). Duplex ultrasound (DUS) maturation was seen in 86/130 (66.2%) cases, 48/86 (55.8%) in exercise group and 38/86 (44.2%) in control group (p = 0.263). In brachiocephalic AVF, clinical maturation was seen in 57/64 (89.1%) cases, 27/57 (47.4%) and 30/57 (52.6%) in exercise and control group respectively (p = 0.821). Duplex ultrasound (DUS) maturation in BCAVF was seen in 57/64 (89.1%) cases, 27/57 (47.4%) in exercise and 30/57 (52.6%) in control group (pvalue = 0.821). Post-operative handgrip exercise improves clinical maturation in radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula. Registration number: CTRI/2017/04/008283, Registered on 03.04.2017

AB  - Thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein (TOX) is a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of T cell exhaustion during chronic infection and cancer. While TOX is being targeted for cancer immunotherapy, limited information is available about its significance in breast cancer and other solid tumors. We performed a comprehensive analysis ofTOXgene expression, its epigenetic regulation, protein localization, relation to tumor infiltrating immune cell composition, and prognostic significance in breast cancer using publicly available datasets. Our results suggest an inverse correlation betweenTOXexpression and DNA methylation in tumor cells. However, its expression is elevated in tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), which may compensates for the totalTOXlevels in the tumor as a whole. Furthermore, higherTOXlevels in tumors are associated with T cell exhaustion signatures along with presence of active inflammatory response, including elevated levels of T cell effector cytokines. Survival analysis also confirmed that higher expression ofTOXis associated with better prognosis in breast cancer. Therefore, expression ofTOXmay serve as a novel prognostic marker for this malignancy.

AB  - There are numerous ongoing studies assessing treatment options for preventing, treating, and managing complications of coronavirus disease-2019 disease. The objective of this study was to do a systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials with an aim to provide insight into the various interventions tested, clinical rationale, geographical distribution of the trials as well as the endpoints assessed in the studies. , World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and PubMed were assessed till 11 May 2020. The search resulted in 3242 ongoing studies of which 829 studies were included. There are 134 different drug-based interventions being assessed in 463 clinical trials as treatment options China accounts for 35% of all ongoing clinical studies followed by USA 23% and other countries together account for 42%. Amongst the 463 studies assessing drug-based treatment options, studies that are funded by federal and academic institutions are 79.6%, pharmaceutical company-funded studies are 15.11%, and no funding information is available in 5.10%. The definitive outcomes like mortality are being assessed as primary outcome in 22.8% of the studies only and need for ventilator in 6.2% of the studies. Amongst the pharmaceutical company-funded drug-based studies, only 20% of the studies had mortality as the primary outcome. Only 5.5% of the ongoing clinical trials are specifically designed to assess the most vulnerable population like elderly, patients with comorbidities and cancer. Multiple intervention-based clinical studies against severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 are being performed throughout the world with a high concentration of clinical trials in the developed world with concern that of elderly and patients with comorbidities are being underrepresented and definite endpoints like mortality are being assessed in only one-fifth of the studies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to achieve consensus amongst a global panel of expert bariatric surgeons on various aspects of resuming Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (BMS) during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A modified Delphi consensus-building protocol was used to build consensus amongst 44 globally recognised bariatric surgeons. The experts were asked to either agree or disagree with 111 statements they collectively proposed over two separate rounds. An agreement amongst >= 70.0% of experts was construed as consensus as per the predetermined methodology. We present here 38 of our key recommendations. This first global consensus statement on the resumption of BMS can provide a framework for multidisciplinary BMS teams planning to resume local services as well as guide future research in this area.

AB  - Science, particularly in life sciences and biotechnologies, is continuing to make remarkable progress in the past decade. This has been possible due to the governments and people recognizing that scientific discoveries bring development and prosperity to the nation. The new trend in research is to collaborate across disciplines with large teams of participants across the globe. This has brought success but has led to varying standards in ethics and responsible conduct which require harmonization. Recent discoveries point to a need for new approaches to ethics. The rise in cases of misconduct and retraction of research papers from high-profile individuals has been a cause for concern. It is encouraging that many countries that have detected misconduct in research have instituted strong steps to correct the situation. This brief review discusses the recent developments of interest to me, the issues of global research, ethics and responsible conduct.

AB  - The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19 has become a global pandemic that is spreading rapidly and has caused a global health emergency. Hence, there is an urgent need of the hour to discover effective drugs to control the pandemic caused by this virus. Under such conditions, it would be imperative to repurpose already known drugs which could be a quick and effective alternative to discovering new drugs. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-COV-2 is an attractive drug target because of its essential role in the processing of the majority of the non-structural proteins which are translated from viral RNA. Herein, we report the high-throughput virtual screening and molecular docking studies to search for the best potential inhibitors against Mpro from FDA approved drugs available in the ZINC database as well as the natural compounds from the Specs database. Our studies have identified six potential inhibitors of Mpro enzyme, out of which four are commercially available FDA approved drugs (Cobicistat, Iopromide, Cangrelor, and Fortovase) and two are from Specs database of natural compounds (Hopeaphenol and Cyclosieversiodide-A). While Cobicistat and Fortovase are known as HIV drugs, Iopromide is a contrast agent and Cangrelor is an anti-platelet drug. Furthermore, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using GROMACS were performed to calculate the stability of the top-ranked compounds in the active site of Mpro. After extensive computational studies, we propose that Cobicistat and Hopeaphenol show potential to be excellent drugs that can form the basis of treating COVID-19 disease.

AB  - The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19, a global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented loss of life and economy worldwide. Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2 '-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of-12.83 +/- 0.52 kcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of -11.21 +/- 0.47 kcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background and purpose Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) cognitive impairment at early stages is challenging compared to the stage of PD dementia where functional impairment is apparent and easily diagnosed. Hence, to evaluate potential early stage cognitive biomarkers, we assessed frontal lobe metabolic alterations using in vivo multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI). Method Frontal metabolism was studied in patients with PD with normal cognition (PD-CN) (n = 26), with cognitive impairment (PD-CI) (n = 27), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 30) using a single slice (two-dimensional)H-1-MRSI at 3 T. The acquired spectra were post-processed distinctly for voxels corresponding to the bilateral middle/superior frontal gray matter (GM) and frontal white matter (WM) regions (delineated employing neuromorphometrics atlas) using the LC-Model software. Result Significant (post hocp < 0.016) reduction in the concentration ofN-acetyl aspartate (NAA) in the middle and superior frontal GMs and total choline (tCho) and total creatine (tCr) in the frontal WM was observed in PD-CI compared to PD-CN and HC, while that in HC and PD-CN groups were comparable. The NAA and tCr/tCho metabolite concentrations showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations with cognitive test scores in the frontal GM and WM, respectively. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis revealed significant (p < 0.05) "area under curve" for NAA/tNAA in the frontal GM and tCho in the frontal WM. Conclusion The frontal metabolic profile is altered in cognitively impaired PD compared with cognitively normal PD. Neuronal function loss (NAA), altered energy metabolism (Cr), and cholinergic (Cho) neural transmission are implicated in PD cognitive pathology. Frontal neuro-metabolism may promisingly serve as PD cognitive biomarker.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased in incidence and prevalence in Asian countries since the end of the 20th century. Moreover, differences in the cause, phenotypes, and natural history of IBD between the East and West have been recognized. Therefore, the Asian Organization for Crohn's and Colitis and the Asia Pacific Association of Gastroenterology have established recommendations on medical management of IBD in Asia. Initially, the committee members drafted 40 recommendations, which were then assessed according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Eight statements were rejected as this indicated that consensus had not been reached. The recommendations encompass pretreatment evaluation; medical management of active IBD; medical management of IBD in remission; management of IBD during the periconception period and pregnancy; surveillance strategies for colitis-associated cancer; monitoring side effects of thiopurines and methotrexate; and infections in IBD.

AB  - Like several indigenous populations, Sauria Paharias, a vulnerable indigenous tribal group residing in a biodiverse environment of Jharkhand, India, have high levels of undernutrition. We assessed agroforestry and dietary diversity, food consumption especially indigenous food (IF) intake and nutritional status of Sauria Paharia women through a cross-sectional study conducted in 18 villages of Godda district, Jharkhand. Household level information was elicited through household surveys including a dietary survey and a food frequency questionnaire. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls (24 HDR) and anthropometric assessments were taken on one randomly selected woman per household. An index, Food Accessed Diversity Index (FADI) created to measure agroforestry diversity, showed a low mean score of 0.21 +/- 0.15 and range: 0, 0.85. Fifty-nine percent of women consumed any IF during 24 HDR. Median minimum dietary diversity score for women (MDD-W) was 3 (acceptable score >= 5). More than 96% of women had intakes below estimated average requirements for all nutrients studied (energy; vitamins A, C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine; folate; iron; calcium and zinc) except protein; 41% women were underweight. IF consumption was independently associated with calcium and vitamin A intake. Decision trees developed for micronutrient consumption at different levels of MDD-W score and IF consumption scenarios revealed 1.3 to 2.9 times higher consumption of micronutrients among women with MDD-W >= 3 or 4. Strategies like agricultural extension programmes promoting indigenous varieties and nutrition education for increasing dietary diversity with IFs have potential to address undernutrition in Sauria Paharia women.

AB  - Temperature tolerance is an important factor limiting the distribution of arthropod vectors, with limited information on the ability of mosquitoes to evolve different temperature levels. Under laboratorial conditions effect of thermal stress in late third instar larvae ofAedes aegyptidetermined by subjecting them to temperature regimes such as 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C, 41 degrees C, 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C, and the lethal time required to inflict mortality of 50% (LT50) and 90% (LT90) were also computed. To understand the adaptive thermotolerance in immature stages ofAe.aegypti, late third instar larvae were exposed to 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C, and these larvae were further re-exposed to temperatures 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C respectively. The median mortality of the larvae exposed to sub-lethal temperatures at 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C was 140 and 30 min respectively. While the median mortality for the larvae adapted at 39 degrees C and exposed to 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C was 230 and 50 min. All the larvae exposed at 39 degrees C were survived up to 420 min whereas at 45 degrees C within 60 min of exposure time 100% mortality was observed. Larvae pre-adapted at 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C were re-exposed to 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C and it was observed that larvae pre-adapted at 39 degrees C were more thermotolerant than larvae pre-adapted at 37 degrees C. LT(50)values were 82.9 and 213.7 min as compared to the non-adapted larvae. Similarly, the LT(50)values were 30.5 min and in larvae pre-adapted at 39 degrees C when re-exposed to 45 degrees C showed 2 fold increases in thermotolerancein comparison to the same stage larvae kept at room temperature. Larvae pre-adapted from higher temperature showed more thermotolerance than the larvae pre-adapted at lower temperature.

AB  - Purpose To determine the significance of both massive choroidal invasion and optic nerve invasion (retrolaminar [(RL]+cut end [CE]) as a criterion for classifying high metastatic potential retinoblastoma and their relationship with other known histopathological high-risk features. Methods A retrospective review of 650 eyes diagnosed as retinoblastoma over a 10-year period. In our study, there is male predominance and a higher percentage of the poorly differentiated tumors. The age of most of the patients ranges from 1 month to 8 years with a median age of 2 years. Results There were 24% of eyes with massive choroidal invasion and 18% of eyes with optic nerve invasion up to the cut end. On performing Cox-proportional hazard analysis, it was found that massive choroidal invasion in association with optic nerve invasion up to the cut end was an independent prognostic parameter. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, overall survival had reduced in patients having both massive choroidal invasion and an optic nerve cut end invasion along with orbital invasion (P < .05). Conclusion The presence of massive choroidal invasion in association with optic nerve cut end invasion (RL+CE) could be used as a better prognostic predictor in assessing retinoblastoma patients with high metastatic potential and need to be kept for longer follow up.

Methods Both eyes of 33 children with unilateral PCG and 30 healthy, age-matched children, old enough to co-operate were analysed using high-resolution anterior segment spectral domain (SD) OCT. Subgroup analysis was done for the presence/absence of angle dysgenesis as defined by the presence of abnormal tissue/hyper-reflective membrane within angle recess and/or the absence of SC. Other anatomical landmarks differentiating the fellow eyes from eyes with glaucoma were also evaluated and compared with healthy subjects. Results The presence of abnormal tissue at the angle and/or a hyper-reflective membranous structure covering the meshwork was seen in all affected PCG eyes (100%) and in 21 (63%) unaffected fellow eyes; p = 0.001. The SC could be seen in 8 (24%) affected in comparison with 29 (88%) fellow unaffected eyes; p = 0.001. The ASOCT scans of 54 (90%) healthy eyes and 3 (9%) fellow PCG eyes revealed a direct communication of anterior portion of the SC with the anterior chamber. Among the fellow eyes, a communication of the supraciliary space with anterior chamber could be discerned in 26 eyes (79%). Conclusions Despite angle dysgenesis, outflow channels such as the uveoscleral or a direct communication of SC with the anterior chamber play a role in preventing the development of glaucoma in fellow eyes of unilateral PCG.

AB  - Aim To compare the technical difficulty, safety, radiation exposure and success rates between right-sided and left-sided percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (RPTBD and LPTBD) in patients with malignant biliary obstruction (MBO). Materials and Methods Fifty patients (28 males, 22 females; mean age 51.78 years) with MBO were randomized to undergo either RPTBD or LPTBD during the study period between June 2016 and May 2018. The procedure time, fluoroscopy time, radiation doses to the operators and patients, technical success, clinical success, complications and effect on quality of life were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Results Twenty-five patients were included in each group. The technical success was 100% in both groups. There was no significant difference between RPTBD and LPTBD groups in terms of major complications [4% and 12%, respectively;p = 0.297] and minor complications [40% and 32%, respectively;p = 0.597]. Further, the average procedure time (37.80 +/- 13.07 min vs 41.04 +/- 14.94 min), fluoroscopy time (5.88 +/- 4.2 min vs 5.97 +/- 3.8 min), radiation doses to the operator (136.84 +/- 106.67 mu Sv vs 130.40 +/- 106.46 mu Sv) and to the patient (8.23 +/- 5.80 Gycm(2)vs 11.74 +/- 11.28 Gycm(2)) were not significantly different between the groups. Clinical success was achieved in 21 patients (84%) of RPTBD group and 17 patients (68%) of LPTBD group with no significant difference (p = 0.416) between them. Conclusion There was no significant difference between RPTBD and LPTBD with reference to the technique, safety, radiation dose, success rates and impact on quality of life suggesting no laterality advantage for biliary drainage in cases of MBO.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: Complex upper eyelid lacerations can present to the emergency department after a myriad of trauma. The goal of the surgical repair is anatomical and functional recovery along with symmetrical cosmesis. Despite meticulous surgery, post traumatic blepharoptosis may develop. We describe an additional step during upper eyelid laceration repair to help mitigate the development of traumatic blepharoptosis. Methods: Patients with traumatic eyelid laceration without head injury, globe injury or associated orbital fractures, who were planned for a primary upper eyelid repair were included. Intraoperatively, wound margins and tissues were identified to establish anatomical continuity. After the LPS muscle was reinserted onto the tarsus, a single, central suture LPS plication - the "central levator tuck" was performed. This helped in improving the muscle action as well as strengthening its reattachment onto tarsus. Results: Four cases underwent laceration repair with this modified technique. The nature of eyelid injury, surgical technique, and the outcome at 6 months is described. Three patients had a successful outcome, whereas one patient developed early scarring which reduced with scar therapy over time. Conclusion: We describe a simple and effective "central levator tuck" technique for traumatic eyelid laceration repair with optimal functional and cosmetic outcome while reducing the development of blepharoptosis in four patients.

AB  - Objectives (1) Development and validation of a composite ultrasound score (cUSS) for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). (2) To predict treatment response after local corticosteroid injection. Methods Wrists of CTS patients and controls were evaluated with high-resolution ultrasound and cross-sectional area of median nerve at carpal tunnel inlet (CSAp) and outlet (CSAd) and bowing of flexor retinaculum (FRB), flexor tenosynovitis, and intraneural vascularity and echogenicity changes were noted. Patients were prospectively followed after ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection. Results We studied 479 wrists of 141 patients and 99 controls. Optimal cut-offs for diagnosing CTS were 9.5 mm(2)and 10.5 mm(2), respectively, for CSAp and CSAd. A cUSS consisting of the following parameters was developed: age, CSAp, CSAd, FRB, and flexor tenosynovitis and echogenicity changes. External validation of cUSS yielded sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 91.7%, 87.1%, and 89.8%, respectively. Treatment responses from 88 injections (median duration of follow-up of 6 months) were available with satisfactory initial responses in 69.32% (61/88) and relapses in 30.86% (25/81). Median time to relapse was 2 months. Initial response was predicted by FRB (odds ratio (OR): 5.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-20.3,p = 0.012). Relapse was predicted by age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.168, 95% CI: 1.076-1.268,p = 0.0002), male gender (HR: 8.1.02, 95% CI: 2.394-27.422,p = 0.0007), FRB, (HR: 46.982, 95% CI: 5.048-437.293,p = 0.0008), and higher body mass index (HR: 0.238, 95% CI: 0.064-0.892,p = 0.0332). Conclusions The developed cUSS has a diagnostic accuracy of 88% for diagnosing CTS. Ultrasound parameters could predict both initial treatment response and relapse.

AB  - Background The contact areas in between primary teeth are broader, flatter, and located further cervically when compared with the contact areas of permanent molars. Aim We investigated the prevalence of interproximal contact area types of primary molars using CBCT images in children aged 3-10 years. Our second objective was to correlate OXIS contact areas when observed with CBCT images and clinical photographs. Design A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed with 367 CBCT images of children, aged 3-10 years, obtained from Children's Dental Centre, South Korea. The type of contacts in between primary molars was scored at various levels, specifically, occlusal, middle, and cervical thirds, according to OXIS criteria. Following this, the same patient's records were checked for the presence of clinical photographs and scored according to the same criteria. Prevalence was stated as percentages along with numbers. Chi-square test was applied to determine association of contact areas across genders and arches. The correlation between the two methods was done by Cohen's Kappa correlation test. Results The prevalence of the OXIS contacts obtained from CBCT images was as follows: I (79.7%), followed by X (10.0%), S (6.6%), and, finally, O (3.7%). The overall score of all the 1343 contact areas matched with the score observed at the occlusal third. All included contacts were of O (open) type at cervical third, and 1,231 contacts were of O (open) type at the middle third. Significant results were observed with respect to arches (P < .001). The correlation between the two methods was found to be 0.958. Conclusions The contact area observed at the occlusal level determined the overall type of contact based on OXIS criteria. Thus, reports in the literature concluded that contact areas are broad, flat, and extend further gingivally should be revised. The study also concluded almost perfect agreement between CBCT images and clinical photographs.

AB  - Objective: Anastomosing hemangioma (AH) is a novel tumor of vascular origin. Though well-documented in the kidney and retroperitoneum, only a single case has been documented in the head and neck, and AH in larynx has not been described.
   Methods: A 37-year-old male presented with difficulty in breathing, and hoarseness. Imaging revealed a lesion involving left paraglottic and cricothyroid spaces with destruction of cricoid cartilage, suggestive of a malignant cartilageneous neoplasm. Multiple biopsies were non-diagnostic.
   Results: Intraoperative frozen section during transcervical resection showed a vascular tumor devoid of nuclear atypia. Histopathological examination revealed a vasoformative tumor comprised of anastomosing capillary-sized vessels lined by flat and hobnail endothelial cells, consistent with AH. The patient was disease-free at 12 months.
   Conclusion: AH are rare neoplasms that may mimic a malignancy on imaging, especially in sites where they have not been documented. Due to their vascular nature, biopsies are often non-diagnostic, making preoperative diagnosis difficult. Frozen section may assist in decision-making on the extent of resection required.

AB  - Purpose H3K27M mutant diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are considered grade IV irrespective of histological features and have dismal prognosis. We evaluated clinico-pathologic, radiological, and molecular characteristics of DMGs across all ages. Methods One twenty-six DMGs were identified over 10 years. Immunohistochemistry was done for H3K27M, ATRX, IDH1, and p53, and Sanger sequencing performed for IDH1 and H3K27M mutation. Patient demographics and clinico-radiologic characteristics were reviewed and survival analysis performed. Results DMGs comprised 5.3% of all gliomas with 49.2% H3K27M mutant and 50.8% wild types. Majority (75.68%) of pediatric and 38.20% of adults were H3K27M mutant (p = 0.0001). Amongst H3K27M mutants, brainstem (46.43%) was the commonest location in pediatric and thalamus (61.76%) in adults. H3K27M mutation was mutually exclusive with IDH mutation in 93.55%, while p53, ATRX mutation were seen in 56.4% and 30.6% cases respectively. Software-based immunohistochemistry evaluation (H-scoring) showed 99.2% concordance with sequencing for H3K27M mutation. Radiologically, no significant difference in contrast enhancement was seen between mutant and wild types (p = 0.05). The difference in overall survival (OS) was not significant in mutant versus wild types, with age or location. Tumor resection independently and on correlation with H3K27M did not influence OS (p = 0.51 andp = 0.47). Adjuvant therapy impacted survival significantly in adults (p = 0.0009), however, not in pediatric cases (p = 0.06). Conclusions The study highlights the differences in frequency and location of pediatric and adult DMGs. IHC (H-scoring) for H3K27M mutation is an excellent surrogate for sequencing. Prognosis remains dismal irrespective of age, location, and H3K27M status. Potential therapeutic targets need to be explored.

AB  - The recent pandemic situation transpired due to coronavirus novel strain SARS-CoV-2 has become a global concern. This human coronavirus (HCov-19) has put the world on high alert as the numbers of confirmed cases are continuously increasing. The world is now fighting against this deadly virus and is leaving no stone unturned to find effective treatments through testing of various available drugs, including those effective against flu, malaria, etc. With an urgent need for the development of potential strategies, two recent studies from China using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia have shed some light on a potential cure for the COVID-19 infected patients. However, MSCs, despite being used in various other clinical trials have always been questioned for their tendency to aggregate or form clumps in the injured or disease microenvironment. It has also been reported in various studies that exosomes secreted by these MSCs, contribute towards the cell's biological and therapeutic efficacy. There have been reports evaluating the safety and feasibility of these exosomes in various lung diseases, thereby proposing them as a cell-free therapeutic agent. Also, attractive features like cell targeting, low-immunogenicity, safety, and high biocompatibility distinguish these exosomes from other synthetic nano-vesicles and thus potentiate their role as a drug delivery nano-platform. Building upon these observations, herein, efforts are made to give an overview of stem cell-derived exosomes as an appealing therapeutic agent and drug delivery nano-carrier. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the recent evidence and developments in understanding exosomes as a promising candidate for novel nano-intervention in the current pandemic scenario. Furthermore, this review will highlight and discuss mechanistic role of exosomes to combat severe lung pathological conditions. We have also attempted to dwell into the nano-formulation of exosomes for its better applicability, storage, and stability thereby conferring them as off the shelf therapeutic.

AB  - The strength between the cortical screw and bone following an orthopaedic implant surgery is an important determinant for the success of osteosynthesis. An excessive axial cutting force during drilling produces microcracks in the bone surface, resulting in reduced strength between the screw and bone, resulting in loosening of implant. The present work, investigates the influence of drilling parameters on microcracks generated in the drilled surface and pull-out strength of screw fixed in cortical bone of human tibia. The holes were drilled by two different techniques: conventional surgical bone drilling (CSBD) and rotary ultrasonic bone drilling (RUBD), by a recently developed operation theatre (OT) compatible machine. Cutting force generated in drilling of human tibia using RUBD was 30-40% lesser than that of CSBD. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also revealed that RUBD produced significantly lesser and thinner microcracks than that of CSBD in human bones. Biomechanical pull-out test results showed that, the pull-out strength of screws inserted into drilled holes by RUBD was much higher (100-150%) than that of CSBD. A significant difference in pull-out strength (p< 0.05) between RUBD and CSBD was revealed by statistical analysis at 95% confidence interval.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and has been declared as pandemic disease by World Health Organization. Lack of targeted therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-2019 have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or drugs against this novel virus. Many synthetic compounds and antimalarial drugs are undergoing clinical trials. The traditional medical practitioners widely use Indian medicinal plantWithania somnifera(Ashwagandha) natural constituents, called withanolides for curing various diseases. The main protease (M-pro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in disease propagation by processing the polyproteins which are required for its replication. Hence, it denotes a significant target for drug discovery. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of 40 natural chemical constituents of Ashwagandha to explore a possible inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by adopting the computational approach. The docking study revealed that four constituents of Ashwagandha; Withanoside II (-11.30 Kcal/mol), Withanoside IV (-11.02 Kcal/mol), Withanoside V (-8.96 Kcal/mol) and Sitoindoside IX (-8.37 Kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking energy among the selected natural constituents. Further, MD simulation study of 100 ns predicts Withanoside V possess strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and indicates its stability in the active site. The binding free energy score also correlates with the highest score of -87.01 +/- 5.01 Kcal/mol as compared to other selected compounds. In conclusion, our study suggests that Withanoside V in Ashwagandha may be serve as a potential inhibitor against M(pro)of SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 and may have an antiviral effect on nCoV.

AB  - Objectives The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of synchronous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The secondary objective was to determine risk factors for the development of synchronous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCN). Study Design: Cross sectional observation study. Methods A prospective cross sectional, observational study on consecutive 300 newly diagnosed oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients who underwent trans-nasal esophageal endoscopy with white light imaging and narrow band imaging. Results Among 300 patients, index HNSCCs were located in the oral cavity (n = 154, 51.3%), oropharynx (n = 63, 21%), larynx (n = 53, 17.7%), and hypopharynx (n = 30, 10%). The prevalence of synchronous ESCN was 2.7% (n = 8), including four low-grade, two high-grade dysplasia, and two squamous cell carcinomas. On logistic regression analysis, moderate to heavy alcohol consumption (OR 8.7,P= .01) and primary HNSCC involving supraglottis [(OR 12.5,P= .02) were risk factors for synchronous ESCN. The association of pyriform sinus carcinoma and synchronous ESCN was of borderline significance (P= .054, OR 10.92). Conclusion The prevalence of synchronous ESCN in HNSCC was 2.7%. Routine trans-nasal esophagoscopy should be performed in all newly diagnosed patients with carcinoma of the supraglottis and pyriform sinus, and those with consumption of moderate to heavy alcohol for the screening of synchronous ESCN.

AB  - In single-layer interrupted intestinal anastomosis, the inter-suture distance is conventionally kept at 4 to 5 mm. There is no human study which has described which is the appropriate inter-suture distance. A study that has investigated the gap between sutures in rats concluded that a small distance between sutures (1.5 mm) improves apposition compared with a larger distance (2.5 mm). We hypothesize that in humans also close inter-suture distance should have better apposition and healing. We performed case series to evaluate the rate of anastomotic leak and anastomotic stricture in ileoileal and ileocolic anastomosis with close inter-suture distance of 3 mm. The patients of ileostomy closure were taken for the study, and anastomosis was hand-sewn, single layer, full thickness, interrupted with 3-0 polydioxanone or polyglactin. We performed anastomosis in 38 patients. Five patients had superficial surgical site infection, which was managed with dressing and required secondary skin closure. No patients had an anastomotic leak. No patient had stricture related complaints in the mean follow-up period of 16 months (range 6 to 22 months). Our case series on anastomotic technique looks promising in decreasing anastomotic complications. A comparative study with randomization can throw more light on it.

AB  - Background The aging trajectory from a state of robustness and good health proceeds from sarcopenia to frailty followed by disability and death due to decline in skeletal muscle mass and function. Sarcopenia is now formally recognized as a muscle disease with an ICD-10-MC diagnosis code. The autophagic response seems to be affected in the skeletal muscle during aging contributing to sarcopenia. Sestrins (Sesns) proteins play a critical role in autophagy induction under cellular stress conditions. Aims The study aims to identify sarcopenia in older adults using Asian Working group guidelines (AWGS) to determine clinically relevant cut-off levels for diagnosis and their association with antioxidant protein Sesns. Methods The study recruited 102 older adults attending Geriatric medicine OPD AIIMS, New Delhi, India. The level of serum Sesns were evaluated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and validated by immunoblotting. Fifty older adults were diagnosed as sarcopenics according to AWGS. Results Sesn 1 (p = 0.0448) and Sesn 2 (p < 0.0001) levels were significantly reduced in sarcopenic compared to non-sarcopenic. ROC analysis showed a better cut-off of Sesn 2; 10.104 ng/mu L with 92% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Even after adjusting the values with respect to confounding factors, Sesn levels remained significantly reduced in sarcopenics (p < 0.030). Discussion The level of Sesn 2 showed positive co-relation with the characteristics of sarcopenia. This study first time reported the concentration of serum sestrin in sarcopenic older adults. Conclusion It can be concluded that sarcopenia can be diagnosed at the early stage by using the serum sestrin scale as one of the potential biomarker.

AB  - Children born in fluorosis endemic areas usually suffer from gastrointestinal complications and are unable to attain normal growth as per their age group. The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls gut movement and functions. It is highly vulnerable to any ingested toxins. Based on observations, it was hypothesized that fluoride exposure during pregnancy and lactation might induce ENS developmental defects. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of fluoride exposure during pregnancy and lactation on ENS of the first-generation rat pups. After confirmation of pregnancy, female rats were divided into 3 groups and kept on normal water (group 1), 50 ppm of fluoride (group 2), and 100 ppm of fluoride (group 3). The fluoride exposure started at the start of pregnancy and continued until lactation. On the 21st post-natal day, the pups were euthanized and the gut tissue and blood were harvested and subjected to fluoride measurement, oxidative stress estimation, histopathological and ultrastructural analysis, TUNEL, and immunofluorescence. The quantitative expressional analysis of embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like 4 (ELAVL4)(a pan-neuronal marker) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (a glial cell marker) genes was performed by RT-qPCR. An increase in oxidative stress, subcellular and cellular injuries, and apoptosis in enteric neuronal, glial, and epithelial cells was observed in the distal colon of the first-generation pups. Ganglionic degeneration, reduced expression of HuC/D and GFAP, altered colon muscle layer thickness, and tissue edema were observed in the fluoride-treated groups compared with the control. Fluoride exposure during prenatal and lactation period leads to subcellular and cellular injuries due to increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in the ENS. The reduction in the number of neurons and glia due to increased apoptosis may cause alterations in ENS development.

AB  - Inhibition of Sirtuin2 (SIRT2) protein rescues the alpha-synuclein toxicity in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thioacetyl group can structurally mimic the acetyl group and restrain the deacetylating p53 reaction by SIRT2. This work evaluated the biological activity of designed pentapeptides inhibitor containingN-thioacetyl-lysine against SIRT2. Pentapeptide by introducing thioacetyl-lysine as an inhibitor of SIRT2 was screened by molecular docking and synthesized by solid phase method. The inhibition of pure recombinant SIRT2 as well as SIRT2 in serum of PD patients by peptide was done by fluorescent activity assay. The inhibition of SIRT2 was assessed in PC12 cell line by measuring acetylated alpha-tubulin level. The peptide YKK(epsilon-thioAc)AM and HRK(epsilon-thioAc)AM were found to be SIRT2 inhibitors by molecular docking. However, YKK(epsilon-thioAc)AM was more specific towards SIRT2 than SIRT1 (Sirtuin1). It inhibited recombinant SIRT2 by IC(50)value of 0.15 mu M and KD values 9.92 x 10(-8)/M. It also inhibited serum SIRT2 of PD. It increased the acetylation of alpha-tubulin in PC12 neuroblastoma cells which is essential for maintaining the microtubular cell functions of brain. It can be concluded that novel peptide YKK(epsilon-thioAc)AM may be a platform for therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease targeting SIRT2.

AB  - Introduction: Preretinal hemorrhages can be located in subhyaloid or sub-internal limiting membrane (ILM) space. Though optical coherence tomography (OCT) may help to distinguish the exact location of hemorrhage in selected cases, it is often difficult to discern clinically. The purpose is to describe a novel clinical sign named "arcus retinalis" as a clinical marker of sub-ILM hemorrhage. Methods: Retrospective observational case series. Ophthalmic records of 31 eyes with sub-ILM hemorrhage were analyzed. The sub-ILM nature of the hemorrhage was confirmed either by the presence of two distinct layers (ILM and posterior hyaloid) on OCT or on intraoperative sub-ILM localization of the hemorrhage during vitrectomy. Results: 15 out of 31 eyes with sub-ILM hemorrhage demonstrated a retinal yellowish-white arc corresponding to the outer margin of the sub-ILM hemorrhage. A complete circle was not seen in most of the cases. This arc corresponded to a vertical peg-like structure in the outer retina on OCT and had a tendency to fade away over months. In 10 eyes, it was visible at presentation and in five eyes it could only be seen after clearing of the hemorrhage. Conclusion: Retinal yellowish-white arc ("arcus retinalis") is a useful clinical marker of sub-ILM hemorrhage with distinct OCT features that tends to disappear with time.

AB  - Radiology plays a very important role in the management of acutely injured patients. As per the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, it has been made an integral part of primary and secondary surveys. The primary objective of the imaging during the primary survey is to identify immediately life-threatening injuries and to assist in resuscitation of the patient. While during the secondary survey, imaging modality is aimed to assist in definitive management of the trauma patient. However, imaging modality should never hamper the resuscitation process of the patient and should be used judiciously. This review is aimed to study the indications, advantages and disadvantages of these modalities and to guide the treating trauma surgeons about the utilization of imaging modalities in different aspects of the trauma care.

AB  - Purpose The current study aimed to explore whether Internet gaming disorder (IGD) should be considered a subtype of generalised problematic Internet use (PIU) by assessing the degree of overlap between them and comparing their correlates. The sociodemographic profile and presence of depressive symptoms were studied as correlates for IGD and generalised PIU. Design and Methods This was a self-report survey administered online among medical students (n = 306). Finding Less than half of the participants with IGD (45.45%; 5 out of 11) also met the criteria for generalised PIU. Only 6.67% (5 out of 75) of subjects with generalised PIU were also classified as having IGD. Male gender and time spent on digital gaming per day were associated with greater risk of IGD; whereas the time spent on Internet per day and more frequent use of the Internet for social networking rather than academic purposes were associated with greater risk of generalised PIU. The regression models built for IGD and generalised PIU were statistically significant (F = 64.10;P < .01 andF = 80.97;P < .01, respectively). The two models explained 66.1% and 57.4% of the variance in IGDS-SF and GPIUS2 scores, respectively. Practice Implications The IGD and generalised PIU appear to be conceptually distinct entities. The IGD should not be assumed as a subtype of generalised PIU. Thus, health care providers need to focus on IGD beyond and besides generalised PIU. There is a need to specifically enquire about IGD while screening for behavioural addictions involving use of Internet.

AB  - Background With standardization of laparoscopic technique of groin hernia repair, the focus of surgical outcome has shifted to lesser studied parameters like sexual function and fertility. Methods This prospective randomized study was conducted in a single surgical unit at a tertiary care hospital. A sample size of 144 was calculated with 72 in each group (Group 1 TEP and Group 2 TAPP). Primary outcomes measured included comparison of sexual function using BMFSI, qualitative semen analysis and ASA levels between patients undergoing TEP or TAPP repair. Semen analysis and ASA was measured pre-operatively and 3 months post-operatively. Results A total of 145 patients were randomized into two groups, TAPP (73) and TEP (72) patients. Both the groups were comparable in terms of demographic profile and hernia characteristics with majority of the patients in both the groups having unilateral inguinal hernia (89.0% in TAPP group and 79.2% in TEP group). Both the groups showed statistically significant improvement in overall sexual function score (BMFSI) at 3 months; however, there was no inter group difference. Both the groups were also comparable in terms of ASA and qualitative semen analysis. Conclusion Both TEP and TAPP repair are comparable in terms of sexual function and effect on semen analysis. Laparoscopic repair improves the overall sexual functions in patients with groin hernia.

AB  - Background With evolving technology, the focus of groin hernia repair has shifted to sexual function and fertility outcomes. Methods This three-arm randomized study was conducted in tertiary care hospital from 1st July 2017 to 30th March 2019. Consecutive patients of groin hernia were randomized into 3 groups, TAPP (Group 1), TEP (Group 2), and OMH (Group 3). Demographic profile and hernia characteristics were assessed preoperatively. Sexual functions (using BMSFI) and fertility (using surrogate fertility indices, viz., semen analysis and anti-sperm antibodies (ASA)) were assessed preoperatively at 3 months after the surgery. Results A total of 121 patients were included in the study with 41 patients in TAPP (Group 1) and 40 each in TEP (Group 2) and OMH (Group3) group. All the 3 groups were comparable in terms of demographic profile, hernia characteristics, intra-operative and early post-operative outcomes. Significant improvement was found in most of the domains of BMSFI score in the study population (pvalue < 0.001) with no intergroup difference. There was significant increase of anti-sperm antibody level in OMH group as compared to TAPP and TEP (p = 0.001), however, the levels were within normal limit. Conclusions In conclusion, this study has shown that inguinal hernia repair whether open or laparoscopic (TEP or TAPP) leads on to improvement in sexual functions and fertility indices and can have a significant impact on pre-op counseling of the patient in terms of choice of repair, depending on the available expertise in a given center.

AB  - Objective To determine if early discontinuation of antimicrobials in pediatric patients with low risk febrile neutropenia is as effective as continuing therapy before recovery of counts, in an outpatient setting. Methods In an open label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled phase 3 trial at a tertiary cancer center, patients aged 3-18 y, with low risk febrile neutropenia were started on empirical intra-venous antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Randomization was done when the patients became afebrile for at least 24 h; standard arm consisted of oral antibiotics, while antibiotics were stopped in the experimental arm. Enrolled patients were followed for re-appearance of fever and rate of re-admission, until ANC >= 500. A pilot feasibility randomized study with similar design preceded this trial. Results From Jan 2017-Dec 2018, 75 patients were randomized: 38 to stoppage arm while 37 patients received oral antibiotics. Baseline characteristics were equally matched. Success rates were 94.6% in the continuation arm vs. 94.7% in the stoppage arm; absolute risk difference was 0.1% (95% CI: -10.0% to +10.3%), thus suggesting that the experimental arm is non-inferior to the standard arm. There was no re-admission on failure in any arm. Conclusions Antimicrobial therapy in low risk afebrile neutropenic patients can be stopped early. This approach can lead to significant cost and resource benefits.

AB  - Introduction Chronic migraine is a disease of altered cortical excitability. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation provides a novel non-invasive method to target the nociceptive circuits in the cortex. Motor cortex is one such potential target. In this study, we targeted the left motor cortex using fMRI-guided neuronavigation. Materials and Methods Twenty right-handed patients were randomized into real and sham rTMS group. Baseline subjective pain assessments were done using visual analog scale (VAS) and questionnaires: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Becks Depression Inventory, and Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire. Objectively, pain was assessed by means of thermal pain thresholds using quantitative sensory testing. For corticomotor excitability parameters, resting motor thresholds and motor-evoked potentials were mapped. For rTMS total, 600 pulses in 10 trains at 10 Hz with an intertrain interval of 60 s were delivered in each session. Ten such sessions were given 5 days per week over 2 consecutive weeks. The duration of each session was 10 min. Real rTMS was administered at 70% of Resting MT. All the tests were repeated post-intervention and after 1 month of follow-up. There are no studies reporting the use of fMRI-based TMS for targeting the motor cortex in CM patients. Results We observed a significant reduction in the mean VAS rating, headache frequency, and MIDAS questionnaire in real rTMS group which was maintained after 1 month of follow-up. Conclusion Ten sessions of fMRI-based rTMS over the left motor cortex may provide long-term pain relief in CM, but further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with majority of trauma deaths, and objective tools are required to understand the severity of injury. The application of a biomarker like procalcitonin (PCT) in TBI may allow for assessment of severity and thus aid in prognostication and correlation with mortality and outcome. Aims The primary objective is to determine the correlation between PCT concentrations with TBI outcomes (mainly in terms of mortality) at intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital discharge. Secondary objectives are to evaluate correlation with associated extra cranial injuries and complications during hospital stay. Methods In total, 186 TBI patients aged > 18 years with minimum survival for at least 12 h admitted to the ICU at the level 1 trauma center were prospectively included in the study and divided into two groups: TBI with and without extra cranial injuries. All admitted patients were treated according to the standard institutional protocol. The PCT levels were obtained on admission, on day 2, and 5. Clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic data were also collected. Primary mortality is defined as death related to central nervous system (CNS) injury, while secondary mortality defined as death related to sepsis or extracranial cause. Results Median PCT levels at admission, day 2, and day 5 in TBI patients with extracranial injuries were 3.0, 0.83, and 0.69 ng/ml. In total, primary mortality was observed in 18 (9.7%) patients, while secondary causes were attributable in 20 (12.3%) patients. Regression analysis for primarily CNS cause of mortality showed PCT cutoff level at admission more than 5.5 ng/ml carried sensitivity and specificity of 75%, but for secondary cause (sepsis) of mortality, PCT cutoff values on day 2 > 1.15 ng/ml were derived significant with sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%. No significant association of parameters like length of ICU stay, Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), and primary/secondary mortality with the presence of extracranial injuries in TBI patients as compared with TBI alone was noted. Conclusion This observational study demonstrates the poor correlation between PCT concentrations with outcome at days 1, 2, and 5 post-injury. The predicted relationship between PCT levels and outcome was not confirmed, and that these results do not support the prognostic utility of PCT biomarker in this population for outcome (mortality) assessment in TBI patients with or without extracranial injuries.

AB  - Objective To present and analyse the radiological findings, surgical findings, pre-implantation and post-implantation speech and hearing outcomes of nine children with SMS Type III cochleovestibular malformation. Study design Retrospective case series of nine children with pre-lingual profound sensorineural hearing loss who underwent cochlear implantation (Jan 2012 to July 2019). These children had been classified as Type III malformation according to the SMS Classification of cochleovestibular anomalies. Facial nerve anomalies, CSF leaks and any other significant surgical finding were noted. Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS) was used to report the child's pre-operative and two-year post-implantation auditory and speech abilities. Any significant improvement was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.Pvalue < 0.05 was considered significant. Results Out of nine patients, five patients sustained CSF gushers, while three patients had mild CSF leak, which were plugged adequately. No facial nerve anomalies were encountered. Post-op course was uneventful for all nine patients. MAIS scores at a two-year follow-up showed significant statistical improvement (P < 0.05) when compared to pre-operative scores. Conclusion Cochlear implant is the treatment of choice for children with type III cochleovestibular malformation. There are significant auditory and speech improvements expected. However, the surgeon should bear in mind the risk of CSF leak and subsequent meningitis.

AB  - Isolated duodenal injuries are not commonly seen in children who sustain abdominal trauma, and a complete pyloroduodenal disruption is quite rare. While techniques of duodenal diverticulization are employed widely in adults, the application of intubated diversion with primary repair works just as well in children. Two cases of isolated pyloroduodenal transection have been chronicled. To the best of our knowledge, one of these is the first case of successfully treated complete pyloroduodenal disjunction in pediatric literature. Case 1: A 10-year-old boy sustained multiple injuries after a road traffic accident and presented to us 48-h post-incident. Imaging suggested a duodenal injury. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a complete pyloroduodenal transection without associated pancreatic/ductal injuries. Primary repair with intubated diversions and a feeding jejunostomy was done. The child recovered completely. Case 2: A 5-year-old girl with delayed presentation following a road traffic accident required cardiopulmonary resuscitation and inotropic support prior to exploratory laparotomy. Findings included a large retroperitoneal hematoma involving zone 1 and 2, a right hepatic laceration, gastroduodenal disruption, and impending venous gangrene of the bowel. Intraoperative cardiac arrest necessitated rapid damage control surgery. Unfortunately, the child did not survive the injury. We wish to emphasize not only the need for early diagnosis and the customization of the surgery depending on the site and extent of injury but also the necessity of the rapid establishment of enteral nutrition to enhance recovery.

AB  - PNH is a rare disease with wide spectrum of intra-vascular hemolysis and thrombosis to sub-clinical PNH clones. We aimed to study the clinico-hematological profile and clone size on granulocytes and monocytes of PNH patients classified as per International PNH Interest Group recommendations. A retrospective analysis of clinico-hematological profile of 112 PNH clone positive patients by FLAER based flow cytometry between January and September 2017 done and classified into classical PNH, PNH with aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (PNH-AA/MDS) and sub-clinical PNH clones (PNH-sc). Of 112 patients, majority were PNH-sc (62) followed by PNH-AA/MDS (34) and classical PNH (16). The commonest clinical feature was anemia in all 3 groups followed by jaundice (87.5%) in classical PNH and fever in PNH-AA/MDS (64.7%) and PNH-sc (48.4%). Thrombosis was present in 25% (4/16) classical PNH and 2.9% (1/34) of PNH-AA/MDS. The mean hemoglobin, reticulocyte count and LDH was higher in classical PNH. Bone marrow was predominantly hypercellular in classical PNH (11/16) and hypocellular in PNH-AA/MDS (31/34) and PNH-sc (50/62) with dyserythropoiesis predominantly in PNH-AA/MDS (83.8%) and PNH-sc (74.1%). Marrow iron was reduced in 62.2% classical PNH contrary to increased in PNH-BMF (58%) and PNH-sc (91%). The mean clone size in PNH-sc was significantly lower with > 50% in 16.2% patients. Three patients with MDS-MLD and MDS-MLD-RS in PNH-sc had > 80% clone on granulocytes and monocytes. Most PNH patients in Indian setting are PNH-sc with significantly lower clone, however, a clone size > 50% is not uncommon in Indian PNH-sc.

AB  - Objective To compare the psychiatric co-morbidity and Body image disturbances of obese adolescents with age and gender matched normal weight controls. Methods A case control study was conducted in a school in New Delhi. Nine hundred seventy six students were screened for height and weight and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Thirty one consenting obese students as per International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) guidelines and 31 age and gender matched normal weight students were recruited for the study. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to assess socio-demographic details, psychiatric co-morbidity using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview- child and adolescent version (MINI-KID), and body image disturbances by Body Shape Questionnaire-the 8 items shorter version (BSQ-8C). The authors examined the relationships between variables measured on these scales and anthropometric data. Results Of the 976 students screened, 33 (3.38%) students were obese; 21 boys (3.25%) and 12 girls (3.65%). Of the 31 consenting obese subjects and an equal number of age and sex matched controls included in the study, 68% and 7% of them were diagnosed with a DSM-IV disorder based on MINI-KID respectively. The most common diagnosis in the obese group was social phobia (36%) followed by specific phobia (19%) and major depressive disorder (19%). Ninety percent of the obese samples expressed concern over body shape as against 29% in the control subjects. Among obese subjects, 36% expressed mild concern, another 36% expressed moderate concern and 19% expressed marked concern over body shape. Conclusions Psychiatric co-morbidity and body shape dissatisfaction are common in obese non-treatment seeking adolescents and warrants need for comprehensive evaluation and management of these issues to manage the epidemic of adolescent obesity in India.

AB  - Purpose To describe the role of combined topical cyclosporine (CsA) 0.1% and tacrolimus 0.03% in cases with severe steroid intolerant vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). Methods Medical records of patients with acute exacerbation of VKC and steroid intolerance referred from glaucoma to cornea clinic were reviewed from March 2017 to December 2018. Eleven patients (22 eyes), (nine with steroid-induced glaucoma, two with steroid-induced cataract and glaucoma) were found. All were started on topical CsA 0.1% QID. Due to suboptimal response at 2 weeks, topical tacrolimus 0.03% BD was also included. Results The mean total subjective score at presentation was 13 +/- 1.4, which reduced to 11.2 +/- 1.3 at 2 weeks of topical CsA therapy and further reduced to 5 +/- 0 at 2 weeks of combination therapy (p < 0.001). The mean total objective score at presentation was 9.4 +/- 1.4 that reduced to 8.0 +/- 1.3 at 2 weeks of topical CsA therapy and further reduced to 4.3 +/- 1.6 at 2 weeks of combination therapy (p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained in a sub-group analysis including the worse eye or right eye of the cases only. The absolute change in the total subjective and objective score was much more with combination therapy. Photophobia and conjunctival hyperemia resolved within 4 weeks of combined therapy. No recurrence was observed till 6 months follow-up. Conclusions Combined use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus may lead to rapid resolution of symptoms and reduced recurrence rate in cases with severe VKC where steroid has to be avoided.

AB  - Thoracic trauma severity score (TTSS) has been used to assess severity and risk of pulmonary complications in patients with chest trauma. The role of cytokines and biomarkers in patients with chest trauma and its association with TTSS is not well elucidated. The aim of the study was to assess the cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha) and biomarkers (vWF, CC-16) in patients of thoracic trauma and correlate it with TTSS and patient's outcome. This was a prospective observational study. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected from chest trauma patients. TTSS was calculated in all patients. Suitable controls for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample were selected. The outcome parameters included patient discharge or death, duration of hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Forty-three patients were included. There was no significant correlation between the measured cytokines and biomarkers and TTSS. The mean TTSS of patients who had a fatal outcome was significantly higher than the patients who recovered. Patients with a high TTSS score had a significant prolonged ICU stay. Patients with a prolonged hospital stay had lower values of CC-16. TTSS is a useful tool to predict severity of chest trauma and prolonged ICU stay. Lower levels of CC-16 in BAL fluid of chest trauma patients were associated with prolonged hospital stay suggestive of its protective role in the airway. Longer prospective studies are required to determine the role of cytokines and biomarkers in patients with thoracic trauma in predicting the patient's outcome.

AB  - B cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common leukemia occurring in children and young adults and is the leading cause of cancer related deaths. The 5 year overall survival outcome in children with B-ALL has improved significantly in the last few decades. In the past, the discovery of various genetic alterations and targeted therapy have played a major role in decreasing disease-related deaths. In addition, numerous advances in the pathogenesis of B-ALL have been found which have provided better understanding of the genes involved in disease biology with respect to diagnostic and prognostic implications. Present review will summarize current understanding of risk stratification, genetic factors including cytogenetics in diagnosis and prognosis of B-ALL.

AB  - With the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the Indian healthcare sector is at the forefront to deliver optimal care. Patients with cancer especially are at serious risk for increased chances of morbidity and mortality due to their immunocompromised state. Currently there is a paucity of definitive guidelines for the management of sarcomas during the pandemic in a resource-constrained and diverse population setting like India. Health care professionals from various specialties involved in the management of sarcomas have collaborated to discuss various aspects of evidence-based sarcoma management during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides structured recommendations for HCP to adapt to the situation, optimize treatment protocols with judicious use of all resources while providing evidence-based treatment for sarcoma patients.

AB  - This prospective study was conducted in collaboration with the Department of Surgical Oncology and Nursing. A total of 60 patients (30 patients in each group selected in consecutive fashion) were included based on assumption of alpha error and power of 5% and 90% respectively. A structured questionnaire for knowledge assessment of primary caregivers before and after intervention was used in the intervention group. The control group received routine care. The demographic profile, tumor location, and surgical intervention were comparable in both groups. At the initial assessment, 76.3% of patient's caregivers did not have prior knowledge of post-operative care. With the specific educational intervention, 68% of the caregivers in the interventional group obtained poor (0-11) knowledge score which was improved to good score (19-25) in 73% of caregivers after the administration of the educational package but this improvement was not seen in the control group which received routine care. This study suggested that there is a need for specific educational package for the primary caregivers to improve their knowledge regarding home-based post-operative care of oral cancer patients that helps in the early recovery of the surgical patients.

AB  - Background India has a large youth population whose mental health needs must be addressed. This includes promotion of positive mental health, with early detection and effective intervention for mental health disorders. Understanding the perspectives of community stakeholders working with youth is pivotal to this effort. Current study aimed to bring together a group of community stakeholders (eg, parents, teachers, policy makers) to understand their perspectives on youth mental health problems, challenges in provision of care, and to provide recommendations to address these concerns at national level.
   Materials and methods The study was conducted across two sites in India: Chennai and New Delhi. Three group meetings were conducted involving 52 participants, including governmental, non-governmental and community representatives working with youth. The proceedings were manually recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis method.
   Results Many youth mental health problems were similar across the two sites. The commonest drivers of mental health problems were reported to be academic pressure, substance use and problematic internet/social media use. Stigma and lack of awareness were identified as the most important challenges acting as barriers to seeking mental health help by youth. Prioritizing youth mental health as a national programmes along with strong political will were the major recommendations suggested by the stakeholders.
   Conclusion Initial findings suggest that prioritizing youth mental health programmes in India would be advantageous. Inclusive and collaborative approach, involving community stakeholders working with youth in providing services that promote mental health and early access to care will help in developing healthy young citizens.

AB  - We analyzed one feasible timeline of critical surgery within the first hour of admission as a possible intervention, which could be applied in existing trauma systems in Low and middle-income countries (LMIC), and may improve trauma care outcomes. Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained data registry under project named TITCO (Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcome) was done at a level one trauma center in India from October 2013 to September 2015. All admitted patients who underwent critical surgery within the first hour of admission were analyzed. These patients were divided in two groups depending upon primary presentation or referred from other facility. Statistical analysis was done between these two groups to compare outcome. Sixty-one (57.6%) patients were directly admitted, whereas forty-five (42.4%) were transferred from other hospitals. The median time from injury to presentation for primary patients was 50 min with interquartile range (IQR) of 40. In referred patient median time gap between the injury to our center (not referring center) was 230 min with IQR of 350. This difference was statistically significant. Both the groups were comparable in terms of injury severity measured by ISS. Major outcome indicators in the form of median ICU and total stay, as well as mortality, were not significantly different. We propose that critical surgery within the first hour of presentation might be a useful hospital-based key performance indicator even in the existing trauma systems in LMIC to improve the outcome of injured patients.

AB  - Objective: Cortical dynamics is driven by cortico-cortical connectivity and it characterizes cortical morphological features. These brain surface features complement volumetric changes and may offer improved understanding of disease pathophysiology. Hence, present study aims to investigate surface features; cortical thickness (CT) and gyrification index (GI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients of normal cognition (PD-CN), cognitively impaired patients with PD (PD-CI) in comparison with cognitively normal healthy controls (HC) to better elucidate cognition linked features in PD. Method: Anatomical MRI (3DT1) was carried out in 30 HC (56.53 +/- 8.42 years), 30 PD-CN (58.8 +/- 6.07 years), and 30 PD-CI (60.3 +/- 6.43 years) subjects. Whole brain ROI based parcellation using Desikan-Killiany (DK-40) atlas followed by regional CT and GI differentiation [with 'age' and 'total intracranial volume' (TIV) correction], multiple linear regression (with 'age', 'TIV', and 'education' correction) with clinical variables, ROC analysis, and CT-GI correlation across the groups was used for data analysis. Results: Widespread cortical thinning with regional GI reduction was evident in PD-CI with respect to other two groups (HC and PD-CN), and with absence of such alterations in PD-CN compared to HC. Frontal, parietal, and temporal CT/GI significantly correlated with cognition and presented classification abilities for cognitive state in PD. Mean regional CT and GI were found negatively correlated across groups with heterogeneous regions. Conclusion: Fronto-parietal and temporal regions suffer cognition associated cortical thinning and GI reduction. CT may serve better discriminator properties and may be more consistent than GI in studying cognition in PD. Heterogeneous surface dynamics across the groups may signify neuro-developmental alterations in PD.

AB  - There is a deficient application of qualitative research methods in surgical specialties. The concerned researchers largely focus on quantitative estimates like: health risk, burden, surgical management and objective outcomes. Without qualitative assessment important aspects like: patient's preparation, perception, satisfaction, coping ability, well-being and functional outcomes are not addressed. In quantitative research, evaluation of pre-set variables is done to primarily study the process and outcomes of healthcare interventions. However, in qualitative research, patient's experience, emotions, self-image, decision-making, pain perception, coping mechanism and quality of life (QoL) can be assessed. With time, surgeons are emphasizing more on the importance of functional recovery and QoL after surgery in multidisciplinary board discussions, and before making treatment decisions. Qualitative research employs purposive sampling and a meticulous data collection using in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) etc. Collected data is analysed using statistical tools post transcription and coding and is suitably presented. Like other research designs, qualitative methods also have uniform criteria's and standards for quality management. Adoption of qualitative research is critical in filling gaps of patient and surgeon's perspective and experience of process of surgical care for clinical policy decisions. Integration of qualitative evidence in shared decision-making process will further improve standards and practice of surgical care and enhance doctor-patient relationship.

AB  - Case presentation: A 32-year-old professional bodybuilder presented with acute decompensated heart failure. He gave a history of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) use for >2 years and mephentermine use for the preceding 3 months. Management: Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with a large pedunculated, mobile thrombus attached to the ventricular apex. The patient had an embolic stroke during the hospital stay, with complete neurological recovery. Following the cessation of mephentermine use, there was a steady improvement in LV function over a follow-up of 2 months. However, at 3 months, his ventricular function showed deterioration, which coincided with mephentermine reuse. Take home message: Though AAS abuse by athletes leading to such a presentation has been documented, to the best of our knowledge, a similar role of mephentermine has not been reported.

AB  - Background:
   Short-term peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection rates have not been systematically studied in Asian countries, and data on peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections incidence by number of short-term peripheral venous catheter days are not available.
   Methods:
   Prospective, surveillance study on peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections conducted from 1 September 2013 to 31 May 2019 in 262 intensive care units, members of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium, from 78 hospitals in 32 cities of 8 countries in the South-East Asia Region: China, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. For this research, we applied definition and criteria of the CDC NHSN, methodology of the INICC, and software named INICC Surveillance Online System.
   Results:
   We followed 83,295 intensive care unit patients for 369,371 bed-days and 376,492 peripheral venous catheter-days. We identified 999 peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections, amounting to a rate of 2.65/1000 peripheral venous catheter-days. Mortality in patients with peripheral venous catheter but without peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections was 4.53% and 12.21% in patients with peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections. The mean length of stay in patients with peripheral venous catheter but without peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections was 4.40 days and 7.11 days in patients with peripheral venous catheter and peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections. The microorganism profile showed 67.1% were Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (22.9%), Klebsiella spp (10.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.3%), Enterobacter spp. (4.5%), and others (23.7%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (11.4%).
   Conclusions:
   Infection prevention programs must be implemented to reduce the incidence of peripheral venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections.

AB  - The Asian Society of Mastology (ASOMA) was established with an attempt to bring together experts in the field of breast surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, radiology, pathology, and breast care nursing to update and improve care for the patients with various breast diseases in developing countries. The ASOMA-proposed "Standards of Care for Breast Cancer Patients" has been developed with an attempt to identify obstacles and provide possible solutions to improve quality of care for breast cancer patients. Besides these recommendations for cancer care, issues related to common benign breast diseases, viz. non-lactation mastitis, granulomatous mastitis, high-risk lesions, and issues related to triple assessment, were also deliberated.

AB  - Recent reports have shown that a C-terminal fragment of adhesion protein Fibulin7 (Fbln7-C) could demonstrate both antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. The current study investigated the potential of Fbln7-C as a modulator of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and its potential as an anticancer therapeutic. Our in vitro data show that Fbln7-C could inhibit the tumor cell line (MDA-MB-231) supernatant-induced reprogramming of human monocytes into immunosuppressive TAMs as indicated by higher expression of pERK1/2 and pSTAT1 molecules, and reduced expression of CD206 protein and arg1, ido, and vegf transcripts in monocytes cultured in the presence of Fbln7-C compared to controls. Interestingly, Fbln7-C-treated macrophages retained their altered phenotype even after the removal of Fbln7-C, and their secretome demonstrated anticancer activities. Finally, in a 4T1-induced murine breast tumor model, intravenous administration of Fbln7-C, following the appearance of measurable tumors, significantly reduced the growth and weight of the tumors. Detailed phenotypic analysis of the infiltrated monocyte/macrophage populations (F480(+)Ly6G(-)CD11b(+)) at day 23 postinduction showed a higher percentage of inflammatory monocytes (F480(+)Ly6C(hi)CD11b(+)) and a delayed differentiation into anti-inflammatory TAMs as evident by their reduced levels of CD206 expression. In conclusion, the above data suggest that Fbln7-C could regulate the tumor environment-induced macrophage reprogramming and has the potential for cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Purpose To study the accuracy of deformable registration algorithm for CT and cone beam CT (CBCT) using a combination of physical and digital phantoms. Materials and methods The physical phantoms consisted of objects over a range of electron densities, shape and sizes. The system was tested for simple and complex scenarios including performance in the presence of metallic artefacts. Clinically present deformations were simulated using a set of five geometric and anatomic virtual phantoms. Results The system could not account for large changes in size, shape and Hounsfield units. Deformations of low intensity structures and small objects were highly inaccurate, and errors were prominent for volume reduction scenario than volume growth. The presence of artefacts did alter the performance of the algorithm. Objects of low density and that close to artefacts were affected the most. Overall, deformations to CBCT were poor. In virtual phantoms, the system could not handle gas pockets and deformation errors in inverse direction were higher than that in forward direction. Conclusion The algorithm was tested for several non-clinical and clinical scenarios. The performance was acceptable for realistic and clinically present deformations. However, it is necessary to tread cautiously for structures with small volumes and large reductions in volume.

AB  - Aim Habitual dislocation of patella is an uncommon pathological condition. Though numerous techniques have been described in the literature for the treatment of patellar dislocations, none of the single procedure is fully effective in the surgical treatment of habitual dislocation of patella. We described our experience with a two in one procedure for habitual dislocation of patella in ten children. Patients and method Ten children having habitual dislocation were reviewed prospectively for twelve months following surgical procedure. The age ranged between 5 and 9 years. We performed graded lateral soft tissue release and patellar tendon transposition as described by Roux Goldthwait. Clinical results were evaluated using Kujala score, ability to do straight leg raise, knee range of motion and visual analogue scale. Result There has been no recurrence of dislocation. The mean Kujala score before surgery was 48 which improved to 97.8 at 12 months follow-up after the surgical procedure. At 12 months follow-up all patients were able to do straight leg raise and had almost full range of motion. Conclusion We conclude that extensive proximal lateral release along with Goldthwait Roux procedure helps in treating the habitual dislocation in patella in children. Decision for the extent of lateral release must be taken intra-operatively. Our method of treatment is simple, cost effective and reproducible with excellent functional outcome.

AB  - Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the iris and ciliary body is extremely rare. We present a case which was misdiagnosed as granulomatous uveitis with neovascular glaucoma, and underwent a trabeculectomy with mitomycin-c along with iris biopsy. The post-operative period showed early bleb failure and catastrophic growth of the suspected mass. Histopathological examination revealed a diagnosis iris plasmacytoma. Subsequent ultrasound biomicroscopy showed involvement of the iris and ciliary body. A prompt systemic workup was done, and an associated systemic plasma cell dyscrasia was ruled out. The affected eye was enucleated, and the patient remains disease free at the end of 3-year follow-up.

AB  - Purpose Juvenile onset primary open angle glaucoma (JOAG) is a rare disorder associated with high IOP and progressive optic neuropathy in patients diagnosed before the age of 40 years. While in some populations it has primarily an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, in others it occurs in a primarily sporadic form. The main aim of the study was to assess the relative prevalence of Myocilin (MYOC) mutations in familial versus sporadic cases of JOAG. Methods We screened 92 unrelated (sporadic) JOAG patients, and 22 affected families (70 affected members and 36 unaffected) for variations in theMYOCgene. We also analyzed the clinical features associated with these variations. Results Three coding sequence variants were identified as mutations causing JOAG. Four families segregated distinct mutations at Gly367Arg, and two families at Gln337Arg, while only two sporadic JOAG cases harboredMYOCmutations (Gly367Arg and Gln48His). The frequency ofMYOCmutations in familial cases (27%) was significantly higher than in sporadic JOAG cases (2%);p = 0.001. A 90% penetrance for the Gly367Arg variant was seen by the age of 40 years in our patients. Characteristic allele signatures, indicative of specific founder effects, were not observed for the Gly367Arg mutation that was looked for in 12 patients among 2 geographically close families, which harbored this mutation. Conclusion Our data demonstrated that genetic screening forMYOCmutations should be focused toward cases with familial rather than sporadically occurring JOAG.

AB  - Available sleep deprivation studies lack data on simultaneous changes in hypothalamic, cortical and body temperature during sleep deprivation and recovery. Ten adult male Wistar rats chronically implanted with electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram and electromyogram electrodes for recording sleep were used in this study. Hypothalamic and cortical temperatures were measured by pre-implanted thermocouples. A radio transmitter (TA10TAF-40, DSI USA) was implanted intraperitoneally to measure body temperature. All the temperatures were measured simultaneously at 15-s intervals during baseline conditions, sleep deprivation and recovery sleep. Sleep deprivation was carried out for 24 hr by the gentle handling method; however, sleep and temperature were only recorded during the first 12 hr of deprivation. During sleep deprivation the body, hypothalamic and cortical temperatures increased significantly as compared to baseline. During recovery sleep, body and cortical temperature recovered earlier than the hypothalamic temperature. Hypothalamic temperature remained higher than the baseline values throughout 12 hr of recovery sleep. In the recovery sleep, cortical temperature decreased immediately and reached near baseline by 4 hr. We observed a quicker return of cortical temperature towards control temperature during recovery sleep compared with hypothalamic and body temperature. The results of the present study show that acute sleep deprivation results in a rise in both cortical and hypothalamic temperature, along with body temperature. A rise in cortical temperature may be a contributing factor for cognitive dysfunction resulting from sleep deprivation.

AB  - Background Intestinal flora plays a critical role in immunity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) may be a potential immunomodulatory therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Aim We aimed to study role of FMT in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients in terms of its effect on HBeAg, HBsAg, and HBV DNA. Methods HBeAg-positive patients despite being on antiviral treatment for > 1 year were given six cycles of FMT via gastroscope (nasoduodenal route) at 4 weekly intervals along with antiviral therapy. Twelve out of 14 included patients in FMT arm completed six cycles. Another 15 HBeAg-positive patients who were on oral antivirals for > 1 year were taken as control-antiviral therapy (AVT) arm. Per-protocol analysis was done. Results The median (interquartile range) age in the FMT and AVT arm were 29 (25-35) and 29(24-38), respectively (P = 0.794). The median (interquartile range) duration of AVT prior to inclusion in the study was 80 (52-104) and 76 (52-114) months in FMT and AVT arm, respectively (P = 0.884). In the FMT arm, 16.7% (2/12) patients had HBeAg clearance in comparison to none in the AVT arm (P = 0.188). None of the patients in either arm had HBsAg loss. The FMT was tolerated well, 42.8% (6/14) patients reported one or more minor adverse events. Conclusions In this non-randomized pilot study, FMT appears to be safe and potentially effective in terms of viral suppression and HBeAg clearance in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB. Further randomized controlled trials are needed in order to obtain robust conclusions.

AB  - Objective Incidence of youth-onset diabetes in India has not been well described. Comparison of incidence, across diabetes registries, has the potential to inform hypotheses for risk factors. We sought to compare the incidence of diabetes in the U.S.-based registry of youth onset diabetes (SEARCH) to the Registry of Diabetes with Young Age at Onset (YDR-Chennai and New Delhi regions) in India. Methods We harmonized data from both SEARCH and YDR to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. Data were from youth registered with incident diabetes (2006-2012). Denominators were from census and membership data. We calculated diabetes incidence by averaging the total cases across the entire follow-up period and dividing this by the estimated census population corresponding to the source population for case ascertainment. Incidence was calculated for each of the registries and compared by type and within age and sex categories using a 2-sided, skew-corrected inverted score test. Results Incidence of type 1 was higher in SEARCH (21.2 cases/100 000 [95% CI: 19.9, 22.5]) than YDR (4.9 cases/100 000 [95% CI: 4.3, 5.6]). Incidence of type 2 diabetes was also higher in SEARCH (5.9 cases/100 000 [95% CI: 5.3, 6.6] in SEARCH vs 0.5/cases/100 000 [95% CI: 0.3, 0.7] in YDR). The age distribution of incident type 1 diabetes cases was similar across registries, whereas type 2 diabetes incidence was higher at an earlier age in SEARCH. Sex differences existed in SEARCH only, with a higher rate of type 2 diabetes among females. Conclusion The incidence of youth-onset type 1 and 2 diabetes was significantly different between registries. Additional data are needed to elucidate whether the differences observed represent diagnostic delay, differences in genetic susceptibility, or differences in distribution of risk factors.

KW  - Large post-mastectomy defects
KW  - Free antero-lateral thigh flap
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cause of death due to malignancy among women worldwide. The goal of breast reconstruction post-mastectomy is to improve the quality of life whilst not increasing health risk. Reconstruction of a large-sized post-mastectomy defect with satisfactory outcome poses a challenge to the reconstructive surgeon. In advanced breast cancer, post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy rates are also increasing. In these patients, plastic surgeons are presented with the substantial challenge to cover an extensive skin and soft tissue defect after mastectomy with autologous tissue. Such extensive defects are difficult to reconstruct with available flaps. The decision regarding the most appropriate reconstruction technique and whether to perform an immediate or delayed reconstruction should take into consideration the patient's preference, risk factors and physical characteristics. We present three cases of post-radical mastectomy with large chest wall defects, > 200 sq. cm in greatest dimensions, one of which had an exposed lung, where immediate reconstruction with microvascular free antero-lateral thigh flap was done. Recipient vessels were internal mammary vessels and cephalic vein in all the cases. Post-operatively, patients did well with limited donor-site morbidity. Hence, the antero-lateral thigh (ALT) flap can be considered as a good option for cases with large defects.

AB  - In this work, an effective methodology to incorporate aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in long fiber composites in the presence of geometric discontinuities has been studied. Unidirectional (UD) glass/CNT-epoxy composites containing circular cut-outs were used as representative of a common discontinuity. Multi-walled (MW) CNTs were introduced in the composites via the epoxy matrix and aligned using low-frequency non-uniform AC electric field. This work discusses the methodology to control CNT alignment around the cut-out with the objective of enhancing the stiffness locally. The effectiveness of CNT alignment was assessed indirectly through the mapping of electrical resistance and polarized Raman spectroscopy. A strong correlation was found between the targeted CNT alignment state and the measured resistance values around the cut-out. As a precursor to developing glass/CNT-epoxy hierarchical composites, the response of MW-CNTs in the epoxy resin system was assessed at various input voltage levels in correlation with the weight fraction (wt.%) of CNTs. While a change in electrical resistance by similar to 3 orders of magnitude was found along the direction of CNT alignment in the hierarchical composites, a change in electrical resistance by similar to 5 orders of magnitude was observed in the CNT-epoxy composites in comparison with that of the respective control samples.

AB  - Objective To compare treatment regimens and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) levels in Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) using diabetes registries from two countries-U.S. SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) and Indian Registry of youth onset diabetes in India (YDR). Methods The SEARCH and YDR data were harmonized to the structure and terminology in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Data used were from T1D and T2D youth diagnosed <20 years between 2006-2012 for YDR, and 2006, 2008, and 2012 for SEARCH. We compared treatment regimens and A1c levels across the two registries. Results There were 4003 T1D (SEARCH = 1899; YDR = 2104) and 611 T2D (SEARCH = 384; YDR = 227) youth. The mean A1c was higher in YDR compared to SEARCH (T1D:11.0% +/- 2.9% vs 7.8% +/- 1.7%,P < .001; T2D:9.9% +/- 2.8% vs 7.2% +/- 2.1%,P < .001). Among T1D youth in SEARCH, 65.1% were on a basal/bolus regimen, whereas in YDR, 52.8% were on once/twice daily insulin regimen. Pumps were used by 16.2% of SEARCH and 1.5% of YDR youth with T1D. Among T2D youth, in SEARCH and YDR, a majority were on metformin only (43.0% vs 30.0%), followed by insulin + any oral hypoglycemic agents (26.3% vs 13.7%) and insulin only (12.8% vs 18.9%), respectively. Conclusion We found significant differences between SEARCH and YDR in treatment patterns in T1D and T2D. A1c levels were higher in YDR than SEARCH youth, for both T1D and T2D, irrespective of the regimens used. Efforts to achieve better glycemic control for youth are urgently needed to reduce the risk of long-term complications.

AB  - Gall bladder cancer (GBC) is the most common malignancy of biliary tract cancer associated with high mortality rate and poor prognosis due to lack of suitable biomarkers. In this study, we explored the structural and functional effects of different missense mutations occurs in SMAD4 that was associated with the development of GBC. We utilized in silico methods to predict the harmful effects of nonsynonymous missense mutations and monitored the stability of protein. We found that all mutations (D351N, G352E, R361C, R361H, E526Q) associated with SMAD4 were deleterious in nature resulting in the formation of deformed or unstable protein structure. Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed how these mutations affect protein stability, structure, conformation and function. We observed, different mutants increase the compactness and rigidity of SMAD4 protein, alter secondary structure composition, decrease the surface area and protein-ligand interaction and affect its conformation. Findings of current work indicated that the analyzed mutations might affect the structure of protein and its caliber to interact with other molecules, which probably related to functional impairment of SMAD4 upon D351N, G352E, R361C, R361H, E526Q mutations and their involvement in cancer. Hence, the present study has significance of rational drug design and further increase our understanding of GBC development. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

   Retrospective cohort.
   Objective:
   (a) To compare the recommendations of Lenke and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) classifications in choosing distal fusion levels in Lenke 1 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) curves and (b) to analyze whether the variability in distal fusion levels influences treatment outcomes.
   Methods:
   Hospital records of Lenke 1 AIS patients operated for single stage, posterior-only deformity correction were analyzed. Distal fusion levels recommended by Lenke and PUMC classifications were calculated and were compared with the actual distal fusion levels. The study population was divided based on whether the actual distal fusion levels were in agreement, shorter or longer than those recommended by Lenke classification. Subgroup analysis of Lenke 1C curves was done. The groups were compared with regard to the following outcome measures: Cobb angle correction, postoperative sagittal vertical axis, postoperative C7 offset, and Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r) score at 24 months.
   Results:
   The distal fusion levels recommended by the 2 classifications were in agreement in 92 of 104 cases. In all the cases with disparity, Lenke classification recommended shorter fusions than the PUMC classification. No statistically significant difference was observed in the outcome measures-whether the actual distal fusion levels were in agreement, shorter, or longer than those recommended by the Lenke classification or whether or not the recommendations for selective fusion of any of these classifications were adhered to.
   Conclusion:
   Lenke classification can save fusion levels without compromising on treatment outcomes when compared with PUMC classification. Variability in choice of distal fusion levels is not clinically significant at 24-month follow-up.

AB  - Opportunistic bacterial infections amongst HIV-infected individuals contribute significantly to HIV-associated mortality. The role of HIV-mediated modulation of innate mechanisms like autophagy in promoting opportunistic infections, however, remains obscure. Here we show, HIV reactivation in or infection of macrophages inhibits autophagy and helps the survival of pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and nonpathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterial strains (NTMs). The HIV-mediated impairment of xenophagy flux facilitated bacterial survival. Activation of autophagy by trehalose could induce xenophagy flux and kill intracellular Mtb or NTMs either during single or co-infections. Trehalose, we delineate, activates PIKFYVE leading to TFEB nuclear translocation in MCOLN1-dependent manner to induce autophagy. Remarkably, trehalose significantly reduced HIV-p24 levels in ex-vivo-infected PBMCs or PBMCs from treatment-naive HIV patients and also controlled mycobacterial survival within Mtb-infected animals. To conclude, we report leveraging of HIV-mediated perturbed host innate-immunity by opportunistic bacterial pathogens and show an attractive therapeutic strategy for HIV and associated co-morbidities.

AB  - Background There is significant global variation in the prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis among youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, data for youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited, even in developed countries. We compared the prevalence of DKA at diagnosis among individuals with T1D and T2D from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) and the Registry of Youth Onset Diabetes in India (YDR) registries.
   Methods We harmonized the SEARCH and YDR registries to the structure and terminology in the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model. Data used were from youth with T1D and T2D diagnosed before 20 years and newly diagnosed between 2006 and 2012 in YDR and 2009 and 2012 in SEARCH.
   Results There were 5366 US youth (4078 with T1D, 1288 with T2D) and 2335 Indian youth (2108 with T1D, 227 with T2D). More than one third of T1D youth enrolled in SEARCH had DKA at diagnosis which was significantly higher than in YDR (35.3% vs 28.7%, P < .0001). The burden of DKA in youth with T1D was significantly higher among younger age groups; this relationship was similar across registries (P = .4). The prevalence of DKA among T2D in SEARCH and YDR were 5.5% and 6.6% respectively (P = .4).
   Conclusions There is significant burden of DKA at diagnosis with T1D among youth from United States and India, especially among the younger age groups. The reasons for this high prevalence are largely unknown but are critical to developing interventions to prevent DKA at diagnosis.

AB  - Background We here report the demographic and clinical profile of the patients enrolled in the Indian Council of Medical Research funded Registry of people with diabetes in India with young age at onset (YDR) from 1 January 2000 to 31 July 2011.
   Methods The YDR registry recruits all diabetes cases (newly diagnosed or treated) reporting on or after 1 January 2000 with age of diagnosis <= 25 years, and residing within the assigned geographical area of the reporting centres. A baseline proforma was used to obtain information on demographic and clinical details at registration.
   Results The registry has enrolled 5546 patients (49.5% male; 50.5% female) with youth onset diabetes from 205 reporting centres linked to 8 regional collaborating centres (RCC) across India. T1DM (63.9%; n = 3545) and T2DM (25.3%; n = 1401) were the commonest variants of youth onset diabetes, though their relative proportion varied across RCCs. The mean (SD) age at diagnosis for T1DM was 12.9 (6.5) years, while that for T2DM was 21.7 (3.7) years. Nearly half the T1DM patients were registered within 6 months of the onset of disease. Most cases of T2DM (47.3%) were registered after 3 years from their date of diagnosis. 56.1% of patients had at least one episode of hospitalization at registration.
   Conclusion The observations from YDR registry indicate the need to establish a surveillance system in India to monitor diabetes in youth, not only to understand its complex etiology and natural history but also due to its detrimental socio economic impact.

AB  - There is a huge burden of patients suffering from trauma-induced disabling spasticity the world over. There are surprisingly few modalities of treatment with a sustained, proven benefit which can be offered to such patients. Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) has been used with proven success in treating spasticity in patients of cerebral palsy, both in children and in adults. The rationale behind using the procedure in post-traumatic cases is reviewed, along with the cases reported till date in the world literature. The indications, surgical procedure used, outcome and complications, if any, are described. Most of the cases described in the literature have shown a favourable outcome with minimal complications. SDR can become an important tool in the armamentarium of the clinician treating this condition.

AB  - Background Over the last decades, diabetes in youth has increased in both India and the United States, along with the burden of long-term complications and healthcare costs. However, there are limited standardized population-based data in contemporary youth cohorts for comparison of clinical and demographic characteristics of diabetes for both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D). Methods In partnership, we harmonized demographic and clinical data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) registry in the United States and the Registry of People with Diabetes with Youth Age at Onset (YDR) in India to the structure and terminology of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Data were from youth with T1D and T2D, aged chi(2) tests and t-tests. Results In total, there were 9650 youth with T1D and 2406 youth with T2D from 2006 to 2012. SEARCH youth were diagnosed at younger ages than YDR youth for T1D and T2D (10.0 vs 10.5 years, P < .001 and 14.7 vs 16.1 years, P < .001, respectively). For T2D, SEARCH had a higher proportion of females and significantly lower proportion of youth of high socioeconomic status compared to YDR. For T1D and T2D, SEARCH youth had higher BMI, lower blood pressure, and lower A1c compared to YDR youth. Conclusions These data offer insights into the demographic and clinical characteristics of diabetes in youth across the two countries. Further research is needed to better understand why these differences exist.

AB  - Introduction Globally, the use of telestroke programmes for acute care is expanding. Currently, a standardised set of variables for enabling reliable international comparisons of telestroke programmes does not exist. The aim of the study was to establish a consensus-based, minimum dataset for acute telestroke to enable the reliable comparison of programmes, clinical management and patient outcomes. Methods An initial scoping review of variables was conducted, supplemented by reaching out to colleagues leading some of these programmes in different countries. An international expert panel of clinicians, researchers and managers (n = 20) from the Australasia Pacific region, USA, UK and Europe was convened. A modified-Delphi technique was used to achieve consensus via online questionnaires, teleconferences and email. Results Overall, 533 variables were initially identified and harmonised into 159 variables for the expert panel to review. The final dataset included 110 variables covering three themes (service configuration, consultations, patient information) and 12 categories: (1) details about telestroke network/programme (n = 12), (2) details about initiating hospital (n = 10), (3) telestroke consultation (n = 17), (4) patient characteristics (n = 7), (5) presentation to hospital (n = 5), (6) general clinical care within first 24 hours (n = 10), (7) thrombolysis treatment (n = 10), (8) endovascular treatment (n = 13), (9) neurosurgery treatment (n = 8), (10) processes of care beyond 24 hours (n = 7), (11) discharge information (n = 5), (12) post-discharge and follow-up data (n = 6). Discussion The acute telestroke minimum dataset provides a recommended set of variables to systematically evaluate acute telestroke programmes in different countries. Adoption is recommended for new and existing services.

AB  - Cholecystectomy is one of the commonest general surgical procedures performed all over India. The risk of bile duct injury (BDI) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is two to three times higher than during open cholecystectomy. The worldwide incidence of bile duct injury is 0.5% or 1 in 200 cases. BDI and its consequences result in significant morbidity and may even cause mortality. BDI increases the cost of treatment and is a common reason for a medicolegal suit against the surgeons. To minimize the incidence of BDI and to manage it timely and appropriately, a set of guidelines was deemed necessary by a group of senior surgeons during a Society of Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgeons of India (SELSI) meeting in 2016. Guidelines for "Safe Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy" and bile duct injury management formulated by other international societies are already available. The applicability of these guidelines to Indian subjects especially in small peripheral centers was limited. Hence, a decision was taken to form a set of guidelines for general surgeons with basic laparoscopic skills with little or no advanced laparoscopic skills. Those working in a solo practice, nursing homes, and small private hospitals at talukas or districts should have "Safe Cholecystectomy" guidelines and management of BDI suitable to their situation. These guidelines were formed after three consensus meetings and have been approved by a SELSI Expert Group.

AB  - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) presents with intravascular hemolysis, bone marrow failure and thrombosis. Various studies have reported geographic and ethnic variation in prevalence of thrombosis in PNH. There is limited data on thrombosis in PNH from the Indian subcontinent. In this study we describe disease burden and risk factors for thrombosis in 18 Indian PNH patients. We studied markers of thrombin generation (Thrombin-antithrombin complexes; TAT and D-Dimer), endothelium and platelet activation (soluble P-selectin) and inflammation (interleukin-6; IL-6) in PNH patients and compared their levels with healthy controls. Thrombosis was identified in 17% of PNH patients. TAT, sP-selectin and D-Dimer levels were significantly elevated in PNH patients (TAT: 5.06 +/- 1.08 ng/ml; sP-selectin: 80.57 +/- 19.5 ng/ml; D-Dimer mean: 936 ng/ml 95% CI 559, 1310) compared to control population (TAT: 3.39 +/- 0.769 ng/mlP = 0.016; sP-selectin: 44.67 +/- 5.17 ng/mlP = 0.002). Using Youden's J statistic, the cut-off values for TAT and sP-selectin in our cohort of PNH patients were 2.90 ng/ml and 58.41 ng/ml respectively. TAT, sP-selectin and D-Dimer levels were elevated beyond the cut-off values in PNH patients with thrombosis compared to those without thrombosis. A positive correlation was noted between TAT, sP-selectin and D-Dimer levels. Increased TAT, sP-selectin, and D-Dimer levels may indicate impending thrombosis in PNH.

AB  - The present study explores the efficacy of 12-week yoga + diet-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) vs dietary intervention (DI) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and identifies the predictors of change in HRQoL in Indians with metabolic syndrome (Met S). Data from the historical randomized controlled trial was used including adults (n = 260, 20-45 years) with Met S. Four domains of HRQoL were measured at baseline, 2 and 12 weeks using WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation and chi-square test was used to compare 12-week changes in HRQoL domains and proportion of subjects, respectively. Changes in HRQoL were predicted using regression models concerning changes in body mass index (BMI), physical activity, total calorie intake, adiponectin, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Exploratory mediation analysis was carried out using Baron & Kenny approach. YBLI resulted in a significantly greater increase in the physical domain score of HRQoL than DI. A significantly greater proportion of subjects in YBLI group (71%) showed an increase in physical domain scores compared to DI (51%). A unit change in BMI negatively predicted a unit change in physical, psychological and environmental health. Whereas, a unit change in adiponectin and SOD levels positively predicted a unit change in physical and environmental health. Partial mediation between YBLI intervention and physical HRQoL domain was observed via adiponectin. In conclusion, a 12-week YBLI has a positive and greater effect on HRQoL physical domain score than following DI alone. Changes in BMI, adiponectin, and SOD levels may predict changes in HRQoL domains after lifestyle intervention.

AB  - Traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) is believed to be the second most common cause of fatality associated with motor vehicle crashes(MVCs) with substantial societal and economic burdens. TAR in motor vehicle crashes is caused by a complex state of deformation progressing at high strain rates. A major step to gain insight into the possible mechanisms of TAR is to understand the mechanical behaviour of aortic tissue under loading conditions that leads to injury and failure. This study reports a total of 29 uniaxial tensile tests performed on porcine aortic tissue in the longitudinal and circumferential direction of loading. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed at targetted strain rates of 0.01/s, 70/s, 150/s and 250/s to failure. Engineering stresses reported in the study is calculated from the ratio of interially compensated measured force and initial cross sectional area whereas true strain is calculated by tracking the markers on the specimen surface using Matlab(TM) based digital image correlation (DIC) tool. The load - deformation behaviour of porcine aorta is found to be Non-Hookean and strain rate dependent with higher stiffness in circumferential direction compared to the longitudinal direction indicating the anisotropic behaviour of the tissue. As strain rate increased to 250/s, the failure stress ranged from 1.64 MPa to 4.84 MPa and 1.98 MPa to 7.05 MPa for longitudinal and circumferential tissues respectively. For the same range of strain rate, failure strain ranged from 26% to 37% and 24% to 42% and the elastic modulus changed from 9.42 MPa to 31 MPa and 12.33 MPa to 51 MPa for longitudinal and circumferential tissues respectively.

AB  - Objective: Digastric ridge (DR) is an important landmark to locate facial nerve (FN) and sigmoid sinus for mastoid surgeries and transmastoid approaches. We aim to look for the effect of temporal bone pneumatization on the morphometry of the DR and its relation to the adjoining structures. Methods: Temporal bones were harvested from unclaimed cadavers after the approval of the ethical committee. The dissection of the temporal bones was performed under a microscope, and the length of the DR and the distance between the mastoid segment of the FN and the anterior end of DR (FN-DR distance) were measured using a digital caliper. Stata version 14.0 was used to perform the statistical calculations. Results: Ninety-three temporal bones were microdissected (right:left = 47:46; well pneumatized:poorly pneumatized = 58:35). Mean length of the DR was 17.1 mm and was significantly longer in well-pneumatized bones (P= .0000). The mean distance between the anterior end of the digastric ridge and the mastoid part of the facial nerve was 4 mm. The distance was significantly more in well-pneumatized bones. Conclusion: Prominence and the length of the DR, as well as the FN-DR distance, are significantly more in well-pneumatized bones compared to poorly pneumatized bones. This finding has potential surgical implications with reduced risk of injury to the FN resulting from a conspicuous DR in well-pneumatized bones.

AB  - Objective: To describe the retinal imaging characteristics, retinopathy management strategies and visual outcomes in cases of diabetes with chronic myeloid leukaemia.
   Design: Retrospective observational study.
   Participants: Patients with diabetes and chronic myeloid leukaemia managed at our tertiary eye care centre from January 2015 to December 2017.
   Methods: Detailed ophthalmic and systemic evaluation, treatment and follow-up records were reviewed. The main measures studied were visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure, retinopathy severity, and surgical indications and techniques.
   Results: Of the six patients studied, three had diabetes and chronic myeloid leukaemia at presentation, while in three cases chronic myeloid leukaemia was diagnosed following evaluation for proliferative retinopathy. The visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to perception of light. All eyes had marked proliferative retinopathy out of proportion to the exudation. None of the eyes had significant macular oedema. Pan-retinal photocoagulation (10/12, 83.33%), intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection (8/12, 66.67%), vitrectomy (2/12, 16.67%), cataract surgery (2/12, 16.67%) and trabeculectomy followed by cryoablation (2/12, 16.67%) was performed for management of the ocular disease as indicated. Median follow-up was 16.5months (range: 6-24months). Final visual acuity ranged from PL to 20/20 with acuity20/100 in eight eyes. Four eyes had advanced optic neuropathy from neovascular glaucoma.
   Conclusion: Accelerated proliferative retinopathy can be seen in cases of diabetes with chronic myeloid leukaemia at the very initial ophthalmic evaluation. Thus, there is a need to alter screening guidelines for retinopathy in cases of diabetes with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Early detection and aggressive management may help preserve visual acuity in such cases.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a rare presentation of a case of intraocular non-teratoid medulloepithelioma with teratoid metastases in ipsilateral intraparotid lymph nodes. Case description: A 9-year-old male child with previous history of ciliary body non-teratoid medulloepithelioma presented with a swelling in the right pre-auricular region for 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed a right intraparotid mass with enlarged ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes. A core biopsy was taken from the lesion, which on microscopy showed a tumor composed of small round cells arranged in cords, tubules lined by multilayered cells, and in cribriform pattern. These cells were embedded in a hypocellular, loose myxoid matrix. Based on the histopathological characteristics and previous history, a diagnosis of medulloepithelioma metastastic to ipsilateral parotid gland was made. The patient underwent right total conservative parotidectomy and bilateral neck dissection. Histopathological examination revealed metastatic medulloepithelioma in five out of eight intraparotid lymph nodes, with extranodal extension into the adjacent parotid parenchyma. Foci of hyaline cartilage were identified within the tumor, leading to a diagnosis of metastatic teratoid medulloepithelioma. Conclusion: Intraparotid lymph node metastases from intraocular medulloepithelioma is a rare possibility and we recommend that the parotid should be evaluated in cases of intraocular medulloepithelioma at initial presentation as well as during the follow-up period. Also, metastasis should be considered in all pediatric patients with solitary mass lesions showing unconventional histology for a primary parotid neoplasm.

AB  - This case report presents a rare association of a complete aniridia with lenticular and choroidal coloboma. An 8-year-old female patient was referred to our glaucoma clinic with aniridia, nystagmus and bilateral corneal opacity with right eye being phthisical. Ultrasonography of the phthisical eye revealed the presence of an old closed funnel retinal detachment. Further examination under anaesthesia revealed lens coloboma in the inferonasal quadrant and presence of a choroidal coloboma in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 28 mmHg with a central corneal thickness of 693 mu m. A macula sparing laser barrage around the colobomatous area was done in the left eye and topical ocular hypotensives were started.
