AB  - Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) are rare diseases sharing a common pathological feature, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA is characterized by microvascular thrombosis with consequent thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and/or multiorgan dysfunction. In the past, the distinction between HUS and TTP was predominantly based on clinical grounds. However, clinical presentation of the two syndromes often overlaps and, the differential diagnosis is broad. Identification of underlying pathogenic mechanisms has enabled the classification of these syndromes on a molecular basis: typical HUS caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS); atypical HUS or complement-mediated TMA (aHUS/CMTMA) associated with genetic or acquired defects leading to dysregulation of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement; and TTP that results from a severe deficiency of the von Willebrand Factor (VWF)-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13. The etiology of TMA differs between pediatric and adult patients. Childhood TMA is chiefly caused by STEC-HUS, followed by CM-TMA and pneumococcal HUS (Sp-HUS). Rare conditions such as congenital TTP (cTTP), vitamin B12 metabolism defects, and coagulation disorders (diacylglycerol epsilon mutation) present as TMA chiefly in children under 2 years of age. In contrast secondary causes and acquired ADAMT13 deficiency are more common in adults. In adults, compared to children, diagnostic delays are more frequent due to the wide range of differential diagnoses. In this review we focus on the three major forms of TMA, STEC-HUS, aHUS and TTP, outlining the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of the affected patients, to help highlight the salient features and the differences between adult and pediatric patients which are relevant for management.

AB  - beta-catenin is an evolutionary conserved, quintessential, multifaceted protein that plays vital roles in cellular homeostasis, embryonic development, organogenesis, stem cell maintenance, cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and pathogenesis of various human diseases including cancer. beta-catenin manifests both signaling and adhesive features. It acts as a pivotal player in intracellular signaling as a component of versatile WNT signaling cascade involved in embryonic development, homeostasis as well as in carcinogenesis. It is also involved in Ca2+ dependent cell adhesion via interaction with E-cadherin at the adherens junctions. Aberrant beta-catenin expression and its nuclear accumulation promote the transcription of various oncogenes including c-Myc and cyclinD1, thereby contributing to tumor initiation, development, and progression. beta-catenin's expression is closely regulated at various levels including its stability, sub-cellular localization, as well as transcriptional activity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulation of beta-catenin and its atypical expression will provide researchers not only the novel insights into the pathogenesis and progression of cancer but also will help in deciphering new therapeutic avenues. In the present review, we have summarized the dual functions of beta-catenin, its role in signaling, associated mutations as well as its role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression of various cancers. Additionally, we have discussed the challenges associated with targeting beta-catenin molecule with the presently available drugs and suggested the possible way forward in designing new therapeutic alternatives against this oncogene.

AB  - DENV infection poses a major health concern globally and the pathophysiology relies heavily on host-cellular machinery. Although virus replication relies heavily on the host, the mechanistic details of DENV-host interaction is not fully characterized yet. Here, we are focusing on characterizing the mechanistic basis of virus-induced stress on the host cell. Specifically, we aim to characterize the role of the stress modulator ribonuclease Angiogenin during DENV infection. Our results suggested that the levels of Angiogenin are up-regulated in DENV-infected cells and the levels increase proportionately with DENV replication. Our efforts to knockdown Angiogenin using siRNA were unsuccessful in DENV-infected cells but not in mock-infected control. To further investigate the modulation between DENV replication and Angiogenin, we treated Huh7 cells with Ivermectin prior to DENV infection. Our results suggest a significant reduction in DENV replication specifically at the later stages as a consequence of Ivermectin treatment. Interestingly, Angiogenin levels were also found to be decreased proportionately. Our results suggest that Angiogenin modulation during DENV infection is important for DENV replication and pathogenesis.

AB  - Aim: Hemophilia A (HA) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII in the blood. In resource-limited settings like India, affordability is a significant challenge in managing patients with severe HA. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of intermediate-dose prophylaxis versus on-demand factor therapy in adult and pediatric populations with moderate-to-severe congenital HA without inhibitors in India.Method: We conducted a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective, categorizing patients into a base state and a joint disease state (patients with Hemophilia suffering extensive bleeds leading to chronic joint disease). Using targeted literature search and primary market research, we developed a Markov model measuring the total cost of Hemophilia treatment and health outcomes, including life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The model extended over a lifetime horizon of 70 years with a one-year cycle length. Sensitivity analyses assessed study robustness.Results: Low-dose prophylactic therapy was cost-effective for adults (>18 years) and pediatric populations (<18 years), yielding better health outcomes (adults: 0.15 LYs and 2.43 QALYs gained; pediatric: 0.40 LYs and 3.12 QALYs gained). Intermediate-dose prophylaxis showed positive net monetary benefits in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for both adult and pediatric populations, with dominant ICER and ICUR values in both cases.Conclusion: Using intermediate-dose prophylactic factor VIII therapy is a cost-effective approach that improves clinical outcomes compared to on-demand therapy in the Indian adult and pediatric HA populations without inhibitors.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a novel association of TGFBI variants with congenital glaucoma in a family with GAPO (growth retardation, alopecia, pseudoanodontia, and progressive optic atrophy) syndrome, as well as among other unrelated cases of juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) and primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). Methods: This study of one family of GAPO with congenital glaucoma and three unrelated patients with JOAG ana-lyzed a common link to glaucoma pathogenesis. Three girls with GAPO syndrome born to consanguineous parents in a multi-generation consanguineous family were identified. Two of the girls had congenital glaucoma in both eyes, while the elder sibling (a 10-year-old female) had features of GAPO syndrome without glaucoma. Results: A genetic evaluation using whole exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous ANTXR1 mutation in all three affected siblings with GAPO. No other mutations were detected in the genes associated with glaucoma. A rare missense variant in the TGFBI gene was shared in the two siblings with congenital glaucoma and GAPO syndrome. We found three other unrelated patients with JOAG and one patient with primary congenital glaucoma with no known glaucoma causing gene mutations, but having four different missense variants in the TGFBI gene. One of these patients with JOAG had familial granular corneal dystrophy. Molecular dynamic simulations of TGFBI and 3-D structural models of three of its variants showed significant alterations that could influence TGFBI protein function. Conclusions: The possibility that variations in the TGFBI gene could have a possible role in the pathogenesis of con-genital and juvenile onset open-angle glaucomas needs further evaluation.

AB  - Copy number variants (CNVs) are among the main genetic factors identified in schizophrenia (SZ) through genome-scale studies conducted mostly in Caucasian populations. However, to date, there have been no genome-scale CNV reports on patients from India. To address this shortcoming, we generated, for the first time, genome-scale CNV data for 168 SZ patients and 168 controls from South India. In total, 63 different CNVs were identified in 56 patients and 46 controls with a significantly higher proportion of medium-sized deletions (100 kb-1 Mb) after multiple testing (FDR = 2.7E-4) in patients. Of these, 13 CNVs were previously reported; however, when searched against GWAS, transcriptome, exome, and DNA methylation studies, another 17 CNVs with candidate genes were identified. Of the total 30 CNVs, 28 were present in 38 patients and 12 in 27 controls, indicating a significantly higher representation in the former (p = 1.87E-5). Only 4q35.1-q35.2 duplications were significant (p = 0.020) and observed in 11 controls and 2 patients. Among the others that are not significant, a few examples of patient-specific and previously reported CNVs include deletions of 11q14.1 (DLG2), 22q11.21, and 14q21.1 (LRFN5). 16p13.3 deletion (RBFOX1), 3p14.2 duplication (CADPS), and 7p11.2 duplication (CCT6A) were some of the novel CNVs containing candidate genes. However, these observations need to be replicated in a larger sample size. In conclusion, this report constitutes an important foundation for future CNV studies in a relatively unexplored population. In addition, the data indicate that there are advantages in using an integrated approach for better identification of candidate CNVs for SZ and other mental health disorders.

TI  - Gut Metabolite Indoxyl Sulfate Has Selective Deleterious and Anticancer Effect on Colon Cancer Cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
KW  - INDOLE
KW  - DESIGN
AB  - There are a number of reports about anticancer activity of indole derivatives. In this study, we investigated the role of indoxyl sulfate (IS) for its selective anticancer activity on colon cancer cells. IS treatment on HCT-116 and HT-29 human epithelial adenocarcinoma cells led to a decrease in cell proliferation, cell viability, and ATP content. Colon cancer cells showed a 10% increase in cell apoptosis in comparison to control. Due to IS treatment, cell morphology got distorted, cell number found decreased, intracellular vesicles formed, and cells were found floating in the media. Cells also showed a loss in membrane integrity and a decrease in colony-forming ability and ceased at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. No significant change was noted in the level of inflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha, histology, length of intestine, and spleen after 100 mM IS treatment to balb/c mice. These observations indicate the selective anticancer effect of IS on colon cancer cells.

AB  - Contemporary diagnosis and management of traumatic dental injuries requires a multifaceted understanding of the pathological and psychological impact over a patient's lifetime. The legacy of dental trauma injuries can have repercussions for the dentition and supporting tissues, requiring complicated multidisciplinary clinical input. Foresight is required to ensure optimal aesthetic and functional outcomes. Mitigating risks and maximising benefits in patients presenting with polytrauma can be challenging, but if optimally managed at the acute presentation, the long-term burden to the patient and the clinician is reduced. This paper aims to discuss the contemporary clinical dilemmas, challenges and controversies related to the management of dental trauma.
   Raises awareness of the chronic challenges that dental trauma presents to the profession.Details specific areas where early treatment can mitigate complications.Highlights the need for multidisciplinary care in severe and complicated presentations.

AB  - Long-term follow-up of a cohort of unmarried girls who received one, two, or three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine, between 10 and 18 years of age, in an Indian multi-centric study allowed us to compare antibody responses between the younger and older age cohorts at 10-years post-vaccination, and study the impact of initiation of sexual activity and cervical HPV infections on antibody levels. Among the younger (10-14 years) recipients of a single dose, 97.7% and 98.2% had detectable binding antibody titers against HPV 16 and HPV 18 respectively at ten years post-vaccination. The proportions among those receiving a single dose at age 15-18 years were 92.3% and 94.2% against HPV 16 and HPV 18 respectively. Mean HPV 16 binding antibody titers were 2.1 folds (95%CI 1.4 to 3.3) higher in those vaccinated at ages 10-14 years, and 1.9 folds (95%CI 1.2 to 3.0) higher in those vaccinated at 15-18 years compared to mean titers seen in the unvaccinated women. Compared to previous timepoints of 36 or 48 months, binding antibodies against HPV 16 and neutralizing antibodies against both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were significantly higher at 10 years. This rise was more pronounced in participants vaccinated at 15-18 years. No association of marital status or cervical HPV infections was observed with the rise in titer. Durability of antibody response in single dose recipients correlated well with the high efficacy of a single dose against persistent HPV 16/18 infections irrespective of age at vaccination, as we reported earlier.

AB  - -OBJECTIVE: Changing paradigms of neurosurgical training and limited operative exposure during the resi-dency period have made it necessary to evaluate newer technologies for training. Virtual reality (VR) technology provides three-dimensional reconstruction of routine im-aging, along with the ability to see as well as interact. The application of VR technology in operative planning, which is an important part of neurosurgical training, has been incompletely studied so far. -METHODS: Sixteen final-year residents, post-M.Ch. (magister chirurgiae) residents, and fellows were included as study participants. They were divided into 2 groups based on their seniority for further analysis. Five complex cranial cases were selected and a multiple-choice question-based test was prepared by the authors, with 5 questions for each of the cases. The pretest score was determined based on performance on the test after participants accessed routine preoperative imaging. The posttest score was calculated after use of the VR system (ImmersiveTouch VR System, ImmersiveTouch Inc.). Anal-ysis was performed by the investigators, who were blinded to the identity of the participant. Subanalysis based on the type of case and type of question was performed. Feedback was obtained from each participant regarding VR use. -RESULTS: There was an overall improvement in scores from pretest to posttest, which was also noted in the analysis based on the participants' seniority. This improvement was noted to be more for the vascular cases (15.89%) compared with the tumor cases (7.84%). Partici-pants also fared better in questions related to surgical anatomy and surgical approach, compared with questions based on the diagnosis. There was overall positive feed-back from participants regarding VR use, and most par-ticipants wanted VR to become a routine part of operative planning. -CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that there is improve-ment in understanding of surgical aspects after use of this VR system.

AB  - Cancer cachexia is a complex syndrome characterized by progressive weight loss, muscle mass depletion, and systemic inflammation, profoundly affecting the well-being and treatment outcomes of cancer patients. Effective management of cancer cachexia demands a coordinated, multifaceted approach involving various healthcare disciplines and operational strategies. Streamlining care processes is crucial to ensure timely interventions and support, reducing delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation. Multidisciplinary collaboration is pivotal in creating integrated care plans that address the multifactorial nature of cancer cachexia comprehensively. Data-driven decision-making empowers healthcare teams to identify trends, monitor treatment responses, and tailor care plans to individual needs, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. Standardized assessment and monitoring play a vital role in maintaining consistent, high-quality care, facilitating early interventions and treatment adjustments. Implementing patient-centered care fosters trust, enhances treatment adherence, and encourages patients to actively engage in their care journey, thereby improving their overall quality of life. This paper underscores the significance of applying operations management principles to optimize care delivery and enhance patient outcomes in the management of cancer cachexia. It provides valuable insights for healthcare institutions and professionals striving to provide comprehensive and effective care for individuals affected by this challenging condition.

AB  - Purpose: To study the effect of four types of inferior oblique-weakening procedures on ocular torsion: inferior oblique recession (IOR), recession and antero-positioning (RAP), anterior transposition as practiced by Elliot and Nankin (EN), and anterior and nasal transposition (ANT).Methods: The medical records of 72 consecutive patients >10 years of age undergoing inferior oblique weakening for primary or secondary inferior oblique overaction (IOOA) with or without horizontal rectus surgery were reviewed retrospectively. The 106 included eyes were assigned to one of the four groups according to the type of inferior oblique-weakening procedure. The severity of IOOA and the amount of V pattern guided the choice of procedure. IOOA, disk-fovea angle (DFA), and the amount of V pattern were recorded preoperatively. Measurements were repeated postoperatively at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months. Change in the DFA was used to study the change in objective cyclotorsion in all four groups.Results: A significant incyclotorsional shift was seen in all four groups at postoperative 3 months. The mean reduction in excyclotorsion 3 months postoperatively was 3.65 degrees +/- 4.84 degrees for IOR, 5.31 degrees +/- 4.64 degrees for RAP, 6.10 degrees +/- 3.89 degrees for EN, and 16.62 degrees +/- 8.72 degrees ANT; it was significantly higher in the ANT group compared with the other three groups. Reduction in DFA was also correlated with preoperative DFA overall, and for all procedures except IOR (P <= 0.005).Conclusions: All four inferior oblique-weakening procedures reduced excyclotorsion; the largest reductions in our study were seen in cases treated using ANT of the inferior oblique.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and malnutrition are major global health problems, with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB complicating international efforts. The role of vitamin D in susceptibility to and as an adjunctive treatment for TB is being studied extensively, although no study has included MDR-TB patients in context to dietary profile with vitamin D levels and sunlight exposure.Objective: This study aimed to estimate vitamin D serum levels and examine their association with dietary intake of vitamin D and sun exposure in patients with MDR-TB.Methods: North Indian participants were enrolled in three groups: MDR-TB, drug-susceptible pulmonary TB (DS-PTB), and healthy controls. All consenting participants underwent the estimation of macro- and micronutrient intake and sunlight exposure using structured questionnaires. Serum biochemistry, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium levels, was measured, and the correlation between variables was determined.Results: 747 participants were enrolled. Significant differences among the three groups were found in mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, body mass index, macronutrient intake, dietary vitamin D and calcium content, and sun exposure index (SEI). All except sun exposure (SEI was highest in DS-PTB patients) were found to follow the trend: MDR-TB < DS-PTB < healthy controls. The mean serum vitamin D levels of all groups were deficient and correlated positively with dietary intake and SEI.Conclusion: In this study's we found significant association of serum vitamin D concentrations, dietary intake and sunlight exposure in MDR-TB, DS-PTB patients and healthy controls. Dietary intake may be more important than sun exposure in determining serum levels. However, the significance of this finding is uncertain. Further studies are required to confirm the association, direction, and potential for vitamin D supplementation to treat or prevent MDR-TB infection.

TI  - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics up to 6 months of follow-up: Result from a nation-wide population-based, age stratified sero-epidemiological prospective cohort study in India
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Repeated serological testing tells about the change in the overall infection in a community. This study aimed to evaluate changes in antibody prevalence and kinetics in a closed cohort over six months in different sub-populations in India. The study included 10,000 participants from rural and urban areas in five states and measured SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum in three follow-up rounds. The overall seroprevalence increased from 73.9% in round one to 90.7% in round two and 92.9% in round three. Among seropositive rural participants in round one, 98.2% remained positive in round two, and this percentage remained stable in urban and tribal areas in round three. The results showed high antibody prevalence that increased over time and was not different based on area, age group, or sex. Vaccinated individuals had higher antibody prevalence, and nearly all participants had antibody positivity for up to six months.

AB  - Aim: We investigated our previous finding of increased retention of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) with metabolic inhibitors (MI) and studied the effect of some small molecule inhibitors on PLGA-NP assimilation. Materials & methods: Intracellular PLGA-NP colocalization in the presence of MI was investigated by confocal microscopy. Intracellular retention of PLGA-NPs by some small molecules was estimated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry after Pulse/Chase experiments. Results: MI caused PLGA-NP colocalization in intracellular membranous structures, mainly endosomes and lysosomes. Some small molecule inhibitors demonstrated increased intracellular PLGA-NP accumulation. Conclusion: This study elucidates the movement of PLGA-NP in cells and suggests that clinically used small molecules can reduce their extrusion by enhancing their stay within intracellular vesicles, with possible clinically beneficial consequences.
   Nanoparticles are increasingly being used to carry drugs for treatment of cancer. We wish to decrease their movement out of the cells. This may give time for them to unload their drugs. Cells were treated with nanoparticles for 30 min and observed. Then the nanoparticles were washed off. Cells were again observed after 30 min. Various intracellular trafficking inhibitors were also added. Nanoparticle retention and subcellular localization were measured. We found that nanoparticles are trapped in some membranous compartments within the cells after energy depletion. We also discovered some commonly used clinical molecules that can decrease the excretion of nanoparticles from the cells. These inhibitors can be utilized for increasing the intracellular stay of the drug-loaded nanoparticles.

AB  - IntroductionMicrotubules are intracellular, filamentous, polymeric structures that extend throughout the cytoplasm, composed of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin subunits. They regulate many cellular functions including cell polarity, cell shape, mitosis, intracellular transport, cell signaling, gene expression, cell integrity, and are associated with tumorigenesis. Inhibition of tubulin polymerization within tumor cells represents a crucial focus in the pursuit of developing anticancer treatments.Areas CoveredThis review focuses on the natural product and their synthetic congeners as tubulin inhibitors along with their site of interaction on tubulin. This review also covers the developed novel tubulin inhibitors and important patents focusing on the development of tubulin inhibition for cancer treatment reported from 2018 to 2023. The scientific and patent literature has been searched on PubMed, Espacenet, ScienceDirect, and Patent Guru from 2018-2023.Expert opinionTubulin is one of the promising targets explored extensively for drug discovery. Compounds binding in the colchicine site could be given importance because they can elude resistance mediated by the P-glycoprotein efflux pump and no colchicine site binding inhibitor is approved by FDA so far. The research on the development of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) for tubluin polymerization inhibition could be significant strategy for cancer treatment.

AB  - Knowledge about the key steps in "research methodology" is necessary for all postgraduate students who are enrolled in the medical profession. The objective of the present study was to plan, design, and implement a participant-centric postgraduate skill development activity to inculcate the key principles and components of research methodology. It included 3 goal-oriented component group exercises, namely, 1) framing a research question, 2) critiquing a research article, and 3) writing a research protocol. Out of 25 eligible postgraduate students of our department, 20 participated in all three component group exercises, and they were included in the study. Feedback was obtained from them on a five-point Likert scale after the group exercises. In addition, students were also asked to provide open-ended comments for further improvement of the session. Data from participants' feedback suggested that the majority of the participants expressed satisfaction regarding the plan, conduct, and learning experience of the postgraduate activity. Therefore, participant-centric group activity could be an innovative approach in postgraduate medical education to inculcate the basics of research methodology. It can provide additional emphasis on the components of self-directed learning through individual exercises and unsupervised group dynamics. Supervised group dynamics can inculcate skills in critical thinking, acceptance, communication skills, and teamwork.

AB  - Importance Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition that is associated with significant health and economic burden worldwide. Previous studies assessed the global current-day prevalence of COPD, but to better facilitate resource planning and intervention development, long-term projections are needed.Objective To assess the global burden of COPD through 2050, considering COPD risk factors.Design, Setting, and Participants In this modeling study, historical data on COPD prevalence was extracted from a recent meta-analysis on 2019 global COPD prevalence, and 2010 to 2018 historical prevalence was estimated using random-effects meta-analytical models. COPD risk factor data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease database.Main Outcomes and Measures To project global COPD prevalence to 2050, generalized additive models were developed, including smoking prevalence, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and development indices as predictors, and stratified by age, sex, and World Bank region.Results The models estimated that the number of COPD cases globally among those aged 25 years and older will increase by 23% from 2020 to 2050, approaching 600 million patients with COPD globally by 2050. Growth in the burden of COPD was projected to be the largest among women and in low- and middle-income regions. The number of female cases was projected to increase by 47.1% (vs a 9.4% increase for males), and the number of cases in low- and middle-income regions was expected to be more than double that of high-income regions by 2050.Conclusions and Relevance In this modeling study of future COPD burden, projections indicated that COPD would continue to affect hundreds of millions of people globally, with disproportionate growth among females and in low-middle income regions through 2050. Further research, prevention, and advocacy are needed to address these issues so that adequate preparation and resource allocation can take place.

AB  - BackgroundRecapitulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vitro remains a major hurdle in cancer research. In recent years, there have been significant strides in this area, particularly with the emergence of 3D spheroids as a model system for drug screening and therapeutics development for solid tumors. However, incorporating macrophages into these spheroid cultures poses specific challenges due to the intricate interactions between macrophages and cancer cells.MethodsTo address this issue, in this study, we established a reproducible healthy multicellular 3D spheroid culture with macrophage infiltrates in order to mimic the TME and modulate the drug's efficacy on cancer cells in the presence of macrophages. A 3D spheroid was established using the human cancer cell line CAL33 and THP1 cell derived M0 macrophages were used as a source of macrophages. Cellular parameters including tumour metabolism, health, and mitochondrial mass were analysed in order to establish ideal conditions. To modulate the interaction of cancer cells with macrophage the ROS, NO, and H2O2 levels, in addition to M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypic markers, were analyzed. To understand the crosstalk between cancer cells and macrophages for ECM degradation, HSP70, HIF1 alpha and cysteine proteases were examined in spheroids using western blotting and qPCR.ResultsThe spheroids with macrophage infiltrates exhibited key features of solid tumors, including cellular heterogeneity, metabolic changes, nutrient gradients, ROS emission, and the interplay between HIF1 alpha and HSP70 for upregulation of ECM degradading enzymes. Our results demonstrate that tumor cells exhibit a metabolic shift in the presence of macrophages. Additionally, we have observed a shift in the polarity of M0 macrophages towards tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in response to cancer cells in spheroids. Results also demonstrate the involvement of macrophages in regulating HIF-1 alpha, HSP70, and ECM degradation cysteine proteases enzymes.ConclusionsThis study has significant implications for cancer therapy as it sheds light on the intricate interaction between tumor cells and their surrounding macrophages. Additionally, our 3D spheroid model can aid in drug screening and enhance the predictive accuracy of preclinical studies. The strength of our study lies in the comprehensive characterization of the multicellular 3D spheroid model, which closely mimics the TME.

AB  - Objectives To study the prevalence, correlates, and outcomes of GI manifestations in a prospectively enrolled nationwide cohort of SLE in India (INSPIRE).Methods It is an observational cohort study with analysis of the baseline database of the INSPIRE cohort with early outcomes assessed till 10 April 2023. Cases with GI manifestations as per the BILAG index were selected, pertinent clinical and laboratory data were retrieved for analysis. Patients with GI manifestations were compared with the rest of the cohort and factors associated with death were determined.Results Of the 2503 patients with SLE enrolled in the INSPIRE cohort, 243 (9.7%) had GI manifestations observed early in the disease course (1, 0-3 months). Ascites (162, 6.5%), followed by enteritis (41,1.6%), pancreatitis (35, 1.4%) and hepatitis (24, 0.9%) were the most prevalent manifestations. All patients received immunosuppressive therapy, and four patients required surgery. Twenty-nine patients died (11.9%), with uncontrolled disease activity (17, 58.6%) and infection (6, 20.7%) accounting for the majority of deaths. Low socioeconomic class [lower Hazard Ratio (95% confidence intervals, CI) 2.8 (1.1-7.9); upper lower 7.5 (2-27.7); reference as upper class] and SLEDAI 2K [1.06 (1.02-1.11)] were associated with death in the GI group. GI manifestations were significantly associated with age [odds ratio and 95% CI 0.97 (0.96-0.99)], pleural effusion [4.9 (3.6-6.7)], thrombocytopenia [1.7 (1.2-2.4)], myositis [1.7 (1.1-2.7)], albumin [0.7 (0.5-0.8)], alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [1.01 (1.0-1.002)], low C3 [1.9 (1.3-2.5)], total bilirubin [1.2 (1.03-1.3)], alopecia [0.62 (0.5-0.96], elevated anti-dsDNA [0.5 (0.4-0.8)], and anti-U1RNP antibody [0.8 (0.5-0.7)] in model one; and age [0.97 (0.96-0.99)], creatinine [1.2 (1.03-1.4)], total bilirubin [1.2 (1.03-1.3)], ALP [1.01 (1.0-1.002)], albumin [0.6 (0.5-0.7)], andanti-U1RNP antibody [0.6 (0.5-0.8)] in model two in multivariate analysis compared with patients without GI features. The mortality was higher in the GI group (11.9% and 6.6%, P = 0.01) as compared with controls.Conclusion GI manifestations were observed in 9.7% of the cohort and were always associated with systemic disease activity and had higher mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUNDManipulation under anesthesia (MUA) of the shoulder joint is a commonly used method for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis. Though it has been known to be associated with a variety of complications, there is a paucity of studies describing the arthroscopic findings after MUA.AIMTo describe the arthroscopic findings in patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder after MUA.METHODSWe recruited 28 patients with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis who underwent arthroscopic capsular release. Manipulation of the shoulder was performed under anesthesia in all of these patients before capsular release. Intra-articular findings were recorded during arthroscopic capsular release in these patients.RESULTSAll patients showed the presence of synovitis. Twenty-seven patients showed tears in the capsule on the anterior aspect. One patient had an avulsion of the anterior rim of the glenoid and labrum following the manipulation. Four patients had partial rotator cuff tears, and one patient showed a superior labrum anterior posterior lesion, which was not diagnosed preoperatively on magnetic resonance imaging.CONCLUSIONMUA leads to rupture of the capsule, which is the desired outcome. However, the site of rupture of the capsule is dependent on the maneuvers of MUA. In addition, partial tears of the rotator cuff and osteochondral fractures of the glenoid can also occur.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesPersons with epilepsy are afflicted with comorbidities such as stigma, anxiety, and depression which have a significant impact on their quality of life. These comorbidities remain largely unaddressed in resource-limited countries. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to investigate whether yoga and psychoeducation were effective in reducing felt stigma (primary outcome), neuropsychiatric outcomes, and seizure frequency, as compared with sham yoga and psychoeducation in persons with epilepsy.MethodsThis was an assessor-blinded, sham yoga-controlled RCT. Patients clinically diagnosed with epilepsy, aged 18-60 years, and scoring higher than the cutoff score for felt stigma as measured by the Kilifi Stigma Scale (KSS) in our population were randomly assigned to receive either yoga therapy plus psychoeducation (intervention) or sham yoga therapy plus psychoeducation (comparator) for a duration of 3 months. The primary outcome was a significant decrease in felt stigma as compared with the comparator arm as measured by the KSS. Primary and secondary outcomes (seizure frequency, quality of life, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, trait rumination, cognitive impairment, emotion regulation) were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Parametric/nonparametric analysis of covariance and the chi 2 test were used to compare the 2 arms.ResultsA total of 160 patients were enrolled in the trial. At the end of the follow-up period (6 months), the intervention arm reported significant reduction in felt stigma as compared with the control arm (Cohen's d = 0.23, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.55, p = 0.006). Significantly higher odds of >50% seizure reduction (odds ratio [OR] 4.11, 95% CI 1.34-14.69, p = 0.01) and complete seizure remission (OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.75-55.89, p = 0.005) were also observed in the intervention group. The intervention group showed significant improvement in symptoms of anxiety, cognitive impairment, mindfulness, and quality of life relative to the control group at the end of follow-up period (p < 0.05).DiscussionYoga can alleviate the burden of epilepsy and improve the overall quality of life in epilepsy by reducing perceived stigma.

AB  - BackgroundVesicoureteral reflux (VUR) affects 1-2% of children, predisposing them to pyelonephritis, renal scarring, and reflux nephropathy. Treatment aims to prevent febrile urinary tract infections (f-UTI) and long-term sequelae. While guidelines differ, the current consensus proposes individual risk-stratification and subsequent management strategies. Here, we systematically analyzed the current literature on Positional Instillation of Contrast Cystography (PIC) for individualized diagnostics in patients with recurrent f-UTIs.ObjectiveWe present a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Outcomes were: 1. the ability of PIC to predict VUR in patients with negative voiding cystographies (VCUG), 2. the ability of PIC to predict occult contralateral VUR, 3. the correlation of occult VUR in PIC with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan findings, and 4. the incidence of postoperative f-UTI in children treated for occult VUR picked up on PIC.Study designWe conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines, applying the following inclusion criteria: Children with occult VUR in PIC with negative VCUG.ResultsWe included nine studies with 496 symptomatic patients with a mean age of 6.8 years, published between 2003 and 2021. PIC detected VUR in 73% of patients. Out of them, 81% had low-grade and 19% high-grade VUR. Occult contralateral VUR was present in 41% children. The presence of renal scars on DMSA scan was 1.39 times more likely with occult VUR on PIC. 85% of patients did not experience recurrent f-UTIs after PIC and subsequent treatment.DiscussionPIC can detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent f-UTIs in whom VCUG is negative. However, we recommend a cautious approach in the use of PIC in clinical practice until further prospective studies confirm the validity of our outcome measures.ConclusionIdentification, risk stratification, and prompt action are central in managing VUR. PIC can be helpful in identifying VUR in patients with recurrent f-UTI.

AB  - Introduction: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) displays ethnic differences in disease phenotype. We aimed to examine how this common disease is managed worldwide.Methods: An online 2-step questionnaire-based survey was conducted among nephrologists globally focusing on various management strategies used in IgAN.Results: A total of 422 nephrologists responded to the initial survey and 339 to the follow-up survey. Of the nephrologists, 13.7% do not get MEST-C scores in biopsy reports; 97.2% of nephrologists use renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) / angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as initial treatment. Other supportive treatments commonly employed are fish oil (43.6%) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (48.6%) with regional differences. Immunosuppression is generally (92.4%) initiated when proteinuria >1 g/d persists for $3 months.Main considerations for initiating immunosuppression are level of proteinuria (87.9%), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline (78.7%), lack of response to RAAS blockade (57.6%) and MEST-C score (64.9%). Corticosteroids (89.1%) are universally used as first-line immunosuppression; mycophenolate mofetil is commonly used in resistant patients (49.3%). Only 30.4% nephrologist enroll patients with persistent proteinuria >1 g/d in clinical trials. Nephrologists in Europe (63.6%), North America (56.5%), and Australia (63.6%) are more likely to do so compared to South America (31.3%) and Asia (17.2%). Only 8.1% nephrologists in lower-middle income countries (LMICs) enroll patients in clinical trials, though 40% of them are aware of such trials in their nations.Conclusion: Although most nephrologists agree on common parameters to assess clinical severity of IgAN, use of RAAS blockade, and blood pressure control, there is heterogeneity in use of other supportive therapies and initiation of immunosuppression. There is reluctance to enroll patients in clinical trials with novel treatments, principally in LMICs.

AB  - Oral cancer screening with exogenous agents is highly demanding due to high sensitivity, as the early diagnosis plays a vital role in achieving favorable outcomes for oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) by facilitating prompt detection and comprehensive surgical removal. Optical techniques utilizing the local application of fluorescein dye or fluorescence-guided surgery offer potential for early OSCC detection. The use of fluorescein dye in oral cancer is significantly less, and there is a need to inspect the local application of fluorescein dye in oral cancer patients. Concentration-based investigations of the dye with OSCC patients are essential to ensure accurate fluorescence-guided surgery and screening with fluorescein labeling and to mitigate possible adverse effects. Additionally, analyzing the dye distribution within OSCC tissues can provide insights into their het-erogeneity, a critical indicator of malignancy. The present study includes a concentration-based statistical and spectroscopic analysis of fluorescein dye in ex-vivo and in-vivo OSCC patients. In the ex-vivo examination of OSCC tissues, five concentrations (18.66 +/- 0.06, 9.51 +/- 0.02, 6.38 +/- 0.01, 4.80 +/- 0.004, and 3.85 +/- 0.002 millimolar) are employed for optical analysis. The ex-vivo OSCC tissues are analyzed for multiple statistical parameters at all concentrations, and the results are thoroughly described. Additionally, spectroscopic analysis is conducted on all concentrations for a comprehensive evaluation. Following optical analysis of all five concen-trations in the ex-vivo study, two concentrations, 6.38 +/- 0.01 and 4.80 +/- 0.004 millimolar, are identified as suitable for conducting in-vivo investigations of oral cancer. A detailed spectroscopic and statistical study of OSCC tissues in-vivo has been done using these two concentrations.

AB  - Trauma is rising as a cause of morbidity and mortality in lower- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This article describes the Epidemiology, Challenges, Management strategies and prevention of pediatric trauma in lower- and middle-income countries. The top five etiologies for non-intentional injuries leading to death are falls, road traffic injuries, burns, drowning and poisoning. The mortality rate in LMICs is twice that of High-Income Countries (HICs) irrespective of injury severity adjustment. The reasons for inadequate care include lack of facilities, transportation problems, lack of prehospital care, lack of resources and trained manpower to handle pediatric trauma. To overcome these challenges, attention to protocolized care and treatment adaptation based on resource availability is critical. Training in management of trauma helps to reduce the mortality and morbidity in pediatric polytrauma cases. There is also a need for more collaborative research to develop preventative measures to childhood trauma.

AB  - Objectives To identify factors associated with malnutrition (undernutrition and overnutrition) and determine appropriate cut-off values for mid-arm circumference (MAC) and calf circumference (CC) among community-dwelling Indian older adults.Design Data from the first wave of harmonised diagnostic assessment of dementia for Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI-DAD) were used. Various sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, childhood financial and health status were included. Anthropometric measurements included body mass index (BMI), MAC and CC.Setting Nationally representative cohort study including 36 Indian states and union territories.Participants 4096 older adults aged >60 years from LASI DAD.Outcome measures The outcome variable was BMI, categorised as low (<18.5 kg/m(2)), normal (18.5-22.9 kg/m(2)) and high (>23 kg/m(2)). The cut-off values of MAC and CC were derived using ROC curve with BMI as the gold standard.Results 902 (weighted percentage 20.55%) had low BMI, 1742 (44.25%) had high BMI. Undernutrition was associated with age, wealth-quintile and impaired cognition, while overnutrition was associated with higher education, urban living and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and chronic heart disease. For CC, the optimal lower and upper cut-offs for males were 28.1 cm and >31.5 cm, respectively, while for females, the corresponding values were 26 cm and >29 cm. Similarly, the optimal lower and upper cut-offs for MAC in males were 23.9 cm and >26.9 cm, and for females, they were 22.5 cm and >25 cm.Conclusion Our study identifies a high BMI prevalence, especially among females, individuals with higher education, urban residents and those with comorbidities. We establish gender-specific MAC and CC cut-off values with significant implications for healthcare, policy and research. Tailored interventions can address undernutrition and overnutrition in older adults, enhancing standardised nutritional assessment and well-being.

AB  - Objective To determine the utility of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB MRI) to predict relapse in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in clinical remission.Methods Consecutive patients with JIA who fulfilled the Wallace criteria for remission were recruited into this longitudinal pilot study and underwent WB MRI. A radiological score was devised, incorporating synovitis, bone marrow edema, sacroiliitis, enthesitis, and bone erosions. Two readers independently scored the MR data sets. The same score was calculated for both knee joints individually and correlated with outcome for that joint. Score-based models incorporating clinical and laboratory variables were generated. Logistic regression analysis was done to determine predictors for relapse. Receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn for significant variables.Results Twenty-two children (median age, 12 years; interquartile range, 9.5-14.25 years) were included in the final analysis. At 24 months' follow-up, 15 joints in 5 children relapsed; knee was the most common site. Seven knee joints had disease relapse. On univariate analysis, synovitis and total score on WB MRI were significant predictors of relapse at follow-up, with odds ratios of 9.46 (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval, 3.07-29.13) and 2.8 (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval, 1.23-6.39) respectively. Two models, which included a higher number of joints involved at presentation and abrupt drug withdrawal strategy as predictor variables, were also statistically significant (odds ratio, approximately 1.9). On multivariate analysis of the predictors variables in models where p < 0.6, it was found that only synovitis score and total score were near statistical significance (p = 0.06); no clinical or laboratory variables were significant. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for relapse prediction were approximately 0.82, 0.87, 0.79, and 0.81 for synovitis score, total MRI score, and both models, respectively.Conclusion Synovitis on WB MRI is the strongest independent predictor for disease relapse in children with JIA in remission

AB  - Pr & eacute;cis: In primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), micropulse cyclophotocoagulation resulted in a significant reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP), and the number of antiglaucoma medications without any sight-threatening complications. However, the IOP lowering efficacy decreased over time.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of micropulse trans-scleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) in PACG.Patients and Methods: Thirty-three phakic PACG eyes with patent laser peripheral iridotomy and IOP uncontrolled on maximum tolerable antiglaucoma medications (AGMs), scheduled for trabeculectomy, were given a trial of MP-TSCPC (810 nm laser, 2000 mw power for 180 seconds, 360 degrees). The primary outcome measure was a success at 1 year with IOP <= 18 mm Hg and <= 15 mm Hg with (qualified success) or without (absolute success) AGMs after a single session of MP laser. Secondary outcome measures were changes in pupillary diameter, visual acuity, central macular thickness, and subjective pain perception.Results: Thirty-two out of 33 PACG patients completed 12 months of follow-up. The mean age of patients was 54.7 +/- 8.9 years; male:female ratio was 1:1. The baseline IOP was 25.7 +/- 5.3 mm Hg, which reduced to 17.9 +/- 4.6 mm Hg at the end of 12 months (P<0.0001). Twenty eyes (62.5%) achieved qualified success, and 1 eye (3.125%) had absolute success at 12 months for IOP <= 18 mm Hg; 6 eyes (18.75%) had qualified success, and 1 eye (3.125%) had absolute success for IOP <= 15 mm Hg at 12 months follow-up. A significant reduction was also observed in the number of AGMs (4.4 +/- 0.8 at baseline to 2.9 +/- 1.1 at 12 months; P <0.0001). Five eyes (15.6%) received additional treatment-3 eyes (9.4%) requiring a subsequent filtering procedure, and 2 eyes (6.2%) requiring an additional MP-TSCPC session. No significant change in pupillary diameter (P=0.489) or central macular thickness (P=0.938) was noted at 12 months. There was a transient drop of visual acuity >2 lines in 1 patient due to cystoid macular edema, and no major postlaser complications were noted.Conclusions: MP-TSCPC can be used as an interim procedure to reduce IOP in PACG eyes and delay the need for invasive surgery. Most patients require continued use of glaucoma medications, and target IOPs achieved are in the high teens.

AB  - For residents or fellows outside anesthesiology and critical care training programs, formal training in managing critically sick patients does not exist in India either at the undergraduate level, or at postgraduate level. Acute critical care course (ACCC) is a simulation-based skills development course that has been developed indigenously to address this lacuna in training of interns and residents in surgical specialties and emergency medicine in India. This study is aimed to find out and to assess the effectiveness of this course.
   This is a prospective interventional study using low-fidelity simulation-based courses. As many as 1036 candidates (interns and residents) were trained in 40 ACCC provider courses, and 165 instructor candidates in 9 instructor courses in 16 teaching hospitals in India in 2014-2021. However, in this report, the authors have analyzed the feedback (verbal and written) from 487 candidates of 19 ACCC provider courses conducted in 14 teaching hospitals in India between 2014 and 2018. Analysis of data was performed by thematic analysis for qualitative data and descriptive analysis for quantitative data.
   All the 487 candidates in 19 courses over 5 years replied either as very good (above expectations) or as good (as per expectations). In response to the question of the effectiveness of a lecture or skill station, none of them chose the options fair (below expectations) or poor (unacceptable). Fifteen out of 18 interns replied their emails that were sent 3 weeks after ACCC to find out if there was an improvement in their clinical application on a scale of 1-10. The response to the question in regards to improvement in their own ability 'to assess a sick patient', 'in treating a sick patient', 'communication skills with a colleague', and 'confidence in breaking bad news to patient or relatives', respectively, was 7.5, 7.8, 8.3 and 8.3. Mean scores out of 5 in response to content of ACCC course for clarity, utility, adequacy of content, understandable and interaction during course were 4.59, 4.81, 4,78, 4.86 and 4.97 respectively. Qualitative analysis led to 5 themes described in the manuscript.
   Low fidelity simulation using role-play appeals to the adult learners, breaks the monotony of classroom teaching, encourages interactive learning, and facilitates active participation in skill development necessary for critical care training of residents in surgical specialties and in emergency medicine. Sharing the vision document of ACCC with the deans of medical colleges is the crucial step in implementing applied physiology in step-wise logical approach in managing a sick patient.

AB  - Monitoring graft health and detecting graft rejection is crucial for the success of post-transplantation outcomes. In Western countries, the use of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) has gained widespread recognition as a diagnostic tool for kidney transplant recipients. However, the role of dd-cfDNA among the Indian population remains unexplored. The recipients were categorized into two groups: the post-transplant recipient (PTR) group (n = 16) and the random recipient (RR) group (n = 87). Blood samples were collected daily from the PTR group over a 7-day period, whereas the RR group's samples were obtained at varying intervals. In this study, we used a targeted approach to identify dd-cfDNA, which eliminated the need for genotyping, and is based on the minor allele frequency of SNP assays. In the PTR group, elevated dd-cfDNA% levels were observed immediately after transplantation, but returned to normal levels within five days. Within the RR group, heightened serum creatinine levels were directly proportional to increased dd-cfDNA%. Sixteen recipients were advised to undergo biopsy due to elevated serum creatinine and other pathological markers. Among these sixteen recipients, six experienced antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), two exhibited graft dysfunctions, two had active graft injury, and six (37.5%) recipients showed no rejection (NR). In cases of biopsy-proven ABMR and NR, recipients displayed a mean +/- SD dd-cfDNA% of 2.80 +/- 1.77 and 0.30 +/- 0.35, respectively. This study found that the selected SNP assays exhibit a high proficiency in identifying donor DNA. This study also supports the use of dd-cfDNA as a routine diagnostic test for kidney transplant recipients, along with biopsies and serum creatinine, to attain better graft monitoring.

AB  - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressively fatal and incurable disease characterized by the loss of alveolar structures, increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and aberrant tissue repair. In this study, we investigated the role of Nuclear Factor I-B (NFIB), a transcription factor critical for lung development and maturation, in IPF. Using both human lung tissue samples from patients with IPF, and a mouse model of lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin, we showed that there was a significant reduction of NFIB both in the lungs of patients and mice with IPF. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments using cultured human lung cells demonstrated that the loss of NFIB was associated with the induction of EMT by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Knockdown of NFIB promoted EMT, while overexpression of NFIB suppressed EMT and attenuated the severity of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Mechanistically, we identified post-translational regulation of NFIB by miR-326, a miRNA with anti-fibrotic effects that is diminished in IPF. Specifically, we showed that miR-326 stabilized and increased the expression of NFIB through its 3'UTR target sites for Human antigen R (HuR). Moreover, treatment of mice with either NFIB plasmid or miR-326 reversed airway collagen deposition and fibrosis. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the critical role of NFIB in lung development and maturation, and its reduction in IPF leading to EMT and loss of alveolar structures. Our study highlights the potential of miR-326 as a therapeutic intervention for IPF.Graphical abstractThe schema shows the role of NFIB in maintaining the normal epithelial cell characteristics in the lungs and how its reduction leads to a shift towards mesenchymal cell-like features and pulmonary fibrosis. A In normal lungs, NFIB is expressed abundantly in the epithelial cells, which helps in maintaining their shape, cell polarity and adhesion molecules. However, when the lungs are exposed to factors that induce pulmonary fibrosis, such as bleomycin, or TGF-beta, the epithelial cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which leads to a decrease in NFIB. B The mesenchymal cells that arise from EMT appear as spindle-shaped with loss of cell junctions, increased cell migration, loss of polarity and expression of markers associated with mesenchymal cells/fibroblasts. C We designed a therapeutic approach that involves exogenous administration of NFIB in the form of overexpression plasmid or microRNA-326. This therapeutic approach decreases the mesenchymal cell phenotype and restores the epithelial cell phenotype, thus preventing the development or progression of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Objective We compared diagnostic quality of Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT imaging focused on the pelvic structures using two furosemide protocols in two different groups of patients.Material and methods A total of 55 patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Out of 55, 31 patients were in group 1 (median age: 66 years, Range 44-78 years) in which furosemide injection was given after completion of whole-body Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT scan and 24 patients were in group 2 (median age: 63.5 years, range: 50-82 years) in which it was given along with the Ga-68-PSMA injection. In both groups, an initial time point scan (T0 scan) and a delayed time point scan (T1scan) were done. The images were analyzed qualitatively as well as quantitatively.Results Quantitatively there was no statistically significant difference between the SUVmax and T:B of prostatic lesion and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) in both the groups at two time points (P > 0.05). Early furosemide injection caused a washout of the urinary bladder radiotracer concentration in significantly higher number of patients in group 2 (62.5% vs. 6.45% patients, P < 0.001). There was significant clearance of radiotracer activity from the ureters in group 2 (SUVmax: 9.28 vs. 3.09, P = 0.002).Conclusion The simultaneous furosemide and Ga-68-PSMA injection can reduce the urinary excretion of the tracer and improve the diagnostic confidence of prostatic lesion, SVI and lymph nodal metastasis, along with reducing the scanning time and radiation burden, making this protocol an effective alternative to the present protocol of delayed furosemide injection.

AB  - ObjectiveDetection of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) through noninvasive modalities is very important in the successful management of LGIB. RBC scintigraphy and CT have a role in the detection of LGIB and guiding the management of patient by localization of the bleeding site. However, only a small number of studies have evaluated the role of RBC scintigraphy and CT in the diagnosis of LGIB. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of RBC scintigraphy and CT in the detection of LGIB in patients with clinical or biochemical findings suspicious of LGIB.MethodsThis systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. Searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase were conducted using relevant keywords, and articles published through 30 April 2022, were included. Using endoscopy or surgical outcomes as the reference standard, the numbers of true and false positives and true and false negatives were extracted. Pooled estimates of diagnostic test accuracy - including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and summary ROC (SROC) curve - were generated using bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.ResultsThree studies comprising 171 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the detection of LGIB using RBC scintigraphy were 0.787 (95% CI, 0.643-0.893), 0.289 (95% CI, 0.164-0.443), 1.214 (95% CI, 0.923-1.597) and 0.576 (95% CI, 0.296-1.121) respectively. The area under the SROC curve was 0.73. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the detection of LGIB using CT were 0.931 (95% CI, 0.772-0.992), 0.870 (95% CI, 0.737-0.951), 6.085 (95% CI, 0.840-44.097), 0.126 (95% CI, 0.006-2.509) respectively. The area under the SROC curve was 0.095.ConclusionRBC scintigraphy has overall good sensitivity and CTA has excellent sensitivity specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio in the detection of LGIB in patients with clinical or biochemical findings suspicious for LGIB.CTA along with RBC scintigraphy can be used algorithmically to rule out patients who do not have a localization for the site of LGIB thereby helping these patients to avoid invasive procedures like endoscopy or surgical explorations.

AB  - Introduction: Corticosteroids are used as adjunctive treatment in tuberculous meningitis (TBM). However, there is no universally accepted regimen, type, duration, or route of steroid administration. Methodology: In a randomized open labelled pilot study, TBM patients were divided into overlap oral dexamethasone (OOD) and direct oral dexamethasone (DOD) arms. The total duration of steroid administration was 8 weeks. The primary outcome was symptomatic resolution at 1 month post randomization. The secondary outcomes were mortality and modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 and 6 months after initiation of steroids. Results: Symptomatic resolution after one month of randomization in 53 randomized patients was similar in OOD (71.4% (15/21)) versus DOD ((85.0% (17/20)) arm (p value:0.45). Median mRS was also similar in OOD versus DOD (OOD: 2.5 (IQR: 1.0; 6.0) versus DOD: 1.0 (IQR: (0.0; 4.0); p value: 0.31)) arm at 6 months. The mortality at 6 months was 31.8% (7/22) in the OOD versus 20.0% (4/20) in the DOD arm (p value: 0.49). Conclusions: In this open label pilot study, the outcomes were similar in OOD versus DOD arms in terms of symptomatic resolution at 1 month, and morbidity, and mortality at 3 and 6 months. Patients with stage I to III TBM may be given injectable steroids for 1 week after which they may be switched to oral steroid. This regime cannot be applied to stage IV TBM and patients with complications like optico-chiasmatic or spinal arachnoiditis or vasculitic infarcts.

AB  - Background: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in young adults has been steadily rising in incidence over the decades. However, data on longterm outcomes in this specific cohort remain limited. In this study, we intended to evaluate young adults with DTC with regard to their clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes and compare the same vis-a-vis pediatric patients with DTC.
   Methods: Data of pediatric (<= 18 years) and young adult (19-39 years) patients with DTC, from 1971 to 2016, were sequentially extracted and analyzed for clinical characteristics, treatment responses, rates of recurrent/persistent disease, and disease-free survival (DFS).
   Results: A total of 1803 patients with DTC were included (pediatric cohort: n = 176; young adult cohort: n = 1627). Pediatric patients with DTC had more frequent adverse baseline features including extrathyroidal extension (P =.040), nodal and distant metastases, and American Thyroid Association high-risk disease (P <.001 each). At 2 years posttreatment, young adult patients with DTC had significantly lower incomplete responses compared with pediatric patients with DTC (223/1627; 13.7% vs 94/176, 53.4%, respectively; P < .001). Over a median follow-up of 10.7 years, 120/1627 (7.4%) young adult patients with DTC had recurrent/persistent disease vs 23/176 (13.1%) pediatric patients with DTC (P = .012). The 10-year DFS probability was 93.6% for the young adult patients with DTC vs 88.7% for the pediatric patients with DTC (P = .007). American Thyroid Association high-risk disease and incomplete response at 2 years were independent predictors of significantly worse DFS in the young adult cohort (P <.001 each).
   Conclusions: Young adult DTCs behave less aggressively compared with their pediatric counterparts with excellent long-term outcomes. Appropriate initial and dynamic risk stratification can help optimize treatment decisions and follow-up strategies.

AB  - Recent advancements in the understanding of how sperm develop into offspring have shown complex interactions between environmental influences and genetic factors. The past decade, marked by a research surge, has not only highlighted the profound impact of paternal contributions on fertility and reproductive outcomes but also revolutionized our comprehension by unveiling how parental factors sculpt traits in successive generations through mechanisms that extend beyond traditional inheritance patterns. Studies have shown that offspring are more susceptible to environmental factors, especially during critical phases of growth. While these factors are broadly detrimental to health, their effects are especially acute during these periods. Moving beyond the immutable nature of the genome, the epigenetic profile of cells emerges as a dynamic architecture. This flexibility renders it susceptible to environmental disruptions. The primary objective of this review is to shed light on the diverse processes through which environmental agents affect male reproductive capacity. Additionally, it explores the consequences of paternal environmental interactions, demonstrating how interactions can reverberate in the offspring. It encompasses direct genetic changes as well as a broad spectrum of epigenetic adaptations. By consolidating current empirically supported research, it offers an exhaustive perspective on the interwoven trajectories of the environment, genetics, and epigenetics in the elaborate transition from sperm to offspring.

AB  - Skull base chondrosarcomas remain a surgical challenge despite advances in neurosurgical armamentarium and can be intimately related to critical neurovascular structures.(1-4) In this operative video, we discuss the virtual surgical planning and operative nuances of excision of a multicompartmental chondrosarcoma in a 50-year-old female patient presenting with right-sided facial sensory loss and headache for 2 years. On preoperative imaging, extradural multicompartmental T2-hyperintesne lesion with heterogeneous contrast enhancement extending from sella to middle cranial fossa to posterior cranial fossa was identified. We performed 3D segmentation of the imaging data using Simpleware (TM) ScanIP software (Synopsys Inc.) for virtual surgical planning. The senior author decided to operate this case using an extradural subtemporal approach (Video). The patient consented to the procedure and the publication of her images. The patient recovered well in the postoperative period with no added neurological deficits and had excellent surgical outcome with no evidence of residual tumor at 3-month follow up. In this video, we attempt to highlight the utility of preoperative virtual planning in complex cases for excellent surgical outcome with minimal complications. This patient-specific virtual surgical rehearsal helped in better understanding of relationship of the petrous and cavernous segment of internal carotid artery to the eroded skull base and the tumor, which in turn decreased the chances of intraoperative complications. In addition, this is very useful for training of young neurosurgeons to develop 3D orientation which is necessary for optimal outcome.(5-7)

AB  - Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), a growing class of immune cells, imitate the appearance and abilities of T cells. However, unlike T cells, ILCs lack acquired antigen receptors, and they also do not undergo clonal selection or proliferation in response to antigenic stimuli. Despite lacking antigen-specific receptors, ILCs respond quickly to signals from infected or damaged tissues and generate an array of cytokines that regulate the development of adaptive immune response. ILCs can be categorized into four types based on their signature cytokines and transcription factors: ILC1, ILC2, ILC3 (including Lymphoid Tissue inducer-LTi cells), and regulatory ILCs (ILCregs). ILCs play key functions in controlling and resolving inflammation, and variations in their proportion are linked to various pathological diseases including cancer, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and skin diseases. We highlight current advancements in the biology and classification of ILCs in this review. Additionally, we provide a thorough overview of their contributions to several inflammatory bone-related pathologies, including osteo-porosis, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Understanding the multiple functions of ILCs in both physiological and pathological conditions will further mobilize future research towards targeting ILCs for therapeutic purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary intradural extramedullary (IDEM) lesions are rare, with an incidence of about 1/100,000 person-years. The aim of this study was to investigate their demographic, clinical, imaging, management, histopathological and outcome parameters. Another objective was to evaluate the various predicting factors leading to long-term favorable outcomes, thereby answering the controversial question: when to operate? METHODS: This study observed 212 patients of primary IDEM lesions and followed-up for a mean of 53.80 months. The patient's outcome using McCormick grade at follow-up was correlated with age, sex, duration of symptoms, preoperative McCormick grade, tumor location and extent, extradural spread, extent of excision, vascularity, WHO grade and histopathological tumor type. RESULTS: Benign nerve sheath tumors were the commonest lesions (47.17% schwannoma, 4.72% Neurofibroma), followed in incidence by meningioma (19.34%). There was predominance of males (57.08%), except in meningiomas (male: female ratio 1:2.15). Pain was the com-monest initial symptom (51.88%). Limb weakness was the most common presenting complaint (88.68%). Gross total excision was achieved in 81.60% of cases and 70.75% of patients improved following surgery. The significant factors predicting favorable outcome included preoperative McCormick grade (P=0.001), the vertical extent of the tumor (P=0.027), histopathological tumor type (P=0.023) and WHO grading (P=0.015); and extent of excision had an odds ratio of 1: 2.5. CONCLUSIONS: Significant predictors of functional outcome following surgery in IDEM lesions included preoperative McCormick grade, extent of the tumor, tumor type, WHO grading and extent of resection. The authors recommend surgery with the intent of complete tumor exci-sion, before the onset of substantial symptoms, for better outcome.

AB  - Pancreatic Neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) are challenging to diagnose and often detected at advanced stages due to a lack of specific and sensitive biomarkers. This study utilized proteomics as a valuable approach for cancer biomarker discovery; therefore, mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiling was conducted on plasma samples from 12 subjects (3 controls; 5 Grade I, 4 Grade II PanNET patients) to identify potential proteins capable of effectively distinguishing PanNET from healthy controls. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD045045. 13.2% of proteins were uniquely identified in PanNET, while 60% were commonly expressed in PanNET and controls. 17 proteins exhibiting significant differential expression between PanNET and controls were identified with downstream analysis. Further, 5 proteins (C1QA, COMP, HSP90B1, ITGA2B, and FN1) were selected by pathway analysis and were validated using Western blot analysis. Significant downregulation of C1QA (p=0.001: within groups, 0.03: control vs. grade I, 0.0013: grade I vs. grade II) and COMP (p=0.011: within groups, 0.019: control vs grade I) were observed in PanNET Grade I & II than in controls. Subsequently, ELISA on 38 samples revealed significant downregulation of C1QA and COMP with increasing disease severity. This study shows the potential of C1QA and COMP in the early detection of PanNET, highlighting their role in the search for early-stage (Grade-I and Grade-II) diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for PanNET.

AB  - The first Lancet Oncology Commission on Global Cancer Surgery was published in 2015 and serves as a landmark paper in the field of cancer surgery. The Commission highlighted the burden of cancer and the importance of cancer surgery, while documenting the many inadequacies in the ability to deliver safe, timely, and affordable cancer surgical care. This Commission builds on the first Commission by focusing on solutions and actions to improve access to cancer surgery globally, developed by drawing upon the expertise from cancer surgery leaders across the world. We present solution frameworks in nine domains that can improve access to cancer surgery. These nine domains were refined to identify solutions specific to the six WHO regions. On the basis of these solutions, we developed eight actions to propel essential improvements in the global capacity for cancer surgery. Our initiatives are broad in scope, pragmatic, affordable, and contextually applicable, and aimed at cancer surgeons as well as leaders, administrators, elected officials, and health policy advocates. We envision that the solutions and actions contained within the Commission will address inequities and promote safe, timely, and affordable cancer surgery for every patient, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location.

AB  - BackgroundMass casualty incidents (MCI) pose significant challenges to existing resources, entailing multiagency collaboration. Triage is a critical component in the management of MCIs, but the lack of a universally accepted triage system can hinder collaboration and lead to preventable loss of life. This multinational study uses validated patient cards (cases) based on real MCIs to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel Translational Triage Tool (TTT) in primary triage assessment of mass casualty victims.MethodsUsing established triage systems versus TTT, 163 participants (1575 times) triaged five patient cases. The outcomes were statistically compared.ResultsTTT demonstrated similar sensitivity to the Sieve primary triage method and higher sensitivity than the START primary triage system. However, the TTT algorithm had a lower specificity compared to Sieve and higher over-triage rates. Nevertheless, the TTT algorithm demonstrated several advantages due to its straightforward design, such as rapid assessment, without the need for additional instrumental interventions, enabling the engagement of non-medical personnel.ConclusionsThe TTT algorithm is a promising and feasible primary triage tool for MCIs. The high number of over-triages potentially impacts resource allocation, but the absence of under-triages eliminates preventable deaths and enables the use of other personal resources. Further research involving larger participant samples, time efficiency assessments, and real-world scenarios is needed to fully assess the TTT algorithm's practicality and effectiveness in diverse multiagency and multinational contexts.

TI  - Immunogenicity and safety of a new quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls and boys aged 9-14years versus an established quadrivalent HPV vaccine in women aged 15-26 years in India: a randomised, active-controlled, multicentre, phase 2/3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
KW  - ADOLESCENTS
AB  - Background To meet global cervical cancer elimination efforts, a wider range of affordable and accessible vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are needed. We aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine (targeting HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18), developed and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SIIPL). Here we report outcomes in the 9-14 years cohort.Methods This randomised, active-controlled, phase 2/3 trial was conducted at 12 tertiary care hospitals across India. Healthy participants aged 9-14 years or 15-26 years with no history of HPV vaccination were eligible for enrolment. Female participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web response system, by use of a central computer-generated schedule and block randomisation (block sizes of 2, 4, 6, and 8), to receive the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Cervavac; SIIPL, Pune, India) or the comparator quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil; Merck Sharp & Dohme, Harleem, the Netherlands). Participants, investigators, laboratory technicians, and sponsors were masked to treatment allocation of female participants. Male participants were given the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine in an open-label manner. Study vaccines were administered intramuscularly with a two-dose schedule (at day 0 and 6 months) in the cohort aged 9-14 years, and with a three-dose schedule (at day 0, month 2, and month 6) in the cohort aged 15-26-years. Immunogenicity was assessed 30 days after the last dose by use of multiplexed ELISA. The primary outcome was the non-inferiority of immune response in terms of the geometric mean titre (GMT) of antibodies against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 generated by the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls and boys (aged 9-14 years) compared with the GMT generated by the comparator quadrivalent HPV vaccine in women aged 15-26 years at month 7 in the modified per-protocol population (ie, all participants who received all doses of study vaccines per assigned treatment group and had both day 0 and 1-month immunogenicity measurements after the last dose following protocol-defined window periods with no major protocol deviations). Non-inferiority was established if the lower bound of the 98<middle dot>75% CI of the GMT ratio was 0<middle dot>67 or higher. The co-primary outcome of occurrence of solicited adverse events (within 7 days of each dose) and unsolicited adverse events (up to 30 days after the last dose) was assessed in all participants who were enrolled and received at least one dose of study vaccine. The trial is registered with the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI/2018/06/014601), and long-term follow-up is ongoing.Findings Between Sept 20, 2018, and Feb 9, 2021, 2341 individuals were screened, of whom 2307 eligible individuals were enrolled and vaccinated: 1107 (738 girls and 369 boys) in the cohort aged 9-14 years and 1200 (819 women and 381 men) in the cohort aged 15-26 years. No race or ethnicity data were collected. 350 girls and 349 boys in the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine group and 338 women in the comparator vaccine group were included in the modified per-protocol population for the primary endpoint analysis. The median follow-up for the analyses was 221 days (IQR 215-231) for girls and 222 days (217-230) for boys in the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine group, 223 days (216-232) for girls in the comparator vaccine group, and 222 days (216-230) for women in the comparator vaccine group.
   GMT ratios were non-inferior in girls and boys receiving the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine compared with women receiving the comparator vaccine: GMT ratios for girls were 1<middle dot>97 (98<middle dot>75% CI 1<middle dot>67-2<middle dot>32) for HPV type 6, 1<middle dot>63 (1<middle dot>38-1<middle dot>91) for HPV type 11, 1<middle dot>90 (1<middle dot>60-2<middle dot>25) for HPV type 16, and 2<middle dot>16 (1<middle dot>79-2<middle dot>61) for HPV type 18. For boys the GMT ratios were 1<middle dot>86 (1<middle dot>57-2<middle dot>21) for HPV type 6, 1<middle dot>46 (1<middle dot>23-1<middle dot>73) for HPV type 11, 1<middle dot>62 (1<middle dot>36-1<middle dot>94) for HPV type 16, and 1<middle dot>80 (1<middle dot>48-2<middle dot>18) for HPV type 18. The safety population comprised all 1107 participants (369 girls and 369 boys in the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine group, and 369 girls in the comparator group). Solicited adverse events occurred in 176 (48%) of 369 girls and 124 (34%) of 369 boys in the SIIPL vaccine group and 179 (49%) of 369 girls in the comparator vaccine group. No grade 3-4 solicited adverse events occurred within 7 days of each dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in 143 (39%) girls and 147 (40%) boys in the SIIPL vaccine group, and 143 (39%) girls in the comparator vaccine group. The most common grade 3 unsolicited adverse event was dengue fever, in one (<1%) girl in the SIIPL vaccine group and three (1%) girls in the comparator group. There were no grade 4 or 5 adverse events. Serious adverse events occurred in three (1%) girls and three (1%) boys in the SIIPL vaccine group, and five (1%) girls in the comparator vaccine group. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. There were no treatment-related deaths.Interpretation We observed a non-inferior immune response with the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls and boys aged 9-14 years and an acceptable safety profile compared with the comparator vaccine. These findings support extrapolation of efficacy from the comparator vaccine to the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the younger population. The availability of the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine could help meet the global demand for HPV vaccines, and boost coverage for both girls and boys globally.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) related mortality and morbidity heavily strain society. The relationship between external risk factors and our genetics have not been well established. It is widely acknowledged that environmental influence and individual behaviours play a significant role in CVD vulnerability, leading to the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS). We employed the PRISMA search method to locate pertinent research and literature to extensively review artificial intelligence (AI)-based PRS models for CVD risk prediction. Furthermore, we analyzed and compared conventional vs. AI-based solutions for PRS. We summarized the recent advances in our understanding of the use of AI-based PRS for risk prediction of CVD. Our study proposes three hypotheses: i) Multiple genetic variations and risk factors can be incorporated into AI-based PRS to improve the accuracy of CVD risk predicting. ii) AI-based PRS for CVD circumvents the drawbacks of conventional PRS calculators by incorporating a larger variety of genetic and non-genetic components, allowing for more precise and individualised risk estimations. iii) Using AI approaches, it is possible to significantly reduce the dimensionality of huge genomic datasets, resulting in more accurate and effective disease risk prediction models. Our study highlighted that the AI-PRS model outperformed traditional PRS calculators in predicting CVD risk. Furthermore, using AI-based methods to calculate PRS may increase the precision of risk predictions for CVD and have significant ramifications for individualized prevention and treatment plans.

AB  - Revision surgery for OPLL is undesirable for both patients and physicians. However, the risk factors for reoperation are not clear. Thus, we sought to review the existing literature and determine the factors associated with higher reoperation rates in patients with OPLL. A search was performed using Pubmed, Embase, Web of Sciences, and Ovid to include studies regarding the risk factors of reoperation for OPLL. RoBANS (Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Nonrandomized Studies) was used for risk of bias analysis. Heterogeneity of studies and publication bias was assessed, and sensitivity analysis was performed. Statistical analysis was performed with a p-value < 0.05 using SPSS software (version 23). Twenty studies with 129 reoperated and 2,793 non-reoperated patients were included. The pooled reoperation rate was 5% (95% CI: 4% to 7). The most common cause of reoperation was residual OPLL or OPLL progression (n = 51, 39.53%). An increased risk of additional surgery was found with pre-operative cervical or thoracic angle (Standardized mean difference = -0.44; 95% CI: -0.69 to -0.19; p = 0.0061), post-operative CSF leak (Odds ratio, OR = 4.97; 95% CI: 2.48 to 9.96; p = 0.0005), and graft and/or hardware failure (OR = 192.09; 95% CI: 6.68 to 5521.69; p = 0.0101). Apart from the factors identified in our study, the association of other variables with the risk of second surgery could not be ruled out, owing to the complexity of the relationship and significant bias in the current literature.

AB  - The quality of the indoor environment significantly impacts human health and productivity, especially given the amount of time individuals spend indoors globally. While chemical pollutants have been a focus of indoor air quality research, microbial contaminants also have a significant bearing on indoor air quality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of microbial contamination in built environments, covering sources, sampling strategies, and analysis methods. Microbial contamination has various origins, including human occupants, pets, and the outdoor environment. Sampling strategies for indoor microbial contamination include air, surface, and dust sampling, and various analysis methods are used to assess microbial diversity and complexity in indoor environments. The review also discusses the health risks associated with microbial contaminants, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and their products in indoor air, highlighting the need for evidence-based studies that can relate to specific health conditions. The importance of indoor air quality is emphasized from the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic. A section of the review highlights the knowledge gap related to microbiological burden in indoor environments in developing countries, using India as a representative example. Finally, potential mitigation strategies to improve microbiological indoor air quality are briefly reviewed.

AB  - Background: H-deficient phenotypes are classified as H-deficient non- secretors (Bombay Oh), H-deficient secretors (Para Bombay), and H-partially deficient non-secretors (O h reunion, Ah and Bh, ABh). Report: We report the first case of H-partially deficient non-secretor- the Ah phenotype from India. What makes this report interesting is that they do not fit into the Bombay, or the Para Bombay series of H-deficient phenotypes and these partially deficient non-secretors were exclusively found on Re ' union Island, off the East Coast of Africa in 1982. These reunion type phenotypes have not been reported since then and may lead to misinterpretations and confusions when encountered in the current existing laboratory settings especially in the low income (LIC's) and low middle income (LMIC's) countries like our own. Moreover, literature from LMIC and LIC incorrectly uses Ah/Bh for parabombay phenotypes.Conclusions: H-deficient phenotypes are rare, challenging to identify and assign correct notations. Hence, we have highlighted characteristic differences between H-deficient phenotypes and illustrated a diagnostic laboratory approach to correctly identify and assign notations to them especially in the resource constrained settings.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane vesicles secreted into biological fluids, which play crucial roles in influencing the cellular function in different pathological processes. However, there is less clarity on how plasma EVs influence proliferation activation and functions of immune cells during dengue virus (DV) infection. In this study, we aimed to characterize circulating EVs from different categories of dengue patients and examined the consequence of naive CD4+ T cells to EVs isolated from the plasma of mild or severe dengue patients. We observed that severe dengue infection was associated with an increased release of CD41a+ platelet extracellular vesicles compared with that from patients with mild disease or healthy donors. These EVs carried an increased level of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines along with immunoregulatory proteins on the surface that caused CD4+ T cell suppression. Treatment of purified naive CD4+ T cells with EVs derived from severe dengue plasma drove CD4+ proliferation toward specific subtypes and modulated surface receptor CXCR3 and CCR6 expression. Subsequent studies indicated a notable rise in programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression within CD41a+ severe DV (SDV) EVs. Additionally, CD4+ T cells showed an elevated increase in programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) after incubating with SDV-EVs. We also demonstrated that blocking PD-L1 on SDV-EVs or PD-1 on late-activating CD4+ T cells partially reversed the SDV-EV-induced suppression of CD4+ T cell proliferation. Overall, our study highlights the immunosuppressive property of EVs derived from plasma of severe dengue patients, which might contribute to immune pathogenesis by shaping the immune response.IMPORTANCESevere dengue manifestations caused by the dengue virus are a global health problem. Studies suggest that severe dengue disease depends on uncontrolled immune cell activation, and excessive inflammation adds to the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. Therefore, it is important to understand the process that triggers the uncontrolled activation of the immune cells. The change in immune response in mild to severe dengue may be due to direct virus-to-cell interaction or it could be a contact-independent process through the extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from infected cells. The importance of circulating EVs in the context of dengue virus infection and pathogenesis remains unexplored. Therefore, understanding the possible biological function of circulating EVs may help to delineate the role of EVs in the progression of disease. Our present study highlights that EVs from plasma of severe dengue patients can have immunosuppressive properties on CD4+ T cells which may contribute to T cell suppression and may contribute to dengue disease progression.

AB  - The clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of anorectal malformation has been well described in the literature, however the experience with these conditions in low-and middle-income countries is often shaped in unique ways due to the social, cultural and economic factors at work in these regions. This leads to adaptation of modifications in management options for these babies that usually present as delayed cases with added poor prognostic factors like sepsis leading to need for emergency resuscitation and overall increased morbidity and mortality. This article explores the anomaly from a global surgery lens and outlines the spectrum of the anomaly, burden faced in the resource constrained environment and the management options adopted for successful management under the available circumstances.

AB  - Introduction: Functional jaw orthopaedics, produces a radical change in the occlusal scheme and the masticatory apparatus, particularly in patients with Class II malocclusion. It remains to be seen how the changes brought about by a functional appliance alter the masticatory ability of a growing child, who needs the necessary nutrition to properly grow the craniofacial region.
   Materials and methods: Pretreatment and Post-treatment values of masticatory efficiency and the distribution of the occlusal load at centric occlusion were evaluated and compared for 20 patients with Class II division 1 malocclusion undergoing functional jaw orthopaedics.
   Results: Significant increase in the masticatory efficiency was seen during and after treatment (p < 0.5) There was an increase in the anterior distribution of occlusal load associated with a concomitant decrease in the posterior region at centric occlusion.
   Conclusion: Improvement in the masticatory efficiency was observed after treatment of a retrognathic mandible with functional jaw orthopaedics in the adolescent participants with Class II malocclusion. This highlights the importance of treatment with functional jaw orthopaedics, which apart from providing esthetic and functional improvement also improves the ability of a growing child to extract proper nutrition from his/her diet.

AB  - AIM: To ascertain the pattern of investigations at first contact in uveitic patients and evaluate compliance to treatment.
   METHODS: An observational study comprised of 201 uveitic patients presenting for the first time to our centre from January 2019 to June 2020. Detailed information regarding systemic investigations undertaken by specialists at the time of first contact and the cost of these investigations were reviewed on the first visit to our centre. Compliance with the treatment was determined and reasons behind non-compliance were evaluated on the first follow-up in patients who had no improvement in clinical signs and symptoms.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the study group was 35.35 +/- 14.1y and gender composition was 59.7% males and 40.3% females. Anterior uveitis was observed in 45.3% of patients, intermediate uveitis in 31.8% of patients, posterior uveitis in 14.9% of patients and panuveitis in 8.0% of patients. Association with a systemic disease was evident in 17.9% of patients. When compared with standard guidelines and uveitis patterns, systemic investigations were identified to be relevant only in 38.3% of patients. Non-compliance to treatment was documented in 22.4% of patients. Common reasons for non-compliance were inadequate counselling by the treating physician about treatment in 26.7% of patients and a busy schedule at work/school in 22.2% of patients.
   CONCLUSION: Significant number of investigations performed at first contact is found to be contrary to standard guidelines and are not contributory to the care. About a quarter of patients in this study are found to be non-compliant with the treatment. Compliance is more challenging to achieve in school-going children and working adults. The availability of comprehensive, periodically updated, evidence-based guidelines on the role of investigations and the use of trained counsellors may help to channelize proper evaluation and improve compliance to treatment, respectively, in patients with uveitis.

AB  - Centipede bites are reported in many parts of tropical and subtropical countries, such as India. Centipede envenomation produces significant local symptoms, with pain being the most prominent symptom. The emergency department (ED) plays a crucial role in managing the victims through appropriate pain management and control of other local and systemic symptoms. Nonopioids and weak opioids, along with local measures, are often employed, but the intense pain is often refractory to these conventional techniques. Regional anesthesia has numerous benefits over these traditional measures, such as avoid-ance of polypharmacy and its consequent systemic adverse effects, excellent quality of pain control, and decreased need or avoidance of hospital admission. The applications of regional anesthesia have recently increased tremendously in the ED but are unreported for the management related to centipede bites. We report a case of centipede bite in which conventional analgesics did not help, and the pain was success-fully managed by low-volume selective sensory peripheral nerve block.

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer and accounts for about 95% of all head and neck cancers with high mortality, usually at a late stage. Dysbiosis in the oral microbiome can lead to chronic inflammatory responses and may predispose to the development and progression of OSCC. Tobacco abuse plays an essential role in oral microbiome dysregulation and OSCC pathogenesis. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon next-generation sequencing to examine microbial signatures unique to saliva from OSCC patients, tobacco abusers (TA) and controls (n = 10 for each group) to elucidate oral microbiome changes associated with tobacco abuse and OSCC. Overall, the oral microbiome compositions of class Beta-proteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, order Neisseriales, Burkholderiales and Campylobacterales, family Burkholderiaceae and Campylobacteraceae and genera Campylobacter and Leptotrichia revealed significant differences among OSCC patients, TA and control. Our preliminary pilot study not only serves as a basis for future studies with large sample size but also gives an indication of microbiome-based potential non-invasive biomarkers for early screening and monitoring of oral carcinogenesis transition due to tobacco abuse.

AB  - Aim. The present study sought to characterize the pulmonary arterial morphology and pulmonary blood supply in patients of tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia (TOF-PA) on CT angiography. Materials and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed our departmental database to identify patients with TOF-PA evaluated using CT angiography. The images were analysed to detect the presence of main and branch pulmonary arteries and pulmonary arterial confluence, presence of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs), laterality and relation with pulmonary arterial morphology, and presence of patent arterial duct and associated intra- and extracardiac anomalies. Results. TOF-PA was identified in 177 patients (114 (64.4%) males; median age: 9 months). Pulmonary arteries were confluent in 142/177 (80.2%) patients. According to Somerville classification, type II pulmonary atresia was the most frequent pattern seen in 127/177 (71.8%). Based on McGoon's ratio, pulmonary arteries were adequate for surgery in 123/177 (69.5%) patients. Patent arterial duct was present in 84/177 (47.5%) patients while MAPCAs were present in 124 (70.1%) patients, of which 72/124 (58.1%) patients had at least 1 essential MAPCA supplying either lung. According to Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society classification, type B pulmonary arterial anatomy was the most prevalent, seen in 103/177 (57.6%) patients. Conclusion. TOF-PA is associated with marked morphologic variability in the pulmonary arterial arborization to supply the lungs. Cardiac CT angiography can accurately delineate the pulmonary arterial morphology, sources of pulmonary blood supply, and associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with TOF-PA which aids in planning appropriate surgical management including decisions regarding the need for unifocalization of MAPCAs.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is an increasingly common neurodegenerative condition, which causes movement dysfunction and a broad range of non-motor symptoms. There is no molecular or biochemical diagnosis test for PD. The miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs and are extensively studied owing to their altered expression in pathological states and facile harvesting and analysis techniques. Methods: A total of 48 samples (16 each of PD, aged-matched, and young controls) were recruited. The small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) were isolated and validated using Western blot, transmission electron microscope, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Small RNA isolation, library preparation, and small RNA sequencing followed by differential expression and targeted prediction of miRNA were performed. The real-time PCR was performed with the targeted miRNA on PD, age-matched, and young healthy control of plasma and plasma-derived sEVs to demonstrate their potential as a diagnostic biomarker. Results: In RNA sequencing, we identified 14.89% upregulated (fold change 1.11 to 11.04, p < 0.05) and 16.54% downregulated (fold change -1.04 to -7.28, p < 0.05) miRNAs in PD and controls. Four differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-23b-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-150-3p) were selected. The expression of miR-23b-3p was "upregulated" (p = 0.002) in plasma, whereas "downregulated" (p = 0.0284) in plasma-derived sEVs in PD than age-matched controls. The ROC analysis of miR-23b-3p revealed better AUC values in plasma (AUC = 0.8086, p = 0.0029) and plasma-derived sEVs (AUC = 0.7278, p = 0.0483) of PD and age-matched controls. Conclusion: We observed an opposite expression profile of miR-23b-3p in PD and age-matched healthy control in plasma and plasma-derived sEV fractions, where the expression of miR-23b-3p is increased in PD plasma while decreased in plasma-derived sEV fractions. We further observed the different miR-23b-3p expression profiles in young and age-matched healthy control.

AB  - PURPOSE: The global cervical cancer burden is disproportionately high in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and outcomes can be governed by the accessibility of appropriate screening and treatment. High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a central role in cervical cancer treatment, improving local control and overall survival. The American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) and Indian Brachytherapy Society (IBS) collaborated to provide this succinct consensus statement guiding the establishment of brachytherapy programs for gynecological malignancies in resource-limited settings.METHODS AND MATERIALS: ABS and IBS members with expertise in brachytherapy formulated this consensus statement based on their collective clinical experience in LMICs with varying levels of resources.RESULTS: The ABS and IBS strongly encourage the establishment of HDR brachytherapy programs for the treatment of gynecological malignancies. With the consideration of resource variability in LMICs, we present 15 minimum component requirements for the establishment of such programs. Guidance on these components, including discussion of what is considered to be essential and what is considered to be optimal, is provided.CONCLUSIONS: This ABS/IBS consensus statement can guide the successful and safe establishment of HDR brachytherapy programs for gynecological malignancies in LMICs with varying levels of resources.(c) 2023 American Brachytherapy Society.

AB  - ObjectiveSkeletal metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients are associated with poor prognosis. The objective was to determine the maximum I-131 cumulative activity that could be safely administered without compromising efficacy. The secondary objective was to identify other prognostic factors affecting survival outcomes.Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective cohort study done at a tertiary-care institution comprising of data from January 1990-June 2020. 489 DTC patients having skeletal metastases with >= 12 months follow-up were included. Ninety-six percent of patients had thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy for skeletal metastases. All patients were on oral suppressive levothyroxine tablets. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors were used whenever indicated. The main outcome measures were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse-events.ResultsThere were 347 (71%) females and 324 (66%) had follicular carcinoma thyroid. Median follow-up was 78 (interquartile range, IQR: 37-153) months. 333 patients (68%) received <= 37GBq I-131 cumulative activity (group 1) and 156 patients (32%) received >37GBq cumulative RAI activity (group 2). Overall median OS and PFS were 74 (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.2-85.8) and 48 (95%CI: 40.5-55.4) months, respectively. The 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year estimated overall survival probabilities were 55.7%, 28.4%, 14% and 8.3%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age(<55years) (p<0.001), female gender(p = 0.01), cumulative I-131 activity >37GBq (p<0.001) and EBRT(p = 0.001) were favourably associated with OS; no factors were significantly associated with PFS. The median OS for groups 1 & 2 were 51 versus 90 months (p<0.001) & median PFS for groups 1 & 2 were 45 versus 53 months respectively (p = 0.9). However, cumulative activity >37GBq resulted in more adverse events (2.4%), particularly bone marrow suppression (3.5%).ConclusionFor better survival outcomes, cumulative I-131 activity upto 37GBq could be administered with acceptable toxicity to DTC patients with skeletal metastases.

AB  - Statement of problem. Knowledge of the effect of a shortened dental arch on masseter muscle thickness and occlusal force is sparse but could help clinicians understand how a shortened dental arch might affect the stomatognathic system. Purpose. The purpose of this pilot clinical study was to evaluate and compare the masseter muscle thickness and occlusal force of participants rehabilitated by using a shortened dental arch with matched completely dentate individuals.Material and methods. Twelve partially edentulous participants with a minimum of 1 posterior occluding pair on each side of the arch were enrolled in the study. The mandibular arch of these participants was rehabilitated by using a single posterior mandibular implant crown (group S). The maxillary arch of all participants in group S was intact. Masseter muscle thickness (cm) and occlusal force (N) were recorded before (T1) and 6 months after implant rehabilitation (T2) for each participant. Twelve participants were selected as controls (group C). They were matched for age, sex, height, and weight with group S and evaluated for masseter muscle thickness and occlusal force. Masseter muscle thickness was evaluated by using ultrasonography during the rest position and maximum volumetric clenching. Occlusal force was measured with an occlusal force measuring appliance. All recordings were done for the left and right sides of the arch. Descriptive analysis was followed by comparison between groups and within group S by using the paired t test (a=.05).Results. Higher masseter muscle thickness and higher occlusal force were observed in group C than in group S before and after rehabilitation. An increase in masseter muscle thickness in the rest position and in maximum volumetric clenching was observed within group S after rehabilitation. Before rehabilitation, a difference in the masseter muscle thickness between group S and group C was statistically significant for the left side at the rest position (P=.017) and during maximum volumetric clenching (P=.016). After rehabilitation, the difference between group S and group C was not statistically significant for masseter muscle thickness at the rest position (P=.890 for right side and P=.555 for left side) and during maximum volumetric clenching (P=.109 for right side and P=.755 for left side). The difference in occlusal force between group S and group C was statistically significant for the right side and left side (P<.001) before rehabilitation and statistically not significant after rehabilitation (P=.161 for the right side and P=.134 for the left side).Conclusions. Rehabilitation following the concept of a shortened dental arch increased masseter muscle thickness and occlusal force in partially edentulous individuals, making the masseter muscle thickness and occlusal force comparable with those of a completely dentate arch.

AB  - Introduction: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant health issue affecting males globally and is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality in males. Diet and physical activity can affect the possibility of getting PCa. Traditional plant-derived compounds and natural products have demonstrated promising effects against PCa in clinical settings. These natural products possess various antitumour qualities and have shown to be safe, inexpensive, and well-tolerated.Objective: The objective of this review is to thoroughly assess and describe the most recent studies on natural products and their multifunctional roles in PCa therapy methods. In order to evaluate the efficiency and safety of these natural compounds in clinical settings, it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, identify prospective molecular targets, and regulatory molecules.Methodology: In 2023, our team conducted thorough searches across multiple databases for studies published from 1990 to 2023, with a major emphasis on 2010-2023, using specific keywords and headings related to natural products and PCa. We included relevant older studies published as early as 2000. Original articles and review papers were included as part of the criteria.Result: The results showed that natural compounds, plant extracts, nutraceuticals, and marine products hold great potential as therapeutic approaches for PCa. Compounds like quercetin, fisetin, genistein, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, ginsenosides, silymarin, berberine, celastrol, and honokiol have shown inhibitory effects on the androgen receptor axis, similar to synthetic drugs. Additionally, compounds such as quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, curcumin, sulforaphane, and genistein have demonstrated promise in targeting PCa stem cells. Nutraceuticals like green tea, legumes rich in phytoestrogens, tomatoes with lycopene, buckwheat con-taining quercetin, and guava rich in phytochemicals have exhibited antiprostate cancer effects by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and displaying antioxidant properties. Moreover, marine products, including compounds like discorhabdin C, 1386A, frondoside A, and marinomycin A, have displayed potent anticancer activity against PCa cells by triggering apoptosis and exhibiting cytotoxic properties.Conclusions: These findings highlight the promising role of natural compounds, plant extracts, nutraceuticals, and marine products in developing innovative therapeutic strategies for PCa. However, further research is needed to better understand their mechanisms of action, evaluate their efficacy and safety in clinical settings, and determine optimal dosages and treatment regimens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability of high-definition (HD) videobronchoscopy to detect airway involvement in sarcoidosis has not been evaluated previously.RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the role of HD videobronchoscopy in the identification of sarcoidosis-associated airway abnormalities (AAs)? What are the patterns of AAs more commonly observed and more frequently associated with the detection of granulomas in endobronchial biopsy (EBB)?STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective international multicenter cohort study, consecutive patients with suspected sarcoidosis underwent airway inspection with an HD videobronchoscope and EBB using a standardized workflow. AAs were classified according to six patterns defined a priori: nodularity, cobblestoning, thickening, plaque, increased vascularity, and miscellaneous. We assessed diagnostic yield of EBB, prevalence of AAs, and interobserver agreement for different patterns of AAs. RESULTS: AAs were identified in 64 of 134 patients with sarcoidosis (47.8%), with nodularity (n = 23 [17.2%]), plaque (n = 19 [14.2%]), and increased vascularity (n = 19 [14.2%]) being the most prevalent. The diagnostic yield of EBB was 36.6%. AAs were significantly more prevalent in patients with than in those without nonnecrotizing granulomas on EBB (67.4% vs 36.5%; P = .001). Likewise, parenchymal disease on CT scan imaging was signifi- cantly more common in patients with than in those without nonnecrotizing granulomas on EBB (79.6% vs 54.1%; P = .003). On a per-lesion analysis, nonnecrotizing granulomas were seen especially in EBB samples obtained from areas of cobblestoning (9/10 [90%]) and nod-ularity (17/29 [58.6%]). The overall diagnostic yield of random EBB was low (31/134 [23.1%]). The interobserver agreement for the different patterns of AA was fair (Fleiss k = 0.34).INTERPRETATION: In a population with a large prevalence of White Europeans, HD video-bronchoscopy detected AAs in approximately one-half of patients with sarcoidosis. The diagnostic yield of EBB was higher in patients with parenchymal involvement on CT scan imaging and in those with AAs, especially if manifesting as cobblestoning and nodularity.TRIAL REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT4743596; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov

KW  - MEDIAL TRANSPOSITION
AB  - Objective: To quantify changes in ductions following nasal transposition of the split lateral rectus muscle (NTSLR) for treating third nerve palsy.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Participants: A single eye from each patient with third nerve palsy treated with NTSLR with ocular motility measurements.
   Methods: Observation of changes in pre- and postoperative ductions. Outcome measures including patient demographic and surgical factors associated with the ability to adduct beyond the midline after NTSLR were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: A total of 116 patients met the inclusion criteria for this study. The NTSLR significantly decreased abduction (median of 0 limitation [interquartile range (IQR), 0-0] prior to surgery to -4 [IQR, -4 to -3] after NTSLR; p < 0.001), with a corresponding improvement in adduction (median, -5 [IQR, -5 to -4] prior to surgery to -4 [IQR, -4 to -3] after NTSLR; p < 0.001). There was no change in median supraduction or infraduction after NTSLR (p > 0.05). The ability to adduct beyond the midline after NTSLR was demonstrated in 42% of patients. Although not statistically significant, a trend toward a postoperative ability to adduct beyond the midline was seen in patients who had concurrent superior oblique muscle tenotomy (odds ratio [OR] = 5.08; 95% CI, 0.91-40.9) or who were designated with partial rather than complete third nerve palsy (OR = 2.29; 95% CI, 0.82-6.70).
   Conclusions: NTSLR improves the horizontal midline positioning of eyes with third nerve palsy. Most eyes lose the ability to abduct, but some regain a modest ability to adduct while vertical ductions remain unchanged.

AB  - Introduction: Antenatal care (ANC) is crucial for ensuring positive maternal and perinatal outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has released comprehensive guidelines on ANC with the aim of providing a "positive pregnancy experience". While mobile health (mHealth) technology shows immense potential in improving healthcare services, evidence of its effectiveness remains limited.Objectives: This study aimed to develop a mobile application aligned with the WHO antenatal care model and follow a group of antenatal women using that and compare it to the conventional care provided.Methods: A prospective open-label study was carried out at three health centers, where patients with singleton/ twin pregnancies and access to smartphones were recruited after obtaining informed consent. The study group was followed using the mobile application, while the control group received conventional care. A recall-based questionnaire was used to assess the content of care, including comprehensive history, examination, and patient counselling. Patient satisfaction and the feasibility of using the application were also evaluated.Results: A total of 85 patients in the study group and 73 controls were followed until delivery. Baseline demographic details were comparable, while the number of antenatal visits were higher in the intervention group. Patients in the study group had significantly higher mean scores compared to the controls in terms of comprehensive history (8.26 +/- 2.26 vs 3.58 +/- 2.30; p < 0.001), physical examination (4.26 +/- 1.03 vs 3.66 +/- 1.09; p = 0.001) and patient counselling (6.09 +/- 1.65 vs 4.33 +/- 1.69; p < 0.001). Among the recommended investigations, a hemogram (100 % vs 93.2 %; p = 0.02) and ultrasound prior to 24 weeks (89.4 % vs 56.2 %; p < 0.001) were carried out in a larger number of patients in the study group. Patient satisfaction scores, calculated using the PreMAPeQ questionnaire, were higher in the intervention group.Conclusion: This study highlights the effectiveness of an m-health application in enhancing the quality of antenatal care and facilitating standardized ANC visits. Further research is necessary to establish mHealth technology as a cost-effective intervention in this area.

AB  - Objective. Surgical innovation led to an endoscopic-assisted intraoral approach for managing condyle fractures. The purpose of this systematic review is to purview the role of the endoscope and determine the range of information, summarizing the evidence for the benefit of surgeons on an endoscopic-assisted intraoral approach. Study Design. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases for studies mentioning the endoscopic intraoral approach for managing mandibular condylar fractures. Outcomes include the role of the endoscope, challenges, adjunct armamentarium, duration, and complications associated with the transoral and transbuccal approach for screw fixation. The meta-analysis was conducted with prevalence estimates and standardized means using Results. Thirty-nine studies were included. A 30 angulated, 4-mm-thick endoscope was the most commonly used endoscope. Two mini plates were most commonly used for fixation. Facial nerve weakness was higher in the transbuccal approach (1.24%) than in the transoral approach (0.8%). Pooled analysis (6 studies) showed that the duration of the surgical procedure was less in the transoral approach compared with the transbuccal approach for screw fixation. The bailout was 1.49%. Conclusions. The endoscopic-assisted intraoral approach is reliable for condylar fracture management. The transoral and transbuccal approaches can be used for screw fixation with comparable outcomes.

TI  - Assessment of CT perfusion indices of the clinicoradiological response to anti-tubercular therapy in patients with intestinal tuberculosis
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
KW  - PET/CT
AB  - AIM: To explore the possibility of using a novel technique, CT perfusion imaging, to monitor the response to anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) in patients with intestinal tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in adults with treatment naiveintestinal tuberculosis. Clinical, endoscopic, and conventional radiological findings of patients were compared at baseline and post-ATT. CT perfusion imaging was performed with recording of six perfusion parameters (blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time, time to peak, maximum peak intensity, and permeability/blood flow extraction).RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (13 women, 59%) with a median age of 25 years were recruited. The terminal ileum and ileocaecal junction were the most frequent sites of involvement (59%), with multiple segments of the intestine being involved in 16 patients (73%). Median duration of ATT was 6 months (range 6-10 months). Complete clinical response was observed in 22/22 (100%) patients, endoscopic response in 12/12 (100%) patients, and radiological response in 10/13 (76%) patients. There was a significant decrease in mean blood flow, blood volume, maximum peak intensity, and an increase in mean transit time and time to peak on follow-up CT perfusion imaging performed after 6 months of ATT.CONCLUSION: Significant alterations in CT perfusion parameters were demonstrated following treatment, consistent with a decline in inflammation and vascularity. CT perfusion imaging of the bowel is a novel means to assess the radiological response to ATT in intestinal tuberculosis, although at the cost of a higher dose of radiation exposure.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal College of Radiologists.

AB  - Purpose Population-based prevalence surveys are essential for decision-making on interventions to achieve trachoma elimination as a public health problem. This paper outlines the methodologies of Tropical Data, which supports work to undertake those surveys.Methods Tropical Data is a consortium of partners that supports health ministries worldwide to conduct globally standardised prevalence surveys that conform to World Health Organization recommendations. Founding principles are health ministry ownership, partnership and collaboration, and quality assurance and quality control at every step of the survey process. Support covers survey planning, survey design, training, electronic data collection and fieldwork, and data management, analysis and dissemination. Methods are adapted to meet local context and needs. Customisations, operational research and integration of other diseases into routine trachoma surveys have also been supported.Results Between 29th February 2016 and 24th April 2023, 3373 trachoma surveys across 50 countries have been supported, resulting in 10,818,502 people being examined for trachoma.Conclusion This health ministry-led, standardised approach, with support from the start to the end of the survey process, has helped all trachoma elimination stakeholders to know where interventions are needed, where interventions can be stopped, and when elimination as a public health problem has been achieved. Flexibility to meet specific country contexts, adaptation to changes in global guidance and adjustments in response to user feedback have facilitated innovation in evidence-based methodologies, and supported health ministries to strive for global disease control targets.

AB  - Background Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have a higher risk of developing other malignancies (OMs) compared to the general population. However, the impact of CLL-related risk factors and CLL-directed treatment is still unclear and represents the focus of this work.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective international multicenter study to assess the incidence of OMs and detect potential risk factors in 19,705 patients with CLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or high-count CLL-like monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, diagnosed between 2000 and 2016. Data collection took place between October 2020 and March 2022.
   Findings In 129,254 years of follow-up after CLL diagnosis, 3513 OMs were diagnosed (27.2 OMs/1000 person-years). The most common hematological OMs were Richter transformation, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Non-melanoma skin (NMSC) and prostate cancers were the most common solid tumors (STs).
   The only predictor for MDS and AML development was treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with/without rituximab (FC +/- R) (OR = 3.7; 95% CI = 2.79-4.91; p < 0.001). STs were more frequent in males and patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable genes (OR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.49-2.11; p < 0.001/OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.6-2.24; p < 0.001).
   CLL-directed treatment was associated with non-melanoma skin and prostate cancers (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.36-2.41; p < 0.001/OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.12-3.97; p = 0.021). In contrast, breast cancers were more frequent in untreated patients (OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.08-0.33; p < 0.001).
   Patients with CLL and an OM had inferior overall survival (OS) than those without. AML and MDS conferred the worst OS (p < 0.001).
   Interpretation OMs in CLL impact on OS. Treatment for CLL increased the risk for AML/MDS, prostate cancer, and NMSC. FCR was associated with increased risk for AML/MDS.

AB  - Background: Whether coeliac disease in adults can be diagnosed with serology alone remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of serum anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.Methods: In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, adult participants (aged >= 18 years) with suspected coeliac disease without IgA deficiency who were not on a gluten-free diet and who had a local serum tTG-IgA measurement, were enrolled from Feb 27, 2018, to Dec 24, 2020, by 14 tertiary referral centres (ten from Europe, two from Asia, one from Oceania, and one from South America) to undergo local endoscopic duodenal biopsy. Local serum tTG-IgA was measured with 14 different test brands and concentration expressed as a multiple of each test's upper limit of normal (ULN), and defined as positive when greater than 1 times the ULN. The main study outcome was the reliability of serum tests for the diagnosis of coeliac disease, as defined by duodenal villous atrophy (Marsh type 3 or Corazza-Villanacci grade B). Histology was evaluated by the local pathologist, with discordant cases (positive tTG-IgA without duodenal villous atrophy or negative tTG-IgA with duodenal villous atrophy) re-evaluated by a central pathologist. The reliability of serum tests for the prediction of duodenal villous atrophy was evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for categorical and continuous data.Findings: We enrolled 436 participants with complete local data on serum tTG-IgA and duodenal histology (296 [68%] women and 140 [32%] men; mean age 40 years [SD 15]). Positive serum tTG-IgA was detected in 363 (83%) participants and negative serum tTG-IgA in 73 (17%). Of the 363 participants with positive serum tTG-IgA, 341 had positive histology (true positives) and 22 had negative histology (false positives) after local review. Of the 73 participants with negative serum tTG-IgA, seven had positive histology (false negatives) and 66 had negative histology (true negatives) after local review. The positive predictive value was 93<middle dot>9% (95% CI 89<middle dot>2-98<middle dot>6), the negative predictive value was 90<middle dot>4% (85<middle dot>5-95<middle dot>3), sensitivity was 98<middle dot>0% (95<middle dot>3-100<middle dot>0), and specificity was 75<middle dot>0% (66<middle dot>6-83<middle dot>4). After central re-evaluation of duodenal histology in 29 discordant cases, there were 348 true positive cases, 15 false positive cases, 66 true negative cases, and seven false negative cases, resulting in a positive predictive value of 95<middle dot>9% (92<middle dot>0-99<middle dot>8), a negative predictive value of 90<middle dot>4% (85<middle dot>5-95<middle dot>3), a sensitivity of 98<middle dot>0% (95<middle dot>3-100<middle dot>0), and a specificity of 81<middle dot>5% (73<middle dot>9-89<middle dot>1). Either using the local or central definition of duodenal histology, the positive predictive value of local serum tTG-IgA increased when the serological threshold was defined at increasing multiples of the ULN (p<0<middle dot>0001). The AUC for serum tTG-IgA for the prediction of duodenal villous atrophy was 0<middle dot>87 (95% CI 0<middle dot>81-0<middle dot>92) when applying the categorical definition of serum tTG-IgA (positive [>1 x ULN] vs negative [<= 1 x ULN]), and 0<middle dot>93 (0<middle dot>89-0<middle dot>96) when applying the numerical definition of serum tTG-IgA (multiples of the ULN).
   Additional endoscopic findings included peptic gastritis (nine patients), autoimmune atrophic gastritis (three), reflux oesophagitis (31), gastric or duodenal ulcer (three), and Barrett's oesophagus (one). In the 1-year follow-up, a midgut ileum lymphoma was diagnosed in a woman on a gluten-free diet.Interpretation: Our data showed that biopsy could be reasonably avoided in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in adults with reliable suspicion of coeliac disease and high serum tTG-IgA.Funding None.Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Desmoid tumours of the brachial plexus are rare locally infiltrative aggressive, monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferations characterized by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course. Only 21 patients have been reported in the literature. We add another one, and report function-preserving surgery in a 34-year-old man with a desmoid tumour of the brachial plexus. The patient presented with paraesthesia and gradually progressive distal muscle weakness in the left upper limb. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed preganglionic changes in imaging showed an enhancing mass with irregular margins in the left paravertebral region encasing the subclavian artery, pre- and post-ganglionic C6-D1 nerve roots and trunks of the brachial plexus. Using an anterior transclavicular approach the tumour was decompressed, which led to a major improvement in paraesthesia and partial motor recovery. He was doing well at 6 months of follow-up. Histopathological examination showed findings consistent with desmoid tumour. A tailored multidisciplinary surgical approach, with the aim to preserve function over radiological clearance, is an jeopardizing the quality of life.

AB  - The human monkeypox (mpox) virus is an orthopox virus that can be transmitted to humans. Though the disease has been endemic in Africa, the recent mpox outbreak since May 2022. We attempted to examine differences between the endemic form of mpox and the current outbreak. Review of electronic medical database with relevant keywords. The current outbreak of mpox has disproportionately impacted the gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) community. This is also the first time that widespread semen testing has turned up evidence of mpox viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Cases in the present outbreak are more likely to affect adults, involve the genitalia, and have no prodrome. Close diagnostic differentials include varicella and hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease is usually self-limiting; though secondary infections, anorectal pain, pharyngitis, ocular lesions and rarely, renal injury and myocarditis may occur. This review focuses primarily on the novel clinical characteristics and emerging sexual transmission route of the mpox virus, which, although unconfirmed, appears extremely likely as the route of spread. Dermatologists have an important role in this health emergency, as early diagnosis can cause a significant reduction in disease transmission.

AB  - Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the second most common muscular dystrophy in adults, and it is associated with local D4Z4 chromatin relaxation, mostly via the contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array on chromosome 4q35. In this study, we aimed to investigate the use of Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) as a diagnostic tool for testing FSHD cases from the UK and India and to compare OGM performance with that of traditional techniques such as linear gel (LGE) and Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) Southern blotting (SB). A total of 6 confirmed and 19 suspected FSHD samples were processed with LGE and PFGE, respectively. The same samples were run using a Saphyr Genome-Imaging Instrument (1-color), and the data were analysed using custom EnFocus FSHD analysis. OGM was able to confirm the diagnosis of FSHD1 in all FSHD1 cases positive for SB (n = 17), and D4Z4 sizing highly correlated with PFGE-SB (p < 0.001). OGM correctly identified cases with mosaicism for the repeat array contraction (n = 2) and with a duplication of the D4Z4 repeat array. OGM is a promising new technology able to unravel structural variants in the genome and seems to be a valid tool for diagnosing FSHD1.

AB  - ObjectiveTo socio-culturally adapt and validate a Hindi language version of Ages and Stages Qustionnaire (ASQ-3) in Indian children aged 2-24 months.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary-care center between March, 2017 and April, 2019, children "at-risk" for developmental delay of either gender aged 2-24 months. Socio-cultural adaptation was done through interaction among 37 subject experts followed by validation. [After piloting in 20 children, modified ASQ-3 was validated in 568 at-risk children (4 age-groups: 2-7, 7-13, 13-19 and 19-24 months). Validation was done against Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants (DASII).ResultsAfter screening 654 children, 568 were enrolled. Among these, 420 had developmental delay on DASII while 18 failed to be identified on ASQ-3 (4.3%). Overall sensitivity and specificity of Hindi language Indian-adaptation of ASQ-3 in detecting developmental delay were 95.9% (95%CI: 93.6%-97.5%) and 81.7% (95%CI: 74%-87.9%), respectively with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 94.6% (95%CI: 92%-96.5%) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 85.6% (95%CI: 78.2%-92.2%). The sensitivity and specificity for motor delay were 96.1% (93.8%-97.7%) and 92.4% (86.4%-96.3%) [PPV: 97.7% (95.8%-98.9%); NPV: 87.7% (81%-92.7%)]. Sensitivity and specificity for mental delay were 95.5% (93.1%-97.2%) and 95.3% (90.1%-98.3%) [PPV: 98.6% (97%-99.5%); NPV: 85.9% (79.1%-91.2%)].ConclusionThe Hindi language Indian-adaptation of ASQ-3 had good psychometric properties with high sensitivity for developmental delay (95.9%), mental delay (95.5%), and motor delay (96.1%), suggesting it to be a good screening tool for neurodevelopmental delay.

AB  - Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder whose underlying pathophysiology is insufficiently understood. The pathophysiology of OCD may be related to abnormalities in the biochemistry of neurotransmitters.Aim: The aim of the present study was to measure the absolute concentration of various metabolites in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and caudate nucleus (CN) in treatment-naive patients with OCD and compare it with healthy controls (HCs).Methods: The present study investigated the metabolic profile of two brain regions, namely right DLPFC and CN, by using single voxel in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) in drug-naive patients with OCD (n = 17, mean age = 30.71 +/- 10.104 years) and compared it with healthy controls (n = 13, mean age = 30.77 +/- 5.449 years). The patients with OCD were recruited after appropriate psychometric assessments. The H-1-MRS experiments were performed using the 3 Tesla (3T) human MR scanner, and absolute concentrations of metabolites were estimated using the LC model.Results: Significantly lower concentration of tNAA in the right DLPFC was observed in the patients with OCD compared to the controls, which may be indicative of neurodegeneration in this region. However, no significant differences were observed in the concentrations of the metabolites between the patients and controls in the CN region. The level of tNAA in DLPFC significantly correlated with the disability level (WHO-DAS) of the patients.Conclusions: The present study demonstrates abnormalities in the metabolic profile of an important region, DLPFC of the CSTC circuit, which is suggestive of neurodegeneration in the region in OCD patients.

AB  - Background: Circumferential subcuticular wound approximation (CSWA) of round shaped skin wounds after ileostomy take down is believed to lower the rates of surgical site infection (SSI). We performed this randomized trial to compare the rates of SSI and other short-term outcomes among primary linear skin closure (PC) and CSWA groups of patients.Patients and Methods: All patients undergoing ileostomy reversal during the study period were randomly assigned to either PC or CSWA. The primary outcome was the incidence of SSI as assessed by ASEPSIS scoring system. The secondary outcomes included healing time, length of post-operative hospital stay, and patients' satisfaction regarding cosmetic outcome, expectations, pain, time of healing, wound care, and activity on a five-point Likert scale.Results: Thirty-one patients (PC = 15; CSWA = 16) underwent ileostomy reversal during the study period. There was no SSI in the PC group whereas three patients developed SSI in the CSWA group but the result was not statistically significant (p = 0.23). The scores for time of healing (p < 0.001), wound care (p = 0.007), and activity (p < 0.001) were significantly better for PC compared with CSWA whereas there was no significant difference in the scores for cosmetic outcome, expectations, and pain. Healing time was shorter in the PC group (6.7 vs. 34.2 days; p < 0.001) whereas the post-operative length of stay was comparable (6.3 vs. 7 days; p = 0.27).Conclusions: Although there was no difference in the incidence of SSI among the two groups, the PC group fared better in terms of mean time to healing and requirement of wound care.

AB  - Background: Radiocontrast administration during interventional neuroradiology (INR) procedures for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) can add to renal insult. Serum creatinine (sCr) is a conventional marker of acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (sNGAL) is a novel marker which is increasingly used to predict renal injury in susceptible patients. Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate correlation between serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and sCr in aSAH patients undergoing therapeutic or diagnostic INR procedures. The secondary aim was to find the incidence of contrast-induced AKI and hemodynamic complications during the study period. Material and Methods: All consenting aSAH patients (18-60 years, Modified Hunt and Hess grade 1-4) posted for INR procedures during the study time were included. Patients with history of chronic renal disease, recent contrast exposure, or renal insufficiency were excluded. Blood samples for sCr and sNGAL were obtained preprocedure and then at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h after contrast administration. Hourly urine output was noted. AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. Statistical Analysis Used: Repeated measurement analysis of variance, Posthoc Bonferroni test and Pearson correlation coefficient test. Results: Fifty patients, mean age 47.34 +/- 9.31 years, were enrolled for the study. Majority (48; 96%) were Hunt and Hess (H and H) grade I-III. The mean volume of contrast administered was 123.2 +/- 53.08 mL. The mean sNGAL and sCr values at pre-op, 1, 6, 24, and 48 h were 124.99 +/- 64.58, 148.40 +/- 77.90, 147.33 +/- 76.00, 125.49 +/- 64.44, and 116.38 +/- 61.79 ng/mL and 0.629 +/- 0.23, 0.624 +/- 0.22, 0.612 +/- 0.21, 0.632 +/- 0.19, and 0.577 +/- 0.22 mg/dL, respectively. There was a correlation in sCr and sNGAL value (P < 0.001) at all study time points. However, no specific pattern was seen. No patient developed any AKI or hemodynamic complications in first 48 h. Conclusions: There is a correlation between serum NGAL and sCr at individual time points. NGAL may represent a sensitive early biomarker of renal impairment after INR Procedures. There was no incidence of AKI after contrast administration in aSAH patients without predisposing renal risk factors.

AB  - A significant number of patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) are refractory to first-line drugs and require interruption of the pain pathway by various percutaneous procedures. One such percutaneous technique involves an injection of absolute alcohol (AA) into the peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve. This procedure is useful in elderly and medically compromised drug-refractory cases of TGN who are not interested in undergoing open neurosurgery. Peripheral neurolysis with AA is easy, quick, and safe. It may be carried out in the outpatient department; however, its use is not free from complications. Here, we report four such patients who were complicated with local necrosis and ulceration following administration of AA. The most probable attributable etiologies are sympathetic nerve involvement, intravascular injection of alcohol, vascular spasm of the terminal arteries, distal micro-emboli effect, and faulty technique, including repeated injections.

AB  - Procedural dermatology includes invasive conventional dermatologic surgeries which involve significant use of knife and suture, minimally invasive procedures and device-based procedures. Device-based procedures are the easiest to learn and are less prone to human errors due to automation but can lead to monotony, while conventional surgeries require significant skill, craftsmanship and interest. There has been a recent shift in the approach to procedural dermatology as a therapeutic option with complementary and combination models replacing the conventional hierarchical model in which procedures were last in the step-ladder approach. The demand for both conventional dermatologic surgeries and minimally invasive cosmetic procedures is increasing. Unfortunately, this demand has not been met with adequate supply. Consequently, the number of trained professionals with expertise in these procedures is very limited; they are far outnumbered by unqualified practitioners. A limited number of dermatologic surgeons practicing conventional surgeries has resulted in huge waiting lists for vitiligo surgeries, inappropriate excisions for skin cancers and poor cosmetic outcomes of excisions without proper knowledge of flaps and grafts. Increasingly procedures are being performed by inadequately trained personnel, resulting in complications. There is also an absence of good quality research on the subject of procedural dermatology, which has resulted in a lack of standardisation of various procedures and knowledge about the efficacy of various drug-procedure and procedure-procedure combinations. An increasing variety of gimmicky but costly procedures are being offered to the public without much evidence of efficacy. Individual institutional and broad policy directives are needed to address these issues. Special emphasis is required on formal hands-on procedural dermatology training during residency and beyond it.

AB  - Significant progress has been achieved in the realm of therapeutic interventions for multiple myeloma (MM), leading to transformative shifts in its clinical management. While conventional modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have improved the clinical outcomes, the overarching challenge of effecting a comprehensive cure for patients afflicted with relapsed and refractory MM (RRMM) endures. Notably, adoptive cellular therapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, has exhibited efficacy in patients with refractory or resistant B-cell malignancies and is now also being tested in patients with MM. Within this context, the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has emerged as a promising candidate for CAR-T-cell antigen targeting in MM. Alternative targets include SLAMF7, CD38, CD19, the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule CS1, NKG2D, and CD138. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of these CAR-T-cell therapies, although longitudinal follow-up reveals some degree of antigenic escape. The widespread implementation of CAR-T-cell therapy is encumbered by several barriers, including antigenic evasion, uneven intratumoral infiltration in solid cancers, cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, logistical implementation, and financial burden. This article provides an overview of CAR-T-cell therapy in MM and the utilization of BCMA as the target antigen, as well as an overview of other potential target moieties.

AB  - Metabolic pathways and proteins responsible for maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis in the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified and functionally characterized a novel OPA3-like domain-containing protein in P. falciparum (PfOPA3). We show that PfOPA3 is expressed in the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite and localizes to the mitochondria. Inducible knock-down of PfOPA3 using GlmS ribozyme hindered the normal intraerythrocytic cycle of the parasites; specifically, PfOPA3-iKD disrupted parasite development as well as parasite division and segregation at schizont stages, which resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of merozoites progenies. Parasites lacking PfOPA3 show severe defects in the development of functional mitochondria; the mitochondria showed reduced activity of mtETC but not ATP synthesis, as evidenced by reduced activity of complex III of the mtETC, and increased sensitivity for drugs targeting DHODH as well as complex III, but not to the drugs targeting complex V. Further, PfOPA3 downregulation leads to reduction in the level of mitochondrial proton transport uncoupling protein (PfUCP) to compensate reduced activity of complex III and maintain proton efflux across the inner membrane. The reduced activity of DHODH, which is responsible for pyrimidine biosynthesis required for nuclear DNA synthesis, resulted in a significant reduction in parasite nuclear division and generation of progeny. In conclusion, we show that PfOPA3 is essential for the functioning of mtETC and homeostasis required for the development of functional mitochondria as well as for parasite segregation, and thus PfOPA3 is crucial for parasite survival during blood stages.

AB  - The emergence of resistance to anti-infective agents poses a significant threat to successfully treating infections caused by bacteria. Bacteria acquire random mutations due to exposure to environmental stresses, which may increase their fitness to other selection pressures. Interestingly, for bacteria, the frequency of anti-microbial resistance (AMR) seems to be increasing in tandem with the human lifespan. Based on evidence from previous literature, we speculate that increased levels of free radicals (Reactive Oxygen Species-ROS and Reactive Nitrosative Species-RNS), elevated inflammation, and the altered tissue microenvironment in aged individuals may drive pathogen mutagenesis. If these mutations result in the hyperactivation of efflux pumps or alteration in drug target binding sites, it could confer AMR, thus rendering antibiotic therapy ineffective while leading to the selection of novel drug-resistant variants.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate by in vivo lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT imaging, the lymphatic drainage patterns of para-nasal sinus (PNS) tumours. To confirm or refute the belief of the retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) being the significant draining lymph node for such tumours. Methods: Prospective cohort study conducted on previously untreated PNS tumours with no clinicoradiological evidence of lymph node metastasis. Lymphoscintigraphy undertaken by nasal endoscopic assisted peritumoral injection of 99mTc sulphur colloid. Injections were classified as anterior or posterior as per a vertical line along the maxillary sinus ostium. Results: Seventeen patients were included. Lymphoscintigraphy successfully identified 17 sentinel nodes in 15 patients and was unsuccessful (lymphoscintigraphy failure) in 2 patients. Predominant sites of sentinel lymphatic drainage were noted to be the RPLN (n = 8; 47%) and level I (n = 7; 42%). Occasional drainage was identified at the peri-parotid node (n = 1) and at level II (n = 1). Contralateral drainage was noted in 2 patients (level I-1 and RPLN-1). Anterior injections drained predominantly to level I (6/8) and RPLN (2/8), while posterior injections drai-ned predominantly to the RPLN (6/7). The relative risk of RPLN being identified as the sentinel node was significantly higher for posteriorly placed injections than for anteriorly placed injections (RR: 3.43; 95% CI: 1.0-11.8; P=.05). Conclusion: The RPLN is noted as a frequent draining node for sino-nasal tumours and merits routine attention in all sino-nasal tumours. The radio-colloid SPECT-CT technique described here offers an exce-llent in vivo technique to further explore and validate the lymphatic drainage pathways of these tumours.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of Ocimum sanctum hydroalcoholic extract (OSHE) on seizure control and neuronal injury in rats with lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Methods: SE was induced by administering lithium chloride followed by pilocarpine 24 h later. OSHE was administered either alone or in combination with valproate (VPA) 3 days before SE induction until 14 days post-SE induction. Seizure parameters were recorded on day 1 (0-3 h), day 1-3 and day 4-14 post-SE. On day 14 post-SE, neurobehavioural tests (elevated plus maze and passive avoidance) were done followed by total antioxidant capacity, neuron-specific enolase, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopic assessment in the hippocampus and cortex tissue. Results: OSHE+VPA provided more significant seizure protection (75%) than VPA (62.5%), OSHE (62.5%), or SE control (12.5%) (overall P=0.003). The latency to stage-3/4 seizures was increased and the number of stage-3/4 seizures was reduced in all treatment groups compared to the SE control group (P=0.002 and <0.001, respectively). The OSHE+VPA group also had better memory retention than other treatment groups (P<0.001) in the passive avoidance test. Total antioxidant capacity level was significantly higher and neuron-specific enolase was lower in the OSHE and OSHE+VPA groups compared to the SE control group. Electron microscopic study showed significant myelin sheath damage (67.5%, P<0.05) and axonal degeneration (51.8%, P<0.001) in the hippocampus of the SE control group, which were alleviated by OSHE or OSHE+VPA treatment. In immunohistochemical analysis, the OSHE, OSHE+VPA, and VPA groups had a significantly higher number of viable neurons and less neuronal loss compared to the SE control in the hippocampus (P<0.001). Conclusions: OSHE either alone or in combination with VPA shows better seizure control by preservation of neuronal echotexture and reducing oxidative stress in the hippocampus.

AB  - Purpose:The efficacy of additional barrage laser posterior to ridge in advanced stage 3 or stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is established, but its role in early stages is not defined. The objective was to study the efficacy of additional posterior barrage laser in type I zone 2 disease. Methods:In a randomized trial, patients with type I zone 2 ROP were recruited between February 2016 and May 2017. One eye of each baby was randomized into study and control groups, respectively. Laser photocoagulation anterior to ridge was given in the control group, and additional posterior barrage laser was performed in the study group. The outcome measures were time to complete ridge regression and final cycloplegic refraction at 3 months post-laser. Results:Forty patients (40 eyes per group) completed the required follow-up. The mean birth weight and gestational age were 1357 +/- 338 g and 29.72 +/- 2.57 weeks, respectively. The mean post-conceptional age during laser was 36.67 +/- 3.23 weeks. The number of eyes achieving ridge regression in control and study groups was 8/40 (20%) and 27/40 (67%) at 2 weeks (P = 0.001) and 39/40 (97%) and 40/40 (100%) at 4 weeks (P = 0.4). The mean time to complete ridge regression was 3.74 +/- 1.17 weeks and 2.62 +/- 0.91 weeks in control and study groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean spherical equivalent at 12 weeks in control and study groups was -1.9 +/- 2.3 Diopters and -2.4 +/- 2.6 Diopters, respectively (P = 0.41). Conclusions:Additional posterior barrage laser leads to significantly faster regression of type 1 zone 2 ROP without increasing induced myopia and thereby might be a useful adjunct to conventional treatment in selected cases.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Chronic isolated terminal ileitis (TI) may be seen in Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) in addition to other etiologies that may be managed symptomatically. We developed a revised algorithm to distinguish patients with a specific etiology from a nonspecific etiology.<bold>Methods: </bold>Patients with chronic isolated TI followed up from 2007 to 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. A specific (ITB or CD) diagnosis was made based on standardized criteria, and other relevant data were collected. Using this cohort, validation of a previously suggested algorithm was conducted. Furthermore, based on the results of a univariate analysis, a multivariate analysis with bootstrap validation was used to develop a revised algorithm.<bold>Results: </bold>We included 153 patients (mean age 36.9 +/- 14.6 years, males-70%, median duration-1.5 years, range: 0-20 years) with chronic isolated TI of whom 109 (71.2%) received a specific diagnosis (CD-69, ITB-40). On multivariate regression and validation statistics with a combination of clinical, laboratory, radiological, and colonoscopic findings, an optimism corrected c-statistic of 0.975 and 0.958 was obtained with and without histopathological findings, respectively. Revised algorithm, based on these, showed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy of 98.2% (95% CI: 93.5-99.8), 75.0% (95% CI: 59.7-86.8), 90.7% (95% CI: 85.4-94.2), 94.3% (95% CI: 80.5-98.5) and 91.5%(95% CI:85.9-95.4), respectively. This was more sensitive and specific than the previous algorithm (accuracy 83.9%, sensitivity 95.5%, and specificity 54.6%).<bold>Discussion: </bold>We developed a revised algorithm and a multimodality approach to stratify patients with chronic isolated TI into specific and nonspecific etiologies with an excellent diagnostic accuracy, which could potentially avoid missed diagnosis and unnecessary side effects of treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if initial fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloid (e.g., multiple electrolytes solution [MES]) or 0.9% saline adversely affects kidney function in children with septic shock.DESIGN: Parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial.SETTING: PICUs of four tertiary care centers in India from 2017 to 2020.PATIENTS: Children up to 15 years of age with septic shock.METHODS: Children were randomized to receive fluid boluses of either MES (PlasmaLyte A) or 0.9% saline at the time of identification of shock. All children were managed as per standard protocols and monitored until discharge/death. The primary outcome was new and/or progressive acute kidney injury (AKI), at any time within the first 7 days of fluid resuscitation. Key secondary outcomes included hyperchloremia, any adverse event (AE), at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and all-cause ICU mortality.INTERVENTIONS: MES solution (n = 351) versus 0.9% saline (n = 357) for bolus fluid resuscitation during the first 7 days.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The median age was 5 years (interquartile range, 1.3-9); 302 (43%) were girls. The relative risk (RR) for meeting the criteria for new and/or progressive AKI was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.49-0.80; p < 0.001), favoring the MES (21%) versus the saline (33%) group. The proportions of children with hyperchloremia were lower in the MES versus the saline group at 24, 48, and 72 hours. There was no difference in the ICU mortality (33% in the MES vs 34% in the saline group). There was no difference with regard to infusion-related AEs such as fever, thrombophlebitis, or fluid overload between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Among children presenting with septic shock, fluid resuscitation with MES (balanced crystalloid) as compared with 0.9% saline resulted in a significantly lower incidence of new and/or progressive AKI during the first 7 days of hospitalization.

AB  - Purpose of Study: F-18-FDG PET/CT plays a major role in diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer; however, FDG has lower uptake in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression is found to be associated with endothelial cells or tumor neovasculature in malignant AdCC and salivary duct carcinoma. Thus, present study is aimed to compare the role of Ga-68-PSMA and F-18-FDG PET/CT in patients with primary and/or metastatic AdCC. Materials and Methods: Histopathologically proven AdCC patients were intravenously injected with 370 MBq (10 mCi) of F-18-FDG and 111-185 MBq (3-5 mCi) of Ga-68-PSMA. Images were acquired at 60 and 45 minutes postinjection for F-18-FDG and Ga-68-PSMA, respectively, on dedicated PET/CT scanners. Visual and semiquantitative analyses of PSMA expression in regional and metastatic sites were performed by 2 experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Results: Seventeen patients (7 men, 10 women) having mean age of 44 +/- 14.19 years were prospectively included in the study. Of 17 patients, FDG PET/CT was performed in only 14 (82%) patients. PSMA and FDG uptakes were seen at the primary site in 16 (94%) and 13 (93%) patients, respectively, whereas 1 patient was postradical tumor excision. Lung lesions (n = 7) and lymph nodes (n = 5) were detected on both FDG and PSMA PET scans. However, cerebellar and meningeal metastasis (n = 1, 6%) and bony lesions (n = 2, 12%) were detected only on PSMA PET/CT but not visualized on FDG PET/CT scan. Conclusions: PSMA may have theranostic importance in unresectable or metastatic AdCC, besides having a role in staging/restaging.

AB  - CD8 T cells are important tools for protection against intracellularly replicating pathogens such as viruses. Previous studies showed that a discrete population of HLADR and CD38-expressing CD8 T cells expands massively during the acute febrile phase of human dengue virus infection-but very few of these cells secrete IFN gamma upon in vitro stimulation with dengue peptides. To gain a better understanding of what other cytokines/chemokines do these massively expanding HLADR(+)CD38(+) CD8 T cells express, we performed RNA seq of sorted HLADR(+)CD38(+) CD8 T cell subsets after peptide stimulation. A majority of these peptide-stimulated HLADR(+)CD38(+) CD8 T cells were CD69(-)IFN gamma(-), nearly a third were CD69(+)IFN gamma(-), whereas very few (<10%) were CD69(+)IFN gamma(+). The CD69(-)IFN gamma(-) subset was enriched for the expression of key genes implicated in the negative regulation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and T-cell exhaustion, attraction of B cells and other lymphocytes, and cytokines related to Tc17/T-reg lineages or those that are implicated in immunosuppression/immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities and angiogenesis. The CD69(+)IFN gamma(-) subset showed enriched transcription of key genes implicated in cytotoxic effector functions as well as costimulatory and signaling adaptors implicated in fine balancing of T cell receptor signaling. The CD69(+)IFN gamma(+) subset largely shared the transcriptional profile with the CD69(+)IFN gamma(-) subset-but with relatively more pronounced expression along with additional genes such as chemokines XCL1/XCL2. Our findings showing distinct functional subsets among these massively expanding CD8 T cells in dengue CD8 T cells warrant further studies to carefully examine the precise role of these T cell subsets in protection against dengue.
   IMPORTANCE CD8 T cells play a crucial role in protecting against intracellular pathogens such as viruses by eliminating infected cells and releasing anti-viral cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Consequently, there is significant interest in comprehensively characterizing CD8 T cell responses in acute dengue febrile patients. Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that a discrete population of CD8 T cells with HLADR(+) CD38(+) phenotype undergoes massive expansion during the acute febrile phase of natural dengue virus infection. Although about a third of these massively expanding HLADR(+) CD38(+) CD8 T cells were also CD69(high) when examined ex vivo, only a small fraction of them produced IFN gamma upon in vitro peptide stimulation. Therefore, to better understand such functional diversity of CD8 T cells responding to dengue virus infection, it is important to know the cytokines/chemokines expressed by these peptide-stimulated HLADR(+)CD38(+) CD8 T cells and the transcriptional profiles that distinguish the CD69(+)IFN gamma(+), CD69(+)IFN gamma(-), and CD69(-)IFN gamma(-) subsets.

AB  - Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) continues to be difficult to diagnose. Novel biomarkers in biological specimens offer promise. Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DNA in urine could prove useful in diagnosis of EPTB, possibly due to disseminated disease or micro-abscesses reported in kidneys. The current study was designed to detect Mtb DNA in stored urine samples from patients with EPTB. Diagnosis of EPTB was reached using Microbiological Reference Standards (MRS) on samples from the disease site using WHO Recommended Diagnostics (WRD), [smear microscopy, liquid culture (MGIT-960)] and GX (molecular WRD, mWRD) and Comprehensive reference standards [CRS, clinical presentation, microbiological reference standards, radiology, histopathology]. GX-Ultra was performed on urine samples stored in -80oC deep freezer, retrospectively. Of 70 patients, 51 (72.9%) were classified as confirmed TB, 11 (15.7%) unconfirmed TB, and 8 (11.4%) unlikely TB. GX-Ultra in urine samples demonstrated sensitivity of 52.9% and specificity of 57.9% against MRS, and higher sensitivity of 56.5% and specificity of 100% against CRS. The sensitivity and specificity of GX-Ultra in urine was 53.6% and 75% for pus sample subset and 52.2% and 53.3% for fluid sample subset. Urine being non-invasive and easy to collect, detection of Mtb DNA using mWRD in urine samples is promising for diagnosis of EPTB.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the characteristics of completed panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), using ultra-widefield imaging in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
   Methods: Quantitative assessment of ultra-widefield imaging images of 133 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy with completed PRP was made using ImageJ software. The parameters assessed included distance of laser spots from the optic disk, foveal center, superior and inferior arcades, and extent of the maximum width of laser. Areas assessed were total area of the image, area of the inner limit within which laser spots are restricted, minimum areas of unlasered patches, total area lasered, and ideal area to be covered by PRP.
   Results: Two hundred one images were assessed for the final analysis. The mean distance of laser spots was 4.2 +/- 2.4 mm from the optic disk (nasal) and 6.6 +/- 2.5 mm from the foveal center (temporal). The mean distance of laser spots from the superior arcade vessel was 3.2 +/- 1.9 mm and 6.2 +/- 4.4 mm from the inferior arcade. The mean area of the retina that should have been ideally lasered was found to be 900 +/- 267 mm(2), and the actual area lasered was found to be 681 +/- 254.4 mm(2).
   Conclusion: Approximately one-quarter area of the retina continues to remain ischemic because of the lack of inadequate coverage of PRP. Further longitudinal studies are recommended, using ultra-widefield imaging to objectively assess the adequacy of PRP and its role in modulating the course of progression of the retinopathy.

AB  - Purpose: To compare volumetric changes in buccal soft tissue and pink esthetic scores after immediate implant placement performed with a socket shield technique (SST) or the conventional technique (CT). Materials and Methods: This parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial included 22 participants requiring replacement of a single maxillary incisor with an immediate implant. Immediate implants were placed via either the SST or the CT, with patients randomly allocated to one of the two groups. All implants underwent an immediate loading protocol. Definitive crowns were placed 6 months after implant placement. Scans of casts were recorded with a digital white light scanner before implant placement and at the end of 12 months. Volumetric changes to soft tissues on the buccal aspect were assessed by superimposition of the scanned cast. Esthetic evaluation of the soft tissue was done by evaluating the pink esthetic score (PES) before implant placement and 6 and 12 months after implant placement. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using statistical software (Stata 16.0, StataCorp). Results: The mean volumetric change in buccal soft tissues at the end of 12 months in the SST group was - 0.1520 +/- 0.86 mm, and in the CT group, it was - 0.643 +/- 0.35 mm. The difference was statistically significant (P =.001). Higher PES was observed in the SST group at all time intervals. The difference was statistically significant at 6 months (P =.001) and 12 months (P =.007). Conclusions: The results of this study showed less volumetric changes in buccal soft tissues and higher PES when the SST is used rather than the CT.

AB  - In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been found to be enriched in the synovial fluid. Despite their accumulation, they are unable to suppress synovial inflammation. Recently, we showed the synovial enrichment of interleukin-9 (IL-9) producing helper T cells and its positive correlation with disease activity. Therefore, we investigated the impact of IL-9 on synovial Tregs in RA. Here, we confirmed high synovial Tregs in RA patients, however these cells were functionally impaired in terms of suppressive cytokine production (IL-10 and TGF-beta). Abrogating IL-9/ IL-9 receptor interaction could restore the suppressive cytokine production of synovial Tregs and reduce the synovial inflammatory T cells producing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17. However, blocking these inflammatory cytokines failed to show any effect on IL-9 producing T cells, highlighting IL-9's hierarchy in the inflammatory network. Thus, we propose that blocking IL-9 might dampen synovial inflammation by restoring Tregs function and inhibiting inflammatory T cells.

AB  - Introduction: Electrographic seizures in neonates are commonly associated with poor neurodevelopmental out-comes. However, there is conflict in evidence whether control of electrographic seizures translate into improved neurodevelopmental outcome. We aimed to evaluate whether treating all electrographic seizures compared with treating clinical seizures leads to a better neurodevelopmental outcome at 18-24 months in neonates.Methods: We searched four electronic databases (Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until October 31, 2022. We included RCTs comparing the treatment of electrographic seizures with clinical seizures in neonates with or at risk of seizures. The Risk of Bias version 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The random-effects meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software.Results: Of the 2872 unique records identified by the database search, five trials involving 474 infants were eligible for the review. There was no significant difference in the incidence of neurodevelopmental disability at 18-24 months. Infants in the electrographic seizure group had lower scores in the cognitive domain (2 trials, 186 participants, MD:-5.4; 95% CI:-10.3 to-0.4, I2-0%). There were no significant differences in scores in the motor and language domains, mortality, seizure burden, brain injury scores, antiseizure medication use, and post-neonatal epilepsy.Conclusions: Having limitations of small number of trials and heterogeneity, the systematic review does not identify evidence demonstrating improved neurodevelopmental outcomes or improved survival in neonates treated for electrographic seizures versus clinical seizures.

AB  - Life in contemporary cities is often dangerous for stray cats, with strikingly low survival rates. In several countries, trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs have been employed to control urban stray cat populations. Management of stray cats in urban environments is not just about applying scientific solutions, but also identifying approaches that align with local cultural and ethical values. India has an estimated 9.1 million stray cats. TNR presents as a potential method for stray cat management in India, while also improving their welfare. Yet, to date, there has been no academic exploration on Indian residents' attitudes towards stray cats. We conducted a survey in 13 cities in India reaching 763 residents, examining interactions with stray cats, negative and positive attitudes towards them, attitudes towards managing their population, and awareness of TNR. Results show a high rate of stray cat sightings and interactions. While most respondents believed that stray cats had a right to welfare, the majority held negative attitudes towards and had negative interactions with them. There was widespread lack of awareness about TNR, but, when described, there was a high degree of support. Gathering insights into opinions about stray cats, and the sociodemographic factors that impact these opinions, is an important first step to developing policies and initiatives to manage stray cat populations.

AB  - Background Myelodysplastic Neoplasms (MDS) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and progression to acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia-related (AML-MR). A major mechanism of pathogenesis of MDS is the aberration of the epigenetic landscape of the hematopoietic stem cells and/or progenitor cells, especially DNA cytosine methylation, and demethylation. Data on TET2, the predominant DNA demethylator of the hematopoietic system, is limited, particularly in the MDS patients from India, whose biology may differ since these patients present at a relatively younger age. We studied the expression and the variants of TET2 in Indian MDS and AML-MR patients and their effects on 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-hmC, a product of TET2 catalysis) and on the prognosis of MDS patients.Results Of the 42 MDS patients, cytogenetics was available for 31 sub-categorized according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Their age resembled that of the previous studies from India. Bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs) were also obtained from 13 patients with AML-MR, 26 patients with de-novo AML, and 11 subjects with morphologically normal bone marrow. The patients had a significantly lower TET2 expression which was more pronounced in AML-MR and the IPSS-R higher-risk MDS categories. The 5-hmC levels in higher-risk MDS and AML-MR correlated with TET2 expression, suggesting a possible mechanistic role in the loss of TET2 expression. The findings on TET2 and 5-hmC were also confirmed at the tissue level using immunohistochemistry. Pathogenic variants of TET2 were found in 7 of 24 patient samples (29%), spanning across the IPSS-R prognostic categories. One of the variants - H1778R - was found to affect local and global TET2 structure when studied using structural predictions and molecular dynamics simulations. Thus, it is plausible that some pathogenic variants in TET2 can compromise the structure of TET2 and hence in the formation of 5-hmC.Conclusions IPSS-R higher-risk MDS categories and AML-MR showed a reduction in TET2 expression, which was not apparent in lower-risk MDS. DNA 5-hmC levels followed a similar pattern. Overall, a decreased TET2 expression and a low DNA 5-hmC level are predictors of advanced disease and adverse outcome in MDS in the population studied, i.e., MDS patients from India.

AB  - Rehabilitation of lower limb amputation in developing countries is quite challenging. Though there are basic to highly advanced prostheses available in India, the set-up is still facing difficulties in developing countries. Prosthetic management is difficult due to lack of availability of prostheses and reduced affordability among low income populations. In this review we highlighted the lower limb amputation and prosthetic rehabilitation status in India. Currently, India is advancing well in the rehabilitation field, but further studies are required to provide more evidence and recommendation.

AB  - Telangiectatic osteosarcoma (TO) is an uncommon variant of osteosarcoma that primarily afflicts young adults. In this case report, we describe a unique instance of TO occurring in a young child's maxilla. Under microscopic examination, it reveals abundant blood-filled spaces, extensive hemorrhagic regions, alongside atypical pleomorphic tumor cells and osteoid. It is crucial to conduct a meticulous histopathological examination to distinguish TO from other lesions, such as aneurysmal bone cysts and Ewing sarcoma.

AB  - Biochemical networks integrate enzyme-mediated substrate conversions with non-enzymatic complex formation and disassembly to accomplish complex biochemical and physiological functions. The choice of parameters and constraints used in most of these studies is numerically motivated and network-specific. Although sound in theory, the outcomes that result depart significantly from the intracellular milieu and are less likely to retain relevance in a clinical setting. There is a need for a computational tool which is biochemically relevant, mathematically rigorous, and unbiased, and can ascribe functionality to and generate potentially testable hypotheses for a user-defined biochemical network. Here, we present "ReDirection," an R-package which computes the probable dissociation constant for every reaction of a biochemical network directly from a null space-generated subspace of the stoichiometry number matrix of the modeled network. "ReDirection" delineates this subspace by excluding all trivial and redundant or duplicate occurrences of non-trivial vectors, combinatorially summing the vectors that remain and verifying that the upper or lower bounds of the sequence of terms formed by each row of this subspace belong to the open real-valued intervals( -infinity, - 1) or (1 ,infinity) or whether the number of terms that are differently signed are almost equal. "ReDirection" iterates these steps until these bounds are consistent and unambiguous for all reactions of the modeled biochemical network. Thereafter, "ReDirection" filters the terms from each row of this subspace, bins them to outcome-specific subsets, sums and maps this to an outcome-specific reaction vector, and computes the p1-norm, which is the probable dissociation constant for a reaction. "ReDirection" works on first principles, does not discriminate between enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions, offers a biochemically relevant and mathematically rigorous environment to explore user-defined biochemical networks under baseline and perturbed conditions, and can be used to address empirically intractable biochemical problems. The utility and relevance of "ReDirection" are highlighted by numerical studies on stoichiometric number models of biochemical networks of galactose metabolism and heme and cholesterol biosynthesis. "ReDirection" is freely available and accessible from the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) with the URL (https://cran.r-project.org/package=ReDirection).

AB  - Dendritic cell-derived exosomes (Dex) have overcome the disadvantages associated with dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, such as cost effectiveness, stability, and sensitivity to the systemic microenvironment. However, in clinical trials, Dex failed to provide satisfactory results because of many reasons, including inadequate maturation of DC as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Hence, culturing DCs in the presence of a maturation cocktail showed an induced expression of MHCs and co-stimulatory molecules. Additionally, targeting the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)/CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) signaling pathway by a CSF-1R inhibitor could deplete tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which are responsible for immunosuppressive TME. Hence, in this study, mDex(TA) were isolated from bone marrow-derived DC cultured in the presence of a novel maturation cocktail and tumor antigen. mDex(TA) showed elevated expression of major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) and co-stimulatory molecules and was found capable of activating na & iuml;ve DC and T cells in vitro more efficiently when compared to imDex(TA) isolated from immature DCs. In addition, PLX-3397, a small molecule inhibitor of CSF-1/CSF-1R, was used in combination to enhance the antitumor efficacy of mDex(TA). PLX-3397 showed dose-dependent toxicity against bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). In the B16-F10 murine melanoma model, we found that the combination treatment delayed tumor growth and improved survival compared to the mice treated with mDex(TA) alone by enhancing the CD8 T cells infiltration in TME. mDex(TA) when combined with PLX-3397 modulated the TME by shifting the Th1/Th2 toward a dominant Th1 population and depleting the TAMs and MDSCs. Interestingly, PLX-3397-induced FoxP3 expression was diminished when it was used in combination with mDex(TA). Combination treatment also induced favorable systemic antitumor immunity in the spleen and lymph node. In conclusion, our findings provide insights into the synergy between mDex(TA)-based immunotherapy and PLX-3397 as the combination overcame the disadvantages associated with monotherapy and offer a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of solid tumors including melanoma.

TI  - Hypertension Diagnosis, Treatment, and Control in India
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Importance Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Previous efforts to characterize gaps in the hypertension care continuum-including diagnosis, treatment, and control-in India did not assess district-level variation. Local data are critical for planning, implementation, and monitoring efforts to curb the burden of hypertension. Objective To examine the hypertension care continuum in India among individuals aged 18 to 98 years. Design, Setting, and Participants The nationally representative Fifth National Family Health Survey study was conducted in 2 phases from June 17, 2019, to March 21, 2020, and from November 21, 2020, to April 30, 2021, among 1 895 297 individuals in 28 states, 8 union territories, and 707 districts of India. Exposures District and state of residence, urban classification, age (18-39, 40-64, and >= 65 years), sex, and household wealth quintile.Main Outcomes and Measures Hypertension was defined as a self-reported diagnosis or a newly measured blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. The proportion of individuals diagnosed (self-reported), the proportion of individuals treated among those diagnosed (self-reported medication use), and the proportion of individuals with blood pressure control among those treated (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg [aged 18-79 years] or <150/90 mm Hg [aged >= 80 years]) were calculated based on national guidelines. Age-standardized estimates of treatment and control were also provided among the total with hypertension. To assess differences in the care continuum between or within states (ie, between districts), the variance was partitioned using generalized linear mixed models. Results Of the 1 691 036 adult respondents (52.6% women; mean [SD] age, 41.6 [16.5] years), 28.1% (95% CI, 27.9%-28.3%) had hypertension, of whom 36.9% (95% CI, 36.4%-37.3%) received a diagnosis. Among those who received a diagnosis, 44.7% (95% CI, 44.1%-45.3%) reported taking medication (corresponding to 17.7% [95% CI, 17.5%-17.9%] of the total with hypertension). Among those treated, 52.5% (95% CI, 51.7%-53.4%) had blood pressure control (corresponding to 8.5% [95% CI, 8.3%-8.6%] of the total with hypertension). There were substantial variations across districts in blood pressure diagnosis (range, 6.3%-77.5%), treatment (range, 8.7%-97.1%), and control (range, 2.7%-76.6%). Large proportions of the variation in hypertension diagnosis (94.7%), treatment (93.6%), and control (97.3%) were within states, not just between states. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional survey study of Indian adults, more than 1 in 4 people had hypertension, and of these, only 1 in 3 received a diagnosis, less than 1 in 5 were treated, and only 1 in 12 had blood pressure control. National mean values hide considerable state-level and district-level variation in the care continuum, suggesting the need for targeted, decentralized solutions to improve the hypertension care continuum in India.

AB  - Background and aims: Dexamethasone as adjunct to local anesthetic solution improves the quality of brachial plexus block (BPB). However, evidence for its efficacy at low doses (< 4 mg) is lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the duration of analgesia attained with low dose dexamethasone as adjuvant to local anesthetic for creation of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) under BPB.Methods: Sixty-six patients scheduled for AVF creation were randomly allocated to receive either saline (control) or 2 mg dexamethasone, together with 0.5% ropivacaine and 0.2% lignocaine. The primary outcome was duration of analgesia, defined as time from performing the block to the first analgesic request. The secondary outcomes were time from injection to complete sensory block, time from injection to complete motor block, duration of motor block, postoperative analgesic consumption, and fistula patency at three months.Results: All the blocks were effective. In the group that received dexamethasone, the time to first analgesic request was significantly delayed (432 +/- 43.8 minutes vs. 386.4 +/- 40.2 minutes; p < 0.01). The onset of sensory and motor blockade occurred faster in dexamethasone group and overall analgesic consumption was also reduced. However, dexamethasone addition did not prolong the duration of motor block. There was no statistically significant difference in the patency of fistulas between the two groups at three months. (p = 0.34).Conclusion: Addition of low-dose perineural dexamethasone to local anesthetic solution significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia. Further trials are warranted to compare the adverse effects between dexamethasone doses of 4 mg and lower.(c) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - Imaging is crucial in the diagnostic work-up and follow-up after treatment in children with thoracic tuberculosis (TB). Despite various technological advances in imaging modalities, chest radiography is the primary imaging modality for initial care and in emergency settings, especially in rural areas and where resources are limited. Ultrasonography (US) of the thorax in TB is one of the emerging applications of US as a radiation-free modality in children. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the ideal radiation-free, emerging imaging modality for thoracic TB in children. However, only limited published data is available regarding the utility of MRI in thoracic TB. In this pictorial review, we demonstrate the use of US and rapid lung MRI in evaluating children with thoracic TB, specifically for mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary complications of TB.

AB  - The diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is established by combined clinic-radio-microbiological criteria. Out of the different microbiological criteria, a positive serology for Aspergillus-specific IgG levels is the cornerstone of diagnosis. Alternatively, other microbiological evidence are sometimes sought viz., positive Aspergillus antigen (broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, i.e., BALF galactomannan >= 1.0), histopathological demonstration of the fungi following lung biopsy or resection, demonstration of hyaline septate hyphae in direct microscopy resembling Aspergillus spp. or its growth on a respiratory specimen. However, the exact roles of BALF- GM and the newer BALF-PCR have not been confirmed by studies till date. This study enrolled 210 patients with suspected CPA. Of the participants, 88 patients met the criteria for CPA, whereas 122 patients had an alternative diagnosis. The sensitivity-specificity of AsperGenius (R) PCR and "in-house" PCR were 52.27(36.69-67.54) %-33.78 (23.19-45.72) % and 36.36 (22.41-52.23) %-39.19 (28.04-51.23) % respectively. The sensitivity/specificity of BALF (> 1.0) and serum galactomannan (> 1.0) were 46.55% (33.34-60.13)/64.08% (54.03-73.3) and 29.82% (22.05-37.6)/86.84% (81.1-92.59) respectively. The optimal cut-off values for BALF-Galactomannan and serum galactomannan in diagnosing CPA were found to be 0.69 (sensitivity: 64%; specificity: 53%) and 0.458 (sensitivity: 67%; specificity: 64%) respectively. This results of this study suggests that Aspergillus PCR from BAL may not be a good "rule-in" test for diagnosing CPA. While the performances of GM in BAL and serum may be better than PCR, it should be best used in conjunction with other clinical, radiological, and other microbiological characteristics.

AB  - Background: Over time, COVID-19 testing has significantly declined across the world. However, it is critical to monitor the virus through surveillance. In late 2020, WHO released interim guidance advising the use of the existing Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for the integrated surveillance of influenza and SARS-CoV-2.Methods: In July 2021, we initiated a pan-India integrated surveillance for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 through the geographically representative network of Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) across 26 hospital and laboratory sites and 70 community sites. A total of 34,260 cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) were enrolled from 4 July 2021 to 31 October 2022.Findings: Influenza A(H3) and B/Victoria dominated during 2021 monsoon season while A(H1N1)pdm09 dominated during 2022 monsoon season. The SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" (VoC) Delta and Omicron predominated in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Increased proportion of SARI was seen in extremes of age: 90% cases in < 1 year; 68% in 1 to 5 years and 61% in >= 8 years age group. Approximately 40.7% of enrolled cases only partially fulfilled WHO ILI and SARI case definitions. Influenza- and SARS-CoV-2-infected comorbid patients had higher risks of hospitalization, ICU admission, and oxygen requirement.Interpretation: The results depicted the varying strains and transmission dynamics of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses over time, thus emphasizing the need to continue and expand surveillance across countries for improved decision making. The study also describes important information related to clinical outcomes of ILI and SARI patients and highlights the need to review existing WHO ILI and SARI case definitions.

AB  - Objective Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to treatment. Once medical therapy has failed, palliative surgeries such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or corpus callosotomy (CC) are considered. Although CC is more effective than VNS as the primary neurosurgical treatment for LGS-associated drop attacks, there are limited data regarding the added value of CC following VNS. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of CC preceded by VNS.Methods This multinational, multicenter retrospective study focuses on LGS children who underwent CC before the age of 18 years, following prior VNS, which failed to achieve satisfactory seizure control. Collected data included epilepsy characteristics, surgical details, epilepsy outcomes, and complications. The primary outcome of this study was a 50% reduction in drop attacks.Results A total of 127 cases were reviewed (80 males). The median age at epilepsy onset was 6 months (interquartile range [IQR] = 3.12-22.75). The median age at VNS surgery was 7 years (IQR = 4-10), and CC was performed at a median age of 11 years (IQR = 8.76-15). The dominant seizure type was drop attacks (tonic or atonic) in 102 patients. Eighty-six patients underwent a single-stage complete CC, and 41 an anterior callosotomy. Ten patients who did not initially have a complete CC underwent a second surgery for completion of CC due to seizure persistence. Overall, there was at least a 50% reduction in drop attacks and other seizures in 83% and 60%, respectively. Permanent morbidity occurred in 1.5%, with no mortality.Significance CC is vital in seizure control in children with LGS in whom VNS has failed. Surgical risks are low. A complete CC has a tendency toward better effectiveness than anterior CC for some seizure types.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare heterogenous tumors derived from mesenchymal tissue. While surgery represents the primary treatment modality, the high recurrence rates following surgery alone necessitate consideration for systemic therapy in high-risk sarcomas. Despite multiple trials and meta-analyses over the last 3 decades, the role of chemotherapy remains controversial. It is crucial to accurately identify patients with high-risk diseases who may benefit the most from adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There is renewed interest in the potential to improve outcomes in localized resectable STSs with the addition of targeted and immunotherapeutic strategies. The review presented here is a summary of current evidence on systemic therapy in resectable localized STSs of the trunk and extremities to facilitate clinician decision-making.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are powerful technologies with the potential to revolutionize motor recovery in rehabilitation medicine. This perspective explores how AI and ML are harnessed to assess, diagnose, and design personalized treatment plans for patients with motor impairments. The integration of wearable sensors, virtual reality, augmented reality, and robotic devices allows for precise movement analysis and adaptive neurorehabilitation approaches. Moreover, AI-driven telerehabilitation enables remote monitoring and consultation. Although these applications show promise, healthcare professionals must interpret AI-generated insights and ensure patient safety. While AI and ML are in their early stages, ongoing research will determine their effectiveness in rehabilitation medicine.

AB  - Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) affect similar to 15 million people globally. In high income settings DNA-based diagnosis has transformed care pathways and led to gene-specific therapies. However, most affected families are in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) with limited access to DNA-based diagnosis. Most (86%) published genetic data is derived from European ancestry. This marked genetic data inequality hampers understanding of genetic diversity and hinders accurate genetic diagnosis in all income settings. We developed a cloud-based transcontinental partnership to build diverse, deeply-phenotyped and genetically characterized cohorts to improve genetic architecture knowledge, and potentially advance diagnosis and clinical management.We connected 18 centres in Brazil, India, South Africa, Turkey, Zambia, Netherlands and the UK. We co-developed a cloud-based data solution and trained 17 international neurology fellows in clinical genomic data interpretation. Single gene and whole exome data were analysed via a bespoke bioinformatics pipeline and reviewed alongside clinical and phenotypic data in global webinars to inform genetic outcome decisions.We recruited 6001 participants in the first 43 months. Initial genetic analyses 'solved' or 'possibly solved' similar to 56% probands overall. In-depth genetic data review of the four commonest clinical categories (limb girdle muscular dystrophy, inherited peripheral neuropathies, congenital myopathy/muscular dystrophies and Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy) delivered a similar to 59% 'solved' and similar to 13% 'possibly solved' outcome. Almost 29% of disease causing variants were novel, increasing diverse pathogenic variant knowledge. Unsolved participants represent a new discovery cohort. The dataset provides a large resource from under-represented populations for genetic and translational research.In conclusion, we established a remote transcontinental partnership to assess genetic architecture of NMDs across diverse populations. It supported DNA-based diagnosis, potentially enabling genetic counselling, care pathways and eligibility for gene-specific trials. Similar virtual partnerships could be adopted by other areas of global genomic neurological practice to reduce genetic data inequality and benefit patients globally.
   Wilson et al. present the findings of an international partnership established to study genetic causes of neuromuscular diseases in under-represented diverse populations from 12 low-middle income sites. A genetic cause was identified in similar to 55% of cases and similar to 30% of variants were novel, improving understanding of neuromuscular disease genetics.

AB  - Transthyretin amyloidosis is a severe pathology characterized by the progressive accumulation of transthyretin (TTR) in various organs and tissues. This highly conserved through vertebrate evolution protein transports thyroid hormone thyroxine. In our bodies, TTR can interact with a large number of molecules, including omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are broadly used as food supplies. In this study, we investigated the effect of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs, as well as their fully saturated analog, on TTR aggregation. Our results showed that both omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs strongly decreased the rate of TTR aggregation. We also found that in the presence of PUFAs, TTR formed morphologically different fibrils compared to the lipid-free environment. Nano-Infrared imaging revealed that these fibrils had drastically different secondary structures compared to the secondary structure of TTR aggregates formed in the PUFAs-free environment. Furthermore, TTR fibrils formed in the presence of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs exerted significantly lower cell toxicity compared to the fibrils formed in the absence of fatty acids.

AB  - ObjectivesThe purpose of this review is to determine the effectiveness of intracanal medicament (ICM) on periodontal and periapical healing (PH) of concurrent endodontic-periodontal lesions with/without communication in permanent teeth.Materials and methodsThe pre-defined protocol was registered in PROSPERO, and a literature search using keywords was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase electronic databases, and Gray literature and was hand-searched until August 2023. Two reviewers independently screened the title and abstracts using the inclusion criteria. Randomized or non-randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies were included in the review. The same reviewers extracted the study-level data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) independently. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Random effects meta-analysis was performed on eligible studies using Revman software.ResultsA total of 598 records were identified from the database search; seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Four randomized clinical trials, two prospective cohorts, and one retrospective case-control study with 362 patients were included. Calcium hydroxide (CH) was the most commonly used ICM, followed by using chlorhexidine gel in four studies. Periodontal therapy was performed as initial scaling and root planning (SRP) in all studies, along with open flap debridement (OFD) in three randomized clinical trials. The time lapse between two treatment protocols was variable (ranging from 1 week to 3 months). All studies exhibited a decrease in probing depth (PD) and an increase in clinical attachment level (CAL) after the treatment. Meta-analysis showed insignificant differences between different ICM materials, and the certainty of evidence was low.ConclusionIn patients with/without concurrent endodontic-periodontal lesions, intracanal medication improved clinical periodontal parameters following endodontic therapy. In terms of influence on periapical healing, the results were inconclusive.Clinical relevanceTwo-visit RCT may be considered since it allows for the placement of an ICM in endodontic-periodontal lesions with/without communication. Sufficient time should be allowed after endodontic therapy for any potential periodontal regeneration to occur.

AB  - Background Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting at least 5 million children in South Asia. Majority of these children are without access to evidence-based care. The UK Pre-school Autism Communication Therapy (PACT) is the only intervention to have shown sustained impact on autism symptoms. It was systematically adapted for non-specialist community delivery in South Asia, as the 'Parent-mediated Autism Social Communication Intervention for non-Specialists (PASS)' and extended 'PASS Plus' interventions. RCTs of both showed feasibility, acceptability and positive effect on parent and child dyadic outcomes.
   Methods The Communication-centred Parent-mediated treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder in South Asia (COMPASS) trial is now a scale-up two- centre, two-arm single (rater) blinded random allocation parallel group study of the PASS Plus intervention in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone, plus health economic evaluation embedded in the India health system. Two hundred forty children (approximately 120 intervention/120 TAU) with ASD aged 2-9 years will be recruited from two tertiary care government hospitals in New Delhi, India. Accredited Social Health Activists will be one of the intervention delivery agents. Families will undertake up to 12 communication sessions over 8 months and will be offered the Plus modules which address coexisting problems. The trial's primary endpoint is at 9 months from randomisation, with follow-up at 15 months. The primary outcome is autism symptom severity; secondary outcomes include parent-child communication, child adaptation, quality of life and parental wellbeing. Primary analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles using linear mixed model regressions with group allocation and repeated measures as random effects. The cost-effectiveness analysis will use a societal perspective over the 15-month period of intervention and follow-up.
   Discussion If clinically and cost-effective, this programme will fill an important gap of scalable interventions delivered by non-specialist health workers within the current care pathways for autistic children and their families in low-resource contexts. The programme has been implemented through the COVID-19 pandemic when restrictions were in place; intervention delivery and evaluation processes have been adapted to address these conditions.

AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy with very high incidence and relatively high mortality in women. The PIK3CA gene plays a pivotal role in the pathogenicity of breast cancer. Despite this, the mutational status of all exons except exons 9 and 20 still remains unknown.MethodsThis study uses the whole exome sequencing (WES) based approach to identify somatic PIK3CA mutations in Indian BC cohorts. The resultant hotspot mutations were validated by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was applied to elucidate the conformational and functional effects of hotspot position on PIK3CA protein.ResultsIn our cohort, PIK3CA showed a 44.4% somatic mutation rate and was among the top mutated genes. The mutations of PIK3CA were confined in Exons 5, 9, 11, 18, and 20, whereas the maximum number of mutations lies within exons 9 and 20. A total of 9 variants were found in our study, of which 2 were novel mutations observed on exons 9 (p.H554L) and 11 (p.S629P). However, H1047R was the hotspot mutation at exon 20 (20%). In tumor tissues, there was a considerable difference between copy number of wild-type and H1047R mutant was detected by ddPCR. Significant structural and conformational changes were observed during MD simulation, induced due to point mutation at H1047R/L position.ConclusionsThe current study provides a comprehensive view of novel as well as reported single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in PIK3CA gene associated with Indian breast cancer cases. The mutation status of H1047R/L could serve as a prognostic value in terms of selecting targeted therapy in BC.

AB  - BackgroundWhole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been investigated by multiple authors as a radiation-free alternative to positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) in children with lymphoma.ObjectiveTo evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of whole-body MRI compared to PET-CT for the staging of pediatric lymphoma.MethodsThe databases PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched for studies that reported the accuracy of whole-body MRI compared to PET-CT for lymphoma staging in children. Data was collected from included studies to formulate 2 x 2 contingency tables, including the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated. In addition, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS 2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns.ResultsA total of seven studies were included in the final analysis. Of these, six studies used unenhanced whole-body MRI. The pooled sensitivity of whole-body MRI-based staging was 95.8%, while the pooled specificity was 21.8%. The DOR for whole-body MRI was 1.19. For extranodal staging, the pooled sensitivity was 88.9%, specificity was 97.4%, and DOR was 25.29. The partial AUC for overall staging was 0.63, whereas that for extranodal staging stood at 0.88. Based on the QUADAS 2 tool, all seven studies were at risk of bias (six at high risk, one at unclear risk).ConclusionWhole-body MRI has high sensitivity for staging of pediatric lymphoma and may be a useful alternative to PET-CT.

AB  - To recapitulate bio-physical properties and functional behaviour of native heart tissues, recent tissue engineering-based approaches are focused on developing smart/stimuli-responsive materials for interfacing cardiac cells. Overcoming the drawbacks of the traditionally used biomaterials, these smart materials portray outstanding mechanical and conductive properties while promoting cell-cell interaction and cell-matrix transduction cues in such excitable tissues. To date, a large number of stimuli-responsive materials have been employed for interfacing cardiac tissues alone or in combination with natural/synthetic materials for cardiac tissue engineering. However, their comprehensive classification and a comparative analysis of the role played by these materials in regulating cardiac cell behaviour and in vivo metabolism are much less discussed. In an attempt to cover the recent advances in fabricating stimuli-responsive biomaterials for engineering cardiac tissues, this review details the role of these materials in modulating cardiomyocyte behaviour, functionality and surrounding matrix properties. Furthermore, concerns and challenges regarding the clinical translation of these materials and the possibility of using such materials for the fabrication of bio-actuators and bioelectronic devices are discussed.
   Deciphering the role of stimuli-responsive materials in modulating surrounding matrix properties, and cardiomyocyte maturation and behaviour resulting in generation of functionally active cardiac tissues.

AB  - Background: Patients with pre-eclampsia require smaller vasopressor doses compared with those with normotension for management of post-spinal hypotension during caesarean section. However, the literature has little evidence as to the phenylephrine dose required for patients with pre-eclampsia. Methods: Fifty patients, with either pre-eclampsia or normotension, and developing post-spinal hypotension during caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, were studied. Women in both groups did not receive prophylactic vasopressors. The first patient in each group received phenylephrine 50 mu g to treat the first episode of hypotension, defined as fall of systolic blood pressure >= 20% from baseline or an absolute value <100 mmHg. If hypotension was corrected within one minute it was considered a 'success'. The doses for the subsequent patients were determined by responses to all previous patients, according to a variation of Narayana's rule for the up-down sequential allocation method. Results: The 95% effective dose (ED95) and 50% effective dose (ED50) of phenylephrine was 41.7 <mu>g (95% CI 33.8 to 49.6 mu g) and 29.1 mu g (95% CI 26.0 to 32.2 mu g) respectively in the pre-eclampsia group, and 64.9 mu g (95% CI 54.1 to 75.7 mu g) and 47.3 mu g (95% CI 39.7 to 54.9 mu g) respectively in the normotensive group. The proportionate reduction in phenylephrine dose ranged from 33% (95% CI 18 to 44%) to 40% (95% CI 19 to 52%). Conclusion: Patients with pre-eclampsia may need a 33% to 40% reduction in the first phenylephrine bolus dose, compared with patients with normotension, for the treatment of the first episode of post-spinal hypotension.

AB  - Esophageal cancer is a global health problem, which is 7th most common and 6th most deadly cancer. It has been the era of immuno-oncology for esophageal cancer management. Radiation therapy has been one of the key local therapeutic approaches for esophageal cancer treatment, while its role in advanced disease is challenging and debatable. There have been emerging clinical and translational studies of radiation therapy in recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer. Immunotherapy has been established the standard care of 1st and 2nd line systemic therapies of advanced esophageal cancer, and the development of tumor immunity has opened a new chapter for the esophageal cancer radiation therapy. The current review will summarize the classic radiation therapy research in advanced esophageal cancer, as well as the most recent key findings. The subtitles will cover palliative radiotherapy for dysphagia, re-radiation for recurrent disease, oligo-focal disease management and stereotactic radiation therapy, and radiotherapy with immunotherapy. Radiotherapy plays vital role in multidisciplinary management of advanced EC. External or intratumoral irradiation has been used for palliation of dysphagia and improving QOL in esophageal cancer patients traditionally, while recent clinical and technical advance enables radiotherapy to be considered in recurrent or metastatic disease for curation attention. Novel clinical and translational investigation is opening a new chapter of radiotherapy with immunotherapy for benefiting advanced EC patients.

AB  - Management of type-II diabetes through regulating the activity of alpha-glucosidase is a promising therapeutic approach. Here, bioassay-guided isolation of algal secondary metabolites (ASM) from microalgae (Chlorella minutissima) inhibiting alpha-glucosidase was explored. In this study, the purified column fractions (SIV-P2) of C. minutissima acetone extract obtained from flash chromatography exhibited alpha-glucosidase inhibition potential with the IC50 value of 1.61 mg mL-1, and the active fractions were dominated by terpenoids and alkaloids. Further, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that Lucidine B, an alkaloid compound possesses the least binding energy (BE) of-318 KJ mol-1 when compared to the standard drug acarbose (-216.781 KJ mol-1). Lucidine B formed a hydrogen bond with Glu408 which possibly induced cleft closure and prevented the sub-strate entry to the active site (non-competitive inhibition). The present study unveils that ASM could be exploited as a potential inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase and may be used for the alleviation of type-II diabetes.

AB  - Background: Split-thickness skin grafting is a widely used treatment for burn patients. It requires removing a small portion of healthy skin, making parallel incisions on it, stretching it, and surgically implanting it into the burn site. Although skin graft mesher companies claim to significantly expand the size of the skin graft, in reality, the amount of expansion achieved is much smaller.Methods: This study aimed to improve the expansion potential of skin grafts by designing new incision patterns with auxetic properties, using a skin simulant material and additive manufacturing. The mechanical properties and digital image correlation was used to analyze the strain, effective Poisson's ratio, local strains, void area, and meshing ratio of the auxetic skin graft simulants.Findings: The results showed that the Y-shaped skin graft simulant had the highest effective negative Poisson's ratio, largest areal expansions, lowest maximum induced stresses and strains, and uniform strain distribution properties, making it the best choice for generating high expansions in skin grafts.Intrepretation: The study found that the expansions were highly strain sensitive, with higher auxeticity observed at lower strains. The novel findings with auxetic skin graft simulants are expected to provide valuable insights for developing skin grafts with higher expansion potential in the future.

AB  - Several donated human corneas become unsuitable for transplantation due to lack of cellularity, diseases, and inadequate death to enucleation/preservation time. Here, we utilized discarded human corneas unsuitable for transplantation. Corneas were decellularized using a perfusion bioreactor with Triton-X 100 and cross-linked with chondroitin sulfate to reduce immune response, which FTIR and AFM confirmed. An in vitro study established the morphology of THP-1 cells cultured under three conditions, i.e., native, decellularized, and cross-linked for 10 days, by SEM analysis. The oxidative mechanism in THP-1 cells was determined by nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in the media during the culture period. Cell surface markers and receptors were examined using RT-PCR. A panel of 40 identified cytokines/chemokines and release factors responsible for the immune response and implant rejection were estimated using cytokine microarray. Our findings elucidated the fundamentals of corneal rejection and helped identify a suitable decellularized matrix with predictive immunological properties.

AB  - Cancer diagnoses have been increasing worldwide, and solid tumors are among the leading contributors to patient mortality, creating an enormous burden on the global healthcare system. Cancer is responsible for around 10.3 million deaths worldwide. Solid tumors are one of the most prevalent cancers observed in recent times. On the other hand, early diagnosis is a significant challenge that could save a person's life. Treatment with existing methods has pitfalls that limit the successful elimination of the disorder. Though nanoparticle-based imaging and therapeutics have shown a significant impact in healthcare, current methodologies for solid tumor treatment are insufficient. There are multiple complications associated with the diagnosis and management of solid tumors as well. Recently, surface-conjugated nanoparticles such as lipid nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, and quantum dots have shown positive results in solid tumor diagnostics and therapeutics in preclinical models. Other nanotheranostic material platforms such as plasmonic theranostics, magnetotheranostics, hybrid nanotheranostics, and graphene theranostics have also been explored. These nanoparticle theranostics ensure the appropriate targeting of tumors along with selective delivery of cargos (both imaging and therapeutic probes) without affecting the surrounding healthy tissues. Though they have multiple applications, nanoparticles still possess numerous limitations that need to be addressed in order to be fully utilized in the clinic. In this review, we outline the importance of materials and design strategies used to engineer nanoparticles in the treatment and diagnosis of solid tumors and how effectively each method overcomes the drawbacks of the current techniques. We also highlight the gaps in each material platform and how design considerations can address their limitations in future research directions.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide and declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. Albeit, unprecedented efforts have been made from the scientific community to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease, the host immune and inflammatory responses are not explored well in the Indian population. Continuous arrival of new variants fascinated the scientists to understand the host immune processes and to eradicate this deadly virus. The aim of this study was to see the helper and cellular host immune responses including memory and activated cell subsets of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at different time intervals during the treatment. PBMCs separated from nine patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were incubated with fluorescent conjugated antibodies and acquired on flow cytometer machine to analyze the T and B cell subsets. The results in COVID-19 patients versus healthy volunteers were as follows: elevated helper T cells (57.4% vs 44.9%); low cytotoxic T cells (42.8% vs 55.6%), and activated T (17.7% vs 21.2%) subsets. Both, TREG (40.15% vs 51.7%) and TH17 (13.2% vs 24.6%) responses were substantially decreased and high expression of TREG markers was observed in these patients compared with controls.

TI  - Household transmission investigation for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a rural and urban population of north India
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Transmissibility within closed settings, such as households, can provide a strategic way to characterize the virus transmission patterns because the denominator can be well defined. We aimed to characterize the household transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) and its associated risk factors.
   Methods
   This prospective case-ascertained study was conducted among the household contacts of laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 cases residing in Ballabgarh, Haryana. We enrolled 148 index cases and their 645 household contacts between December 16, 2020 and June 24, 2021. We defined household contact as any person who had resided in the same household as a confirmed COVID-19 case. Baseline data collection and sample collection for real time- reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM/IgG against SARS CoV-2 were done on day 1 visit, and followed for a period of 28 days. RT-PCR was repeated on day 14 or whenever the contact is symptomatic and blood sample for serology was repeated on day 28. We estimated household secondary infection rate (SIR) and other epidemiological indicators-median incubation period and serial interval. We employed binomial logistic regression to quantify risk factors associated with infection.
   Results
   The household SIR was 30.5% (95% CI: 27.1-34.1%). The secondary clinical attack rate was 9.3% (95% CI: 7.2-11.8). The risk factors that showed higher susceptibility to infection were household contacts who were the primary care giver of the case, whose index cases were symptomatic, those with underlying medical conditions, those living in overcrowded households, who were sharing toilet with the index cases and also who were not wearing a mask when coming in contact with the case. The median (IQR) incubation period was 4 days (4, 5), mean (SD) serial interval 6.4 (+/- 2.2) days, and median (IQR) serial interval 5 days (5, 7).
   Conclusion
   Households favour secondary transmission of SARS CoV- 2, hence, index cases are recommended to self-isolate and wear masks; and household contacts to follow strict COVID infection control measures within households when a family member is infected.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of self-citation has not been dis-cussed in the neurosurgery literature, although citations, citation indices, and impact of research may enhance funding opportunities, academic positions, fellowship opportunities, employment, and professional identity development. We sought to assess the magnitude and role of self-citation in academic neurosurgery.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the citation and self-citation rates of articles published in 2001-2020 in 7 major neurosurgery journals: Acta Neuro-chirurgica, Journal of Neurosurgery, Journal of Neurosur-gery: Pediatrics, Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine, Neurosurgery, Neurosurgical Review, and World Neurosurgery.RESULTS: The total number of citations was highest for Journal of Neurosurgery and lowest for Neurosurgical Review. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine had the highest average number of citations per article, followed closely by Journal of Neurosurgery. The self-citation rate increased for all journals over the time period 2001-2020. The highest number of self-citations per article during 2016-2020 was seen in Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics and World Neurosurgery. Neurosurgical Review had the lowest number of self-citations per article.CONCLUSIONS: Academic neurosurgeons must under-stand the ecosystem around self-citation. In our study, we found overall low levels of self-citations in neurosurgery journals with a few outliers. We have, however, noticed an increasing trend in self-citation rates. Self-citation rates should be considered while evaluating the impact of an author and research productivity. Contrary to popular belief, self-citation is not always unethical and must be understood within its circumstances.

AB  - Multimodal neuroimaging data of various brain disorders provides valuable information to understand brain function in health and disease. Various neuroimaging-based databases have been developed that mainly consist of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We present the comprehensive web-based neuroimaging platform "SWADESH" for hosting multi-disease, multimodal neuroimaging, and neuropsychological data along with analytical pipelines. This novel initiative includes neurochemical and magnetic susceptibility data for healthy and diseased conditions, acquired using MR spectroscopy (MRS) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) respectively. The SWADESH architecture also provides a neuroimaging database which includes MRI, MRS, functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), QSM, neuropsychological data and associated data analysis pipelines. Our final objective is to provide a master database of major brain disease states (neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and others) and to identify characteristic features and biomarkers associated with such disorders.

AB  - Recarbrio is a novel antibiotic approved by US-FDA. It was initially found to be useful in treating various resistant gram negative infections. A recent investigation revealed lack of methodological and scientific integrity behind the process of FDA approval for this drug. This incident is a lesson for us that we shall not consider FDA clearance as the gold standard before approving any drug in the Indian market or start using it before having adequate data from our own clinical settings.

AB  - Background Tumor cell-monocyte interactions play crucial roles in shaping up the pro-tumorigenic phenotype and functional output of tumor-associated macrophages. Within the tumor microenvironment, such heterotypic cell-cell interactions are known to occur via secretory proteins. Secretory proteins establish a diabolic liaison between tumor cells and monocytes, leading to their recruitment, subsequent polarization and consequent tumor progression.
   Methods We co-cultured model lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 with model monocytes, THP-1 to delineate the interactions between them. The levels of prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Migration, invasion and attachment independence of lung cancer cells was assessed by wound healing, transwell invasion and colony formation assays respectively. The status of EMT was evaluated by immunofluorescence. Identification of secretory proteins differentially expressed in monocultures and co-culture was carried out using SILAC LC-MS/MS. Various insilico tools like Cytoscape, Reacfoam, CHAT and Kaplan-Meier plotter were utilized for association studies, pathway analysis, functional classification, cancer hallmark relevance and predicting the prognostic potential of the candidate secretory proteins respectively.
   Results Co-culture of A549 and THP-1 cells in 1:10 ratio showed early release of prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6, however anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 was observed to be released at the highest time point. The conditioned medium obtained from this co-culture ratio promoted the migration, invasion and colony formation as well as the EMT of A549 cells. Co-culturing of A549 with THP-1 cells modulated the secretion of proteins involved in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT, inflammation, angiogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis. Among these proteins Versican, Tetranectin, IGFBP2, TUBB4B, C2 and IFI30 were found to correlate with the inflammatory and pro-metastatic milieu observed in our experimental setup. Furthermore, dysregulated expression of these proteins was found to be associated with poor prognosis and negative disease outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma compared to other cancer types. Pharmacological interventions targeting these proteins may serve as useful therapeutic approaches in lung adenocarcinoma.
   Conclusion In this study, we have demonstrated that the lung cancer cell-monocyte cross-talk modulates the secretion of IFI30, RNH1, CLEC3B, VCAN, IGFBP2, C2 and TUBB4B favoring tumor growth and metastasis.

AB  - Dengue is one of the fairly prevalent viral infections at the world level transmitted through mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). Due to various environmental factors, dengue cases surged rapidly at the global level in recent decades, with 193245 cases in 2021 and an increment of 110473 cases in 2022. There is no antidote available against dengue and other flaviviruses. In the absence of a dengue vaccine or specific antiviral, medicinal plants or their products can be the only choice for its effective management. Ocimum sanctum is known as ''The Incomparable One,'' ''Mother Medicine of Nature'' and ''Queen of Herbs'' in Ayurveda, and is considered an "elixir of life" supreme in both healthcare and spiritual terms. In present study eugenol was isolated in O.sanctum. Eugenol (1-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-allylbenzene) has been substantially responsible for its therapeutic potential. High-performance thin-layer chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy were applied to identify the compound. The Rf value of isolated compound was same in the chromatogram (0.69 + 0.05) with compare to standard. The safe dose of plant and eugenol were found as < 31.25 mu g/ml and < 15.62 mu g/ml. The anti-dengue activity was assessed in C6/36 cell lines, their effect was determined through Quantitative PCR. The NMR of the isolated eugenol showed similar properties as the commercial marker compound. The eugenol and SFE extract of O. sanctum showed the inhibition of 99.28% and completely against Dengue-2, respectively. Docking study exposed that the interaction of eugenol with NS1 and NS5 dengue protein showed the binding energy as - 5.33 and - 5.75 kcal/mol, respectively. The eugenol from the O. sanctum plant has the potential to be a good source of future treatment medications for dengue illness, as well as a valuable tool in its successful management

AB  - A 6-year-old boy with a case of double outlet right ventricle with large non-routable ventricle septal defect and severe pulmonary stenosis was deemed unsuitable for biventricular repair on a prior evaluation. Hence, a bidirectional Glenn (BDG) shunt was performed at 3 years of age following cardiac catheterization. He presented this time with worsening cyanosis and exertional breathlessness. The saturation was 88% at room air and the cardiac catheterization was performed before the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC, Fontan) operation. The mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure was 14 mmHg while the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 10 mmHg. The ventricular angiogram revealed normal contractility and moderate atrioventricular valve regurgitation besides showing a generous antegrade flow in the pulmonary arteries.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThis article delves into recent advances in same-day neurosurgery (SDNS), specifically concerning indications, perioperative protocol, safety, and outcomes. Additionally, it explores the recent updates on awake craniotomy and awake spine surgery.Recent findingsThere is an evolving body of literature on studies about SDNS that reaffirm its safety and feasibility. awake craniotomy is associated with lesser neurological deficits and better survival benefits in patients with lesions in eloquent areas. Monitored anesthesia care, compared with the asleep-awake-asleep technique, is associated with lower failure rates, shorter procedure time, and shorter length of stay. However, the incidence of intraoperative seizures is lower with the asleep-awake-asleep technique. Propofol-based and dexmedetomidine-based anesthesia are similar with regard to procedure duration, intraoperative adverse events, and patient satisfaction; however, surgeon satisfaction is higher with dexmedetomidine-based anesthesia. In spine surgery, regional anesthesia when compared with general anesthesia, is associated with less intraoperative blood loss and a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after 24 h. In addition, implementing an enhanced multimodal analgesia protocol improved disability scores and reduced the likelihood of postoperative complications.SummarySDNS offers promising prospects for patients and healthcare providers alike, with the potential to provide well tolerated, efficient, and cost-effective neurosurgical care in carefully selected cases.

AB  - Background & objectives:Postpartum depression and anxiety (PPD/A) impact a woman's physical and psychological wellbeing. In the absence of corroboratory evidence from the community setting in India, the present study was undertaken to examine the prevalence, psychosocial correlates and risk factors for PPD/A in the rural community of India.Methods:This cross-sectional study included 680 women during the postpartum period from a rural community in northern India. Screening for PPD/A was done using Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Diagnostic assessment of screened-positive women was done using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The psychosocial evaluation was done on parameters including women's social support, bonding with the child, functionality, parental stress, interpersonal violence and marital satisfaction.Results:The overall prevalence of PPD/A/both in community women was 5.6 per cent, with a specific prevalence of 2.2 per cent for PPD, 0.74 per cent for PPA and 2.8 per cent for both disorders. Comparative analysis indicated that women with PPD/A/both experienced significantly higher levels of parenting stress, poor lifestyle (prior two weeks), less support from their partner, parents-in-law and parents, less marital satisfaction, high intimate partner violence, poor bonding with infants and higher infant-focussed anxiety. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, higher education, marital satisfaction, support from partners and in-laws were associated with reducing the risk of PPD/A/both.Interpretation & conclusions:Rural Indian women experience PPD/A/both which causes stress and impacts their functionality, bonding with the infant and relationship with their spouse and parents. Higher education, marital satisfaction and higher support from partners and in-laws reduce the risk of developing PPD/A/both.

AB  - Introduction: Since 1990, the proportional contribution of mental disorders to India's total disease burden has nearly doubled, but the number of psychiatrists has not increased proportionately. Even after two decades of District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) launch, a considerable treatment gap still exists for mental illness. The present study aimed to map all health facilities providing mental health services and all psychiatrists in district Faridabad, Haryana.Methods: The starting point was the information available with the DMHP and district health office. This was supplemented by web search and snowball sampling. All identified facilities were visited to map the mental health services provided. All the mental health care providers and health care facilities were mapped using "Google my Maps". 2011 census data on population were used.Results: In Faridabad, 0.88 psychiatrists per lakh population were present. Most psychiatrists were concentrated in the urban area. The number of psychiatrists per lakh population was 1.1 in urban, compared to 0.54 in rural Faridabad. Clustering of mental health facilities was also observed more in urban areas (8.7 per 100 Sq Km) compared to rural areas (0.95 per 100 Sq Km) of district Faridabad.Conclusion: There was a scarcity of psychiatric manpower and facilities in the district with a distinct urban skew.

AB  - Background & objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by chronic ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). Although hyperandrogenism is one of the major features of PCOS, it is rarely observed in southeast Asia. Recently, however, there has been growing evidence on association of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) with PCOS. The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic potentials of AMH in PCOS individuals.Methods: This case-control study included a total of 131 women with PCOS and 49 healthy controls who were enrolled after the exclusion of secondary causes of PCOS. Serum AMH was measured using an ultra-sensitive AMH ELISA kit in addition to other diagnostic biomarkers. Statistical analyses was carried out using the Student's t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Spearman's rank correlation test and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis.Results: The median AMH values were 8.5 ng/ml and 2.5 ng/ml in the study group and controls, respectively (P<0.001). The normal cutoff value of 4.1 ng/ml for AMH was derived from ROC curve analysis. With a 4.1 ng/ml cut-off value, high levels of AMH was found in about 84 per cent of PCOS cases. However, no significant difference in AMH level was noted between age groups (<20 vs. >= 20 yr), body mass index (BMI) (<25 vs. >= 25 kg/m(2)) and PCOM types. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for AMH yielded diagnostic range values. In total PCOS cases, AUC was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88 and 0.96), and in phenotype A PCOS cases, AUC was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91 and 0.98). The correlation test also showed no association with BMI, the FG score, PCOM, free androgen index, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and luteinizing hormone. However, a weak correlation was observed with testosterone in total PCOS cases and with DHT as well as age in phenotype A PCOS cases. The prediction model for PCOS using multivariable binary logistic regression analysis showed AMH as the best marker.Interpretation & conclusions: The results of this study suggest that AMH can be considered as the most promising biomarker in PCOS women, particularly with phenotype A and phenotype D.

AB  - Aim This qualitative study explores with health professionals the provision of, and challenges for, postdischarge stroke care, focussing on eating, drinking and psychological support across India.
   Design Qualitative semistructured interviews.
   Setting Seven geographically diverse hospitals taking part in a Global Health Research Programme on Improving Stroke Care in India.
   Participants A purposive sample of healthcare professionals with current experience of working with patients who had a stroke.
   Results Interviews with 66 healthcare professionals (23 nurses (14 staff nurses; 7 senior nurse officers; 1 intensive care unit nurse; 1 palliative care nurse)); 16 doctors (10 neurologists; 6 physicians); 10 physiotherapists; 5 speech and language therapists; 4 occupational therapists; 4 dieticians; 2 psychiatrists; and 2 social workers resulted in three main themes: integrated inpatient discharge care planning processes; postdischarge patient and caregiver role and challenges; patient and caregiver engagement post discharge.
   Conclusions Discharge planning was integrated and customised, although resources were limited in some sites. Task shifting compensated for a lack of specialists but was limited by staff education and training. Caregivers faced challenges in accessing and providing postdischarge care. Postdischarge care was mainly hospital based, supported by teleservices, especially for rural populations. Further research is needed to understand postdischarge care provision and the needs of stroke survivors and their caregivers.

AB  - Secondary prevention of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) involves continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis among affected individuals and is recognised as a cornerstone of public health programmes that address these conditions. However, several important scientific issues around the secondary prevention paradigm remain unresolved. This report details research priorities for secondary prevention that were developed as part of a workshop convened by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in November 2021. These span basic, translational, clinical and population science research disciplines and are built on four pillars. First, we need a better understanding of RHD epidemiology to guide programmes, policies, and clinical and public health practice. Second, we need better strategies to find and diagnose people affected by ARF and RHD. Third, we urgently need better tools to manage acute RF and slow the progression of RHD. Fourth, new and existing technologies for these conditions need to be better integrated into healthcare systems. We intend for this document to be a reference point for research organisations and research sponsors interested in contributing to the growing scientific community focused on RHD prevention and control.

AB  - The nasal dominance (ND) determination is crucial for nasal synchronized ventilator, optimum nasal drug delivery, identifying brain hemispheric dominance, nasal airway obstruction surgery, mindfulness breathing, and for possible markers of a conscious state. Given these wider applications of ND, it is interesting to understand the patterns of ND with varying temperature and respiration rates. In this paper, we propose a method which measures peak-to-peak temperature oscillations (difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory temperature) for the left and right nostrils during nasal breathing. These nostril-specific temperature oscillations are further used to calculate the nasal dominance index (NDI), nasal laterality ratio (NLR), inter-nostril correlation, and mean of peak-to-peak temperature oscillation for inspiratory and expiratory phase at (1) different ambient temperatures of 18 & DEG;C, 28 & DEG;C, and 38 & DEG;C and (2) at three different respiration rate of 6 bpm, 12 bpm, and 18 bpm. The peak-to-peak temperature (T pp) oscillation range (averaged across participants; n = 8) for the left and right nostril were 3.80 & PLUSMN; 0.57 & DEG;C and 2.34 & PLUSMN; 0.61 & DEG;C, 2.03 & PLUSMN; 0.20 & DEG;C and 1.40 & PLUSMN; 0.26 & DEG;C, and 0.20 & PLUSMN; 0.02 & DEG;C and 0.29 & PLUSMN; 0.03 & DEG;C at the ambient temperature of 18 & DEG;C, 28 & DEG;C, and 38 & DEG;C respectively (averaged across participants and respiration rates). The NDI and NLR averaged across participants and three different respiration rates were 35.67 & PLUSMN; 5.53 and 2.03 & PLUSMN; 1.12; 8.36 & PLUSMN; 10.61 and 2.49 & PLUSMN; 3.69; and -25.04 & PLUSMN; 14.50 and 0.82 & PLUSMN; 0.54 at the ambient temperature of 18 & DEG;C, 28 & DEG;C, and 38 & DEG;C respectively. The Shapiro-Wilk test, and non-parametric Friedman test showed a significant effect of ambient temperature conditions on both NDI and NLR. No significant effect of respiration rate condition was observed on both NDI and NLR. The findings of the proposed study indicate the importance of ambient temperature while determining ND during the diagnosis of breathing disorders such as septum deviation, nasal polyps, nosebleeds, rhinitis, and nasal fractions, and in the intensive care unit for nasal synchronized ventilator.

AB  - Background:Hiatal hernia (HH), whenever encountered during sleeve gastrectomy (SG), needs to be addressed because of its strong association with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the mid-term to long-term effects of hiatal hernia repair (HHR) on GERD remain unclear.Methods:This was a cross-sectional observational analysis of patients who underwent SG + HHR and had completed at least 1 year of follow-up. The preoperative data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Of the 590 patients who underwent SG, 63 patients (10.7%) with concomitant HHR were assessed for the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and symptoms of GERD using the GERD-Q questionnaire.Results:Of the 63 patients, 11 were lost to follow-up, and one underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for HH recurrence and severe reflux. The remaining 51 patients were assessed at a mean follow-up of 3.7 +/- 2.0 years. Of these, 51% (26/51) patients had preoperative reflux symptoms. On follow-up, 69.2% (18/26) had complete resolution with significant improvement in their GERD-Q scores (9.8 +/- 3.1 to 6.5 +/- 2.1; P=0.001), while 76.2% (16/21) of patients were off the PPIs. The incidence of de novo GERD was found in 20% (5/25) of the patients.Conclusions:In patients of morbid obesity with HH, concomitant HHR with SG leads to improvement of the reflux symptoms in more than two-thirds of the patients, besides alleviating the use of PPIs.

AB  - Introduction The effects of COVID-19 infection persist beyond the active phase. Comprehensive description and analysis of the post COVID sequelae in various population groups are critical to minimise the long-term morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. This analysis was conducted with an objective to estimate the frequency of post COVID sequelae and subsequently, design a framework for holistic management of post COVID morbidities.Methods Follow-up data collected as part of a registry-based observational study in 31 hospitals across India since September 2020-October 2022 were used for analysis. All consenting hospitalised patients with COVID-19 are telephonically followed up for up to 1 year post-discharge, using a prestructured form focused on symptom reporting.Results Dyspnoea, fatigue and mental health issues were reported among 18.6%, 10.5% and 9.3% of the 8042 participants at first follow-up of 30-60 days post-discharge, respectively, which reduced to 11.9%, 6.6% and 9%, respectively, at 1-year follow-up in 2192 participants. Patients who died within 90 days post-discharge were significantly older (adjusted OR (aOR): 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), with at least one comorbidity (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.35), and a higher proportion had required intensive care unit admission during the initial hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (aOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.06) and were discharged at WHO ordinal scale 6-7 (aOR: 49.13 95% CI: 25.43, 94.92). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (at least one dose) was protective against such post-discharge mortality (aOR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03).Conclusion Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience a variety of long-term sequelae after discharge from hospitals which persists although in reduced proportions until 12 months post-discharge. Developing a holistic management framework with engagement of care outreach workers as well as teleconsultation is a way forward in effective management of post COVID morbidities as well as reducing mortality.

AB  - F-18-FDG uptake in radiation pneumonitis is well documented; however, the same is less so for F-18-floroestradiol (FES), which specifically binds to the estrogen receptors in vivo. We observed increased FES uptake in the right lung of an estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patient who had undergone right modified radical mastectomy followed by radiation therapy to chest wall. The possibility of FES uptake in radiation pneumonitis must therefore be kept in mind while interpreting FES PET.

AB  - A 12-year-old boy presented with abdominal distention for 1 year. On examination, he had massive hepatomegaly. Facial swelling in the maxillary region, palpable left cervical lymph nodes, and a nasal twang to his voice were detected. Imaging showed multiple hypodense liver lesions, necrotic mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, multiple lytic-sclerotic skeletal lesions, and lesions in the nasopharynx and maxilla. Fine needle aspirate ( FNA) from the cervical lymph node yielded blood. FNA from the liver showed singly dispersed and cohesive clusters of tumor cells, with interspersed neutrophils and tingible body macrophages. Cells had scant to moderate fragile cytoplasm, enlarged vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry on cell block revealed positivity for cytokeratin and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-Latent Membrane Protein-1 (LMP1). A diagnosis of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was made, and was confirmed on a subsequent biopsy from the femur.

AB  - Introduction Exposure to fine particulate matter has been associated with several cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases. However, such evidence mostly originates from low-pollution settings or cross-sectional studies, thus necessitating evidence from regions with high air pollution levels, such as India, where the burden of non-communicable diseases is high.Research design and methods We studied the associations between ambient PM2.5 levels and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among 12 064 participants in an adult cohort from urban Chennai and Delhi, India. A meta-analytic approach was used to combine estimates, obtained from mixed-effects models and proportional hazards models, from the two cities.Results We observed that 10 mu g/m(3) differences in monthly average exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a 0.40 mg/dL increase in FPG (95% CI 0.22 to 0.58) and 0.021 unit increase in HbA1c (95% CI 0.009 to 0.032). Further, 10 mu g/m3 differences in annual average PM2.5 was associated with 1.22 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.36) times increased risk of incident T2DM, with non-linear exposure response.Conclusions We observed evidence of temporal association between PM2.5 exposure, and higher FPG and incident T2DM in two urban environments in India, thus highlighting the potential for population-based mitigation policies to reduce the growing burden of diabetes.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remain the most distressing event in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine containing regimen in preventing CINV in children on HEC and MEC. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials electronic databases to identify randomized clinical trials that compared 2 groups who either got olanzapine (olanzapine group) or placebo/no olanzapine (control group) for the prevention of CINV in children. The primary outcome was to determine the efficacy of olanzapine (complete response). The secondary outcomes were nausea control, the need for rescue medications, and adverse events of olanzapine. Three randomized clinical trials (n=394 patients) were included in this meta-analysis (olanzapine group, n=194, and placebo/control group, n=200). The pooled analysis of this meta-analysis found that olanzapine had a higher complete response in all phases of emesis in the HEC group and only in the acute phase in HEC/MEC groups compared with the control group. Olanzapine had higher nausea control in all phases of HEC but no nausea control in HEC/MEC. Olanzapine also reduced the need for rescue medications. A significant number of patients in the olanzapine group experienced somnolence (grades 1 and 2), but none of the participants discontinued the study due to side effects. In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed that olanzapine significantly prevented CINV in HEC. There was also a lesser need for rescue medications in the olanzapine group. Somnolence was higher in the olanzapine group, but it was clinically insignificant.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to identify factors predicting outcomes following pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction in complex oromandibular defects.Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care oncology center in South Asia from January 2020 to May 2022 to include consecutive cases of complex oromandibular defects reconstructed with pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. During pectoralis major myocu-taneous flap harvest surgical modifications were incorporated to preserve the choke vessel from the fourth intercostal perforator and lateral pedicle supply apart from the main pedicle from acromiothoracic artery.Results: In our series of 196 patients, overall flap compromise was noted in 17.6% with the most common pattern of failure being partial full -thickness necrosis (n = 23) and complete flap loss was identified in only 3 cases. The factors that showed statistically significant correlation with flap outcome in the univariate model were female sex (42.9% vs. 14.9%) associated with a higher incidence of flap compromise, while bipaddle pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (2.2% vs. 17.3%) and larger surface area of skin paddle (>49 cm2) (20.2%, 16%, and 0% in <49 cm(2), 50-96 cm(2), and >96 cm(2), respectively) were factors favoring a better outcome. Factors that emerged as independent prognostic variables in the multivariate model were female sex (odds ratio: 9.801, P = .001) and high body mass index (odds ratio: 1.19, P = .03) signifying a higher incidence of flap compromise.Conclusion: Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is still the "workhorse" of head and neck reconstruction. Nevertheless, the female sex and high body mass index may serve as deterrents to the success of this flap.

AB  - IntroductionHeterogeneous and nonspecific symptoms make invasive endometriosis a difficult entity to diagnose. Small lesions with absent associated changes can be easily missed in cross-sectional imaging. Even when the lesions satisfy the thresholds for various investigations, their appearance changes with cyclical fluctuations in the hormonal levels. Therefore, newer approaches are needed to achieve correct diagnosis.MethodsSix females in reproductive age group (mean age = 32.5 & PLUSMN; 4.3 years) were retrospectively selected, wherein the diagnosis of invasive endometriosis was confirmed after 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Indications for PET/CT were staging in 4 patients, suspected progression in 1 and suspected inflammatory bowel disease in one patient. The study was repeated in proliferative phase in two patients and in the menstrual phase in another patient. FNAC was available in two patients and a drop in CA125 was documented in the last patient.ResultsIn five patients metabolically active lesions were seen in PET/CT and in the last, activity was absent despite symptoms. Repeat menstrual phase imaging in the last patient confirmed the diagnosis. In two patients with metabolically active lesions at baseline, resolution was seen in proliferative phase PET/CT. In the other two patients, repeat study was not indicated as FNAC revealed normal endometrial tissue and in the last patient, significant drop in CA125 was documented after just 2 weeks. In all of these patients, the final diagnosis was of invasive endometriosis.ConclusionIn reproductive-age women, PET/CT acquisition should be optimized in the context of menstrual cycle. This approach can be used to non-invasively rule in/rule out endometriosis, especially with repeat imaging in proper menstrual phase.

AB  - The study aims to determine the difference in the skeletal maturation of unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) and non-cleft children. This study also attempts to determine sexual dimorphism in attaining skeletal maturation between UCLP and non-cleft children. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study. The total sample consisted of the lateral cephalogram of 131 UCLP (62 female and 71 male) children and 500 (274 female and 226 male) non-cleft children. The reviewer used the Baccetti method (2005) to review all the cephalograms for the cervical vertebrae maturation (CVM) stages. T-test was used to compare the mean chronological age and skeletal maturation of cleft and non-cleft children at each CVM stage. There was no significant difference in the mean chronological age and skeletal maturation status of UCLP and non-cleft children. There was no significant difference in skeletal maturation based on sex. The intraobserver assessment showed 80% and 85% kappa agreement, signifying absolute agreement. The correlation coefficient between chronological age and CVMIs was 0.86 (P<0.001) in cleft children and 0.76 (P<0.001) in non-cleft children, which was highly significant. The study indicates no significant difference in the skeletal maturation of UCLP and non-cleft children and no sex-related difference.

Evidence of linkage of common mental disorders (CMDs) including depression and anxiety disorders with DM is sparsely reported from community-based settings. Objective: The present study aimed to study the association between CMDs and DM among adult population (>30 years) residing in a rural area of North India. Materials and Methods: A community-based case-control study was conducted in 28 villages of Ballabgarh block of Faridabad district of Haryana. Cases (diabetes) were recruited from the community with at least 1 year of diabetes. Age- and sex-matched two neighborhood controls were selected from the same community. Diabetic status was confirmed using glycated hemoglobin. CMDs such as depression and anxiety disorders were screened using PRIME-MD Hindi version. Conditional logistic regression was used to study the relationship between diabetes and CMDs. Results: Total 211 cases (diabetic) and 273 controls (nondiabetic) were approached for the study, of which 173 cases and 175 controls were analyzed. Cases and controls were comparable with respect to age, sex, and socioeconomic status. CMDs were found more among cases as compared to controls (67.5% vs. 37.5%) (P < 0.001). On conditional logistic regression analysis, CMDs were significantly higher among diabetes cases (adjusted odds ratio - 3.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.9-5.2). Conclusion: Strong evidence of coexistence of CMDs and DM from this population-based study necessitates the need of incorporation of management of CMDs into diabetes control program in India.

AB  - Objectives More than 50% patients develop emesis during induction therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The addition of aprepitant for emesis control in children receiving induction for AML have not been explored.Methods A single-institutional randomised, open-label trial (NCT02979548) was conducted where children between 5 and 18 years with the diagnosis of AML being planned for 3+7 induction regimen were included. All study participants received ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg) every 8 hours for 8 days starting 30 min prior to chemotherapy. Children belonging to aprepitant group additionally received aprepitant capsules (15-40 kg=days 1-3, 80 mg; >40 kg=day 1, 125 mg and days 2-3, 80 mg) starting from 1 hour prior to chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with complete response (CR) in chemotherapy induced vomiting (CIV) in acute phase (day 1-8), delayed phase (day 9-13), overall and initial 96 hours were recorded along with severity of vomiting and adverse effects.Results Total 78 children were randomised (Aprepitant group: 37 and control group: 41). The proportion of patients with CR in CIV was significantly higher in Aprepitant group in acute phase (p=0.007), overall phase (p=0.007) and in initial 96 hours (p<0.001) but it was not different in delayed phase (p=0.07). The first episode of vomiting was also significantly delayed in aprepitant group (p=0.02). Adverse effect profile was similar in two groups.Conclusion Aprepitant significantly improves emesis control in children receiving induction therapy for AML, especially in acute phase and should be routinely incorporated as part of antiemetic prophylaxis.

AB  - Background: Aim is to find correlation between 2D-gamma passing rate and 3D-DVHbased pre-treatment patient-specific quality assurance. Materials and Methods: 21 head and neck and 21 pelvis patients, treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were selected for this study. All patients were planned with Elekta VersaHD linear accelerator using Monaco (5.11) treatment planning system. 2D-planar dose measurements were performed with IBA-I'matriXX evolution detector-array using MyQA-Patients software. For 2D-Gamma index evaluation, 3%/3mm and 2%/2mm criteria were used. 3D-dose measurements were performed using the IBA-COMPASS system. For 3D measurement, Monaco and COMPASS doses were compared in terms of percentage dose differences to PTV and organs at risk. For PTV D95, D2, and D50 (dose received by 95%, 2%, and 50% volume), similarly for OARs D2 and D50 were noted. 3D Gamma index was also noted. Correlation coefficient and its corresponding two-tailed p-value (<= 0.05, for statistically significant) were calculated for 2D-gamma passing rate and 3D Gamma index & percentage dose differences of 3D-DVH based metrics (Monaco calculated versus COMPASS measured). Strength of correlation will be considered weak or strong based on the r -value. Results: 2D-Gamma index passing rate was 98.6 +/- 1.8%, 92.1 +/- 7.1% and 98.5 +/- 1.3%, 93.5 +/- 4.4% for head-neck and pelvis patients (3%/3mm, 2%/2mm criteria) respectively. Percentage dose-differences for PTV D95, D2, D50 for head-neck and pelvis were: 4.22 +/- 2.09%, 4.25 +/- 2.23%, 3.93 +/- 1.59 & 0.60 +/- 1.96%, 1.53 +/- 1.64%, 1.59 +/- 1.20% respectively. Spine and brainstem D2 were 0.84 +/- 6.10%, 0.77 +/- 2.70%, bladder and rectum D50 were 3.75 +/- 3.31%, -2.19 +/- 3.60%. Conclusion: No strong correlation was observed between the 2D Gamma passing rate and 3D measurements.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for enhanced protective measures for healthcare workers, particularly surgeons, who face a heightened risk of exposure to infectious aerosols. However, conventional eye protection equipment such as face shields, goggles, or glasses often leads to ergonomic discomfort and a reduced field of view (FOV), impeding surgeons' ability to perform microsurgical procedures with precision and ease. To address these limitations, this study aimed to develop personalized 3D-printed eye gear for microscopic surgeons based on facial anthropometry data. 3D scanning was employed to obtain facial data from ten neurosurgery residents. Utilizing computer-aided designing, eye gears tailored to the unique facial features of each participant were developed. Finite element analysis-based contact simulation was used to assess the pressure exerted by the eye gear. Multi-material 3D printing was employed to fabricate the personalized eye gear. Participants, while donning the eye gear, engaged in simulation-based micro suturing tasks at various magnifications of the operating microscope, and marked the FOV range. They provided feedback scores (1-10) on the effectiveness of the eye gear through a Likert scale questionnaire (Q1-Q8). Finite element analysis demonstrated uniform strain distribution on the face, indicating that the edges of the customized eye gear fit exactly to the user's face. The average scores for the questionnaire Q1 to Q8 ranged from 6.8 to 8.5, with an overall mean score of 7.6. This indicates that the developed eye gear was simple to use and did not cause any discomfort. Additionally, the average reduction in the FOV was only 10.93% across the different operating microscope magnifications. These findings highlight eye gear's potential to alleviate discomfort and enhance precision in microscopic surgeries. Consequently, personalized 3D-printed eye gear offers a promising solution for providing surgeons with a safe environment while preserving the benefits of the operating microscope.

AB  - Objective: We present a novel framework for the detection and continuous evaluation of 3D motion perception by deploying a virtual reality environment with built-in eye tracking. Methods: We created a biologically-motivated virtual scene that involved a ball moving in a restricted Gaussian random walk against a background of 1/f noise. Sixteen visually healthy participants were asked to follow the moving ball while their eye movements were monitored binocularly using the eye tracker. We calculated the convergence positions of their gaze in 3D using their fronto-parallel coordinates and linear least-squares optimization. Subsequently, to quantify 3D pursuit performance, we employed a first-order linear kernel analysis known as the Eye Movement Correlogram technique to separately analyze the horizontal, vertical and depth components of the eye movements. Finally, we checked the robustness of our method by adding systematic and variable noise to the gaze directions and re-evaluating 3D pursuit performance. Results: We found that the pursuit performance in the motion-through depth component was reduced significantly compared to that for fronto-parallel motion components. We found that our technique was robust in evaluating 3D motion perception, even when systematic and variable noise was added to the gaze directions. Conclusion: The proposed framework enables the assessment of 3D Motion perception by evaluating continuous pursuit performance through eye-tracking. Significance: Our framework paves the way for a rapid, standardized and intuitive assessment of 3D motion perception in patients with various eye disorders.

AB  - The survival rate of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients is very poor, but it can be improved using highly sensitive, specific, and accurate techniques. Autofluorescence and fluorescence techniques are very sensitive and helpful in cancer screening; being directly linked with the molecular levels of human tissue, they can be used as a quantitative tool for cancer detection. Here, we report the development of multi-modal autofluorescence and fluorescence imaging and spectroscopic (MAF-IS) smartphone-based systems for fast and real-time oral cancer screening. MAF-IS system is indigenously developed and offers the advantages of being a low-cost, handy, non-contact, non-invasive, and easily operable device that can be employed in hospitals, including low-resource settings. In this study, we report the results of 43 individuals with 28 OSCC and 15 oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), i.e., epithelial dysplasia and oral submucous fibrosis, using the developed devices. We observed a red shift in fluorescence emission spectra in vivo. We found red-shift of 7.72 +/- 6 nm, 3 +/- 4.36 nm, and 1.33 +/- 0.47 nm in the case of OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and oral submucous fibrosis, respectively, compared to normal. The results were compared with histopathology and found to be consistent. Further, the MAF-IS system provides results in real-time with higher accuracy and sensitivity compared to devices using a single modality. Our system can achieve an accuracy of 97% with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 94.7%, respectively, even with a smaller number of patients (28 patients of OSCC). The proposed MAF-IS device has great potential for fast screening and diagnosis of oral cancer in the future.

AB  - Although entirely preventable, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), a disease of poverty and social disadvantage resulting in high morbidity and mortality, remains an ever-present burden in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and rural, remote, marginalised and disenfranchised populations within high-income countries. In late 2021, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop to explore the current state of science, to identify basic science and clinical research priorities to support RHD eradication efforts worldwide. This was done through the inclusion of multidisciplinary global experts, including cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular specialists as well as health policy and health economics experts, many of whom also represented or closely worked with patient-family organisations and local governments. This report summarises findings from one of the four working groups, the Tertiary Prevention Working Group, that was charged with assessing the management of late complications of RHD, including surgical interventions for patients with RHD. Due to the high prevalence of RHD in LMICs, particular emphasis was made on gaining a better understanding of needs in the field from the perspectives of the patient, community, provider, health system and policy-maker. We outline priorities to support the development, and implementation of accessible, affordable and sustainable interventions in low-resource settings to manage RHD and related complications. These priorities and other interventions need to be adapted to and driven by local contexts and integrated into health systems to best meet the needs of local communities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the short-term effect of ambient air pollution on daily acute respiratory emergency room visits among adults.METHODS: A time-series study (June 2017-February 2019) was carried out among adults (>= 18 years) visiting a multi-specialty hospital in Delhi. We evaluated the association between the daily levels of particulate matter (PM) <2.5 m in diameter (PM2.5) and PM <10 m in diameter (PM10), ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide and daily count of emergency room (ER) visits for acute respiratory symptoms. Generalised additive model (GAM) was used with the Poisson link function to analyse the associations for 0-1 to 0-7 lag days.RESULTS: A total of 69,400 ER visits were recorded, of which 2,669 were by adults due to acute respiratory symptoms. At 0-7 lag days, an increment of 1 standard deviation in NO2 and PM2.5 concentration was associated with a percentage increase in acute respiratory ER visits of respectively 53.0% (95% CI 30.84-78.97) and 19.5% (95% CI 4.53-36.65). During 0-7 lag days, a positive trend was observed at higher concentrations of CO (>1.86-3.28 mg/m(3)), while a negative significant association was observed at low concentrations of CO (<1.171 mg/m(3)).CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to ambient NO2 and PM2.5 was associated with acute respiratory emergency visits of adults at lag 0-7 days.

AB  - Introduction: Despite being a widely used screening questionnaire, there is no consensus on the most appropriate measurement model for the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Furthermore, there have been limited studies on its measurement invariance across cross-cultural subgroups, genders, and sexual orientations. Aims: The present study aimed to examine the fit of different measurement models for the AUDIT and its measurement invariance across a wide range of subgroups by country, language, gender, and sexual orientation. Methods: Responses concerning past-year alcohol use from the participants of the cross-sectional International Sex Survey were considered (N = 62,943; Mage: 32.73; SD = 12.59). Confirmatory factor analysis, as well as measurement invariance tests were performed for 21 countries, 14 languages, three genders, and four sexual orientation subgroups that met the minimum sample size requirement for inclusion in these analyses. Results: A two-factor model with factors describing 'alcohol use' (items 1-3) and 'alcohol problems' (items 4-10) showed the best model fit across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. For the former two, scalar and latent mean levels of invariance were reached considering different criteria. For gender and sexual orientation, a latent mean level of invariance was reached. Conclusions: In line with the two-factor model, the calculation of separate alcohol-use and alcohol-problem scores is recommended when using the AUDIT. The high levels of measurement invariance achieved for the AUDIT support its use in cross-cultural research, capable also of meaningful comparisons among genders and sexual orientations.

AB  - Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the use of targeted therapy using small molecules such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Since the introduction of ruxolitinib, the first non-selective JAK inhibitor approved for use in myelofibrosis, many other JAK inhibitors have been tried in a wide spectrum of immune-mediated disorders. Although various trials have shown the promising efficacy of JAK inhibitors in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs), there is a growing concern over the major cardiovascular events and malignancies associated with the use of these molecules in older adults, particularly those over 65 years of age. In this review, we aim to discuss the immunology of the JAK-STAT pathway, the scope of use of JAK inhibitors, and their safety in paediatric practice. Here, we discuss high-quality evidence favouring the use of JAK inhibitors in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who are refractory to one or more conventional/biological disease-modifying drugs, demonstrated in two randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In addition to JIA, there are reports favouring the role of JAK inhibitors in other IMIDs such as systemic-onset JIA and interferonopathies. Thus far, the existing literature suggests an acceptable safety profile for JAK inhibitors in children. With the expanding scope of JAK inhibitors in a wide range of IMIDs in children, there is a significant need for long-term close vigilance for any potential harm.

AB  - Background: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been recommended in the practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; however, their effects among patients with preserved ejection fraction have been debatable.Objective: We aim to evaluate the SGLT2 inhibitor effect among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved trials.Methods: We performed a systematic literature search using the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane libraries for relevant articles from inception until August 30th, 2022. Statistical analysis was performed by calculating hazard ratio (HR) using the random effect model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and probability value (P). Statistical significance was met if 95% CI does not cross numeric "1" and P < .05.Results: Six studies with a total of 15,989 total patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients enrolled in SGLT2 inhibitors and placebo was 69.13 and 69.37 years, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 2.24 years. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced composite cardiovascular mortality or first hospitalization for heart failure (HR, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.74-0.87], P < .001, I-2 = 0%), heart failure hospitalization (HR, 0.74 [95% CI: 0.67-0.82], P < .001, I-2 = 0%) compared with placebo. However, all-cause mortality (HR, 0.97 [95% CI: 0.89-1.06], P = .54, I-2 = 0%) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.96 [95% CI: 0.82-1.13), P = .66, I-2 = 35.09%] were comparable between both groups.Conclusion: Our study finding shows that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization; however, all-cause mortality was comparable between the groups.

AB  - There are major gaps in our understanding of food environments (FE) in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) witnessing differential and complex social and economic transition. The present integrative review was conducted to develop a conceptual framework of FE for LMICs using socio-ecological and access theory. The FE framework has four layers: public policy, community/neighborhood (including organizational e.g., markets, schools), household, and individual. Availability, accessibility, and affordability with built-in socio-cultural and contextual factors were the major domains in every layer. The following additional domains emerged: global influences, marketing and regulation, nutrition programs, time-constrained family members, and food behavior. Wet and informal markets are important components of FE. The next step is determining the model's resilience to accommodate and capture nuances across LMICs.

AB  - Introduction: Preeclampsia (PE) arises due to defective spiral artery remodelling which may be due to deficient migration of trophoblast cells. Migration of human endothelial cells has been shown to be promoted via Hydrogen sulphide(H2S)/Rho GTPase Rac1 axis. This novel role of H2S and its downstream processes have not yet been studied in the development and function of the placental trophoblast cells.Methods: Placental tissues were obtained post-delivery from consented preeclamptic and normotensive mothers (n = 60). The protein expression levels of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) along with its downstream migratory molecules were compared in both the arms. The pro-migratory role of H2S was investigated in a first trimester placental cell line.Results: H2S promoted the migration of trophoblast cells in a Rho GTPase dependent manner mediated by actin cytoskeleton reorganization. The reduced levels of H2S producing enzymes in the PE placentae along with decreased levels of Rho GTPases (Rac1 and Rho A) corroborate the results of PAG and AOAA treatment in down regulating the Rho GTPases in the in vitro grown placental cultures. Reduction of the migratory potential of trophoblastic cells caused due to hypoxia/reoxygenation was rescued by upregulating the H2S expression with the use of NaHS as a H2S donor.Discussion: Exogenous H2S increases the migratory potential of the placental cells in culture conditions and also post hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. H2S as a gaso-transmitter holds a great potential as a therapeutic agent. Its long-term effects need to be investigated using model systems (rat/mouse) of PE following it up with clinical regulatory trials.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) emerged in December 2019, causing a range of respiratory infections from mild to severe. This resulted in the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on public health. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020. Viruses are intracellular pathogens that rely on the host's machinery to establish a successful infection. They exploit the gene expression machinery of host cells to facilitate their own replication. Gaining a better understanding of gene expression modulation in SARS-CoV2 is crucial for designing and developing effective antiviral strategies. Efforts are currently underway to understand the molecular-level interaction between the host and the pathogen. In this review, we describe how SARS-CoV2 infection modulates gene expression by interfering with cellular processes, including transcription, post-transcription, translation, post-translation, epigenetic modifications as well as processing and degradation pathways. Additionally, we emphasise the therapeutic implications of these findings in the development of new therapies to treat SARS-CoV2 infection.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of incisional ropivacaine infiltration by presternal multi-orifice catheter to manage poststernotomy pain in pediatric cardiac surgery. Design: A prospective, randomized, and double-blind comparative study. Setting: At a single-institution tertiary referral cardiac center. Participants: The study comprised 200 children undergoing cardiac surgeries through a midline sternotomy. Interventions: Children were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups. Group A (n = 65) and group B (n = 64) received 0.375% ropivacaine infusion and intermittent bolus, respectively, by presternal multi-orifice catheter, whereas Group C (n = 64) did not receive any local anesthetic (LA) drug. Postoperatively, intravenous paracetamol was used for multimodal analgesia, and fentanyl was given as rescue analgesia, respectively. Measurements and main results: Pain was assessed by a Modified Objective Pain Score (MOPS) for 48 hours postextubation. Group B had significantly lower early MOPS at the first hour, but in the later period, the mean MOPS was lower in group A. The requirement of the first rescue analgesia was 3 +/- 1.51, 6.1 +/- 2.26, and 2.6 +/- 0.87 hours for groups A (n = 60), B (n = 60), and C (n = 60), respectively. The 48-hour fentanyl consumption was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in group A (0.5 +/- 0.68 <mu>g/kg) and group B (0.7 +/- 0.86 mu g/kg) than the control group (3.4 +/- 0.68 mu g/kg). The length of intensive care unit stay was lower (p < 0.001) in groups A and B than in group C; however, the length of hospital stay was comparable (p = 0.07). Conclusion: LA bolus and infusion through presternal multi-orifice catheter provided effective analgesia postoperatively. However, the bolus was more efficacious in the early phase but equivalent in later periods. Therefore, bolus and LA infusion can be used for steady poststernotomy pain relief in children undergoing cardiac surgeries.

AB  - Typhoid fever is a serious concern precisely in developing nations. Still investigators are exploring a better conjugate partner for Vi-polysaccharide to develop a more effective vaccine for typhoid fever. Here, we cloned and expressed S. Typhi outer membrane protein A (OmpA). The conjugation of Vi-polysaccharide with OmpA was carried out by the carbodiimide (EDAC) method employing ADH as a linker. Total Ig and IgG generated against OmpA, and Vi polysaccharide was quantified by ELISA. Vi polysaccharide alone induced very low levels of Vi polysaccharide antibody. Vi-OmpA conjugate (Vi-conjugate) elicited a robust immune response compared to Vi polysaccharide alone and showed booster response. Further, IgG was only evoked by Vi-OmpA conjugate, not with Vi polysaccharide alone. OmpA antibody induction in both the Vi-OmpA conjugate and OmpA were similar level. Taken together, we show that OmpA as a carrier protein conjugated to Vi polysaccharide is immunogenic. We predict OmpA antibodies will contribute protection along with antibodies generated by Vipolysaccharide. Past and current literature supports that OmpA is highly conserved protein not only among Salmonellae but entire Enterobacteriacea family with 96-100% identity.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood is termed early-onset type 2 diabetes. Cases of early-onset type 2 diabetes are increasing rapidly globally, alongside rising obesity. Compared with a diagnosis later in life, an earlier-onset diagnosis carries an unexplained excess risk of microvascular complications, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and earlier death. Women with early-onset type 2 diabetes also have a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The high burden of complications renders individuals with early-onset type 2 diabetes at future risk of multimorbidity and interventions to reverse these concerning trends should be a priority. Within the early-onset cohort, disease pathophysiology and interventions have been better studied in paediatric-onset (<19 years) type 2 diabetes compared to adults; however, young adults aged 19-39 years (a larger number proportionally) are not well characterised and are also invisible in the current evidence base supporting management, which is derived from trials in later-onset type 2 diabetes. Young adults with type 2 diabetes face challenges in self-management that older individuals are less likely to experience (being in education or of working age, higher diabetes distress, and possible obesity-related stigma and diabetes-related stigma). There is a major research gap as to the optimal strategies to deploy in managing type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults, given that current models of care appear to not work as well in this age group. In the face of manifold risk factors (obesity, female sex, social deprivation, non-White European ethnicity, and genetic risk factors) prevention strategies with tailored lifestyle interventions, where needed, are likely to have greater success, but more evidence is needed. In this Review, we draw on evidence from both adolescents and young adults to provide a contemporary update on the current insights and emerging trends in early-onset type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Background The clinical heterogeneity in major depressive disorder (MDD), variable treatment response, and conflicting findings limit the ability of genomics toward the discovery of evidence-based diagnosis and treatment regimen. This study attempts to curate all genetic association findings to evaluate potential variants for clinical translation.Methods We systematically reviewed all candidates and genome-wide association studies for both MDD susceptibility and antidepressant response, independently, using MEDLINE, particularly to identify replicated findings. These variants were evaluated for functional consequences using different in silico tools and further estimated their diagnostic predictability by calculating positive predictive values.Results A total of 217 significantly associated studies comprising 1200 variants across 545 genes and 128 studies including 921 variants across 412 genes were included with MDD susceptibility and antidepressant response, respectively. Although the majority of associations were confirmed by a single study, we identified 31 and 18 replicated variants (in at least 2 studies) for MDD and antidepressant response. Functional annotation of these 31 variants predicted 20% coding variants as deleterious/damaging and 80.6% variants with regulatory effect. Similarly, the response-related 18 variants revealed 25% coding variant as damaging and 88.2% with substantial regulatory potential. Finally, we could calculate the diagnostic predictability of 19 and 5 variants whose positive predictive values ranges from 0.49 to 0.66 for MDD and 0.36 to 0.66 for response.Conclusions The replicated variants presented in our data are promising for disease diagnosis and improved response outcomes. Although these quantitative assessment measures are solely directive of available observational evidence, robust homogenous validation studies are required to strengthen these variants for molecular diagnostic application.

AB  - Introduction: The second leading cause of lung cancer is air pollution. Air pollution and smoking are synergistic. Air pollution can worsen lung cancer survival.Methods: The Early Detection and Screening Committee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer formed a working group to better understand issues in air pollution and lung cancer. These included identification of air pollutants, their measurement, and proposed mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The burden of disease and the underlying epidemiologic evidence linking air pollution to lung cancer in individuals who never and ever smoked were summarized to quantify the problem, assess risk prediction models, and develop recommended actions.Results: The number of estimated attributable lung cancer deaths has increased by nearly 30% since 2007 as smokinghas decreased and air pollution has increased. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified outdoor air pollution and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns in outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans (International Agency for Research on Cancer group 1) and as a cause of lung cancer. Lung cancer risk models reviewed do not include air pollution. Estimation of cumulative exposure to air pollution exposure is complex which poses major challenges with accurately collecting long-term exposure to ambient air pollution for incorporation into risk prediction models in clinical practice.Conclusions: Worldwide air pollution levels vary widely, and the exposed populations also differ. Advocacy to lower sources of exposure is important. Health care can lower its environmental footprint, becoming more sustainable and resilient. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer community can engage broadly on this topic.(c) 2023 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Current orthodontic literature reveals a lack of studies on bacterial colonization of orthodontic miniscrew implants (MSI) and their role in the stability of MSI. This study aimed to determine the pattern of microbiological colonization of miniscrew implants in 2 major age groups, to compare it with the microbial flora of gingival sulci in the same group of patients and to compare microbial flora in successful and failed miniscrews. Methods: The study involved 102 MSI placed in 32 orthodontic subjects in 2 age groups: (1) aged <= 14 years and (2) aged >14 years. Gingival and peri-mini implant crevicular fluid samples were collected using sterile paper points (International Organization for Standardization no. 35) >3 months and processed by conventional microbiologic culture and biochemical techniques. A microbiologist characterized and identified the bacteria, and the results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Initial colonization was reported within 24 hours, with Streptococci being the dominant colonizer. The relative proportion of anaerobic bacteria over aerobic bacteria increased over time in peri-mini implant crevicular fluid. Group 1 had greater Citrobacter (P = 0.036) and Parvimonas micra (P = 0.016) colonizing MSI than group 2. Failed MSI showed a significantly higher presence of Parvimonas micra (P = 0.008) in group 1 and Staphylococci (P = 0.008), Enterococci (P = 0.011), and Parvimonas micra (P \0.001) in group 2. Conclusions: Microbial colonization around MSI is established within 24 hours. Compared to gingival crevicular fluid, peri-mini implant crevicular fluid is colonized by a higher proportion of Staphylococci, facultative enteric commensals and anaerobic cocci. The failed miniscrews showed a higher proportion of Staphylococci, Enterobacter, and Parvimonas micra, suggesting their possible role in the stability of MSI. The bacterial profile of MSI varies with age.

AB  - Background: The treatment of vitiligo can be challenging and depends on several factors such as the subtype, disease activity, vitiligo extent, and treatment goals. Vitiligo usually requires a long-term approach. To improve the management of vitiligo worldwide, a clear and up-to-date guide based on international consensus with uniform stepwise recommendations is needed.Objectives: To reach an international consensus on the nomenclature and to develop a management algorithm for the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of vitiligo.Methods: In this consensus statement, a consortium of 42 international vitiligo experts and four patient representatives participated in online and live meetings to develop a consensus management strategy for vitiligo. At least two vitiligo experts summarized the evidence of topics included in the algorithms. A survey was utilized to resolve remaining issues among a core group of eight experts. Subsequently, the unanimous recommendations were finalized and validated based on further input from the entire group during two live meetings.Results: The algorithms highlight the importance of shared decision-making. Dermatologists are encouraged to provide patients with detailed explanations of the prognosis and expected therapeutic outcomes based on clinical examination. The treatment goal should be discussed and clearly emphasized to patients given the different approaches for disease stabilization and repigmentation. The evaluation of disease activity remains a cornerstone in the tailor-made approach to vitiligo patients.Conclusions: These new treatment algorithms are intended to guide clinical decision-making in clinical practice. Promising novel therapies for vitiligo are on the horizon, further highlighting the need for reliable outcome measurement instruments and greater emphasis on shared decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of risk-reducing surgery for breast cancer and ovarian cancer prevention on quality of life. We considered risk-reducing mastectomy, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, and risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy.DATA SOURCES: We followed a prospective protocol (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews: CRD42022319782) and searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library from inception to February 2023.STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We followed a PICOS (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design) framework. The population included women at increased risk of breast cancer or ovarian cancer. We focused on studies reporting quality of life outcomes (health-related quality of life, sexual function, menopause symptoms, body image, cancer-related distress or worry, anxiety, or depression) after risk-reducing surgery, including risk-reducing mastectomy for breast cancer and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy or risk reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy for ovarian cancer.METHODS: We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) for study appraisal. Qualitative synthesis and fixed effects meta-analysis were performed.RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were included (risk-reducing mastectomy: 16 studies; risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy: 19 studies; risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy: 2 studies). Health-related quality of life was unchanged or improved in 13 of 15 studies after risk-reducing mastectomy (N=986) and 10 of 16 studies after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (N=1617), despite short-term deficits (N=96 after risk-reducing mastectomy and N=459 after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy). Sexual function (using the Sexual Activity Questionnaire) was affected in 13 of 16 studies (N=1400) after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in terms of decreased sexual pleasure (-1.21 [-1.53 to-0.89]; N=3070) and increased sexual discomfort (1.12 [0.93-1.31]; N=1400). Hormone replacement therapy after premenopausal risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy was associated with an increase (1.16 [0.17-2.15]; N=291) in sexual pleasure and a decrease (-1.20 [-1.75 to-0.65]; N=157) in sexual discomfort. Sexual function was affected in 4 of 13 studies (N=147) after risk-reducing mastectomy, but stable in 9 of 13 studies (N=799). Body image was unaffected in 7 of 13 studies (N=605) after risk-reducing mastectomy, whereas 6 of 13 studies (N=391) reported worsening. Increased menopause symptoms were reported in 12 of 13 studies (N=1759) after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy with a reduction (-1.96 [-2.81 to-1.10]; N=1745) in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Endocrine Symptoms. Cancer-related distress was unchanged or decreased in 5 of 5 studies after risk-reducing mastectomy (N=365) and 8 of 10 studies after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (N=1223). Risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy (2 studies, N=413) led to better sexual function and menopause-specific quality of life.CONCLUSION: Risk-reducing surgery may be associated with quality of life outcomes. Risk-reducing mastectomy and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy reduce cancer-related distress, and do not affect health-related quality of life. Women and clinicians should be aware of body image problems after risk-reducing mastectomy, and of sexual dysfunction and menopause symptoms after risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.
   Risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy may be a promising alternative to mitigate quality of life -related risks of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.

AB  - Background & Aims: Antiviral therapy may attenuate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We aimed to explore how tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) affect HCC risk in patients with CHB.Methods: The REACH-B, aMAP, and mPAGE-B models were utilized to assess HCC risk in patients with CHB from two global randomized-controlled trials evaluating the impact of TAF vs. TDF treatment. Standard incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using data from the REACH-B model as a ratio of observed HCC cases in the TAF-or TDF-treated patients vs. predicted HCC cases for untreated historical controls. Proportions of treated patients shifting aMAP and mPAGE-B risk categories between baseline and Week 240 were calculated.Results: Of the 1,632 patients (TAF, n = 1,093; TDF, n = 539) followed for up to 300 weeks, 22 HCC cases developed. Those receiving TAF had an SIR that was lower compared to the SIR of individuals receiving TDF: 0.32 (p < 0.001) vs. 0.56 (p = 0.06). In the general study population, individuals without cirrhosis at baseline had an SIR that was lower compared to the SIR of individuals with cirrhosis at baseline: 0.37 (p < 0.001) vs. 0.58 (p = 0.15). Of the patients at low risk of HCC at baseline, the majority (97%) remained low risk by mPAGE-B and aMAP scoring at Week 240. Among those at medium or high risk at baseline, substantial portions shifted to a lower risk category by Week 240 (mPAGE-B: 22% and 42%; aMAP: 39% and 63%, respectively).Conclusions: This evaluation provides evidence that treatment with TAF or TDF can reduce HCC risk in patients with CHB, particularly in patients without cirrhosis.Impact and implications: Despite the substantial impact of HCC on long-term outcomes of patients with CHB, the differential risk of HCC development among those receiving treatment with TAF vs. TDF has not been well elucidated. Using three validated risk prediction models, we found that TAF is at least as effective as TDF in reducing HCC risk in patients with CHB.

AB  - A diet high in sodium contributes to a significant proportion of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to cardiovascular diseases. This paper describes the awareness, behaviour and determinants related to dietary salt intake in an adult population of 18-69 years that were assessed as part of the National NCD Monitoring Survey (NNMS) in India. A sub-sample of 3000 adults selected through simple random sampling from 150 nationally representative Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) was included. Data regarding awareness and behaviour related to dietary salt intake were collected. Urinary sodium excretion in spot urine samples was estimated and used to calculate dietary salt intake. The dietary salt intake's sociodemographic, behavioural and metabolic determinants were also analysed. Less than one-third of the adults of both genders in all age groups in rural and urban areas were aware that daily high salt intake could affect health. The estimated mean daily salt intake was 8.0 g (8.9 g/day for men and 7.1 g/day for women). The salt intake was significantly higher in men [Adjusted OR = 17.66 (5.24-59.46)], rural areas [Adjusted OR = 6.14 (1.83-20.60)], overweight and obese respondents [Adjusted OR = 17.62 (3.17-98.07)]. The perception of the harmful effects of high salt intake and practices to limit salt intake was low in the study population. The mean daily salt intake was higher than the WHO recommendation of up to 5 g daily. The mean dietary salt intake is high in the Indian population, which calls for planning and implementing control of dietary salt consumption measures.

AB  - Purpose: Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists have anticonvulsant effect but their antiepileptogenic effect is unknown. U50488, a selective KOR agonist is used to determine its effect on status epilepticus (SE), spontaneous convulsive seizures (SS) and cognitive impairment in rat lithium-pilocarpine SE model. Effect of an antiepileptic drug levetiracetam is also studied.Method: Male Wistar rats with SE were divided into three groups namely, LiP, LiP + U50488 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and LiP + levetiracetam (400 mg/kg, i.p.) group. SE was terminated after 90 min of its onset with diazepam (15 mg/kg, i.p.) and phenobarbitone (25 mg/kg, i.p.). Drug treatment was started after 15 min of onset of SE and repeated once after 4 h. Rats were video monitored 12 h daily (9 AM to 9 PM) to determine severity of SE using modified Racine scale and onset and frequency of SS from day 0 to day 21. Morris water maze (MWM) test was done at baseline i.e. day -1 (before lithium administration) and day 22, to assess cognitive impairment.Results: As compared to LiP, U50488 decreased the severity of SE (1.98 +/- 0.13 vs 2.95 +/- 0.12; p-value < 0.0001) but not levetiracetam (2.62 +/- 0.09; p-value = 0.3112). Survival increased with both U50488 (90%, n = 10) and levetiracetam (81.8%, n = 11) as compared to NS (56.2%, n = 16). No effect on onset and frequency of SS was found in U50488/levetiracetam group. U50488 improved seizures-induced cognitive impairment. Levetiracetam group showed thigmotactic (wall hugging) behaviour in MWM in 8 out of 9 rats.Conclusion: Acute treatment with U50488, a kappa opioid receptor agonist has a beneficial effect on SE, SE-related mortality and memory impairment. The dual protective effect of U50488 on seizures and related cognitive impairment is advantageous over currently used antiseizure drugs which are known to cause cognitive impairment.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LD) are functionally conserved fat storage organelles found in all cell types. LDs have a unique structure comprising of a hydrophobic core of neutral lipids (fat), triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol esters (CE) surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. LD surface is decorated by a multitude of proteins and enzymes rendering this compartment functional. Accumulating evidence suggests that LDs originate from discrete ERsubdomains, demarcated by the lipodystrophy protein seipin, however, the mechanisms of which are not well understood. LD biogenesis factors together with biophysical properties of the ER membrane orchestrate spatiotemporal regulation of LD nucleation and growth at specific ER subdomains in response to metabolic cues. Defects in LD formation manifests in several human pathologies, including obesity, lipodystrophy, ectopic fat accumulation, and insulin resistance. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular events during initial stages of eukaryotic LD assembly and discuss the critical role of factors that ensure fidelity of this process.

AB  - Purpose: To study the outcomes of topical Retinol Palmitate ophthalmic solution in chronic Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with ocular surface keratinisation.Methods: It was a comparative interventional study conducted at Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, Delhi, India from 2020 to 2022 evaluating outcomes of addition of topical Retinol Palmitate to conventional treatment objectively as well as subjectively from baseline up to 12 weeks.Results: A statistically significant improvement was seen in patients who received topical Retinol palmitate at 12 weeks in terms of Schirmer-1 test(p=<0.01), tear prism height on ASOCT(p = 0.02), Rose Bengal staining score of cornea(p = 0.01) and conjunctiva (p < 0.01), reduction of ocular surface keratinisation on impression cytology(p = 0.01) and subjective evaluation using OSDI questionnaire(p = 0.04).Impression cytology revealed goblet cells in Retinol palmitate group at 1 week after initiation of therapy, which increased further at 1 month follow up but reduced at 3 months. No goblet cells were seen in control group at any follow-up. No significant difference was noted between the two groups in terms of visual acuity, tear film breakup time, inflammatory cells on impression cytology and inflammatory markers in tears.Conclusion: Topical Retinol palmitate is a safe and effective drug in cases of chronic SJS with ocular surface keratinisation. It has the potential to reverse keratinisation of the ocular surface and promote development of goblet cells. However, the survival of goblet cells is not long lasting.

AB  - Background More than 250 loci have been identified by genome-wide scans for type 2 diabetes in different populations. South Asians have a very different manifestation of the diseases and hence role of these loci need to be investigated among Indians with huge burden of cardio-metabolic disorders. Thus the present study aims to validate the recently identified GWAS loci in an endogamous caste population in North India. Methods 219 T2D cases and 184 controls were recruited from hospitals and genotyped for 15 GWAS loci of T2D. Regression models adjusted for covariates were run to examine the association for T2D and fasting glucose levels. Results We validated three variants for T2D namely, rs11634397 at ZFAND6 (OR = 3.05, 95%CI = 1.02-9.19, p = 0.047) and rs8042680 at PRC1 (OR = 3.67, 95%CI = 1.13-11.93, p = 0.031) showing higher risk and rs6813195 at TMEM154 (OR = 0.28, 95%CI = 0.09-0.90, p = 0.033) showing protective effect. The combined risk of 9 directionally consistent variants was also found to be significantly associated with T2D (OR = 1.91, 95%CI = 1.18-3.08, p = 0.008). One variant rs10842994 at KLHDC5 was validated for 9.15mg/dl decreased fasting glucose levels (SE = -17.25-1.05, p = 0.027). Conclusion We confirm the role of ZFAND6, PRC1 and TMEM154 in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes among Indians. More efforts are needed with larger sample sizes to validate the diabetes GWAS loci in South Asian populations for wider applicability.

AB  - Background Non-invasive tests (NITs) are useful to assess advanced fibrosis (AF) in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Data from Asian countries suggest that these tests have poor performance. We aimed to assess diagnostic accuracy of established thresholds of biomarker-based NITs and Transient Elastography (TE) in identifying AF and evaluated the utility of a two-step test approach.
   Methods Biopsy-proven 641 NAFLD patients (55.2% males, median age 42 years) were included from three different centers of Asia. AF (>= F3) was identified as per histological staging (24.8%).
   Results TE had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.82 (0.79-0.86), and all other biomarker-based NITs had low AUROC (< 0.7). NITs performed poorly at established thresholds. The combination of NITs utilizing liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and biomarkers, Agile 3+ and FAST, demonstrated acceptable diagnostic accuracy (AUROC 0.82 and 0.78, respectively), but none were superior to LSM alone. LSM measured using appropriate M and XL probes remained accurate regardless of body mass index (BMI); NFS and APRI scores were less accurate at higher BMI ranges. A two-step approach using NFS rule-out criteria (< - 2.97 to rule out) followed by LSM (< 7.3 kPa to rule out and >= 12.7 kPa to rule in) correctly classified 62.4% of patients, with only 10.2% of patients incorrectly classified.
   Conclusion NITs have not been validated to identify AF in the Asian NAFLD population, and internationally accepted thresholds yield high false-negative rates. LSM and LSM-based combination tests remain the most accurate.

AB  - Background The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not well defined. This study aimed to assess the presentations, outcomes, and development of liver-related events (LREs) and non-LREs in patients with NAFLD stratified by BMI.Methods Records of NAFLD patients from 2000-2022 were reviewed. Patients were categorized as lean (18.5-22.9 kg/m2), overweight (23-24.9 kg/m2), and obese (>25 kg/m2) based on BMI. Stage of steatosis, fibrosis, and NAFLD activity score were noted in the patients undergoing liver biopsy in each group.Results Out of 1051 NAFLD patients, 127 (12.1%) had normal BMI, 177 (16.8%) and 747 (71.1%) were overweight and obese, respectively. Median [interquartile range] BMI was 21.9 [20.6-22.5], 24.2 [23.7-24.6], and 28.3 [26.6-30.6] kg/m2 in each group, respectively. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia were significantly higher in the obese. Obese patients had significantly higher median [interquartile range] liver stiffness (6.4 [4.9-9.4] kPa) than overweight and lean subjects. A higher proportion of obese patients had significant and advanced liver fibrosis. At follow-up, there were no significant differences in the progression of liver disease, new LREs, coronary artery disease, or hypertension across the BMI groups. Overweight and obese patients were more likely to develop new-onset diabetes by follow-up. The mortality rates in the three groups were comparable (0.47, 0.68, and 0.49 per 100 person-years, respectively), with similar causes of death (liver-related vs non-liver-related).Conclusions Patients with lean NAFLD have similar disease severity and rates of progression as the obese. BMI is not a reliable determinant of outcomes in NAFLD patients.

AB  - Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is a partial-thickness corneal transplantation procedure that involves selective transplantation of the Descemet membrane and endothelium. DMEK offers significant advantages over other keratoplasty techniques, such as faster visual rehabilitation, better final visual acuity due to minimal optical interface effects, lower risk of allograft rejection, and less long-term dependence on topical steroids. Despite all its advantages, DMEK has been found to be more challenging than other corneal transplantation techniques, and its steep learning curve appears to be an obstacle to its widespread use and adoption by corneal surgeons worldwide. DMEK surgical training laboratories (wet labs) provide a window of opportunity for surgeons to learn, prepare, manipulate, and deliver these grafts in a risk-free environment. Wet labs are a significant learning tool, especially for those institutions that have limited tissue availability in their local centers. We provide a step-by-step guide for preparing DMEK grafts using different techniques on human and nonhuman models with instructional videos. This article should eventually help the trainees and the educators understand the requirements for performing DMEK and conducting a DMEK wet lab and develop their skills and interests from a wide variety of available techniques.

AB  - Objective: To compare the success of silver diamine fluoride-modified atraumatic restorative technique (SMART) with that of the conventional drill and fill method in restoring carious lesions in primary molars.Method: Children (4-8years old) reporting to a tertiary care hospital setting with asymptomatic cavitated dentinal carious lesions in primary molars were randomly allocated to two groups; SMART and Conventional; and subsequently restored with Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC). Follow-up evaluations were carried out by blinded independent evaluator at 6-months intervals to assess the status of restorations. Primary outcome was the success of restorations at 24 months and the secondary outcome was the child's behaviour and acceptance of the treatment at the time of interventions. Two sample Z-test of proportion, logistic regression analysis and Chi-square test were used to compare the outcomes in two groups.Results: A total of 226 children (SMART group, 112 and conventional, 114) were included with 280 and 282 GIC restorations placed by the SMART and the conventional method respectively. At 24-months, 459 (81.6 %) primary molars were available for evaluation. Success rates of restorations was 38.4 % and 45.8 % % in SMART and conventional groups respectively (p = 0.105). The rate of acceptability of treatment in the SMART and conventional group was 79 % and 56 % (p<0.001) respectively.Conclusion: There was no significant difference in the success rates of GIC restorations by SMART and conventional technique in carious primary molars at 24 months. SMART was better accepted by children as compared to the conventional restorative technique.Clinical significance: SMART can be an alternative option to treat the asymptomatic carious lesions in primary molars and is well accepted by children than the conventional drill and fill technique thus implying that it has a useful role in un-cooperative children.

AB  - Neurological involvement in sarcoidosis is termed as neurosarcoidosis. It usually leads to cranial neuropathies, although it can involve any part of the neuroaxis. Although sarcoidosis is a proinflammatory state, there is an associated anergic state demonstrable by a feeble tuberculin response. Lymphocytic sequestration in granulomas can be associated with peripheral CD4 lymphocytopenia (40% of patients with sarcoidosis) predisposing to opportunistic infections. Here we have described a young, otherwise immunocompetent male presenting with subacute onset right hemiparesis with motor aphasia, who was diagnosed to have progressive multifocal leu-koencephalopathy (PML) secondary to pulmonary sarcoidosis. We want to emphasize that PML should be considered as a differential in all cases of secondary demyelination (even apparently immunocompetent in-dividuals) as early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause is likely to yield better outcomes.

AB  - Aims: Thymic epithelial tumours (TET), including thymomas and thymic carcinomas and thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms, are malignant neoplasms that can be associated with morbidity and mortality. Recently, an updated version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Thoracic Tumours 5th Edition, 2021 has been released, which included various changes to the classification of these neoplasms. In addition, in 2017 the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) / American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) published the 8th Edition Staging Manual which, for the first time, includes a TNM staging that is applicable to thymomas, thymic carcinomas, and thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms.
   Methods and Results: To standardize reporting of resected TET and thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms the accrediting bodies updated their reporting protocols. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR), which represents a collaboration between various National Associations of Pathology, updated its 2017 histopathology reporting guide on TET and thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms accordingly. This report will highlight important changes in the reporting of TET and thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms based on the 2021 WHO, emphasize the 2017 TNM staging, and also comment on the rigour and various uncertainties for the pathologist when trying to follow that staging.
   Conclusion: The ICCR dataset provides a comprehensive, standardized template for reporting of resected TET and thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) has been reported to influence secondary metabolism of Ocimum tenuiflorum L., thereby improving its therapeutic and commercial importance. To explain changes in the secondary metabolite profile, the study reports effects of AM on leaf metabolome of two high yielding genotypes of O. tenuiflorum inoculated with Rhizophagus intraradices. NMR-based non-targeted metabolic fingerprinting was related to changes at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels in mycorrhizal (M) plants. AM resulted in higher accumulation of sucrose, which could be related with enhanced photosynthesis by virtue of increased uptake of mineral nutrients. A strong positive correlation between sucrose and net photosynthetic rate and sucrose and mineral nutrients supported that AM-mediated increase in uptake of mineral nutrients is associated with enhanced photosynthetic rate and accumulation of sucrose. Further, higher sucrose synthase activity resulted in increased glucose. Hexokinase activity was also higher in M plants resulting in higher pyruvate accumulation. On the contrary, Krebs cycle was compromised in M plants as evident by lower activities of its enzymes and concentrations of organic and amino acids. Nevertheless, AM increased activities and expressions of enzymes of terpenoid biosynthesis, shikimate, and phenylpropanoid pathways, thereby resulting in augmented production of terpenoids, phenylalanine, and phenols, respectively. Thus, metabolic reprogramming downstream of glycolysis was apparent wherein AMF resulted in more allocation of carbon resources to secondary metabolism as opposed to primary metabolism, which was supported by Pearson's correlation analysis. Higher C:N ratio in M plants explains the provision of more carbon resources to secondary metabolism as against primary metabolism.

AB  - The structural and characteristic features of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) from chroni-cally infected pediatric donors are currently unknown. Herein, we characterized a heavy chain matured HIV-1 bnAb 44m, identified from a pediatric elite-neutralizer. Interestingly, in comparison to its wild -type AIIMS-P01 bnAb, 44m exhibited moderately higher level of somatic hypermutations of 15.2%. The 44m neutralized 79% of HIV-1 heterologous viruses (n = 58) tested, with a geometric mean IC50 titer of 0.36 mg/mL. The cryo-EM structure of 44m Fab in complex with fully cleaved glycosylated native-like BG505.SOSIP.664.T332N gp140 envelope trimer at 4.4 A resolution revealed that 44m targets the V3-glycan N332-supersite and GDIR motif to neutralize HIV-1 with improved potency and breadth, plausibly attributed by a matured heavy chain as compared to that of wild-type AIIMS-P01. This study further im-proves our understanding on pediatric HIV-1 bnAbs and structural basis of broad HIV-1 neutralization by 44m may be useful blueprint for vaccine design in future.

AB  - Background: The treatment of vitiligo can be challenging. Up-to-date agreed consensus recommendations on the use of topical and systemic therapies to facilitate the clinical management of vitiligo are currently lacking.Objectives: To develop internationally agreed-upon expert-based recommendations for the treatment of vitiligo.MethodsIn this consensus statement, a consortium of 42 international vitiligo experts and four patient representatives participated in different online and live meetings to develop a consensus management strategy for vitiligo. At least two vitiligo experts summarized the evidence for different topics included in the algorithms. A survey was then given to a core group of eight experts to resolve the remaining issues. Subsequently, the recommendations were finalized and validated based on further input from the entire group during two live meetings.Results: The recommendations provided summarize the latest evidence regarding the use of topical therapies (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and Jak-inhibitors) and systemic therapies, including steroids and other systemic immunomodulating or antioxidant agents. The different modalities of phototherapies (NB-UVB, photochemotherapy, excimer devices and home phototherapy), which are often combined with other therapies, are also summarized. Interventional approaches as well as depigmentation strategies are presented for specific indications. Finally, the status of innovative and targeted therapies under development is discussed.Conclusions: This international consensus statement culminated in expert-based clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of vitiligo. The development of new therapies is ongoing in vitiligo, and this will likely improve the future management of vitiligo, a disease that still has many unmet needs.

AB  - Cells inside the body are embedded into a highly structured microenvironment that consists of cells that lie in direct or close contact with other cell types that regulate the overall tissue function. Therefore, coculture models are versatile tools that can generate tissue engineering constructs with improved mimicking of in vivo conditions. While there are many reviews that have focused on pattering a single cell type, very few reviews have been focused on techniques for coculturing multiple cell types on a single substrate with precise control. In this regard, this Review covers various technologies that have been utilized for the development of these patterned coculture models while mentioning the limitations associated with each of them. Further, the application of these models to various tissue engineering applications has been discussed.

T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - A recently emerged sub-lineage of Omicron, BA.5, together with BA.4, caused a fifth wave of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in South Africa and subsequently emerged as a pre-dominant strain globally due to its high transmissibility. The lethality of BA.5 infection has not been studied in an acute hACE2 transgenic (hACE2.Tg) mouse model. Here, we investigated tissue-tropism and immuno-pathology induced by BA.5 infection in hACE2.Tg mice. Our data show that intranasal infection of BA.5 in hACE2.Tg mice resulted in attenuated pulmonary infection and pathology with diminished COVID-19-induced clinical and pathological manifestations. BA.5, similar to Omicron (B.1.1.529), infection led to attenuated production of inflammatory cytokines, anti-viral response and effector T cell response as compared to the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan-Hu-1. We show that mice recovered from B.1.1.529 infection showed robust protection against BA.5 infection associated with reduced lung viral load and pathology. Together, our data provide insights as to why BA.5 infection escapes previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure induced-T cell immunity but may result in milder immunopathology and alleviated chances of re-infectivity in Omicron-recovered individuals.

AB  - Dietary risk, one of the major risk factors for the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, is influenced by household food choices and purchases. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 250 randomly selected households of an urban resettlement colony in Delhi to estimate the proportion of households purchasing different healthier food options during the last purchasing occasion and to identify its key determinants. Purchase of healthier options in staple items like wheat flour with fiber (100%), plant-based oils (97.9%), unpolished pulses (96.2%), and toned milk (94.5%) was high. Affordability and health considerations in food purchases were identified as key determinants.

AB  - The ability of bone to regenerate itself through mechanobiological responses is its dynamic property. Mechanical cues from a neighboring environment produce the structural strain to promote blood flow and bone marrow mobility that in turn aids the bone regeneration process. Occurrences of these phenomena are crucial for the success of metallic scaffolds implanted in the host bone tissue. Thus, permeability and fluid flow-induced wall shear stress (WSS) are two parameters that directly influence cell bioactivities inside a scaffold and are crucial for effective bone tissue regeneration. Given that the scaffolds shall be implanted in the body, permeability assessment was carried out using non-Newtonian fluid. In this work, the triply periodic minimal surface scaffolds with Neovius architectures were fabricated by using selective laser melting technology. The estimation of fluid flow was carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a non-Newtonian blood fluid model. Further, the structural strength of various open cell Neovius lattices was evaluated using a static compression test, and in vitro cell culture using Alamar blue assay was evaluated. Results revealed that the values of intrinsic blood flow permeability of the three-dimensional (3D)-printed open cell porous scaffold with Neovius architecture were of the same order of magnitude as those of human bone, ranging from 0.0025 x 10(-9) to 0.0152 x 10(-9) m(2). The structural elastic modulus and compressive strength of NOCL40, NOCL50, and NOCL60 lattices range from 3.27 to 3.71 GPa and 194 to 205 MPa, respectively. All of the values are comparable to the human bone, thus making these lattices a suitable alternative for orthopedic applications.

AB  - Aim: To study, the incidence and risk factors for postpartum diabetes (DM), in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) from South Asia (Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka), followed for nearly two years after delivery. Methods: Women with prior GDM diagnosed using IADPSG criteria were invited at 19 centres across Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) following childbirth, and were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. The glycaemic category (outcome) was defined from an OGTT based on American Diabetes Association criteria. Results: Participants (n = 1808) recruited had a mean +/- SD age of 31.0 +/- 5.0 years. Incident DM was identified, between childbirth and the last follow-up, in 310 (17.1 %) women [incidence 10.75/100 person years], with a median follow-up duration of 1.82 years after childbirth. Higher age, lower education status, higher prior pregnancy count, prior history of GDM, family history of DM, and postpartum overweight/obese status were significantly associated with incident DM. Women in Bangladesh had a higher cumulative incidence of DM [16.49/100 person years] than in Sri Lanka [12.74/100 person years] and India [7.21/100 person years]. Conclusions: A high incidence of DM was found in women with prior GDM in South Asia, with significant variation between countries. Women from Bangladesh had a significantly higher pregnancy count, family history of DM and overweight/obese status, despite having significantly lower age, which could be responsible for their higher rates of DM. Registration of this study: The study was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2017/06/ 008744), Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry (SLCTR/2017/001), and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03305939).

AB  - The most dangerous type of high-grade astrocytoma is glioblastoma multiforme. The objective of the work was to engineer lactoferrin conjugated temozolomide and resveratrol co-loaded NLC for the treatment of glioblastoma using intranasal delivery for brain targeting. Synergistic activity of temozolomide and resveratrol was deter-mined using combination index method and 1:1 ratio was selected. QbD approach was used to formulate and optimize NLC, with minimum particle size, maximum transmittance and entrapment efficiency using Central Composite Rotable Design (CCRD) method. The optimized LTR-NLC had desired average particle size (209.3 nm), narrow PDI along, high percentage transmittance (>95%) and better entrapment efficiency (95.26% of TEM and 87.59% of RES). From ex-vivo permeation studies it was found that the permeation at 24 h was 77.43 %, and 88.55 % from LTR-NLC and 25.76 % and 31.10% from suspension for resveratrol and temozolomide respectively. In comparison to drug suspension, NLC had nearly 3-fold increase in drug penetration. IC50 value was also significantly better in the groups treated with LTR-NLC. Hence it can be concluded that LTR-NLC may be an effective formulation for the treatment of glioblastoma, according to the findings of this investigation.

AB  - Muller glial cells (MC) support various metabolic functions of the retinal neurons, and maintain the homeostasis. Oxidative stress is intensified with aging, and in human retina, MC and photoreceptors undergo lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. Information on how MC respond to oxidative stress is vital to understand the fate of aging retinal neurons. This study examined age-related changes in MC of donor human retina (age: 35-98 years; N = 18 donors). Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical observations indicate that MC undergo gliosis and increased lipid peroxidation, and show osmotic changes with advanced aging (>80 years). Photoreceptor cells also undergo oxidative-nitrosative stress with aging, and their synapses also show clear osmotic swelling. MC respond to oxidative stress via proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in their processes, and increased expression of aquaporin-4 in endfeet and outer retina. In advanced aged retinas (81-98 years), they showed mitochondrial disorganisation, accumulation of lipids and autophagosomes, lipofuscin granules and axonal remnants in phagolysosomes in their inner processes, suggesting a reduced phagocytotic potential in them with aging. Glutamine synthetase expression does not alter until advanced aging, when the retinas show its increased expression in endfeet and Henle fiber layer. It is evident that MC are vulnerable with normal aging and this could be a reason for photoreceptor cell abnormalities reported with aging of the human retina.

AB  - Patients who require blood from rare blood group donors present great challenges even to the most advanced healthcare delivery system. It is most challenging to supply blood for a patient with an antibody to an antigen of high prevalence. The blood donor lacking the corresponding antigen would have an occurrence rate of less than one in 1,000. The International Rare Donor Panel was established in 1965, but since then there has been gross underrepresentation of South Asian countries, including India. There are several challenges to starting a rare blood group donor program in India that include technical, logistical, and administrative limitations. But the main limiting factors are poor availability of trained resources, lack of awareness, absence of antibody screening, inadequate number of laboratories with blood group genotyping facilities, and the decentralized nature of blood transfusion services. Despite that, there were several rare blood groups identified by Indian immunohematologists in the recent past. Recently, a transfusion genomic group has been established in collaboration with the clinical transfusion medicine specialists in India under the GUaRDIAN (Genomics for Understanding Rare Disease in India Alliance Network) initiative to address the domain of rare blood group genomics. Similarly, the National Institute of Immunohematology, Mumbai under the directive of the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) has taken a step to start the RDRI (Rare Donor Registry of India). In this context, we explore the current challenges of setting-up a rare blood group registry in India and future goals from a developing nation's perspective.

AB  - Status Epilepticus (SE) is a distributed network disorder, which involves the hippocampus and extrahippocampal structures. Epileptogenesis in SE is tightly associated with neurogenesis, plastic changes and neural network reorganization facilitating hyper-excitability. On the other hand, dendritic spines are known to be the excitatory synapse in the brain. Therefore, dendritic spine dynamics could play an intricate role in these network alterations. However, the exact reason behind these structural changes in SE are elusive. In the present study, we have investigated the aforementioned hypothesis in the lithium-pilocarpine treated rat model of SE. We have examined cytoarchitectural and morphological changes using hematoxylin-eosin and Golgi-Cox staining in three different brain regions viz. CA1 pyramidal layer of the dorsal hippocampus, layer V pyramidal neurons of anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and frontal neocortex of the same animals. We observed macrostructural and layerwise alteration of the pyramidal layer mainly in the hippocampus and ATL of SE rats, which is associated with sclerosis in the hippocampus. Sholl analysis exhibited partial dendritic plasticity in apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells as compared to the saline-treated weight-/age-matched control group. These findings indicate that region-specific alterations in dendritogenesis may contribute to the development of independent epileptogenic networks in the hippocampus, ATL, and frontal neocortex of SE rats.

AB  - The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by a Th17/Treg cell imbalance. A pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu that promotes the continued proliferation of Th17 cells is related to the development of autoinflammation. In RA, T cells have several hallmarks of cellular aging, and they accumulate DNA damage, predisposing to the occurrence of mutations and epigenetic alterations. Since the onset, progression, and treatment response are influenced by a variety of external stressors and environmental factors, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of 8-week yoga practice on disease severity, T cell subsets, markers of T cell ageing and inflammation, epigenetic alterations and gene expression patterns in active RA patients on standard disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). A total of 64 participants with active RA were randomized into 2 groups, yoga group (n=32) or non-yoga group (n=32); that were assessed for disease severity, at baseline and after 8 week duration, for Disease Activity Score (DAS28-ESR), T cell subsets [Th17 (CD3+CD4+IL17+ROR gamma t+) cells and Treg (CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127-Foxp3+) cells], markers of T cell aging [aged Th17 cells (CD3+CD4+IL17+ROR gamma t+CD28-) and aged Treg cells (CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127-Foxp3+CD28-)], pro-inflammatory markers [IL-6, and IL-17], anti-inflammatory markers [TGF-beta, and IL-10], epigenetic alterations [5-methyl cytosine, 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, and HDAC1] and gene expression patterns [ROR gamma t, FoxP3, IL-17, IL-6, TGF-beta, CXCL2, CXCR2, and JUN]. In yoga group, there was a significant improvement in DAS28-ESR scores at the end of 8-weeks of yoga program. The Th17 cells and aged T cell subsets showed a significant decline whereas Treg cell population showed a significant elevation in yoga group. There were significant improvements observed in epigenetic markers as well as inflammatory markers post 8-weeks of yoga practice. The yoga group showed downregulation of ROR gamma t, IL-17, IL-6, CXCL2, CXCR2, and upregulation of FoxP3 and TGF-beta transcripts. Yoga enables the maintenance of immune-homeostasis as evident by increased Treg cell population and reduced Th17 cell population. Yoga reduces the rate of immunological aging in T cells, as seen by the reduction in population of aged Th17 cells and aged Treg cells. Yoga positively modifies transcriptome and epigenome by normalization of various inflammatory markers, gene expression patterns and epigenetic alterations. Taken together, yoga reduces RA severity, and aids in immune-modulation and hence can be beneficial as an adjunct therapy.

AB  - Background: Rickettsial pathogens are Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria. They are transmitted by arthropods and are responsible for a wide variety of disease, from minor to life-threatening, which have a global effect on human health. Limited data are available on the prevalence of rickettsial diseases from India, and the disease epidemiology is not fully described. This study aimed to diagnose non-scrub typhus rickettsioses including spotted fever and typhus group of Rickettsia in clinically suspected patients by using standard serological tests and recognition of common epidemiological conditions and clinical manifestations. Methods: During the study period, a total of 700 patients of all ages with acute febrile illness were enrolled. Patients were screened for rickettsial infection using IgM Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed to confirm the ELISA positive results. The relevant demographic, clinical, and laboratory details of patients were documented and analyzed.Results: Of 700 samples tested, 141 (20.2%) were found to be positive for IgM antibodies against rickettsioses using ELISA and IFA. SFGR was positive in 15 (2.2%), TGR was positive in 112 (16%) and 14 (2%) samples were positive for both groups. 20 (14.2%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 24 (17%) in-hospital deaths occurred.Conclusions: The prevalence of rickettsioses in India appears to be underestimated; therefore, increased awareness and improved diagnostic testing could facilitate early detection of cases, pathogen-targeted appropriate treatment, and improved outcomes for patients. Despite the fact that Rickettsiae can be isolated or detected using molecular techniques in clinical specimens, serology still remains the most commonly used diagnostic method for rickettsioses around the world. Our study helps bridge the gap of limited data on Rickettsia in north India and could be useful for future epidemiological investigation of rickettsial diseases and outbreaks.

AB  - The recurrent nature of coronavirus outbreaks, severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid emergence of novel variants, and concerns over the effectiveness of existing vaccines against novel variants have highlighted the need to develop therapeutic interventions. Targeted efforts to identify inhibitors of crucial viral proteins are the preferred strategy. In this study, we screened FDA-approved and natural product libraries using in silico approach for potential hits against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and experimentally validated their potency using in vitro biochemical and cell-based assays. Seven potential hits were identified through in silico screening and were subsequently evaluated in SARS-CoV-2-based cell-free assays, followed by testing in the HCoV-229E-based culture system. Of the tested compounds, 4-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1-isopropyl-1-Hbenzofuro[3,2-b]pyrazolo[4,3-e]pyridin-3(2H)-one (PubChem CID:71755304, hereafter referred to as STL522228) exhibited significant antiviral activity. Subsequently, its potential as a novel COVID therapeutic molecule was validated in the SARS-CoV-2-culture system, where STL522228 demonstrated superior antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.44 mu M) compared to Remdesivir (EC50 = 0.62 mu M). Based on these findings, we report the strong anti-coronavirus activity of STL522228, and propose that it as a promising pan-coronavirus Mpro inhibitor for further experimental and preclinical validation.

AB  - Background The causes for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are diverse and the incidence trends of IMIDs from specific causes are rarely studied. The study aims to investigate the pattern and trend of IMIDs from 1990 to 2019.Methods We collected detailed information on six major causes of IMIDs, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis, between 1990 and 2019, derived from the Global Burden of Disease study in 2019. The average annual percent change (AAPC) in number of incidents and age standardized incidence rate (ASR) on IMIDs, by sex, age, region, and causes, were calculated to quantify the temporal trends.Findings In 2019, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease accounted 1.59%, 36.17%, 54.71%, 0.09%, 6.84%, 0.60% of overall new IMIDs cases, respectively. The ASR of IMIDs showed substantial regional and global variation with the highest in High SDI region, High-income North America, and United States of America. Throughout human lifespan, the age distribution of incident cases from six IMIDs was quite different. Globally, incident cases of IMIDs increased with an AAPC of 0.68 and the ASR decreased with an AAPC of -0.34 from 1990 to 2019. The incident cases increased across six IMIDs, the ASR of rheumatoid arthritis increased (0.21, 95% CI 0.18, 0.25), while the ASR of asthma (AAPC = -0.41), inflammatory bowel disease (AAPC = -0.72), multiple sclerosis (AAPC = -0.26), psoriasis (AAPC = -0.77), and atopic dermatitis (AAPC = -0.15) decreased. The ASR of overall and six individual IMID increased with SDI at regional and global level. Countries with higher ASR in 1990 experienced a more rapid decrease in ASR.Interpretation The incidence patterns of IMIDs varied considerably across the world. Innovative prevention and integrative management strategy are urgently needed to mitigate the increasing ASR of rheumatoid arthritis and upsurging new cases of other five IMIDs, respectively.Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The various strains and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 have been tracked using several forms of genomic classification systems. The present study reports high-throughput sequencing and analysis of 99 SARS-CoV-2 specimens from Western Uttar Pradesh using sequences obtained from the GISAID database, followed by phylogeny and clade classification. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Omicron lineages BA-2-like (55.55%) followed by Delta lineage-B.1.617.2 (45.5%) were predominantly circulating in this area Signature substitution at positions S: N501Y, S: D614G, S: T478K, S: K417N, S: E484A, S: P681H, and S: S477N were commonly detected in the Omicron variant-BA-2-like, however S: D614G, S: L452R, S: P681R and S: D950N were confined to Delta variant-B.1.617.2. We have also identified three escape variants in the S gene at codon position 19 (T19I/R), 484 (E484A/Q), and 681 (P681R/H) during the fourth and fifth waves in India. Based on the phylogenetic diversification studies and similar changes in other lineages, our analysis revealed indications of convergent evolution as the virus adjusts to the shifting immunological profile of its human host. To the best of our knowledge, this study is an approach to comprehensively map the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains from Western Uttar Pradesh using an integrated approach of whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. These findings will be extremely valuable in developing a structured approach toward pandemic preparedness and evidence-based intervention plans in the future.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Lip, oral, and pharyngeal cancers are important contributors to cancer burden worldwide, and a comprehensive evaluation of their burden globally, regionally, and nationally is crucial for effective policy planning.OBJECTIVE To analyze the total and risk-attributable burden of lip and oral cavity cancer (LOC) and other pharyngeal cancer (OPC) for 204 countries and territories and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) using 2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study estimates.EVIDENCE REVIEW The incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to LOC and OPC from 1990 to 2019 were estimated using GBD 2019 methods. The GBD 2019 comparative risk assessment framework was used to estimate the proportion of deaths and DALYs for LOC and OPC attributable to smoking, tobacco, and alcohol consumption in 2019.FINDINGS In 2019, 370 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 338 000-401000) cases and 199 000 (95% UI, 181 000-217 000) deaths for LOC and 167 000 (95% UI, 153 000-180 000) cases and 114 000 (95% UI, 103 000-126 000) deaths for OPC were estimated to occur globally, contributing 5.5 million (95% UI, 5.0-6.0 million) and 3.2 million (95% UI, 2.9-3.6 million) DALYs, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, low-middle and low SDI regions consistently showed the highest age-standardized mortality rates due to LOC and OPC, while the high SDI strata exhibited age-standardized incidence rates decreasing for LOC and increasing for OPC. Globally in 2019, smoking had the greatest contribution to risk-attributable OPC deaths for both sexes (55.8% [95% UI, 49.2%-62.0%] of all OPC deaths in male individuals and 17.4% [95% UI, 13.8%-21.2%] of all OPC deaths in female individuals). Smoking and alcohol both contributed to substantial LOC deaths globally among male individuals (42.3% [95% UI, 35.2%-48.6%] and 40.2% [95% UI, 33.3%-46.8%] of all risk-attributable cancer deaths, respectively), while chewing tobacco contributed to the greatest attributable LOC deaths among female individuals (27.6% [95% UI, 21.5%-33.8%]), driven by high risk-attributable burden in South and Southeast Asia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic analysis, disparities in LOC and OPC burden existed across the SDI spectrum, and a considerable percentage of burden was attributable to tobacco and alcohol use. These estimates can contribute to an understanding of the distribution and disparities in LOC and OPC burden globally and support cancer control planning efforts.

AB  - Objectives-Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) allows excellent delineation of perfusion in septa and nodules without exposure to ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic contrast media. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of CEUS for the assessment of cystic renal masses and compare its diagnostic performance with that of CECT.
   Methods-Exactly 40 patients diagnosed to have cystic renal masses on CECT scan were prospectively evaluated with CEUS and were assigned a Bosniak class. Based on results of final histopathology and clinical follow-up, internal validity of both CEUS and CECT was evaluated, including agreement between these two modalities.
   Results-Out of the 40 patients (mean size 3.1 +/- 2.5 cm), 23 patients had benign lesions and 17 patients had malignant lesions. For CEUS, the sensitivity and negative predictive value was 100%, the specificity and positive predictive value was 73.9%. For CECT, the sensitivity and negative predictive value were 88.2 and 83.3%, respectively, whereas the specificity and positive predictive value was 87 and 90.9%, respectively. Both imaging modalities had similar accuracy with fair to good agreement with the final diagnosis (. = 0.71 and 0.75 for CEUS and CECT, respectively). Concordance between CEUS and CECT was seen in 29 patients (72.5%) with fair agreement between the two modalities (K = 0.66).
   Conclusion-CEUS has comparable accuracy with CECT and could be used as screening modality to rule out the presence of complex cystic renal masses without exposure of nephrotoxic contrast media and ionizing radiation.

AB  - Adiposity has gradually become a global public threat over the years with drastic increase in the attributable deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs). Given an increased metabolic risk among Asians as compared to Europeans for any given body mass index (BMI) and considering the differences in genetic architecture between them, the present review aims to summarize the findings from genome-wide scans for various adiposity indices and related anthropometric measures from Asian populations. The search for related studies, published till February 2022, were made on PubMed and GWAS Catalog using search strategy built with relevant keywords joined by Boolean operators. It was recorded that out of a total of 47 identified studies, maximum studies are from Korean population (n = 14), followed by Chinese (n = 7), and Japanese (n = 6). Nearly 200 loci have been identified for BMI, 660 for height, 16 for weight, 28 for circumferences (waist and hip), 32 for ratios (waist hip ratio [WHR] and thoracic hip ratio [THR]), 5 for body fat, 16 for obesity, and 28 for adiposity-related blood markers among Asians. It was observed that though, most of the loci were unique for each trait, there were 3 loci in common to BMI and WHR. Apart from validation of variants identified in European setting, there were many novel loci discovered in Asian populations. Notably, 125 novel loci form Asian studies have been reported for BMI, 47 for height, 5 for waist circumference, and 2 for adiponectin level to the existing knowledge of the genetic framework of adiposity and related measures. It is necessary to examine more advanced adiposity measures, specifically of relevance to abdominal adiposity, a major risk factor for cardiometabolic disorders among Asians. Moreover, in spite of being one continent, there is diversity among different ethnicities across Asia in terms of lifestyle, climate, geography, genetic structure and consequently the phenotypic manifestations. Hence, it is also important to consider ethnic specific studies for identifying and validating reliable genetic variants of adiposity measures among Asians.

AB  - Background Incisional hernia is a common complication following abdominal surgery. It causes change in function of core abdominal muscles leading to change in abdominal wall dynamics. This study aims to objectively measure and compare preoperative abdominal wall dynamics with surface electromyography (sEMG) in incisional hernia patients with healthy individuals.
   Materials and methods In this prospective comparative study, two groups of participants as cases and controls were evaluated for their abdominal wall dynamics by using sEMG. Both cases and controls were evenly matched in terms of age and gender. Statistical analysis was done with STATA 14.1 and p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results Demographic profile was comparable between the two groups. Mean BMI of cases was higher than controls. The most common index procedure was lower segment cesarean section. The strength and power of all three abdominal wall muscles (rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique) were significantly diminished among cases compared to controls.
   Conclusions Abdominal wall dynamics can be objectively and correctly interpreted from sEMG of abdominal wall core muscles in patients with incisional hernia. This study shows that there is a decrease in abdominal wall strength and power in patients suffering from incisional hernia in comparison with healthy controls.

AB  - Most drugs used in the treatment of Tuberculous Meningitis have limited CNS penetration thereby limiting efficacy. CSF penetration of linezolid is 80-100%.The study was a prospective, randomized, open label with blinded outcome assessment pilot trial carried out in patients with TBM. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two treatment groups either to receive standard ATT alone or add on oral 600 mg BD Linezolid for 4 weeks along with standard four drug ATT [HRZE/S]. Primary outcome was safety and mortality at the end of one and three months measured by intention to treat analysis. 29 patients were recruited and 27 completed three months of follow up. There was no significant difference in terms of mortality with Odds ratio (95% CI) of 2 (0.161-24.87; p = 1) at one month and 0.385 (0.058-2.538; p = 0.39) at three months. There was a significant improvement in GCS in Linezolid group at one month and mRS within the Linezolid group at one and three months. No major safety concerns were observed. The sample size is underpowered to draw any definitive conclusions but improvement in mRS and GCS as well as mortality change make a case for a large sample size

AB  - Background Salivary exosome analysis provides a noninvasive and comprehensive approach with potential applications in oral cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The early detection of oral cancer has remained a critical concern in enhancing the quality of life, especially for individuals who consume tobacco and are at greater risk of developing the disease. The current study investigates the potential of salivary exosomes in screening smokers for early signs and transformations of oral cancer.
   Methods Morphological characterization of salivary exosomes among three study groups (non-smokers as control, smokers as high-risk tobacco consumers, and Oral cancer) (n = 120) was carried out through dynamic light scattering, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. For molecular characterization, EXOCET and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy methods were utilized. The expression of the exosomal surface protein CD63 was evaluated using Western blotting.
   Results Salivary exosomes exhibit noticeable differences in size between control group and tobacco consumers. The differentiation extended beyond exosome size and included variations in concentration and bio- molecular composition, as determined by FTIR screening. Tobacco consumers and oral cancer groups showed significantly larger and more concentrated exosomes compared to the healthy group.
   Conclusion Our study provides strong evidence that the properties of salivary exosomes can serve as reliable noninvasive biomarkers for distinguishing tobacco consumers from non-smokers and oral cancer patients. Our results underscore the potential of exosome-based diagnostics in early oral cancer detection for high-risk individuals. The larger size and higher concentration of exosomes in tobacco consumers indicate early changes in cell secretions associated with the transformation from healthy to abnormal cells.

AB  - Purpose: The effects of epilepsy are worse in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where most people with epilepsy live, and where most are untreated. Correct treatment depends on determining whether focal or generalised epilepsy is present. EEG and MRI are usually not available to help so an entirely clinical method is required. We applied an eight-variable algorithm, which had been derived from 503 patients from India using naive-Bayesian methods, to an adult Sudanese cohort with epilepsy. Methods: There were 150 consecutive adult patients with known epilepsy type as defined by two neurologists who had access to clinical information, EEG and neuroimaging ("the gold standard"). We used seven of the eight variables, together with their likelihood ratios, to calculate the probability of focal as opposed to generalised epilepsy in each patient and compared that to the "gold standard". Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa statistic were calculated. Results: Mean age was 28 years (range 17-49) and 53% were female. The accuracy of an algorithm comprising seven of the eight variables was 92%, with sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 72% for focal epilepsy. Cohen's kappa was 0.773, indicating substantial agreement. Ninety-four percent of patients had probability scores either less than 0.1 (generalised) or greater than 0.9 (focal). Conclusion: The results confirm the high accuracy of this algorithm in determining epilepsy type in Sudan. They suggest that, in a clinical condition like epilepsy, where a history is crucial, results in one continent can be applied to another. This is especially important as untreated epilepsy and the epilepsy treatment gap are so widespread. The algorithm can be applied to patients giving an individual probability score which can help determine the appropriate anti-seizure medication. It should give epilepsy-inexperienced doctors confidence in managing patients with epilepsy.

AB  - Background Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric hematological malignancy, with ETV6::RUNX1 being the most prevalent translocation whose exact pathogenesis remains unclear. IGF2BP1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Binding Protein 1) is an oncofetal RNA binding protein seen to be specifically overexpressed in ETV6::RUNX1 positive B-ALL. In this study, we have studied the mechanistic role of IGF2BP1 in leukemogenesis and its synergism with the ETV6::RUNX1 fusion protein.
   Methods Gene expression was analyzed from patient bone marrow RNA using Real Time RT-qPCR. Knockout cell lines were created using CRISPR-Cas9 based lentiviral vectors. RNA-Seq and RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-Seq) after IGF2BP1 pulldown were performed using the Illumina platform. Mouse experiments were done by retroviral overexpression of donor HSCs followed by lethal irradiation of recipients using a bone marrow transplant model.
   Results We observed specific overexpression of IGF2BP1 in ETV6::RUNX1 positive patients in an Indian cohort of pediatric ALL (n=167) with a positive correlation with prednisolone resistance. IGF2BP1 expression was essential for tumor cell survival in multiple ETV6::RUNX1 positive B-ALL cell lines. Integrated analysis of transcriptome sequencing after IGF2BP1 knockout and RIP-Seq after IGF2BP1 pulldown in Reh cell line revealed that IGF2BP1 targets encompass multiple pro-oncogenic signalling pathways including TNF alpha/NF kappa B and PI3K-Akt pathways. These pathways were also dysregulated in primary ETV6::RUNX1 positive B-ALL patient samples from our center as well as in public B-ALL patient datasets. IGF2BP1 showed binding and stabilization of the ETV6::RUNX1 fusion transcript itself. This positive feedback loop led to constitutive dysregulation of several oncogenic pathways.
   Enforced co-expression of ETV6::RUNX1 and IGF2BP1 in mouse bone marrow resulted in marrow hypercellularity which was characterized by multi-lineage progenitor expansion and strong Ki67 positivity. This pre-leukemic phenotype confirmed their synergism in-vivo. Clonal expansion of cells overexpressing both ETV6::RUNX1 and IGF2BP1 was clearly observed. These mice also developed splenomegaly indicating extramedullary hematopoiesis.
   Conclusion Our data suggest a combined impact of the ETV6::RUNX1 fusion protein and RNA binding protein, IGF2BP1 in activating multiple oncogenic pathways in B-ALL which makes IGF2BP1 and these pathways as attractive therapeutic targets and biomarkers.

AB  - The ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) represents a highly regulated protein degradation pathway essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. This system plays a critical role in several cellular processes, which include DNA damage repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, and immune response regulation. Recently, the UPS has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapeutics due to its involvement in oncogenesis and tumor progression. Here we aim to summarize the key aspects of the UPS and its significance in cancer therapeutics. We begin by elucidating the fundamental components of the UPS, highlighting the role of ubiquitin, E1-E3 ligases, and the proteasome in protein degradation. Furthermore, we discuss the intricate process of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, emphasizing the specificity and selectivity achieved through various signaling pathways. The dysregulation of the UPS has been implicated in cancer development and progression. Aberrant ubiquitin-mediated degradation of key regulatory proteins, such as tumor suppressors and oncoproteins, can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and metastasis. We outline the pivotal role of the UPS in modulating crucial oncogenic pathways, including the regulation of cyclins, transcription factors, Replication stress components and DNA damage response. The increasing recognition of the UPS as a target for cancer therapeutics has spurred the development of small molecules, peptides, and proteasome inhibitors with the potential to restore cellular balance and disrupt tumor growth. We provide an overview of current therapeutic strategies aimed at exploiting the UPS, including the use of proteasome inhibitors, deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitors, and novel E3 ligase modulators. We further discuss novel emerging strategies for the development of next-generation drugs that target proteasome inhibitors. Exploiting the UPS for cancer therapeutics offers promising avenues for developing innovative and effective treatment strategies, providing hope for improved patient outcomes in the fight against cancer.

AB  - Clear surgical margins for solid tumor resection are essential for preventing cancer recurrence and improving overall patient survival. Complete resection of tumors is often limited by a surgeon's ability to accurately locate malignant tissues and differentiate them from healthy tissue. Therefore, techniques or imaging modalities are required that would ease the identification and resection of tumors by real-time intraoperative visualization of tumors. Although conventional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or radiography play an essential role in preoperative diagnostics, these cannot be utilized in intraoperative tumor detection due to their large size, high cost, long imaging time, and lack of cancer specificity. The inception of several imaging techniques has paved the way to intraoperative tumor margin detection with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Particularly, molecular imaging using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) based nanoprobes provides superior imaging quality due to high signal-to-noise ratio, deep penetration to tissues, and low autofluorescence, enabling accurate tumor resection and improved survival rates. In this review, we discuss the recent developments in imaging technologies, specifically focusing on NIRF nanoprobes that aid in highly specific intraoperative surgeries with real-time recognition of tumor margins.

AB  - BackgroundParkinson's disease is generally asymptomatic at earlier stages. At an early stage, there is an extensive progression in the neuropathological hallmarks, although, at this stage, diagnosis is not possible with currently available diagnostic methods. Therefore, the pressing need is for susceptibility risk biomarkers that can aid in better diagnosis and therapeutics as well can objectively serve to measure the endpoint of disease progression. The role of small extracellular vesicles (sEV) in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases could be potent in playing a revolutionary role in biomarker discovery.MethodsIn our study, the salivary sEV were efficiently isolated by chemical precipitation combined with ultrafiltration from subjects (PD = 70, healthy controls = 26, and prodromal PD = 08), followed by antibody-based validation with CD63, CD9, GAPDH, Flotillin-1, and L1CAM. Morphological characterization of the isolated sEV through transmission electron microscopy. The quantification of sEV was achieved by fluorescence (lipid-binding dye-labeled) nanoparticle tracking analysis and antibody-based (CD63 Alexa fluor 488 tagged sEV) nanoparticle tracking analysis. The total alpha-synuclein (& alpha;-synTotal) in salivary sEVs cargo was quantified by ELISA. The disease severity staging confirmation for n = 18 clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients was done by 99mTc-TRODAT-single-photon emission computed tomography.ResultsWe observed a significant increase in total sEVs concentration in PD patients than in the healthy control (HC), where fluorescence lipid-binding dye-tagged sEV were observed to be higher in PD (p = 0.0001) than in the HC using NTA with a sensitivity of 94.34%. In the prodromal PD cases, the fluorescence lipid-binding dye-tagged sEV concentration was found to be higher (p = 0.008) than in HC. This result was validated through anti-CD63 tagged sEV (p = 0.0006) with similar sensitivity of 94.12%. We further validated our findings with the ELISA based on & alpha;-synTotal concentration in sEV, where it was observed to be higher in PD (p = 0.004) with a sensitivity of 88.24%. The caudate binding ratios in 99mTc-TRODAT-SPECT represent a positive correlation with sEV concentration (r = 0.8117 with p = 0.0112).ConclusionsIn this study, for the first time, we have found that the fluorescence-tagged sEV has the potential to screen the progression of disease with clinically acceptable sensitivity and can be a potent early detection method for PD.

AB  - Azathioprine (AZA) has demonstrated efficacy in multiple randomized control trials (RCTs) for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). However, we still need comparative real-world data with other first-line disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We aimed to assess AZA's effectiveness regarding relapses, disability progression, time to the first relapse, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, and safety compared with other approved first-line DMTs in an Indian population in a real-world setting. We conducted a single-center prospective study of treatment-naive RRMS patients between 2017 and 2019. We evaluated the effects of AZA and other approved DMTs on clinical and radiological measures. Among 192 eligible patients (F:M ratio 2.84:1), 68 patients (35.4%) were on AZA, 68 patients (35.4%) were on dimethyl fumarate (DMF), 32 patients (16.7%) on interferon (IFN beta-1a), and 16 patients (8.3%) on teriflunomide (TFL). Four treatment groups were comparable: AZA v/s DMF v/s TFL v/s IFN beta-1a. In primary outcomes, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of change in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at three months (p-value = 0.169), six months (p-value = 0.303), 12 months (p-value = 0.082), and 24 months (p-value = 0.639), the number of relapses (p-value = 0.229), and time to the first relapse (p-value > 0.05 in all groups). In the secondary outcome, there was no significant difference between the treatment groups on serial MRI parameters used according to "Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis" (MAGNIMS) 2016 criteria (p-value > 0.05). In safety outcomes, leukopenia was significantly more common in the AZA group (p-value = 0.025), flu-like symptoms (p-value = 0.0001), and injection site reactions (p-value = 0.035) were significantly more common in the IFN beta-1a group. Our study suggests AZA is as effective as other approved DMTs and a good alternative as a first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis's clinical and radiological activity in real-world settings on short follow-up. Based on these results, more randomized controlled trials of AZA v/s DMF or other DMTs are needed for more robust outcomes.

T2  - ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
KW  - factor analysis
KW  - online physiology teaching
KW  - principal component analysis
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and worldwide lockdowns brought major changes in education systems. There was a sudden obliga-tory shift toward utilization of digital resources for teaching and learning purposes. Medical education, specifically physiology teaching, comprises hands-on training in the laboratory. It is challenging to offer a course like physiology in a virtual format. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and influence of virtual classroom technology on online physiology edu-cation in a sample size of 83 first-year MBBS undergraduates. A questionnaire comprising questions related to technology accessibility and utilization, comprehensibility and effectiveness of instructions, faculty proficiency, and learning outcomes was administered to the group. The responses were collected and analyzed. Validation through principal components and factor analysis showed that online teaching is not very effective and has a limited application in the physiology education of under-graduate MBBS students. Our study also revealed that virtual physiology teaching of undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic had a moderate level of effectiveness. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the present qualitative study, we have conducted and validated an online physiology teaching plat-form at a medical college to continue medical education during the peak times of the COVID-19 pandemic and prolonged lock -downs. Furthermore, we have evaluated the effectiveness of online physiology teaching through multidimensional feedback from undergraduate MBBS students. It is experimental evidence of inadequate sustainability, moderate efficacy, limited applica-tion, and poor first-hand experience gained by the students in virtual physiology teaching in a preclinical and clinical setting.

AB  - Corneal blindness (CB) is one of the leading causes of blindness in India and globally, affecting around 8 million population worldwide. Many of these corneal blind patients may be visually rehabilitated by corneal transplantation (CT). Eye banking plays a crucial role in facilitating CT and ocular research. Many countries have adopted regulatory frameworks, quality assurance programs, and technological advancements to enhance the efficacy and safety of CT. Various infrastructural and organizational frameworks of eye banks (EBs) in India, according to the Eye Bank Association of India (EBAI), aid in establishing guidelines and standards for EB practices. Initiatives such as the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) have significantly contributed to eye donation rates and improved access to donor corneas. This review article discusses the established eye banking networks in countries such as India, the United States (USA), and Europe, where dedicated EB organizations work collaboratively to ensure efficient procurement, processing, and distribution of corneal tissue. It also highlights specific strategies employed in India and global countries to address EBs' challenges. These challenges include the shortage of donor corneas, improving donor screening and tissue processing techniques, ensuring timely distribution of corneal tissue, and maintaining high-quality standards. Interestingly, the comparative analysis between India and other developed countries highlights the similarities and differences in eye banking strategies. By understanding the strategies employed by different regions, EBs can learn from each other's experiences and work toward achieving optimal outcomes in CT and ocular research worldwide. It underscores the importance of knowledge sharing and collaborative efforts in addressing common challenges and implementing best practices in eye banking.

AB  - Resistance to therapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a critical clinical problem and identification of novel therapeutic targets is highly warranted. Dipeptidyl pep-tidase III (DPP3) is a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase and functions in the terminal stages of the protein turnover. Several studies have reported overexpression and oncogenic func-tions of DPP3 in numerous malignancies. The present study aimed to determine the ex -pression pattern and functional role of DPP3 in ESCC. DPP3 expression was assessed in normal and tumor tissues using quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR and corroborated with ESCC gene expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The cancer genome atlas (TCGA). DPP3 stable knockdown was performed in ESCC cells by shRNA and its effect on cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, apoptosis, and activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway was assessed. The results suggested that DPP3 is overexpressed in ESCC and its knockdown leads to reduced proliferation, in-creased apoptosis, and inhibited migration of ESCC cells. Additionally, DPP3 knockdown leads to down-regulation of the NRF2 pathway proteins, such as NRF2, G6PD, and NQO1 along with increased sensitivity toward oxidative stress-induced cell death and chemother-apy. Conclusively, these results demonstrate critical role of DPP3 in ESCC and DPP3/NRF2 axis may serve as an attractive therapeutic target against chemoresistance in this malig-nancy.

AB  - These guidelines discuss the epidemiology, screening, diagnosis, posttransplant prophylaxis, monitoring, and management of endemic infections in solid organ transplant (SOT) candidates, recipients, and donors in South Asia. The guidelines also provide recommendations for SOT recipients traveling to this region. These guidelines are based on literature review and expert opinion by transplant physicians, surgeons, and infectious diseases specialists, mostly from South Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) as well as transplant experts from other countries. These guidelines cover relevant endemic bacterial infections (tuberculosis, leptospirosis, melioidosis, typhoid, scrub typhus), viral infections (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E; rabies; and the arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Japanese encephalitis), endemic fungal infections (mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, sporotrichosis), and endemic parasitic infections (malaria, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, strongyloidiasis, and filariasis) as well as travelers' diarrhea and vaccination for SOT candidates and recipients including travelers visiting this region. These guidelines are intended to be an overview of each topic; more detailed reviews are being published as a special supplement in the Indian Journal of Transplantation.

AB  - Context center dot Gas discharge visualization (GDV) works on the principle of the Kirlian effect. It's a noninvasive, quick, and safe biometric tool to investigate the psychophysiological state of an individual, with the potential to identify deviations from the healthy functioning of humans at early stages.
   Objective center dot The study intended to systematically document the scientific evidence pertaining to the use of GDV devices in human health and disease conditions.
   Design center dot The research team performed a systematic search for studies on GDV on research databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and PsychINFO, using the following inclusion criteria: (1) experimental studies dealing with a GDV device, (2) studies dealing with human participants related to health and disease, and (3) studies published in the English language. The study excluded: (1) review articles, (2) case studies, (3) letter to editors, (4) studies with unclear methodology, and (5) studies published before the year 2000.
   Setting center dot The study took place in the Department of Integrative Medicine at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru, India. Results center dot After filtering, the research team obtained 108 publications that dealt with the application of a GDV device in human participants. Based on the selection criteria, 42 studies were included in the review. These 42 studies included eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs), five nonrandomized controlled studies, 17 cross-sectional studies, 10 single-group pre-post studies, and two correlational studies.
   Conclusions center dot More studies with a robust methodology are needed to make definitive conclusions. The literature reveals that the GDV technique has the potential to provide early diagnosis and screening, especially in disorders of the endocrine and immune systems. It might also be used to assess wellness in healthy subjects and monitor the effects of interventions, such as yoga-including pranayama and meditation, acupuncture, qigong, music therapy, and massage on the human energy system. Future studies should focus on the validation of GDV imaging in clinical settings.

AB  - The asymptomatic nature, high rate of disease recurrence, and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy highlight the need to identify and characterize novel target molecules for ovarian cancer. Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) aids in the development and metastasis of ovarian cancer; however, its definite role is not clear. We employed ELISA and IHC to examine the expression of FGF8 in the saliva and tissue samples of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and controls. Furthermore, various cell assays were conducted to determine how FGF8 silencing influences ovarian cancer cell survival, adhesion, migration, and invasion to learn more about the functions of FGF8. In saliva samples, from controls through low-grade to high-grade EOC, a stepped overexpression of FGF8 was observed. Similar expression trends were seen in tissue samples, both at protein and mRNA levels. FGF8 gene silencing in SKOV3 cells adversely affected various cell properties essential for cancer cell survival and metastasis. A substantial reduction was observed in the cell survival, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, migration, and adhesion properties of SKOV3 cells, suggesting that FGF8 plays a crucial role in the development of EOC. Conclusively, this study suggests a pro-metastatic function of FGF8 in EOC.

AB  - One of the mechanisms shaping the pathophysiology during the infection of enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium is host PTM machinery utilization by the pathogen encoded effectors. Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) during infection in host cells thrives in a vacuolated compartment, Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV), which sequentially acquires host endosomal and lysosomal markers. Long tubular structures, called as Salmonella induced filaments (SIFs), are further generated by S. Tm, which are known to be required for SCV's nutrient acquisition, membran maintenance and stability. A tightly coordinated interaction involving prominent effector SifA and various host adapters PLEKHM1, PLEKHM2 and Rab GTPases govern SCV integrity and SIF formation. Here, we report for the first time that the functional regulation of SifA is modulated by PTM SUMOylation at its 11th lysine. S. Tm expressing SUMOylation deficient lysine 11 mutants of SifA (SifAK11R) is defective in intracellular proliferation due to compromised SIF formation and enhanced lysosomal acidification. Furthermore, murine competitive index experiments reveal defective in vivo proliferation and weakened virulence of SifAK11R mutant. Concisely, our data reveal that SifAK11R mutant nearly behaves like a SifA knockout strain which impacts Rab9-MPR mediated lysosomal acidification pathway, the outcome of which culminates in reduced bacterial load in in vitro and in vivo infection model systems. Our results bring forth a novel pathogen-host crosstalk mechanism where the SUMOylation of effector SifA regulated S. Tm intracellular survival.

AB  - Corneal blindness ranks third among the causes of blindness worldwide, after cataract and glaucoma. Corneal transplantation offers us a means to address this, and is currently the most commonly performed transplantation procedure worldwide - restoring the gift of sight to many an eye. Eye banks play a very important role in these procedures. India was quick to develop its own eye bank in 1945 soon after the launch of world's first eye bank in 1944. The evolution over the past six decades has been tremendous, placing India on the top, with one of the largest eye-banking system in the world. As of 2023, around 740 members are registered under the Eye Bank Association of India. The highest-ever collection of 71,700 donor eyes was achieved in 2017-2018. The overall tissue utilisation rate ranged between 22 - 28 % for voluntary donations and 50% for hospital-based corneal retrieval programs. Though India has an excellent infrastructure and readiness for corneal transplantation surgery, the need of the hour is to create a strong and independent nodal system. It shall take care of the logistics and factor in technological advances - surgical and otherwise. Public awareness, a national corneal grid, and reducing the red-tape barriers, shall improve availability of grafts nationwide. This review aims to detail the evolution of eye banking in India, to provide a comprehensive understanding, and help the stakeholders focus on the road ahead to attain our targets faster.

AB  - Background: Surgical site infection (SSI) rates (1-9%) remain high despite the widespread adoption of infection control bundles. Topical vancomycin has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the rate of SSI in patients undergoing spinal surgery including instrumentation. However, its use and efficiency in cranial neurosurgery is not well established. The aim of this study is to study the efficacy of topical vancomycin in cranial neurosurgery.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data regarding type of surgery, use of implants, the dose of vancomycin, technique of administration in each study, outcomes, rate of SSI, and the interval between surgery and SSI; possible complications related to antibiotic use were collected.
   Results: A total of 12 studies were included in the qualitative analysis with 3,446 patients. SSI developed in 1.6% of the patients in the vancomycin group as compared to 5.28% in the control group. The pooled risk ratio was 0.24 with 95% CI: 0.12-0.51 (P-value: <0.00001). The difference between the subgroups was significant (P-value: < 0.00001). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 27.2. The studies showed low heterogeneity with an I-2 of 24%. Meta-regression analysis showed that the number of patients in a study, duration of follow-up, and year of publication did not contribute significantly to effect size.
   Conclusion: The limited systemic absorption of vancomycin and broad-spectrum led to its widespread applicability in the prevention of SSI in all types of cranial neurosurgery. Cases with implantable pulse generators, cranioplasty, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion procedures have all demonstrated their unequivocal effectiveness.

AB  - ObjectivePolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder with diverse metabolic implications. Diagnosis typically relies on oligo-amenorrhoea (OA), hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM). However, the role of polymenorrhoea in PCOS remains understudied. Additionally, limited information exists regarding metabolic disturbances in women with partial PCOS phenotypes that do not meet diagnostic criteria. This extensive database aims to provide substantial evidence on the metabolic implications of polymenorrhoea and partial PCOS phenotypes.DesignProspective observational study.Patients and MeasurementsIn this single-centre study, 6463 women with PCOS-like characteristics and 3142 age-matched healthy women were included. The study compared clinical (anthropometry, modified Ferriman Gallwey [mFG] score), hormonal (serum testosterone), and metabolic (plasma glucose, serum lipids, insulin) characteristics between women diagnosed with PCOS, those with partial PCOS phenotypes, and the healthy control groupResultsIn all, 5174 women met Rotterdam criteria for PCOS diagnosis, while 737 were classified as Pre-PCOS, including HA (n = 538), OA (n = 121), or PCOM (n = 78). Common clinical features included oligomenorrhoea (75.5%), hirsutism (82.9%), obesity (27.2%), hypertension (1.6%), metabolic syndrome (19.6%), and diabetes mellitus (5.6%). Women diagnosed with PCOS, HA only, and OA only exhibited higher average body mass index, plasma glucose levels (both fasting and 2 h after the oral glucose tolerance test), and lipid fractions in comparison to those with PCOM and the healthy controls. However, indices of insulin resistance were similar among women with PCOS, HA, PCOM, and OA, albeit higher than in the healthy controls. The polymenorrhoea subgroup (5.9%) had lower BMI and serum testosterone, but similar mFG score, plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid levels as the oligomenorrhoea subgroup.ConclusionThe metabolic disturbances observed in Pre-PCOS women highlight the need to reassess diagnostic criteria. Including the polymenorrhoea subcategory in PCOS criteria is recommended due to similar metabolic dysfunctions as the oligomenorrhoea group.

AB  - Background & objectives: Vitamin D plays an important role in bone metabolism, and liver is the intermediary site of vitamin D metabolism. The purpose of this study was to study the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and bone health in patients with cirrhosis.
   Methods: Prospectively, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] level were assessed in cirrhotics by chemiluminescence method. Endocrine Society Clinical practice guideline was used to define deficiency and insufficiency of vitamin D. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the World Health Organization criteria was used to define osteoporosis and osteopenia. The lowest T score at the left hip neck or lumbar spine was taken as osteoporosis or osteopenia. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was used to assess the severity of cirrhosis.
   Results: Cirrhotics (n=350, male: 278, compensated: 210) were included. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 8.75 ng/ml. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and low-BMD (osteopenia and osteoporosis) was 89.4 and 86 per cent, respectively. VDD, insufficiency and osteoporosis was found in 86.7, 11.9 and 33.8 per cent, respectively, in patients with compensated cirrhosis; and 93.6, 3.6 and 40 per cent, respectively, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Body mass index of >25 kg/m(2) was protective for bone health.
   Interpretation & conclusions: VDD and low-BMD is prevalent in Indian patients with cirrhosis and should be looked for in patients with cirrhosis for its prevention.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality after acute myocardial infarction
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines are highly immunogenic but cardiovascular effects of these vaccines have not been properly elucidated.ObjectivesTo determine impact of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).MethodsThis was a single center retrospective observation study among patients with AMI enrolled in the the North India ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NORIN-STEMI) registry. In all the enrolled patients, data regarding patient's vaccination status including details on type of vaccine, date of vaccination and adverse effects were obtained. All enrolled subjects were followed up for a period of six months. The primary outcome of the study was all-cause mortality both at one month and at six months of follow-up. Propensity-weighted score logistic regression model using inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to determine the impact of vaccination status on all-cause mortality.ResultsA total of 1578 subjects were enrolled in the study of whom 1086(68.8%) were vaccinated against COVID-19 while 492(31.2%) were unvaccinated. Analysis of the temporal trends of occurrence of AMI post vaccination did not show a specific clustering of AMI at any particular time. On 30-day follow-up, all-cause mortality occurred in 201(12.7%) patients with adjusted odds of mortality being significantly lower in vaccinated group (adjusted odds ratio[aOR]: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.47-0.71). Similarly, at six months of follow-up, vaccinated AMI group had lower odds of mortality(aOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.65) as compared to non-vaccinated group.ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccines have shown to decrease all-cause mortality at 30 days and six months following AMI.

KW  - CNKSR2 gene
KW  - missense mutation
KW  - refractory epilepsy
KW  - X-linked syndromic mental retardation
AB  - Background: Mental retardation, X-linked, syndromic, Houge type (MRXSHG) is a form of mental retardation characterized by intellectual disability, speech and language impairments, and early-onset seizures. It has been recently recorded in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and only 10 cases have been reported in the literature so far.
   Objective: To highlight the novel neuroimaging findings in the pediatric X-linked intellectual disability with a missense mutation of connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of RAS2 (CNKSR2) gene. Material and Methods: We present a case of intellectual disability, refractory epilepsy, speech and language delay with subtle dysmorphism, and behavioral issues in an 11-year-old boy with novel neuroimaging findings in a CNKSR2 gene with missense mutation.
   Results: Brain MRI revealed involvement of the basal ganglia, predominantly the neostriatum, and along with the subependymal aspects with focal cavitations involving, especially the bilateral caudate heads. There was relative sparing of the globus pallidi and posterior putamina bilaterally. Whole-exome sequencing identified a hemizygous missense pathogenic variant in the CNKSR2 gene. The mother was found to be an asymptomatic carrier.
   Conclusion: This case report highlights the rare missense mutation in the CNKSR2 gene and abnormal neuroimaging findings, which further provide information about the phenotypic characteristics of X-linked syndromic intellectual disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of these clinical standards is to aid the diagnosis and management of asthma in lowresource settings in lowand middle -income countries (LMICs). METHODS: A panel of 52 experts in the field of asthma in LMICs participated in a two -stage Delphi process to establish and reach a consensus on the clinical standards. RESULTS: Eighteen clinical standards were defined: Standard 1, Every individual with symptoms and signs compatible with asthma should undergo a clinical assessment; Standard 2, In individuals (>6 years) with a clinical assessment supportive of a diagnosis of asthma, a hand-held spirometry measurement should be used to confirm variable expiratory airflow limitation by demonstrating an acute response to a bronchodilator; Standard 3, Pre- and postbronchodilator spirometry should be performed in individuals (>6 years) to support diagnosis before treatment is commenced if there is diagnostic uncertainty; Standard 4, Individuals with an acute exacerbation of asthma and clinical signs of hypoxaemia or increased work of breathing should be given supplementary oxygen to maintain saturation at 94-98%; Standard 5, Inhaled short -acting beta -2 agonists (SABAs) should be used as an emergency reliever in individuals with asthma via an appropriate spacer device for metered -dose inhalers; Standard 6, Short -course oral corticosteroids should be administered in appropriate doses to individuals having moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbations (minimum 3-5 days); Standard 7, Individuals having a severe asthma exacerbation should receive emergency care, including oxygen therapy, systemic corticosteroids, inhaled bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol with or without ipratropium bromide) and a single dose of intravenous magnesium sulphate should be considered; Standard 8, All individuals with asthma should receive education about asthma and a personalised action plan; Standard 9, Inhaled medications (excluding drypowder devices) should be administered via an appropriate spacer device in both adults and children. Children aged 0-3 years will require the spacer to be coupled to a face mask; Standard 10, Children aged <5 years with asthma should receive a SABA as -needed at step 1 and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to cover periods of wheezing due to respiratory viral infections, and SABA as -needed and daily ICS from step 2 upwards; Standard 11, Children aged 6-11 years with asthma should receive an ICS taken whenever an inhaled SABA is used; Standard 12, All adolescents aged 12-18 years and adults with asthma should receive a combination inhaler (ICS and rapid onset of action long -acting beta-agonist [LABA] such as budesonide-formoterol), where available, to be used either as -needed (for mild asthma) or as both maintenance and reliever therapy, for moderate to severe asthma; Standard 13, Inhaled SABA alone for the management of patients aged >12 years is not recommended as it is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It should only be used where there is no access to ICS. The following standards (14-18) are for settings where there is no access to inhaled medicines. Standard 14, Patients without access to corticosteroids should be provided with a single short course of emergency oral prednisolone; Standard 15, Oral SABA for symptomatic relief should be used only if no inhaled SABA is available.
   Adjust to the individual's lowest beneficial dose to minimise adverse effects; Standard 16, Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) can be used as a preventive medication and is preferable to the use of long-term oral systemic corticosteroids; Standard 17, In exceptional circumstances, when there is a high risk of mortality from exacerbations, low -dose oral prednisolone daily or on alternate days may be considered on a case -by -case basis; Standard 18. Oral theophylline should be restricted for use in situations where it is the only bronchodilator treatment option available. CONCLUSION: These first consensus -based clinical standards for asthma management in LMICs are intended to help clinicians provide the most effective care for people in resource -limited settings.

AB  - Lipogenic differentiation in ependymoma is an infrequent occurrence with very few reported cases. The grading was done solely based on the histomorphology and molecular subtyping was not described in such ependymomas. New molecular classification divided ependymomas in nine different subgroups, of which supratentorial location tumor usually exhibits C11orf95-RELA, YAP1-MAMLD1, and YAP1-FAM118B fusion proteins. A 46-year-old female presented with headache and right-sided parapresis. Radilogy revealed a large intraxial left parietooccipital mass lesion, which histologically and immuohistochemically confirmed as anaplastic ependymoma with extensive lipogenic changes. The ependymal origin of the tumor was corroborated by the immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural studies. Molecular studies for C11orf95-RELA, YAP1-MAMLD1, and YAP1-FAM118B fusion proteins were negative. This is the first documentation of fusion negative supratentorial anaplastic ependymoma with lipogenic differentiation. This novel finding needs further reinforcement by similar studies to identify its impact on the disease outcome.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the current trends in use of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, especially intracameral antibiotics (ICAB), for cataract surgery in India. Methods: This was an E-survey using a previously validated questionnaire carried out by the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) in August 2022. An E-mail invitation to complete an online 40-point survey was sent to all members of the AIOS using a digital E-mail service (Survey Monkey) and social media platforms. Results: Out of 1804 total respondents, 58% (n = 1022) reported using routine ICAB prophylaxis. Of those using ICAB, 89% (n = 909) reported using it for all cases, whereas the rest used it for specific indications such as post-PC rent (n = 43), one eyed patient (n = 19), and high-risk cases (n = 50). Commercially available moxifloxacin was by far the commonest agent used for ICAB (n = 686, 67%). Eighty respondents (8%) reported noticing occasional toxic reactions and nontoxic corneal edema (n = 64, 6%) with ICAB. Surgeons with >10 years' experience especially practicing in medical colleges used fewer ICAB (OR = 0.52, 95%CI = 0.38 - 0.72, P < 0,001) compared to younger surgeons (<5-year experience) in solo clinics. The commonest reason for nonadoption of IC antibiotics was "unconvinced of the need to use it in my setting" (n = 296, 52% of those who answered this question). Conclusion: IC antibiotic prophylaxis for cataract surgery has significantly increased in India from 40% in 2017 to 58% in 2022. Commercially available moxifloxacin was preferred by the majority users. Intraocular inflammation may occur occasionally and needs safer formulations to avoid this.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the association between the contact areas of primary molar teeth and approximal caries after three years of observation. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 1,119 caries-free children, aged three to four years, from Puducherry, India. At baseline, 4,476 contacts were assessed using the OXIS criteria, which denotes O for open contact and X, I, and S for closed contacts. X contact represents a point contact, I is a straight contact, and S is a curved contact. Two calibrated dentists measured dental caries at one-year intervals following the International Caries Detection and Assessment System for three years. Poisson regression analysis with a multilevel approach was used to determine the association between contact type and approximal caries. Results: Of 3,848 contacts observed at the end of three years, 499 (13 percent) were carious. The adjusted analysis revealed a significant association between contact type and approximal caries (P<0.05). The risk ratios for the development of approximal caries were 2.3 for X-type contacts (0.5 to 11.4, P=0.307), 12.7 for I-type (4.1 to 39.6, P<0.05), and 22.5 for S-type (7.2 to 70.6, P<0.05) when compared with O-type. Conclusions: Compelling evidence suggests that variations in contacts between teeth are significant in the development of approximal caries. The S-type contact is the most susceptible to approximal caries, followed by the I-type.

AB  - Objective To compare the analgesic efficacy of two techniques of morphine titration (intermittent intravenous bolus vs infusion) by calculating rescue dosage in a day at 1 week after analgesic titration.Methods One hundred and forty cancer patients were randomised into two groups. In group 1, intravenous morphine 1.5 mg bolus given every 10 min until Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score <4 is achieved. Total intravenous dose converted to oral dose (1:1) and administered every 4 hours. In group 2, intravenous bolus morphine 0.05 mg/kg body weight administered followed by 0.025 mg/kg/hour intravenous infusion. The NRS pain score was recorded every 10 min but infusion rate was titrated every 30 min if required. The infusion rate of morphine was doubled if the pain score was unchanged and increased to 50% when NRS was between 4 and baseline. If NRS<4, then infusion at same rate was continued. Once the NRS<4 for two consecutive hours, total intravenous dose for 24 hours was calculated and converted to oral morphine in a ratio of 1:3 and divided into six doses given over 24 hours. For rescue (pain score & GE;4) analgesia, one-sixth of the total daily oral dose was prescribed. The primary outcome of this study was to note the number of rescue doses of oral morphine in a day at 1 week.Results The rescue dosage in a day at 1-week post discharge from the palliative care unit was significantly higher in group 1 as compared with group 2.Conclusion Intravenous infusion morphine may be a better analgesic titration technique for analgesia in patients with advanced cancer.Trial registration number CTRI/2018/04/013369.

AB  - The management of an episode of corneal graft rejection (CGR) is primarily by corticosteroids. Immunomodulators are useful for long-term immunosuppression and in dealing with cases of high-risk (HR) corneal grafts. The classical signs of CGR following penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) include rejection line, anterior chamber (AC) reaction, and graft edema. However, these signs may be absent or subtle in cases of endothelial keratoplasty (EK). Prevention of an episode of graft rejection is of utmost importance as it can reduce the need for donor cornea significantly. In our previous article (IJO_2866_22), we had discussed about the immunopathogenesis of CGR. In this review article, we aim to discuss the various clinical aspects and management of CGR.

AB  - Background: The nosological tradition in psychiatry defines diagnostic criteria for disorders based on expert consensus than objective biological markers reflecting underlying neurobiological correlates. Endophenotypes have been researched as heritable biological markers that can be quantified and defined to represent intermediate measures of a psychiatric illness. In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), various putative biomarkers such as neuropsychological, neurophysiological, neuroradiological, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), etc., have been explored.Aim: The study aimed to compare levels of serum BDNF in individuals with OCD and their unaffected first-degree relatives (FDR) with healthy controls (HC).Methods: This cross-sectional study compared serum BDNF levels in medication-free/naive individuals with OCD (n = 30) to their FDR (n = 30) and age-sex matched HC (n = 30). Intergroup comparison was done using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey's test. Correlation analysis was conducted to find the relationship of sociodemographic and clinical correlates to serum BDNF as well as dimensional subtypes of OCD.Results: No significant difference in BDNF levels was observed between OCD and HC (P = 0.13) but a significantly higher level was found in the FDR group compared to age-sex matched HC (P = 0.02).Conclusion: BDNF levels may have a complex interplay influencing the genetic inheritance and clinical manifestations of OCD. Further research is required before considering it a viable biomarker.

AB  - Background & objectives: Current practice around transfusion trigger in critically ill sepsis patients is not clear. Moreover, any association of haemoglobin trigger and other transfusion parameters such as age of red blood cells (RBCs) at transfusion and number of units of RBCs transfused with mortality and other adverse outcomes need further assessment.
   Methods: In this prospective study, patients aged 18-70 yr and admitted to intensive care with a diagnosis of sepsis were included (n=108). Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters were noted and various transfusion data, i.e., haemoglobin trigger, number of units of RBCs and the age of RBCs were recorded. Following outcome data were collected: 28 and 90 day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay and requirement of renal replacement therapy.
   Results: Of the total 108 participants, 78 (72.2%) survived till 28 days and 66 (61.1%) survived till 90 days. Transfusion trigger was 6.9 (6.7-7.1) g/dl [median (interquartile range)]. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) (95% confidence interval {CI}): 0.86 (0.78, 0.96); P=0.005], cumulative fluid balance (CFB) [aOR (95% CI): 0.99 (0.99, 0.99); P=0.005] and admission platelet count [aOR (95% CI): 1.69 (1.01, 2.84); P=0.043] were the predictors of 28 day mortality [model area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) 0.81]. APACHE II [aOR (95% CI): 0.88 (0.81, 0.97); P=0.013], CFB [a OR (95% CI): 0.99977 (0.99962, 0.99993); P=0.044] and transfusion trigger [aOR (95% CI): 3 (1.07, 8.34); P=0.035] were the predictors of 90 day mortality (model AUROC: 0.82).
   Interpretation & conclusions: In sepsis, patients admitted to the ICU, current practice suggests transfusion trigger is below 7 g/dl and it does not affect any adverse outcome including 28 day mortality.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
KW  - Alcohol
KW  - health
KW  - policy
AB  - Alcohol use is a major public health issue. It is also associated with a range of family, social, and economic problems. This led multiple countries worldwide to adopt national policies for alcohol regulation. Over the years, alcohol use and related problems have increased in India. The existing regulatory framework on alcohol varies greatly across states in terms of government sanctions, pricing, and legal drinking age, resulting in variations in its availability and prevalence of alcohol use disorder and related harms. Despite alcohol use being mentioned in several national policies and plans, a comprehensive national policy addressing alcohol is lacking. In this manuscript, the need for a dedicated national alcohol policy is underscored, emphasizing its potential to mobilize resources, prioritize interventions, and guide various stakeholders. The timely implementation of such a policy is crucial to address the multifaceted challenge of alcohol use effectively.

AB  - Background:COVID-19 infection is associated with neurological manifestations, including various types of movement disorders (MD). A thorough review of individual patients with COVID-19-induced MD would help in better understanding the clinical profile and outcome of these patients and in prognostication.Objective:We conducted an individual patient-systematic review to study the clinical and imaging profile and outcomes of patients with COVID-19-associated MD.Methods:A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted by two independent reviewers. Individual patient data COVID from case reports and case series on COVID-19-associated MD, published between December 2019 and December 2022, were extracted and analyzed.Results:Data of 133 patients with COVID-19-associated MD from 82 studies were analyzed. Mean age was 55 +/- 18 years and 77% were males. A mixed movement disorder was most commonly seen (41%); myoclonus-ataxia was the most frequent (44.4%). Myoclonus significantly correlated with age (odds ratio (OR) 1.02 P = 0.03, CI 1-1.04). Tremor had the longest latency to develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection [median (IQR) 21 (10-40) days, P = 0.009, CI 1.01-1.05]. At short-term follow-up, myoclonus improved (OR 14.35, P value = 0.01, CI 1.71-120.65), whereas parkinsonism (OR 0.09, P value = 0.002, CI 0.19-0.41) and tremor (OR 0.16, P value = 0.016, CI 0.04-0.71) persisted.Conclusion:Myoclonus-ataxia was the most common movement disorder after COVID-19 infection. Myoclonus was seen in older individuals and usually improved. Tremor and parkinsonism developed after a long latency and did not improve in the short-term.

TI  - Vaginal Vault Infiltration With Bupivacaine for Postoperative Pain Control After Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy: A Randomized Control Trial EDITORIAL COMMENT
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
AB  - A viable alternative to total abdominal hysterectomy is total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), which offers abdominal route advantages for women in need of total hysterectomy for benign diseases. Fewer complications, faster recovery, and less pain are ensured by laparoscopy, although this method is not entirely devoid of pain. Reports from various authors indicate that up to 80% of laparoscopic surgery patients require opioid analgesia, which could increase hospital-stay duration and delay mobilization/recovery. Because of these statistics, opioid analgesic usages ought to be minimized, for the aforementioned reasons and also to prevent additional adverse effects. This study was performed to evaluate efficacy of reducing postoperative pain by infiltration of bupivacaine, a long-acting anesthetic agent, into the vaginal vault after TLH. This study was a randomized control trial designed as a 2-arm double-blinded study conducted at a North-Indian Apical Center in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. After written informed consent from all patients, computer-generated randomization software placed them in 1 of 2 groups: group 1, the intervention group (received the infiltration of bupivacaine in the vaginal vault following TLH), or group 2 (the control group). The inclusion criteria were a uterine size of <= 12 weeks' pregnancy and patients requiring TLH with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine size and benign conditions. Exclusion criteria were contraindication to any medication used by the study, presence of malignancy, history of multiple surgeries, and history of inflammatory disease. Postoperative pain outcome measured in both groups at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours via a visual analog score was the primary outcome. The secondary outcome was the need for rescue analgesia. A complete profile of each patient was created, using eligibility criteria, body mass index, and demographic profile, and a complete gynecological and physical examination was performed, along with preoperative investigations for fitness to general anesthesia. Per standard protocol, general anesthesia was administered for all surgeries. After vault closure, a fine-tipped aspiration needle was used to administer 10 mL of bupivacaine, which was infiltrated laparoscopically at 2 different locations, approximately 2-4 cm apart. The control group omitted this step. In the first 24 hours after operation, pain was treated using 1 g intravenous paracetamol every 6 hours. For the next 5 days, patients were given nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac) 3 times daily for 5 days. Participants scaled their pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) score at the 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours intervals postsurgery. Scores greater than 4 initiated the distribution of tramadol 50 mg intramuscular. Also recorded were the uterine weight, the operative time, complications, and the amount of operative bleeding. Group 1 patients exhibited VAS scores of less than 4 at 1 hour postsurgery (100%), 3 hours postsurgery (100%), 6 hours postsurgery (97%), 12 hours postsurgery (96.7%), and 24 hours postsurgery (36.7%). The control group VAS scores of less than 4 for the respective times were as follows: 1 hour (93%), 3 hours (86.6%), 6 hours (30%), 12 hours (10%), and 24 hours (3.3%). From these data, it is clear that the infiltration with a local analgesia was effective in reducing postoperative pain. Overall, a feasible and safe option for postoperative pain relief is vaginal cuff infiltration with local anesthetic.
   A significant increase in the number of women experiencing minimal postoperative pain for 24 hours after laparoscopic hysterectomy took place due to infiltration of the vaginal vault with 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine (with no complications). Furthermore, this method reduces requirements of additional opioid/analgesia usage. The beneficial use of local vault infiltration with bupivacaine after TLH within the first 24 postoperative hours is highlighted by this study.

AB  - A novel series of nitrostyrene-based spirooxindoles were synthesized via the reaction of substituted isatins 1a-b, a number of alpha-amino acids 2a-e and (E)-2-aryl-1-nitroethenes 3a-e in a chemo/regio-selective manner using [3+2] cycloaddition (Huisgen) reaction under microwave irradiation conditions. The structure elucidation of all the synthesized spirooxindoles were done using 1H and 13C NMR and HRMS spectral analysis. The single crystal X-ray crystallographic study of compound 4l was used to assign the stereochemical arrangements of the groups around the pyrrolidine ring in spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3 '-oxindoles] skeleton. The in vitro anticancer activity of spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3 '-oxindoles] analogs 4a-w against human lung (A549) and liver (HepG2) cancer cell lines along with immortalized normal lung (BEAS-2B) and liver (LO2) cell lines shows promising results. Out of the 23 synthesized spiro[pyrrolidine-2,3 '-oxindoles], while five compounds (4c, 4f, 4m, 4q, 4t) (IC50 = 34.99-47.92 mu M; SI = 0.96-2.43) displayed significant in vitro anticancer activity against human lung (A549) cancer cell lines, six compounds (4c, 4f, 4k, 4m, 4q, 4t) (IC50 = 41.56-86.53 mu M; SI = 0.49-0.99) displayed promising in vitro anticancer activity against human liver (HepG2) cancer cell lines. In the case of lung (A549) cancer cell lines, these compounds were recognized to be more efficient and selective than standard reference artemisinin (IC50 = 100 mu M) and chloroquine (IC50 = 100 mu M; SI: 0.03). However, none of them were found to be active as compared to artesunic acid [IC50 = 9.85 mu M; SI = 0.76 against lung (A549) cancer cell line and IC50 = 4.09 mu M; SI = 2.01 against liver (HepG2) cancer cell line].

AB  - Cardiomyopathy (particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)) significantly contributes to development and progression of heart failure (HF), and inflammatory factors further deteriorate the symptoms. Morphological and functional defects of the heart in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy (cardiotoxicity) are similar to those of DCM. We used anagonist of PGC-1a (PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma)-? coactivator-1a) that is considered as the 'master regulator' of mitochondrial biogenesis with an aim to rescue the DOX-induced deleterious effects on the heart. Forty male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) were divided in four groups, Control, DOX, ZLN005, and ZLN005 + DOX (n = 10 each group). The DOX-induced (10 mg/kg, single dose) cardiomyopathy mimics a DCM-like phenotype with marked morphologic alteration in cardiac tissue and functional derangements. Significant increased staining was observed for Masson Trichrome/Picrosirius red and a-Smooth Muscle Actinin (a-SMA) that indicated enhanced fibrosis in the DOX group compared to the control that was attenuated by (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-?) coactivator) (PGC)-1a (alpha) agonist (four doses of 2.5 mg/kg/dose; cumulative dose = 10 mg/kg). Similarly, elevated expression of necroptosis markers along with enhanced oxidative stress in the DOX group were alleviated by PGC-1a agonist. These data collectively suggested the potent therapeutic efficacy of PGC-1a agonist in mitigating the deleterious effects of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, and it may be targeted in developing the future therapeutics for the management of DCM/HF.

AB  - Salt plays a critical role in India's past as well as its present, from Dandi March to its role as a vehicle for micronutrient fortification. However, excess salt intake is a risk factor for high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Indians consume double the World Health Organization recommended daily salt (<5 g). India has committed to a 30 per cent reduction in sodium intake by 2025. Evidence based strategies for population sodium intake reduction require a moderate reduction in salt in - home cooked foods, packaged foods and outside-home foods. Reducing the sodium content in packaged food includes policy driven interventions such as front-of-package warning labels, food reformulation, marketing restrictions and taxation on high sodium foods. For foods outside of the home, setting standards for foods purchased and served by schemes like mid-day meals can have a moderate impact. For home cooked foods (the major source of sodium), strategies include advocacy for reducing salt intake. In addition to mass media campaigns for awareness generation, substituting regular salt with low sodium salt (LSS) has the potential to reduce salt intake even in the absence of a major shift in consumer behaviour. LSS substitution effectively lowers blood pressure and thus reduces the risk of CVDs. Further research is required on the effect of LSS substitutes on patients with chronic kidney disease. India needs an integrated approach to sodium reduction that uses evidence based strategies and can be implemented sustainably at scale. This will be possible only through scientific research, governmental leadership and a responsive evidence-to-action approach through a multi-stakeholder coalition.

AB  - Background: Acute appendicitis is a frequently encountered surgical emergency. Despite several scoring systems, the possibility of delayed diagnosis persists. In addition, a delayed diagnosis leads to an increased risk of complicated appendicitis. Hence, there is a need to identify biological markers to help clinicians rapidly and accurately diagnose and prognosticate acute appendicitis with a high sensitivity and specificity. Although several markers have been evaluated, the pressing concern is still the low specificity of these markers. One such marker is serum ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), which can be a novel biomarker for accurately diagnosing and prognosticating acute appendicitis. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases through February 2023 as per the PRISMA guidelines. The difference in the levels of IMA between patients with acute appendicitis vs. healthy controls, and the difference in the levels of IMA between patients with complicated vs. non-complicated acute appendicitis were taken as the outcome measures. Statistical analysis was performed using a random effects model and mean difference (MD) was calculated. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: A total of six prospective comparative studies were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis revealed that the mean level of serum IMA was significantly raised in the acute appendicitis group (MD 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.37, p = 0.01). Similarly, the mean serum IMA levels were also raised in the complicated appendicitis group compared to the non-complicated appendicitis group (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10, p = 0.02). Three of the studies included were, however, of poor methodological quality. Conclusions: Serum IMA is a viable potential marker for diagnosing and prognosticating acute appendicitis. However, due to the limited methodological quality of available studies, further prospectively designed and adequately powered studies are needed.

AB  - The anillin actin-binding protein (ANLN) is immensely overexpressed in cancers, including lung cancer (LC). Phytocompounds have gained interest due to their broader potential and reduced unwanted effects. Screening numerous compounds presents a challenge, but in silico molecular docking is pragmatic. The present study aims to identify the role of ANLN in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), along with identification and interaction analysis of anticancer and ANLN inhibitory phytocompounds followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Using a systematic approach, we found that ANLN is significantly overexpressed in LUAD and mutated with a frequency of 3.73%. It is linked with advanced stages, clinicopathological parameters, worsening of relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS), pinpointing its oncogenic and prognostic potential. High-throughput screening and molecular docking of phytocompounds revealed that kaempferol (flavonoid aglycone) interacts strongly with the active site of ANLN protein via hydrogen bonds, Vander Waals interactions, and acts as a potent inhibitor. Furthermore, we discovered that ANLN expression was found to be significantly higher (p) in LC cells compared to normal cells. This is a propitious and first study to demonstrate ANLN and kaempferol interactions, which might eventually lead to removal of rout from cell cycle regulation posed by ANLN overexpression and allow it to resume normal processes of proliferation. Overall, this approach suggested a plausible biomarker role of ANLN and the combination of molecular docking subsequently led to the identification of contemporary phytocompounds, bearing symbolic anticancer effects. The findings would be advantageous for pharmaceutics but require validation using in vitro and in vivo methods.

AB  - Background: Giant pituitary adenomas (GPA) pose a significant neurosurgical challenge. In this study, we present an experience of 60 consecutive patients with GPA operated by trans-sphenoidal surgery (microscopic/endoscopic).
   Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate preoperative factors predicting extent of resection (EOR) following transsphenoidal surgery for GPA.
   Materials and Methods: The study was a retrospective evaluation of 60 adult patients (>18 years) with GPA operated over a decade. The patients were analyzed for their clinical presentation, EOR, radiology, visual outcome, endocrinological outcome, and complications.
   Results: The mean age of the cohort was 41.5 +/- 13.3 years, mean tumor volume was 38.2 +/- 19.1 cm(3), and mean follow-up was 30.6 +/- 21.7 months. Improvement in vision was seen in forty patients (66.7%), while another 16 (26.7%) had stable vision as prior to surgery. Duration of visual symptoms was found to be statistically significantly associated with postoperative improvement of vision (P = 0.001). Twenty-four patients (40.0%) underwent subtotal resection (STR), while the remaining 36 patients (60.0%) underwent either gross total or near-total resection. Factors associated with STR were retrosellar (P = 0.04), subfrontal (P = 0.02), Knosp 3,4 cavernous sinus extension (P = 0.03), and MRI T2 hypointensity (P = 0.02). During follow-up, eight patients (13.3%) had radiological evidence of growth of residual tumor.
   Conclusions: Most cases of GPA can be adequately handled by trans-sphenoidal surgery. The presence of retrosellar, subfrontal, cavernous sinus extensions, and T2 hypointensity should alert the surgeon for likelihood of STR, postoperative residual tumor hemorrhage and need for second-stage endonasal or transcranial surgery. However, utilization of extended endoscopic route has allowed good debulking of tumors having subfrontal and parasellar extensions, which was not possible previously using traditional microscopic transsphenoidal surgery.

AB  - Objectives: The study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of parents/ caregivers toward epilepsy in paediatric patients at a tertiary care centre of North India.Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out among 418 parents or caregivers using convenience sampling technique with 16-item questionnaire in English language and also translated to local language that is Hindi. Children with epilepsy who visited the paediatric outpatient department within a year were included in the study (January 2021-22). A total of 450 children visited the clinic, 32 of whom were excluded for various reasons, and the final analysis was conducted among the 418 parents or caregivers who completed the questionnaire.Results: The male and female patients were 56.7% (n = 237) and 43.3% (n = 181) respectively. The age distribution of patients with less than 5 years, 6-10 years and more than 10 years were 35.6% (n = 149), 54.5% (n = 228), 9.8% (n = 41) respectively. Only one third of parents and caregivers did not consider epilepsy as psychiatric illness. Most of the parents and caregivers think that epilepsy affects school performance (77.2%) and hinders family life (71.0%). More than half of the parents or caregivers believes that the society discriminates against person with epilepsy and around 46.6% consider that alternative medicine can cure epilepsy. The parents or caregivers felt financial burden due to epilepsy was in 72.5% and approximately 78.5% perceived that their work is affected because of their child's epilepsy. Perception of epilepsy as a psychiatric illness was found to be significantly higher in parents with primary and secondary level education, when compared to parents who were graduates. The practice of the parents or caregivers towards administration of drugs to their child was good, however around 36.6% (n = 153) missed the dose of anti-seizure medications. Conclusion: The study highlights the substantial knowledge, attitude and practice gap amongst parents and caregivers for children with epilepsy which indirectly has huge impact on the

AB  - Background: Management of cleft lip and palate is interdisciplinary. An evidence-mapping approach was envisaged to highlight the existing gaps in this field, using only the highest level of evidence. Objectives: To conduct evidence mapping and quality analysis of systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to any aspect of cleft lip and palate. Search Methods: The cleft lip and palate field was divided into 9 domains and 50 subdomains and a method of categorization of systematic reviews was established. A comprehensive search strategy was carried out in seven databases along with the search of gray literature and references of included articles. Selection criteria: Systematic reviews related to any aspect of cleft lip and palate, conducted by a minimum of two reviewers, with a comprehensive search strategy and adequate quality analysis were included. Data collection and analysis: A self-designed, pre-piloted data-extraction sheet was used to collect information that was analyzed through an expert group discussion. Quality analysis was performed using ROBIS-I, AMSTAR 2, and the PRISMA checklist. Results: A total of 144 systematic reviews published between 2008 and 2022 were included. The largest number of these could be categorized in the therapeutic domain (n = 58). A total of 27% of the studies were categorized as inconclusive, 40% as partially conclusive, and 33% as conclusive. As per ROBIS-I, 77% of reviews had high risk of bias while 58% were graded as critically low in quality as per AMSTAR 2. The majority of systematic reviews showed low reporting errors. Conclusions: The majority of systematic reviews related to cleft lip and palate relate to therapeutic and prognostic domains and show high risk of bias and critically low quality regardless of the source journal. The results of this paper might serve as a starting point encouraging authors to carry out high-quality research where evidence is lacking. Registration: A multidisciplinary expert-group formulated an a priori protocol, registered in Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/NQDV2).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The head and face, due to their prominent positions, are at risk of intentional and unintentional injuries in the majority of competitive sports. There are regional preferences for sports and differences in infrastructural facilities. The majority of the recommendations for sports have been based on the studies conducted in the western world. Hence, this systematic review aimed to estimate the prevalence of sports-related orofacial and dental injuries in professional-sportspersons living in Asian countries.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A protocol was prepared as per the best practices of evidence-based medicine and registered (PROSPERO-CRD42021252488). Search strategy was based on the research question and conducted in six databases using text words and MeSH terms. Scrutiny of title and abstracts and later full-texts were done as per eligibility criteria. Data extraction was done using a pre-piloted sheet and the risk of bias (ROB) was assessed. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analyses were performed and the strength of evidence was assessed by using GRADE-approach.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-three studies published between 1998 to 2021 and from nine countries were included. The highest numbers were from Tfirkiye (N.=7). The total number of professional sportspersons assessed in all the included studies was 14,457. The highest preva-lence of orofacial and dental injuries observed was 66.18% and the highest prevalence of dental injuries was 39.81%. Low risk of bias was seen only in four studies. The changes were observed during the sensitivity analysis with all the meta-analyses showing significant publication bias and heterogeneity.CONCLUSIONS: The pooled prevalence of the combined orofacial and dental injuries was found to be 40.6%, while that of orofacial injury was 17.1% and dental injuries was 15.9%. There were 23 studies included in this review which covered 27 different sports from nine Asian countries. A high level of heterogeneity and the high ROB were observed in the majority of the studies. Further studies on the basis of the recommendations provided in the systematic review will improve the quality of evidence in this area in future.

AB  - Background & objectives: Impaired high density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk. The study was aimed to identify the alterations in HDL function [antioxidative activity (AOA)] and subfraction distribution between acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) individuals and analysing the accuracy of HDL parameters to discriminate between the groups.
   Methods: HDL subfraction distribution analysis was performed in 200 coronary artery disease patients (ACS and SCAD) and 60 control individuals using dextran sulphate, heparin and manganese chloride precipitation method. In terms of HDL function, AOA was evaluated by dihydrorhodamine-based fluorescent cell-free assay and paraoxonase (PON1) enzyme paraoxonase and arylesterase activity.
   Results: We found that higher AOA [odds ratio (95% confidence interval {CI})]: 0.09 (0.02-0.44), P<0.01 for SCAD; 0.008 (0.001-0.07), P<0.001 for ACS and higher PON1 activity [0.22 (0.8-0.59), P<0.01 for SCAD; 0.16 (0.06-0.4), P<0.001 for ACS] were associated with a lower odds of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). AOA of apoB-depleted serum was significantly correlated with HDL2-C/HDL3-C (HDL-cholesterol) ratio in controls (r=-0.31, P=0.01) and ACS (r=-0.18, P=0.04). It was observed that AOA and HDL subfraction distribution together could discriminate between the two groups of CAD with an accuracy of 72.8 per cent (P=0.004).
   Interpretation & conclusions: Impaired AOA and altered subfraction distribution of HDL may be responsible for its diminished anti-athero protective activity and can discriminate between the two groups of CAD individuals.

AB  - In this review article, a comprehensive meta-analysis based on available literature information has been undertaken to make a relative comparison of total arsenic in rice grain. This involves analyzing the findings of various peer-reviewed studies that examined arsenic-contaminated Asian regions. Also, this article highlights the regional-level human health risks caused by the consumption of arsenic-contaminated rice in the three regions of Asia. Deriving such information at the continental level is of major importance in view of the need for proper monitoring and alleviating serious and continually emerging human health issues in arsenic-contaminated areas. One aim of this paper is to highlight the potential of a viable modeling approach for appraising the danger posed by arsenic in soil-plant-human system. There is an urgent need to fix the safe limit of bioavailable arsenic in soil because total arsenic in soil is not a good index of the arsenic hazard. Our hypothesis is finding out whether the modeling approach can be used in establishing a safe limit of bioavailable arsenic in soils with reference to human health. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, we have selected reported rice grain arsenic content data from Asian countries following the PRISMA guidelines. Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk was calculated following the US EPA's guidelines. It emerged that adults in Asian countries are prone to a high risk of cancer due to their consumption of arsenic-contaminated rice. South Asia (SA), South East Asia (SEA), and East Asia (EA) exceeded the US EPA-prescribed safe limit for cancer risk with similar to 100 times higher probability of cancer due to rice consumption. The hazard quotient for the ingestion of arsenic containing rice was 4.526 +/- 5.118 for SA, 2.599 +/- 0.801 for SEA, and 2.954 +/- 2.088 for EA. These figures are all above the permissible limit of HQ of 1. The solubility free ion activity model can predict arsenic transfer from soil to rice grain based on easily measurable soil properties and be used to fix the safe limit of bioavailable arsenic in paddy soils. The methods and findings of this review are expected to be useful for regional-level policymaking and mobilizing resources to alleviate public health issues caused by arsenic.

AB  - Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most common glomerular disease in children. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of its treatment, and steroid response is the main prognostic factor. Most children respond to a cycle of oral steroids, and are defined as having steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Among the children who do not respond, defined as having steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, most respond to second-line immunosuppression, mainly with calcineurin inhibitors, and children in whom a response is not observed are described as multidrug resistant. The pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome remains elusive. In cases of immune-mediated origin, dysregulation of immune cells and production of circulating factors that damage the glomerular filtration barrier have been described. Conversely, up to a third of cases of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome have a monogenic origin. Multidrug resistant nephrotic syndrome often leads to kidney failure and can cause relapse after kidney transplant. Although steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome does not affect renal function, most children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome have a relapsing course that requires repeated steroid cycles with significant side-effects. To minimise morbidity, some patients require steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents, including levamisole, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, and cyclophosphamide. Close monitoring and preventive measures are warranted at onset and during relapse to prevent acute complications (eg, hypovolaemia, acute kidney injury, infections, and thrombosis), whereas long-term management requires minimising treatment-related side-effects. A subset of patients have active disease into adulthood.

AB  - Introduction: Quality indicators (QIs) are tools for improving and maintaining the standard of care. Although burn injuries are a major global health threat, requiring standardized management, there is a lack of worldwide accepted quality indicators for burn care. This study aims to identify the best burn care-specific QIs as perceived by worldwide burn practitioners.Methods: The ISBI Burn Care Committee developed a survey to analyze which burn care specific QIs were relevant to international burn care professionals. The questionnaire was based on the three dimensions of the Donabedian model (i.e., Structure, Process, and Outcome) to evaluate the quality of care. The study was conducted from April to September 2021 and analyzed and reported following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES). Results: According to the 124 worldwide respondents, the most relevant QIs were: access to intensive care, burn surgeons, and dedicated burn care nurses (Structure category), 24 hours access to burn services, local protocols based on documented guidelines (Process category), and in-hospital mortality and incidence of severe infections (Outcome category).Conclusions: Specific QIs related to structures, clinical processes, and outcomes are needed to monitor the treatment of burn patients globally, assess the efficiency of the provided treatment, and harmonize the worldwide standard of burn care.& COPY; 2022 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB  - Background Statins are widely acknowledged for their application in patients with hypercholesterolemia to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. More recently, their potential to exert pleiotropic effects, particularly in impeding the proliferation of neoplastic cells, has attracted considerable attention. Prior studies have demonstrated that statins may mitigate cancer progression and micrometastasis. However, the benefits of statins in breast cancer have been inconclusive.
   Objective The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the impact of statin use following a breast cancer diagnosis on breast cancer recurrence and mortality.
   Methods We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for relevant articles from inception until 30th May 2023. Hazard ratios (HR) were pooled using a random- effect model. The primary outcome of interest was the risk of breast cancer recurrence. The secondary outcomes included breast cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality.
   Results A total of 15 studies with 156 448 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients between statin users and non-users was 64.59 and 59.15 years, respectively. Statin use was associated with a reduction in the recurrence of breast cancer [HR 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67-0.87] compared with non-statin users. This trend was similar among lipophilic statin users (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.63-0.85) but not for hydrophilic statin users (HR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.82-1.68). Furthermore, statin users exhibited a lower risk of breast cancer mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.66-0.96) but all- cause mortality (HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-1.02) was comparable among both groups of patients. Conversely, lipophilic statins demonstrated a reduction in both all-cause mortality (HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.75-0.93) and breast cancer mortality (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.99) compared to non-st atin users.
   Conclusion Among patients with breast cancer, statin use post- diagnosis decreases the risk of breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer mortality. Furthermore, lipophilic statins exhibit an additional advantage of reduction in all-cause mortality.

AB  - Purpose In the context of radioiodine-resistant follicular-cell derived thyroid cancers (RAI-R-FCTC), [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT serves as a widely used and valuable diagnostic imaging method. However, there is growing interest in utilizing molecular imaging probes that target cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as an alternative approach. This study sought to compare the diagnostic capabilities of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi and [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT in patients with RAI-R-FCTC.
   Methods In this retrospective study, a total of 117 patients with RAI-R-FCTC were included. The study population consisted of 68 females and 49 males, with a mean age of 53.2 +/- 11.7 years. The aim of the study was to perform a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative assessment of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi and [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT scans in RAI-R-FCTC patients. The qualitative assessment involved comparing patient-based and lesion-based visual interpretations of both scans, while the quantitative assessment included analyzing standardized uptake values corrected for lean body mass (SULpeak and SULavg). The findings obtained from the scans were validated by correlating them with morphological findings from diagnostic computed tomography and/or histopathological examination.
   Results Among the 117 RAI-R-FCTC patients, 60 had unilateral local disease, and 9 had bilateral lesions with complete concordance in the detection rate on both PET scans. [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi had a higher detection rate for lymph nodes (95.4% vs 86.6%, p<0.0001), liver metastases (100% vs. 81.3%, p<0.0001), and brain metastases (100% vs. 39%, p<0.0001) compared to [F-18]F-FDG. The detection rates for pleural and bone metastases were similar between the two radiotracers. For lung metastases, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi showed a detection rate of 81.7%, whereas [18F]F-FDG had a detection rate of 64.6%. Remarkably, [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi was able to detect a bowel metastasis that was missed on [18F]F-FDG scan. The median standardized uptake values (SUL) were generally comparable between the two radiotracers, except for brain metastases (SULpeak [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi vs. [F-18]F-FDG: 13.9 vs. 6.7, p-0.0001) and muscle metastases (SULpeak [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi vs. [F-18]F-FDG: 9.56 vs. 5.62, p-0.0085), where [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi exhibited higher uptake.
   Conclusion The study results demonstrate the superior performance of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi compared to [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT in detecting lymph nodal, liver, bowel, and brain metastases in patients with RAI-R-FCTC. These findings highlight the potential of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi as a theranostic tool that can complement the benefits of [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT in the imaging of RAI-R-FCTC.

AB  - Introduction: The benefit of endovascular treatment in large anterior circulation ischaemic strokes with low ASPECTS score (<6) is uncertain. Recent randomised studies have demonstrated the benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) in large ischaemic strokes. The present meta-analysis aims to assess the combined effect of these studies on efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment in this group of patients.Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Databases MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, Tripdatabase were searched for randomised controlled trials with at least 50 participants from inception until February 16, 2023. The primary efficacy outcome analysed was the relative risk of functional independence defined as mRS - 0-2 at 90 days. Secondary efficacy outcomes included early neurological improvement, death due to any cause at 90 days and proportion of patients requiring decompressive hemicraniectomy. The primary safety outcome was the risk of developing symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH).Results: A total of three studies (RESCUE Japan-LIMIT, SELECT 2 and ANGEL ASPECTS) involving 1011 patients; 510 in the EVT arm and 501 in the medical management (MM) arm met the defined criteria (ASPECTS-3-5). The combined RR for the primary outcome of mRS 0-2 was 2.53 [1.84-3.47] (p = <0.0001) favouring EVT over MM. The primary safety outcome of sICH was not significant in the EVT arm with a combined RR of 1.84 [0.94-3.60] (p = 0.5157). Mortality rates were similar in both arms (26.67% in EVT arm vs 27.94% in MM arm) with a combined RR of 0.95 [0.78; 1.16] (p = 1.000).Conclusion: In patients with Large vessel occlusion (LVO) and low ASPECTS (3-5), EVT was associated with higher likelihood of achieving functional independence and early neurologic improvement but did not provide any mortality benefit.

AB  - Chronic pancreatitis is a chronic fibro-inflammatory disorder of the pancreas, resulting in recurrent abdominal pain, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition. It may lead to various other complications such as pseudocyst formation, benign biliary stricture, gastric outlet obstruction; and vascular complications like venous thrombosis, variceal and pseudoaneurysmal bleed. Development of varices is usually due to chronic venous thrombosis with collateral formation and variceal bleeding can easily be tackled by endoscopic therapy. Pseudoaneurysmal bleed can be catastrophic and requires radiological interventions including digital subtraction angiography followed by endovascular obliteration, or sometimes with a percutaneous or an endoscopic ultrasound-guided approach in technically difficult situations. Procedure-related bleed is usually venous and mostly managed conservatively. Procedure-related arterial bleed, however, may require radiological interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Re-operative thyroid surgery (RTS) is performed in patients of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with residual or recurrent disease. However, there is a paucity of literature discussing experience and technique of RTS. This study aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of RTS for DTC, utilizing experiences from a dedicated complex thyroid surgical oncology program at the apex hospital in a developing country.Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Department of Surgical Oncology's thyroid cancer database. The study period spanned from 2006 to 2022. Clinical presentation, prior surgical history, operative details of RTS, and post-operative outcomes were assessed. Descriptive analysis was performed.Results: During the study period, a total of 182 patients underwent re-operative thyroid surgery (RTS). The primary surgeries performed prior to RTS included near-total or total thyroidectomy in most cases (69.2%), and approximately half of the patients (48.4%) had prior neck node interventions. The RTS procedures consisted of completion total thyroidectomy in 30.8% of cases and surgery for thyroid bed recurrence in 9.9% of cases, while central node dissection was performed in 46.2% of patients and unilateral or bilateral template neck dissection was performed in 41.8% of cases. Extended resections were required in 9.3% of patients. Post-operative complications included permanent hypoparathyroidism (2.7%) and unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (1.6%).Conclusions: RTS is a complex procedure with high rates of post-operative morbidity reported in literature. Optimal outcomes require a multidisciplinary approach, thorough assessment, and skilled surgeons.

AB  - Background Extensive surgical dissection, hemodynamic alterations associated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS), and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) make pain management challenging. We hypothesized that infusions of intravenous lignocaine and fentanyl provide comparable analgesia to epidural ropivacaine and fentanyl in these patients.Methods Fifty patients scheduled to undergo CRS and HIPEC were enrolled in the study. The patients in group IV (Intravenous) received a bolus dose of 1.5 mg/kg lignocaine over 15 min, starting approximately 15 min before the surgical incision and fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg, about 2 min before the surgical incision, following which patient received lignocaine infusion at 1 mg/kg/hr and fentanyl infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/hr intraoperatively. Patients in group EPI (Epidural) received 6 mL of Ropivacaine 0.2% and fentanyl (2mcg/mL) approximately 15 min before surgical incision, followed by continuous infusion at the rate of 5 mL/hr. The procedure for induction and maintenance of anesthesia was standardized for both groups. In the postoperative period, the infusion of analgesics was reduced to half the intraoperative rates and continued for 24 h.Results Demographic profile and clinical parameters were comparable between both groups (p > 0.05). There was no difference between the number of fentanyl doses given in the IV group [Langenbecks Arch Chir 373(3):189-196, 4, IQR (2-11)] and the EPI group [Reg Anesth Pain Med 35(4):370-376, 12, IQR (5-21)] in the postoperative period (p = 0.229). The need for intraoperative rescue analgesia was comparable among the groups (p = 0.882).Conclusion The two techniques, epidural (ropivacaine and fentanyl) and IV (lignocaine and fentanyl) infusions, provide comparable analgesia in patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC.

AB  - Three dimensional (3D) scaffolds have huge limitations due to their low porosity, mechanical strength, and lack of direct cell-bioactive drug contact. Whereas bisphosphonate drug has the ability to stimulate osteogenesis in osteoblasts and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) which attracted its therapeutic use. However it is hard administration low bioavailability, and lack of site-specificity, limiting its usage. The proposed scaffold architecture allows cells to access the bioactive surface at their apex by interacting at the scaffold's interfacial layer. The interface of 3D polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds has been coated with alendronate-modified hydroxyapatite (MALD) enclosed in a chitosan matrix, to mimic the native environment and stupulate the through interaction of cells to bioactive layer. Where the mechanical strength will be provided by the skeleton of PCL. In the MALD composite's hydroxyapatite (HAP) component will govern alendronate (ALD) release behavior, and HAP presence will drive the increase in local calcium ion concentration increases hMSC proliferation and differentiation. In results, MALD show release of 86.28 +/- 0.22. XPS and SEM investigation of the scaffold structure, shows inspiring particle deposition with chitosan over the interface. All scaffolds enhanced cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteocyte differentiation for over a week without in vitro cell toxicity with 3.03 +/- 0.2 kPa mechanical strength.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous group of progenitor cells that play a multifunctional role including tissue regeneration, self-renewal properties, and differentiate into cells of mesodermal lineage such as adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. MSCs come into contact with tumor microenvironment (TME) and differentiate into tumor-associated MSCs (TA-MSCs). Various substances such as chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and others are released by tumor cells to recruit MSCs. TA-MSCs induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program which mediates tumor growth progression, migration, and invasion. Role of MSCs in the tumor progression, stemness, malignancy, and treatment resistance in the breast cancer TME. Immunomodulation by MSCs is mediated by a combination of cell contact-dependent mechanisms and soluble substances. Monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, and NK cells all show signs of MSCs' immunomodulatory capability. In a complicated interplay initiated by MSCs, anti-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role, as they unveil their full immunomodulatory potential. MSC- secreted cytokines are commonly blamed for the interaction between MSCs, monocytes, and Tregs. Here, we review the current knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in MSC-mediated immunomodulation and focus on the role MSCs play in breast cancer progression and its TME.

AB  - Biomass-derived luminescent nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets have many advantages over other emissive nanobiomaterials for various sensing and bioimaging applications. In this study, emissive nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (N-CNS) are prepared from biomass chitosan (CS) at different temperatures in a furnace at atmospheric air, and their photoluminescent (PL) properties have been evaluated. The luminescent N-CNS are prepared by a unique ecofriendly, cost-effective green approach without any harsh chemical treatments. The as-prepared N-CNS demonstrated intense visible PL emissions in the solid state with an excitation-dependent behavior: with 355 nm excitation, a bluish emission appears, and for 532 nm excitation, an orange-red emission was observed. N-CNS shows temperature-dependent PL emissions without change in the peak positions, depicting the possible application in optical thermometry. The sensitivity value of 1.22% K-1 is obtained from the variation of PL intensity with temperature, which is better than the reported carbon nanomaterial-based sensors. The luminescence properties of N-CNS in the water-dispersed state were also analyzed, where an excitation-dependent emission is apparent, which is suitable for various biomedical applications. The obtained results demonstrated that environment-friendly N-CNS could be employed for nanoscale temperature-sensing, bioimaging, and other therapeutic applications.

AB  - The atypical cadherin FAT1 function either as a pro or antitumorigenic in tumors of different tissue origins. Our group previously demonstrated the protumorigenic nature of FAT1 signaling in glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we investigated how FAT1 influences the expression of clustered oncomiRs (miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p) and their downstream effects in GBM. Through several experiments involving the measurement of specific gene/microRNA expression, gene knockdowns, protein and cellular assays, we have demonstrated a novel oncogenic signaling pathway mediated by FAT1 in glioma. These results have been verified using antimiRs and miR-mimic assays. Initially, in glioma-derived cell lines (U87MG and LN229), we observed FAT1 as a novel up-regulator of the transcription factor NF & kappa;B-RelA. RelA then promotes the expression of the clustered-oncomiRs, miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p, which in turn suppresses the expression of the tumor suppressor gene (TSG), PDCD10 (Programmed cell death protein10). The suppression of PDCD10, and other known TSG targets (PTEN/PUMA), by miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p, leads to increased clonogenicity, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. Consistent with our in-vitro findings, we observed a positive expression correlation of FAT1 and miR-221-3p, and an inverse correlation of FAT1 and the miR-targets (PDCD10/PTEN/PUMA), in GBM tissue-samples. These findings were also supported by publicly available GBM databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] and The Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data [Rembrandt]). Patients with tumors displaying high levels of FAT1 and miR-221-3p expression (50% and 65% respectively) experienced shorter overall survival. Similar results were observed in the TCGA-GBM database. Thus, our findings show a novel FAT1/RelA/miR-221/miR-222 oncogenic-effector pathway that downregulates the TSG, PDCD10, in GBM, which could be targeted therapeutically in a specific manner.

AB  - The presence of lung metastases in patients with primary malignancies is an important criterion for treatment management and prognostication. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is the preferred method to detect lung metastasis. However, CT has limited efficacy in differentiating metastatic nodules from benign nodules (e.g., granulomas due to tuberculosis) especially at early stages (<5 mm). There is also a significant subjectivity associated in making this distinction, leading to frequent CT follow-ups and additional radiation exposure along with financial and emotional burden to the patients and family. Even 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission technology-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) is not always confirmatory for this clinical problem. While pathological biopsy is the gold standard to demonstrate malignancy, invasive sampling of small lung nodules is often not clinically feasible. Currently, there is no non-invasive imaging technique that can reliably characterize lung metastases. The lung is one of the favored sites of metastasis in sarcomas. Hence, patients with sarcomas, especially from tuberculosis prevalent developing countries, can provide an ideal platform to develop a model to differentiate lung metastases from benign nodules. To overcome the lack of optimal specificity of CT scan in detecting pulmonary metastasis, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based protocol is proposed utilizing a combination of radiological and clinical biomarkers to identify lung nodules and characterize it as benign or metastasis. This protocol includes a retrospective cohort of nearly 2,000-2,250 sample nodules (from at least 450 patients) for training and testing and an ambispective cohort of nearly 500 nodules (from 100 patients; 50 patients each from the retrospective and prospective cohort) for validation. Ground-truth annotation of lung nodules will be performed using an in-house-built segmentation tool. Ground-truth labeling of lung nodules (metastatic/benign) will be performed based on histopathological results or baseline and/or follow-up radiological findings along with clinical outcome of the patient. Optimal methods for data handling and statistical analysis are included to develop a robust protocol for early detection and classification of pulmonary metastasis at baseline and at follow-up and identification of associated potential clinical and radiological markers.

AB  - Background: Magnetic compression anastomosis (MCA) is an alternative technique for patients with long-gap esophageal atresia (EA). It allows for preservation of the native esophagus. We aimed to systematically summarize the current literature on MCA in EA.Methods: Studies where neonates with EA were treated with MCA devices were included, while studies on esophageal stenosis were excluded. All clinical studies, including comparative studies, case series, and case reports, were eligible for inclusion. Methodological quality assessment was performed using a validated tool.Results: Twelve studies with a total of 42 patients were included in this review. There was a wide variation among these studies with regard to the time of initiation of MCA (1 day to 7 months), procedure time (13-320 minutes), and magnet characteristics (strength, size, and shape of the magnets used). The time to achieve anastomosis ranged from 1 to 12 days. Stricture at the anastomotic site was reported in almost all the patients, which required multiple endoscopic dilatations (median no. of dilatations/patient = 9.8). Stent placement for refractory stricture was required in 9 (21%) patients, and surgery for stricture was required in 6 (14%) patients. Long-term outcomes included esophageal dysmotility (n = 3) and recurrent pulmonary infections (n = 3) were reported in only four studies.Conclusion: As per the findings of this review, neonates with long-gap EA undergoing MCA would invariably require multiple sittings of endoscopic dilatations (median no. of dilatations/patient = 9.8). Also, there is a wide variation among the included studies in terms of the procedure of MCA. Future studies with a standardized procedure for achieving MCA are needed to determine additional outcomes in this fragile patient population.

AB  - The interplay between platelets and leukocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammation, thrombosis, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our recent studies described alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG), a Krebs cycle intermediate metabolite as an inhibitor to platelets and leukocytes activation by suppressing phosphorylated-Akt (pAkt) through augmentation of prolyl hydroxylase-2 (PHD2). Dietary supplementation with a pharmacological concentration of aKG significantly inhibited lung inflammation in mice with either SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposed to hypoxia treatment. We therefore investigated if aKG supplementation could suppress hyperactivation of these blood cells and reduce thromboinflammatory complications in T2D. Our study describes that dietary supplementation with aKG (8 mg/100 g body wt. daily) for 7 days significantly reduced the activation of platelets and leukocytes (neutrophils and monocytes), and accumulation of IL1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL6 in peripheral blood of T2D mice. aKG also reduced the infiltration of platelets and leukocytes, and accumulation of inflammatory cytokines in lungs by suppressing pAkt and pP65 signaling. In a cross-sectional investigation, our study also described the elevated platelet-leukocyte aggregates and pro-inflammatory cytokines in circulation of T2D patients. T2D platelets and leukocytes showed an increased aggregation and thrombus formation in vitro. Interestingly, a pre-incubation of T2D blood samples with octyl aKG significantly suppressed the activation of these blood cells and ameliorated aggregate/thrombus formation in vitro. Thus, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of aKG against inflammation, thrombosis, and CVDs in T2D.

AB  - Human disease-associated genetic variations often map to long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes; however, elucidation of their functional impact is challenging. We previously identified a new genetic variant rs4454083 (A/G) residing in exon of an uncharacterized lncRNA ARBAG that strongly associates with plasma levels of C-peptide, a hormone that regulates insulin bioavailability. On the opposite strand, rs4454083 also corresponds to an intron of a cerebellum-specific GABA receptor subunit gene GABRA6 that mediates strengthening of inhibitory synapses by insulin. Here, we show that alleles of rs4454083 modulate transcript levels of the antisense gene, ARBAG, which then controls the expression of the sense gene, GABRA6. Predisposing to low C-peptide, GG (a minor allele genotype across ethnicities) stabilizes ARBAG lncRNA causing higher transcript levels in cerebellum. ARBAG lncRNA abundance leads to cleavage of GABRA6 mRNA at the complementary region, resulting in a dysfunctional GABRA6 protein that would not be recruited for synapse strengthening. Together, our findings in human cerebellar cell-line and induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) demonstrate biological role of a novel lncRNA in determining the ratio of mRNA isoforms of a protein-coding gene and the ability of an embedded variant in modulating lncRNA stability leading to inter-individual differences in protein expression.

AB  - Primary healthcare caters to nearly 70% of the population in India and provides treatment for approximately 80-90% of common conditions. To achieve universal health coverage (UHC), the Indian healthcare system is gearing up by initiating several schemes such as National Health Protection Scheme, Ayushman Bharat, Nutrition Supplementation Schemes, and Inderdhanush Schemes. The healthcare delivery system is facing challenges such as irrational use of medicines, over- and under-diagnosis, high out-of-pocket expenditure, lack of targeted attention to preventive and promotive health services, and poor referral mechanisms. Healthcare providers are unable to keep pace with the volume of growing new scientific evidence and rising healthcare costs as the literature is not published at the same pace. In addition, there is a lack of common standard treatment guidelines, workflows, and reference manuals from the Government of India. Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with the National Health Authority, Govt. of India, and the WHO India country office has developed Standard Treatment Workflows (STWs) with the objective to be utilized at various levels of healthcare starting from primary to tertiary level care. A systematic approach was adopted to formulate the STWs. An advisory committee was constituted for planning and oversight of the process. Specialty experts' group for each specialty comprised of clinicians working at government and private medical colleges and hospitals. The expert groups prioritized the topics through extensive literature searches and meeting with different stakeholders. Then, the contents of each STW were finalized in the form of single-pager infographics. These STWs were further reviewed by an editorial committee before publication. Presently, 125 STWs pertaining to 23 specialties have been developed. It needs to be ensured that STWs are implemented effectively at all levels and ensure quality healthcare at an affordable cost as part of UHC.

AB  - Microbes evolve rapidly by modifying their genomes through mutations or through the horizontal acquisition of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) linked with fitness traits such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence, and metabolic functions. We conducted a multicentric study in India and collected different clinical samples for decoding the genome sequences of bacterial pathogens associated with sepsis, urinary tract infections, and respiratory infections to understand the functional potency asso-ciated with AMR and its dynamics. Genomic analysis identified several acquired AMR genes (ARGs) that have a pathogen-specific signature. We observed that blaCTX-M-15, blaCMY-42, blaNDM-5, and aadA(2) were prevalent in Escherichia coli, and blaTEM-1B, blaOXA-232, blaNDM-1, rmtB, and rmtCwere dominant in Klebsiella pneumoniae. In con-trast, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii harbored blaVEB, blaVIM-2, aph(3'), strA/B, blaOXA-23, aph(3 & PRIME;) variants, and amrA, respectively. Regardless of the type of ARG, the MGEs linked with ARGs were also pathogen-specific. The sequence type of these pathogens was identified as high -risk international clones, with only a few lineages being predominant and region-specific. Whole -cell proteome analysis of exten-sively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa strains revealed differential abundances of resistance-associated proteins in the presence and absence of different classes of antibiotics. The pathogen-specific resistance signatures and differential abundance of AMR -associated proteins identified in this study should add value to AMR diagnostics and the choice of appropriate drug combinations for successful antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - Most recommendations on cardiopulmonary resuscitation were developed from the perspective of high-resource settings with the aim of applying them in these settings. These so-called international guidelines are often not applicable in low-resource settings. Organisations including the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) have not sufficiently addressed this problem. We formed a collaborative group of experts from various settings including low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries, and conducted a prospective, multiphase consensus process to formulate this ILCOR Task Force statement. We highlight the discrepancy between current cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines and their applicability in low-resource settings. Successful existing initiatives such as the Helping Babies Breathe programme and the WHO Emergency Care Systems Framework are acknowledged. The concept of the chainmail of survival as an adaptive approach towards a framework of resuscitation, the potential enablers of and barriers to this framework, and gaps in the knowledge are discussed, focusing on lowresource settings. Action points are proposed, which might be expanded into future recommendations and suggestions, addressing a large diversity of addressees from caregivers to stakeholders. This statement serves as a stepping-stone to developing a truly global approach to guide resuscitation care and science, including in health-care systems worldwide.

AB  - Emerging evidence have shown the importance of gut microbiota in regulating brain functions. The diverse molecular mechanisms involved in cross-talk between gut and brain provide insight into importance of this communication in maintenance of brain homeostasis. It has also been observed that disturbed gut microbiota contributes to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and aging. Recently, gut microbiome-derived exosomes have also been reported to play an essential role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and could thereby act as a therapeutic target. Further, pharmacological interventions including antibiotics, prebiotics and probiotics can influence gut microbiome-mediated management of neurological diseases. However, extensive research is warranted to better comprehend this interconnection in maintenance of brain homeostasis and its implication in neurological diseases. Thus, the present review is aimed to provide a detailed understanding of gut-brain axis followed by possibilities to target the gut microbiome for improving neurological health.

TI  - No Doppler Single Position-Lateral Intercostal Artery Perforator Flap (NDSP-LICAP): a Safe and Versatile Flap for Breast Oncoplasty in Resource-Limited Setting
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
KW  - RECONSTRUCTION
KW  - TRIAL
AB  - IntroductionThe lateral intercostal artery perforator flap (LICAP) has emerged as one of the safest and less morbid flaps for lateral and central breast defects. We hereby describe a reproducible no Doppler single position (NDSP) technique to harvest it in single position without handheld Doppler, making it a versatile flap for lateral breast defects in resource-limited setting also.Materials and MethodsWith this technique, we performed a total of 22 LICAP turnover flaps over a period of 18 months from January 2020 to June 2021. In all 22 cases, the indication of flap was to fill the post-breast conservation surgery (BCS) defects in outer quadrant of breast. All LICAP flaps were harvested by surface marking of anatomical landmarks and without handheld Doppler.ResultsOut of 22 LICAP turnover flaps, thirteen were harvested for left breast and nine for right breast. The median width and length of the flap were 12.2 cm and 19.6 cm, respectively. The additional mean operative time was 41 min. All LICAP flaps survived well, and grade 1 Clavien-Dindo morbidity was documented in four cases. Mean hospital stay was 2.6 days. All patients received radiotherapy on their stipulated schedule. Early cosmetic outcome was good, and long-term outcomes are awaited.ConclusionNDSP-LICAP flap is a workhorse for lateral breast defects. Precise knowledge of perforators and anatomical landmarks can be used for harvesting these flaps, thus avoiding ultrasound Doppler and dedicated training for perforator localization. This technique has short learning curve without the need for any plastic surgery training. The early cosmetic outcomes are good.

AB  - Understanding the metabolic dysfunctions and underlying complex pathological mechanisms of neuro-degeneration in glaucoma could help discover disease pathways, identify novel biomarkers, and rationalize newer therapeutics. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the local metabolomic alterations in the aqueous humor and plasma of primary glaucomatous patients. This study cohort comprised primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), and cataract control groups. Aqueous humor and plasma samples were collected from patients undergoing trabeculectomy or cataract surgery and subjected to high -resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis. Spectral information was processed, and the acquired data were subjected to univariate as well as multi-variate statistical analyses using MetaboAnalyst ver5.0. To further understand the localized metabolic abnormalities in glaucoma, metabolites affected in aqueous humor were distinguished from metabolites altered in plasma in this study. Nine and twelve metabolites were found to be significantly altered (p < 0.05, variable importance of projection >1 and log(2) fold change =0.58/=-0.58) in the aqueous humor of PACG and POAG patients, respectively. The galactose and amino acid metabolic pathways were locally affected in the PACG and POAG groups, respectively. Based on the observation of the previous findings, gene expression profiles of trace amine-associated receptor-1 (TAAR-1) were studied in rat ocular tis-sues. The pharmacodynamics of TAAR-1 were explored in rabbits using topical administration of its agonist, 13-phenyl-ethylamine (13-PEA). TAAR-1 was expressed in the rat's iris-ciliary body, optic nerve, lens, and cornea. 13-PEA elicited a mydriatic response in rabbit eyes, without altering intraocular pressure. Targeted analysis of 13-PEA levels in the aqueous humor of POAG patients showed an insignificant elevation. This study provides new insights regarding alterations in both localized and systemic metabolites in primary glaucomatous patients. This study also demonstrated the propensity of 13-PEA to cause an adrenergic response through the TAAR-1 pathway.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the expression pattern of complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) CD46, CD59, and CD55 in HPV-positive (HPV+) & negative (HPV-) cervical cancer cell lines in search of a reliable differential biomarker.Study Design: We analysed the expression of CRPs in HPV 16-positive SiHa cell line, HPV 18-positive HeLa cell line, and HPV-negative cell line C33a using RT-qPCR, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy.Results: We observed a differential expression profile of CRPs in HPV+ and HPV- cervical cancer cell lines. The mRNA level of CD59 & CD55 showed a higher expression pattern in HPV+ cells when compared to HPV- cancer cells. However, flow cytometry-based experiments revealed that CD46 was preferentially expressed more in HPV 16-positive SiHa cells followed by HPV 18-positive HeLa cells when compared to HPV- C33a cells. Interestingly, confocal microscopy revealed a high level of CD59 expression in Hela cells and SiHa cells but low expression in HPV- C33a cells. In addition, HPV 18-positive HeLa cells expressed more CD55, which was lower in SiHa cells and very weak in C33a cells.Conclusion: The study demonstrates the differential expression of CRPs in both HPV+ and HPV- cervical cancer cells for the first time, and their potential to serve as an early diagnostic marker for cervical carcinogenesis.

AB  - Background Severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) is associated with high mortality. Numerous studies and meta-analysis have reported that corticosteroids reduce the 28-day mortality in SAH, but not the 6-month mortality. Therefore, newer treatments for SAH need to be studied. A pilot study from our group had recently treated ten patients with SAH with bovine colostrum (BC) [20 g thrice in a day for 8 weeks] and prednisolone. This therapy improved the biological functions and 3-month mortality. However, as more and more data showed the failure of corticosteroids to improve the 3- and 6-month mortality, especially in patients with high mDF and MELD scores, we planned this trial to study the safety and efficacy of BC (without corticosteroids) in the treatment of SAH.Method This is a multicenter, parallel, double-blind, randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled trial, which will enroll 174 patients with SAH from 5 academic centers in the India. Patients will receive freeze-dried BC or placebo by random 1:1 allocation for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure is survival at 3 months. The secondary outcome measures are survival at 1 month, change in mDF and MELD scores, change in endotoxin and cytokines (alpha TNF, IL6, and IL8) levels, number of episodes of sepsis [pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cellulitis, urinary tract infection (UTI)] from baseline to 4 weeks.Discussion This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of bovine colostrum in improving the survival of patients with SAH.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the antibiotic resistance and genetic profile of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella Typhi isolated from the blood culture of two paediatric cases of typhoid fever and one from the stool culture of their household contact, in North India.Methods: In this study, whole-genome sequencing was carried out with paired-end 2 x 150 bp reads on Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, USA) employing v2 and v3 chemistry. To check data quality, adapters and low-quality sequences were removed through Trimmomatic-v0.36. High quality reads were then assembled de novo using A5-miseq pipeline. For further refinement, reference-guided contig ordering and orienting were performed on the scaf-fold assemblies using ABACAS (http://abacas.sourceforge.net/). The assembled genome was annotated using Prokka v1.12 to identify and annotate the gene content. Plasmid replicons in bacterial isolates were identified by PlasmidFinder, whereas mobile genetic elements were predicted using Mobile Element Finder. Referenced-based SNP tree with maximum likelihood method was built with CSI phylogeny v1.4.Results: All three isolates exhibited resistance to ceftriaxone, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and co-trimoxazole, while demonstrating sensitivity to azithromycin and chloramphenicol. The whole-genome sequencing of these strains revealed the presence of blaCTX-M-15 gene for cephalosporin resistance in addition to gyrA, qnr and IncY plasmid replicon. A 5 kb IS91 Sbo1 gene cassette (IncY plasmid) was identified which carried extended spectrum & beta;-lactamase blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1D (resistance to ampicillin and cephalosporin), sul2, dfrA14 (resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and qnrS (resistant to ciprofloxacin). These isolates belong to H58 lineage and grouped as sequence type 1 (ST1) on multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis.Conclusion: In the present study we report the isolation of blaCTX-M-15 positive S. Typhi from two paediatric patients presenting with fever and one from stool culture of their contact from North India and highlight the need for further investigations to understand the different factors contributing to ceftriaxone resistance in Salmonella Typhi.

AB  - BackgroundIn India, around 77 million people are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Yoga interventions can be effective in preventing T2DM. We conducted a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) in India, and the intervention was the Yoga Programme for T2DM Prevention (YOGA-DP). This study aimed to identify and explore the facilitators and challenges in conducting the feasibility trial in India, and more specifically, to explore the perceptions and experiences of trial staff in relation to running the feasibility trial and Yoga instructors in relation to delivering the intervention.MethodsAn exploratory qualitative study was conducted at two trial sites in India (Yoga centers in New Delhi and Bengaluru). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten participants (six trial staff and four Yoga instructors) to explore their perceptions and experiences related to the study's aim. Data were analyzed using deductive as well as inductive logic and an interpretative phenomenological approach.ResultsFeasibility-trial-related facilitators were useful participant recruitment strategies and help and support received from the trial coordination center. Intervention-related facilitators were strengths of the intervention content, structure, and delivery (including materials) and competencies of Yoga instructors. Feasibility-trial-related challenges were lack of awareness about T2DM among potential participants, stigma and fear associated with T2DM among potential participants, difficulties in explaining the research and obtaining written informed consent from potential participants, expectations and demands of potential participants and control-group participants, gender and language issues in participant recruitment, other participant recruitment-related challenges, issues in participant follow-up, and issues in data collection and trial documentation. Intervention-related challenges were the limited interest of participants in Yoga, participants' time constraints on practicing Yoga, participants' health issues hindered Yoga practice, beginners' difficulties with practicing Yoga, participants' demotivation to practice Yoga at home, issues with the Yoga practice venue, confusion regarding the intervention structure, issues with intervention materials, and the incompetence of Yoga instructors.ConclusionsThe perceptions and experiences of trial staff and Yoga instructors helped us to understand the facilitators and challenges in running a feasibility trial and delivering the intervention for T2DM prevention, respectively. These findings and their suggestions will be used when designing the definitive RCT for evaluating YOGA-DP's effectiveness, and may be helpful to researchers planning similar trials.

AB  - To describe a concept of ideal 'puncture zone' as against any single ideal 'puncture tract' for percutaneous nephro-lithotomy (PCNL) and present our results. Through this narrative, we aim to reduce the gaps in inter-understanding of an erstwhile description of ideal tract and real-life puncture making. The puncture zone principle was applied for our novel puncture making technique during PCNL. The largest imaginary cone that can fit into a respective calyx, with its tip in the pelvis defines the 'puncture zone' for that calyx. This concept allows fine-tuning of the ideal puncture tract based upon the desired corresponding manipulation zone and also shifts the focus of puncture making to infundibulum anatomy from the tip of calyx. The surgical technique and retrospective review of 136 cases done between 2015 and 2021 using this concept are presented. Primary outcome included stone-free rate, pseudo-aneurysm and blood transfusion at 3 months of follow-up. 33 cases had multiple (> 3) stones, 21 only calyceal/infundibular stones, eight partial staghorn and 12 were complete staghorn stones. Mean stone size was 29 & PLUSMN; 15 (Range: 5-53) mm. Complete clearance was achieved in 127 cases, four of which required two tracts. Blood transfusion was required in one case. No pseudo-aneurysms were encountered. The puncture zone concept has provided good results in our hands. It may help easier understanding of PCN puncture making and provides a background for reconciliation between description of an ideal tract and practical puncturing techniques used by different surgeons.

AB  - Objective: To assess the timeliness and risk factors for the delay in the uptake of the hepatitis B birth dose among Indian children aged 0-59 months. Information regarding whether the children received the birth dose and the time of receiving it was recorded based on the vaccination card available at the time of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).Methods: Using data from the fourth and fifth round of India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS), the percentage of uptake and timely receipt of the hepatitis B birth dose were obtained by background characteristics and at the sub-national level (state). Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the risk factors. This study further performed a negative binomial regression estimation to predict the probability of receiving the birth dose at each day within a multivariable framework.Results: It was found that approximately 34 % of the children who received the birth dose and the timing of receiving the birth dose was made available through the vaccination card were administered the dose within 24 -hours during 2015-16. However, the percentage increased to 51.91 % during 2019-21. During 2019-21, Ladakh had the highest proportion (85.03 %) of children receiving the dose within 24-hours, followed by Jammu & Kashmir with 78 %, and Arunachal Pradesh with 68 %. Mother's education, economic status of the child's family and region (children belong from) were found to be significant predictors in delay of receiving the birth dose within 24 hours.Conclusion: Results indicated a need for targeted interventions to improve the coverage and timeliness in the uptake of this critical vaccine dose in the country. These interventions could include strategies such as strengthening the healthcare system, improving awareness among parents and healthcare providers, addressing logistical challenges in vaccine delivery, and promoting community engagement and education on importance of timely vaccination.

AB  - Atypical microbial keratitis refers to corneal infections caused by micro-organisms not commonly encountered in clinical practice. Unlike infections caused by common bacteria, cases of atypical microbial keratitis are often associated with worse clinical outcomes and visual prognosis. This is due to the challenges in the identification of causative organisms with standard diagnostic techniques, resulting in delays in the initiation of appropriate therapies. Furthermore, due to the comparatively lower incidence of atypical microbial keratitis, there is limited literature on effective management strategies for some of these difficult to manage corneal infections. This review highlights the current management and available evidence of atypical microbial keratitis, focusing on atypical mycobacteria keratitis, nocardia keratitis, achromobacter keratitis, and pythium keratitis. It will also describe the management of two uncommonly encountered conditions, infectious crystalline keratopathy and post-refractive infectious keratitis. This review can be used as a guide for clinicians managing patients with such challenging corneal infections.

AB  - Background: This project aimed to assess the impact of yoga on stress, metabolic parameters and cognition (at-tention & concentration) in adolescents, aged 13-15 years from public and private schools in two cities (Chennai and New Delhi) in India. Methods: The study recruited 2000 adolescents from 24 schools in a cluster randomized controlled trial design. The yoga group participants underwent 17 yoga sessions, which included: pranayama, basic asanas, meditation and relaxation exercises. Yoga sessions, were held in the school premises once a week. A total of five awareness talks on healthy lifestyle were delivered once a month to the education group. ADOlescence Stress Scale (ADOSS), salivary cortisol, metabolic and clinical parameters and Letter Cancellation Test (LCT) score were measured at baseline and post-intervention (5-6 months).Results: The yoga group showed statistically significant differences in the mean ADOSS score, metabolic param-eters, salivary cortisol, and LCT scores compared to the education group. In the intention- to-treat analysis, a significant reduction [5.11, 95% CI (4.78, 5.36), p = 0.001] in ADOSS score was seen in the yoga group compared to education.Conclusion: Implementation of a 17-week standardized yoga program at the school level significantly decreased stress, improved attention and concentration, metabolic and clinical parameters in Indian adolescents. Trial registration: Clinical Trials Registry, India (CTRI/2017/08/009203).

AB  - The management of the deep carious lesion with reversible pulpitis is a dilemma for the dentist. The current study compared selective removal of soft dentine (SRSD) to full pulpotomy for treating proximal deep carious lesions in teeth with reversible pulpitis. Visual-tactile examination and bitewing radiographs were used to determine the depth of carious lesion and American Association of Endodontist recommendations were used to formulate pulp diagnosis. Sixty mandibular molar teeth from healthy patients between the ages of 16-35 years and a diagnosis of proximal deep carious lesion with reversible pulpitis were included. Teeth were randomly allocated to two study groups. SRSD group (n = 30): soft dentine was preserved over the pulpal aspect. A hard setting calcium hydroxide cement liner and resin-modified glass ionomer cement base was applied over the remaining soft carious dentine. Full pulpotomy (FP) group (n = 30): complete caries removal followed by mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) full pulpotomy was performed. The teeth in both groups were restored with composite resin restoration. The established criteria for outcome assessment of SRSD and pulpotomy were used. Accordingly, only asymptomatic teeth with no radiological evidence of periapical rarefaction were considered successful at the 12-month follow-up. Two-sample t-test, Pearson chi-square test/Fisher exact test and percentage agreement were used for statistical evaluation. According to the per-protocol analysis, the success rate of both SRSD and full pulpotomy treatment was 95.45% and 95.65% respectively and the actual difference between the two treatments was 1% (95% CI (-10, 9)). The data suggests that both treatments (SRSD and FP) appear to have a good success rate (>95%) when used to manage permanent mandibular molar teeth with proximal deep carious lesion and reversible pulpitis. As SRSD is a non-invasive procedure, it should be favoured over FP in these instances.

AB  - Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are one of the most prevalent forms of healthcareassociated infections worldwide. Recurrent episodes of infections and development of antibiotic resistance/ tolerance among biofilm-forming bacteria are well documented. We developed a simple method of making superhydrophobic micro-structured antibacterial polymer surfaces for coating-free catheters. A two-step fabrication approach was used to turn the hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) into superhydrophobic surfaces. The nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser was used to fabricate two types of structures (holes and grooves) on a steel mold. The soft-molding technique was adopted to replicate these structures on PDMS films. The pillar structured PDMS surface exhibited a water droplet contact angle (WDCA) of 169. +/- 3. with a low sliding angle of 12., whereas the grooved surface had 142. +/- 5. contact angle. Moreover, the Luria Broth which is media for bacterial growth shows contact angle of 141. +/- 2. and 120. +/- 3., respectively. Theoretically, the micro-pillar structures with selected dimensions could sustain the Cassie-Baxter state. The crystal violet binding assay was used to assess the anti-biofilm activity of structured surfaces (grooved and pillared) against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), as well as clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumoniae), E. coli, and S. aureus. Furthermore, the attachment and interaction of bacteria with surfaces were investigated through filed emission scanning electronic microscope (FE-SEM) and confocal microscopy. Overall, the pillarstructured surface reduces the average bacterial attachment more efficiently than a grooved surface (>80% vs. >50% reduction) compared to a plain PDMS surface due to its higher water-repellent property. This work will give new insights into the development of coating-free, long-lasting antibacterial surfaces for polymeric medical devices.

AB  - The POLD4 gene encodes a subunit (d4) of DNA polymerase delta, which is a key enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. Recent studies have suggested that POLD4 plays a crucial role in developing certain cancers. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the role of POLD4 in the context of glioblastoma (GBM). Therefore, in this study we have used various cancer bioinformatics tools to explore the role of POLD4 in glioblastoma. Data from various sources were accessed to analyze POLD4 gene expression and estimate tumor-infiltrating immune cells in glioblastoma. Methylation data were retrieved using the MEXPRESS web browser and analyzed. UALCAN webserver was used to analyze the protein expression of POLD4. Gene correlation and pathway enrichment analysis were performed using cBioPortal and GSEA software, respectively. Afterward, survival analysis was performed. POLD4 was significantly upregulated in glioblastoma at both gene and protein levels in GBM, and ROC curve analysis revealed it as a potential biomarker in glioblastoma. GSEA analysis of TCGA-GBM pan-cancer study exhibited that POLD4 expression was associated with critical pathways, such as interferon-gamma response, G2M checkpoint, inflammatory response, E2F targets, EMT transition, and KRAS signaling pathways. Furthermore, POLD4 expression was positively correlated with DNA methylation at 3 CpG sites, including Cg16509978, with a Pearson correlation coefficient value of 0.398 (p-value & LE; 0.01), while the promoter region had a positive correlation but was not significant. In addition, POLD4 is significantly linked with poor OS, PFS, and DFS. We also found association of POLD4 expression with altered immune cell infiltration. In conclusion, POLD4 is significantly upregulated in glioblastoma and may be used as a potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for GBM patients. However, to establish the same a large cohort study is needed.

AB  - Many drugs were recommended as antiviral agents for infection control and effective therapy to reduce the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug, has been controversially recommended for prophylactic use in many countries, including India, to control SARS-CoV-2 infections. We have explored the effect of prophylactic HCQ from the cells of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome patients to determine the level of infection and ultrastructural alterations in the ciliated epithelium, type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and enucleated granulocytes. Ultrastructural investigation of ciliated epithelium and type II pneumocytes showed lesser infections and cellular impairment in the prophylactic HCQ(+) group than HCQ(-) group. However, macrophages and neutrophils displayed similar infection and ultrastructural alterations in both patient groups. The enucleated fragments of granulocytes showed phagocytosis of the matured virus in HCQ(+) groups. The present report unveils the ultrastructural proof to complement the paradox regarding the role of prophylactic HCQ in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Despite significant efforts and progress made in newborn care programs in India, implementation gaps persist across the continuum of care. The present case studies of two districts in Himachal Pradesh revealed that pathways of care were often fragmented with inconsistent linkages between facility and community due to poor documentation, lack of tiered referral, health system weaknesses, low utilization of primary level institutions, and inadequate post-natal home visits by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). Involvement of healthcare providers (HCPs) and frontline health workers (FHWs) was low and uneven in generating awareness across the districts with limited participation in supporting care in the community. Ensuring functionality of health centers and first-level care facilities; strengthening referral systems; adequate/trained human resources; strengthening routine health management systems, discharge processes and community-based care with adequate integration with facilities are necessary in closing access gaps.

AB  - T-helper 17 (Th17) cells are a subset of CD4(+) helper T cells that produce interleukin 17 (IL-17) and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Few studies have been conducted to determine the role of Th17 cells in the tumorigenesis and development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); however, its role is still unclear. In this study, the percentage of circulating Th17 cells and serum levels of IL-17A and IL-23 were analyzed using flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively, in 40 PDAC patients, 30 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and 30 healthy controls (HC). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of IL-17A, STAT3 and ROR & gamma;t in tissue samples were quantified by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the percentage of circulating Th17 cells and the concentrations of serum IL-17A and IL-23 were significantly increased in PDAC patients as compared to CP and HC (P < 0.001). In addition, the higher level of IL-17A was significantly correlated with the poor overall survival of the PDAC patients. Furthermore, the frequencies of Th17 cells and IL-17A were significantly higher in stage III+IV PDAC patients versus stage I+II. A significant increase in IL-17A, STAT3 and ROR & gamma;T mRNA was observed in patients with PDAC. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased circulating Th17 cells and serum IL-17A may be involved in the development and metastasis of PDAC, and thus represent potential targets for the treatment of PDAC.

AB  - Conventional cancer screening and diagnostic techniques are costly, time consuming, and available only in big city hospitals. Equipping these techniques in villages, local clinics, or small hospitals could significantly lower healthcare costs and patient's travel-time, making early cancer diagnosis and treatment accessible for masses. To accomplish this task, fast and dependable screening methods, such as multi-modal optical imaging and spectroscopic devices, are required. These techniques are non-contact, non-invasive/minimally invasive methods, have great potential for real time, and accurate diagnosis of cancer. Since these devices work in visible and near-visible range of electromagnetic spectra, it is also known as optical biopsy. This article provides a comprehensive overview of field-portable, multi-spectral and multi-modal devices such as auto-fluorescence imaging, fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy and micro-endoscopy-based point-ofcare tools. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize the screening, real-time diagnosis, treatment and prevention of oral and breast cancer, enabling faster and more effective healthcare interventions. More specifically, the review largely focuses on oral and breast cancer diagnosis with different optical techniques, using low-cost devices. Further, convergence of technologies along with artificial intelligence and machine learning software can be used to analyse data.

AB  - IntroductionExposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is an established causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic lung disease. Numerous studies have evaluated the role of tobacco in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality but missed the opportunity to assess the role of SHS. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether SHS is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection, severity, mortality, and other co-morbidities. MethodologyMulticentric case-control study was conducted across six states in India. Severe COVID-19 patients were chosen as our study cases, and mild and moderate COVID-19 as control were evaluated for exposure to SHS. The sample size was calculated using Epi-info version 7. A neighborhood-matching technique was utilized to address ecological variability and enhance comparability between cases and controls, considering age and sex as additional matching criteria. The binary logistic regression model was used to measure the association, and the results were presented using an adjusted odds ratio. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). ResultsA total of 672 cases of severe COVID-19 and 681 controls of mild and moderate COVID-19 were recruited in this study. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for SHS exposure at home was 3.03 (CI 95%: 2.29-4.02) compared to mild/moderate COVID-19, while SHS exposure at the workplace had odds of 2.19 (CI 95%: 1.43-3.35). Other factors significantly related to the severity of COVID-19 were a history of COVID-19 vaccination before illness, body mass index (BMI), and attached kitchen at home. DiscussionThe results of this study suggest that cumulative exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. More studies with the use of biomarkers and quantification of SHS exposure in the future are needed.

AB  - Automobile crashes and blunt trauma often lead to life-threatening thoracic injuries, especially to the lung tissues. These injuries can be simulated using finite element-based human body models that need dynamic material properties of lung tissue. The strain-rate-dependent material parameters of human parenchymal tissues were determined in this study using uniaxial quasi-static (1 mm/s) and dynamic (1.6, 3, and 5 m/s) compression tests. A bilinear material model was used to capture the nonlinear behavior of the lung tissue, which was implemented using a user-defined material in LS-DYNA. Inverse mapping using genetic algorithm-based optimization of all experimental data with the corresponding FE models yielded a set of strain-rate-dependent material parameters. The bilinear material parameters are obtained for the strain rates of 0.1, 100, 300, and 500 s(-1). The estimated elastic modulus increased from 43 to 153 kPa, while the toe strain reduced from 0.39 to 0.29 when the strain rate was increased from 0.1 to 500 s(-1). The optimized bilinear material properties of parenchymal tissue exhibit a piecewise linear relationship with the strain rate.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The severity grading tool (SGT) was recently designed by the Association for Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies (AABB) to have more objectivity in severity assignment for an adverse donor reaction after blood donation. A study was performed in India to assess the knowledge (post-training) and deter-mine the degree of agreement of the SGT between participating centres and the subject expert group.Materials and Methods: This prospective cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted by the National Coordinating Centre (NCC) of the National Blood Donor Vigilance Programme (NBDVP) of India. Thirty-five real-world case scenarios, validated by seven national and two international experts, were sent to the participating centres, and their responses received (diagnosis and severity grade) were compared and analysed.Results: A total of 50 blood centres participated in the study. The overall agreement between the participating centres and the expert group was 66.4%, with a fair Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) of 0.271 (p-value < 0.05). The degree of agreement was observed to be more than 80% for 12 centres, 60%-80% for 27 centres and <60% for 11 centres. The overall degree/percentage of agreement for cases with single and multiple types of donor adverse reaction was 71.3% and 42.6%, respectively. Conclusion: The SGT will be an efficient mode to have uniform objective reporting of the adverse donor reactions and may be implemented in the NBDVP of India. This study also highlights the need for training of the blood centres on the basic defini-tions and categorization of the donor's adverse reaction.

AB  - Background: Increased levels of occupational stress among health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic have been documented. Few studies have examined the effects of the pandemic on mental health professionals despite the heightened demand for their services.
   Method: A multilingual, longitudinal, global survey was conducted at 3 time points during the pandemic among members of the World Health Organization's Global Clinical Practice Network. A total of 786 Global Clinical Practice Network members from 86 countries responded to surveys assessing occupational distress, well-being, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.
   Results: On average, respondents' well-being deteriorated across time while their posttraumatic stress symptoms showed a modest improvement. Linear growth models indicated that being female, being younger, providing face-to-face health services to patients with COVID-19, having been a target of COVID-related violence, and living in a low- or middle-income country or a country with a higher COVID-19 death rate conveyed greater risk for poor well-being and higher level of stress symptoms over time. Growth mixed modeling identified trajectories of occupational well-being and stress symptoms. Most mental health professions demonstrated no impact to well-being; maintained moderate, nonclinical levels of stress symptoms; or showed improvements after an initial period of difficulty. However, some participant groups exhibited deteriorating well-being approaching the clinical threshold (25.8%) and persistently high and clinically significant levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (19.6%) over time.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that although most mental health professionals exhibited stable, positive well-being and low stress symptoms during the pandemic, a substantial minority of an already burdened global mental health workforce experienced persistently poor or deteriorating psychological status over the course of the pandemic.

AB  - In this study, we have performed green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Feather Protein Hydrolysate (FPH) formed by degradation of chicken feathers by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia KB13. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by techniques such as, UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) respectively. TEM and SEM-EDS confirmed the formation of silver nanoparticles. The size range was found to be 20-40 nm. FTIR analysis suggested the role of amino acids and proteins present in FPH during the synthesis process. XRD analysis of silver nanoparticles confirmed the formation metallic silver nanoparticles with the average size of 29.957 nm. The antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles was also studied on clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria. These nanoparticles exhibited excellent anti-microbial properties. The antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles was employed for the rescue of silk cloth from microbial deterioration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The middle fossa approach is an effective option for the treatment of small (Koos grade I and II) vestibular schwannomas (VSs) when the goal is hearing preservation. The authors evaluated the rates of hearing preservation and examined the factors associated with improved hearing outcomes after the middle fossa approach for VSs. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center cohort study evaluating the clinical outcomes after resection of small VSs using the middle fossa approach, consecutive adult patients (> 18 years) who underwent surgery between January 2000 and December 2021 were included. Clinical and imaging characteristics were analyzed, including baseline hearing status, duration of surgery, anesthetic parameters, and imaging characteristics of the surgically treated tumors. RESULTS Among the 131 included patients, 102 had valid and discoverable pre-and postoperative audiology assessments. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 1-180 months). There were 85 patients with serviceable hearing preoperatively, defined as American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) class A or B, of whom 78% retained class A or B hearing at the last follow-up. Binary logistic regression demonstrated that preoperative hearing AAO-HNS class (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.77; p = 0.02), overlap between fundus and cochlea (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.96; p = 0.04), and duration of anesthesia (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of hearing outcomes. Additionally, 75% of patients with high diffusion-weighted imaging signal in the tumor (p = 0.009) and 67% of patients with the tumor originating at the modiolus of the cochlea (p = 0.004) had poor hearing outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The hearing preservation rates after microsurgical resection of small VSs using the middle fossa approach are high, with 78% of patients maintaining AAO-HNS class A or B hearing. Poor hearing status at baseline, longer duration of anesthesia, and large overlap between the fundus of the internal auditory canal and the cochlea were independently associated with unfavorable hearing outcomes. Imaging characteristics can be used to stratify patients' risk of hearing loss.

AB  - IntroductionA DnCNN for image denoising trained with natural images is available in MATLAB. For Tc-99m DMSA images, any loss of clinical details during the denoising process will have serious consequences since denoised image is to be used for diagnosis. The objective of the study was to find whether this pre-trained DnCNN can be used for denoising Tc-99m DMSA images and compare its performance with block matching 3D (BM3D) filter. Materials and methodsTwo hundred forty-two Tc-99m DMSA images were denoised using BM3D filter (at sigma = 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25) and DnCNN. The original and denoised images were reviewed by two nuclear medicine physicians and also assessed objectively using the image quality metrics: SSIM, FSIM, MultiSSIM, PIQE, Blur, GCF, and Brightness. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to find the statistically significant difference between the value of image quality metrics of the denoised images and the corresponding original images. ResultsNuclear medicine physicians observed no loss of clinical information in DnCNN denoised image and superior image quality compared to its original and BM3D denoised images. Edges/boundaries of the scar were found to be well preserved, and doubtful scar became obvious in the denoised image. Objective assessment also showed that the quality of DnCNN denoised images was significantly better than that of original images at P-value ConclusionThe pre-trained DnCNN available with MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox can be used for denoising Tc-99m DMSA images, and the performance of DnCNN was found to be superior in comparison with BM3D filter.

AB  - Type-II-pneumocytes from the bronchoalveolar fluids of aplastic anemia (AA) patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were imaged to assess the ultrastructural alteration, especially in the number and size of the lamellar bodies. The mild (non-ARDS), and severe ARDS without comorbidities were used as reference for comparative ultrastructural analysis. The electron microscopic imaging of mild non-ARDS patients showed normal ultrastructure with surfactant-containing lamellar bodies of size range 0.5-1.00 & mu;M with an area ranging from 0.3-0.8 & mu;M2. The ARDS patients with diabetes and without any comorbidities showed larger lamellar bodies of the size range 0.8-1.4 & mu;M with an area range from 0.5-1.50 & mu;M2. However, AA patients revealed normal and giant lamellar bodies. These giant lamellar bodies showed a size range of 2.0-4.0 & mu;M with an area ranging from 3.0-5.0 & mu;M2 with a lesser number/cell. This study reports the abnormal ultrastructural alteration of type II pneumocytes in AA patients with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: These clinical standards aim to provide guidance for diagnosis, treatment, and management of drug-susceptible TB in children and adolescents.METHODS: Fifty-two global experts in paediatric TB participated in a Delphi consensus process. After eight rounds of revisions, 51/52 (98%) participants endorsed the final document.RESULTS: Eight standards were identified: Standard 1, Age and developmental stage are critical considerations in the assessment and management of TB; Standard 2, Children and adolescents with symptoms and signs of TB disease should undergo prompt evaluation, and diagnosis and treatment initiation should not depend on microbiological confirmation; Standard 3, Treatment initiation is particularly urgent in children and adolescents with presumptive TB meningitis and disseminated (miliary) TB; Standard 4, Children and adolescents should be treated with an appropriate weight-based regimen; Standard 5, Treating TB infection (TBI) is important to prevent disease; Standard 6, Children and adolescents should receive home-based/community-based treatment support whenever possible; Standard 7, Chil-dren, adolescents, and their families should be provided age-appropriate support to optimise engagement in care and clinical outcomes; and Standard 8, Case reporting and contact tracing should be conducted for each child and adolescent. CONCLUSION: These consensus-based clinical standards, which should be adapted to local contexts, will improve the care of children and adolescents affected by TB.

AB  - Background: Prosthesis-related infections (PRIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs) remain one of the most devastating complications among patients undergoing clean orthopedic surgeries. Prevention strategies are critical to reduce infection rates in orthopedic surgeries. The current study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a set of evidence-based practices (bundled intervention) in reducing the incidence of PRIs and SSIs among patients undergoing clean orthopedic surgeries with hardware implants.Patients and Methods: A prospective, interventional randomized controlled trial was conducted for a period of three years. A total of 597 patients were enrolled, and depending on their Staphylococcus aureus carrier status were categorized into carrier group (n = 98) and non-carrier group (n = 499). Only carrier group patients were analyzed for effectiveness of bundled interventions, after being randomly assigned to two subgroups: interventional carrier group (ICG; n = 50) and non-interventional carrier group (NICG; n = 48).Results: Of the 597 patients, 98 (16.4%) were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, among whom 9 (19.4%) had methicillin resistance. During follow-up, overall infection rate of 1.1% was observed (PRI, 0.3%; SSI, 0.8%). There was no case of PRI/SSI in the ICG. However, in the NICG, one patient developed SSI because of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. An endogenous source of infection was demonstrated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The SSI rate was higher in the NICG (p = 0.002). In the non-carrier group (n = 499), SSIs/PRIs occurred among 1.2% of the patients, because of organisms other than Staphylococcus aureus.Conclusions: Benefit of bundle intervention approach could be demonstrated. Further studies assessing the effectiveness of the individual components of the bundle can inform clinical practice greatly.

AB  - History A 10-year-old North Indian boy presented with swelling of multiple joints in his hands for the past 3 years. This swelling involved the small joints of his hands and some restriction of joint movement, without any associated tenderness or morning stiffness. No other joints were symptomatically involved. Prior to visiting our hospital, he had received disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs for suspected juvenile idiopathic arthritis, without any clinical benefit. On examination, the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints were non -tender but had swelling and flexion deformities. He also had a short stature (below the third centile) for his age. Inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (7 mm per hour; normal range, 0-22 mm per hour) and C-reactive protein level (1.5 mg/L; normal level, <10 mg/L), were normal, and the rheumatoid factor test result was negative. A skeletal survey of the patient was performed.

AB  - Cholesteatoma remains a mystery and the factors triggering and propagating it unknown. This study was aimed to evaluate the role of Psoriasin and pro-inflammatory cytokines in progression of middle ear cholesteatoma. In this study 18 patients (12 cases of cholesteatoma and six cases of posterosuperior retraction pocket (PSRP) without cholesteatoma) were included in the study. Clinical aggressiveness was evaluated on-table under operative microscope by evaluating erosion of ossicles, invasion of surrounding structures. The classification of disease was also based on the radiological (CT-scan) findings. Based on clinical aggressiveness, the cholesteatoma cases were divided into mild, moderate, and severe. The tissues were processed for histopathological, ultra structural and immunohistochemical analysis. The Psoriasin expression in cholesteatoma tissues was significantly higher (P< 0.05) compared to the PSRP tissue and increased with the increasing severity of the disease. The pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1 & beta;) were also upregulated along with vascular endothelial growth factor and Matrix metalloproteinase-13 in cholesteatoma cases compared to control. Transmission Electron Microscopic images of ultra-thin sections of the tissues showed numerous secretory vesicles, most likely containing cytokines and a unique ultrastructural feature of bacterial localization within the membrane pocket was seen, which gave direct evidence of bacterial infection in the middle ear cholesteatoma.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are lung complications diagnosed by impaired gaseous exchanges leading to mortality. From the diverse etiologies, sepsis is a prominent contributor to ALI/ARDS. In the present study, we retrieved sepsis-induced ARDS mRNA expression profile and identified 883 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Next, we established an ARDS-specific weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN) and picked the blue module as our hub module based on highly correlated network properties. Later we subjected all hub module DEGs to form an ARDS-specific 3-node feed-forward loop (FFL) whose highest-order subnetwork motif revealed one TF (STAT6), one miRNA (miR-34a-5p), and one mRNA (TLR6). Thereafter, we screened a natural product library and identified three lead molecules that showed promising binding affinity against TLR6. We then performed molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the stability and binding free energy of the TLR6-lead molecule complexes. Our results suggest these lead molecules may be potential therapeutic candidates for treating sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS. In-silico studies on clinical datasets for sepsis-induced ARDS indicate a possible positive interaction between miR-34a and TLR6 and an antagonizing effect on STAT6 to promote inflammation. Also, the translational study on septic mice lungs by IHC staining reveals a hike in the expression of TLR6. We report here that miR-34a actively augments the effect of sepsis on lung epithelial cell apoptosis. This study suggests that miR-34a promotes TLR6 to heighten inflammation in sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS.

AB  - Somatic Symptom disorders (SSDs) are characterised by the presence of persistent somatic symptoms associated with excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviours related to the symptoms. However, current treatment modalities are non-specific with modest effects. We aim to explore the safety and outcome of high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation at medial Prefrontal Cortex in ten such patients. Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale were applied to ten patients with Somatic Symptom Disorder. 15 sessions of 15Hz TMS using a double cone coil with 2500 pulses/session were administered. All patients completed their sessions except one. Eight of the nine patients reported significant improvement with a reduction of 33%-80% from their baseline PHQ-15 scores. One patient reported significant adverse effects. Double cone coil TMS at medial Prefrontal Cortex appears to be a safe therapeutic intervention with potentially good outcomes in SSDs.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE This is the first human study that confirmed penetration of 0.01% topical atropine in aqueous and vitreous humor in live human eyes. This supports the possible mode of action of atropine via posterior ocular structures. This knowledge will help improve the outcomes in myopia management.PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate penetration of low-dose atropine 0.01% in aqueous and vitreous humor.METHODS In this cross-sectional interventional pilot study, 48 cataract cases were divided into four groups (12 each), and 30 epiretinal membrane/macular hole cases were divided into three groups (10 each). One drop of 0.01% atropine was put in the eye to be operated. Aqueous humor samples were taken from patients undergoing cataract surgery at 60 +/- 15 minutes in group 1, 120 +/- 15 minutes in group 2, 240 +/- 15 minutes in group 3, and 360 +/- 15 minutes in group 4. Vitreous humor samples were taken from patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery for epiretinal membrane/macular hole at 120 +/- 15 minutes in group 1, 240 +/- 15 minutes in group 2, and 360 +/- 15 minutes in group 3. The assay of atropine was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.RESULTS Median concentrations of atropine in aqueous samples were 1.33 ng/mL (min-max, 0.6 to 6.46 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 3.05 ng/mL) at 60 minutes, 2.60 ng/mL (min-max, 0.63 to 4.62 ng/mL; IQR, 1.97 ng/mL) at 120 minutes, 1.615 ng/mL (min-max, 0.1 to 3.74 ng/mL; IQR, 1.62 ng/mL) at 240 minutes, and 1.46 ng/mL (min-max, 0.47 to 2.80 ng/mL; IQR, 1.73 ng/mL) at 360 minutes, and those in vitreous samples were 0.102 ng/mL (min-max, 0 to 0.369 ng/mL; IQR, 0.366 ng/mL) at 120 minutes, 0.1715 ng/mL (min-max, 0 to 0.795 ng/mL; IQR, 0.271 ng/mL) at 240 minutes, and 0.2495 ng/mL (min-max, 0 to 0.569 ng/mL; IQR, 0.402 ng/mL) at 360 minutes, respectively.CONCLUSIONS Measurable concentration of low-dose topical atropine (0.01%) was noted in aqueous and vitreous humor after instillation of a single drop of low-dose atropine. Muscarinic receptors located in the posterior segment such as the choroid and retina could be the possible site of action of low-dose atropine in myopia.

AB  - Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease, which progresses from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Early detection and laboratory-based screening of hepatocellular carcinoma are still major challenges. This study was undertaken to determine whether the cancer hallmark gene signatures that are released into circulation as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be used as a liquid biopsy marker for screening, early detection, and prognosis of HCC.Methods: A total of 130 subjects, including HBV-HCC (n = 80), HBV-cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic (n = 35), and healthy (n = 15) controls, were evaluated for TP53 and beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene hotspot mutations in ctDNA by Sanger-based cycle sequencing and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays. Mutation detection frequency, percentage mutant fractions, and their association with tumour stage, mortality, and smoking habits were determined.Results: Sanger-based cycle sequencing was carried out for 32 HCC patients. Predict SNP Tools analysis indicated several pathogenic driver mutations in the ctDNA sequence, which include p.D228N, p.C229R, p.H233R, p.Y234D, p.S240T, p.G245S, and p.R249M for TP53 gene exon 7 and p.S33T for CTNNB1 gene exon 3. The TP53 c.746G>T (p.R249M) mutation was detected predominately (25% cases) by sequencing, but there was no dominant mutation at position c.747G>T (p.R249S) that was reported for HBV-HCC patients. A dual-probe ddPCR assay was developed to determine mutant and wild-type copy numbers of TP53 (p.R249M and p.R249S) and CTNNB1 (p.S45P) and their percentage mutant fraction in all 130 subjects. The TP53 R249M and CTNNB1 S45P mutations were detected in 31.25% and 26.25% of HCC patients, respectively, with a high mutant-to-wild-type fraction percentage (1.81% and 1.73%), which is significant as compared to cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Poor survival was observed in HCC patients with combined TP53 and CTNNB1 gene driver mutations. The TP53 R249M mutation was also significantly (p < 0.0001) associated with smoking habits (OR, 11.77; 95% CI, 3.219-36.20), but not the same for the TP53 R249S mutation.Conclusion: Screening of ctDNA TP53 and CTNNB1 gene mutations by ddPCR may be helpful for early detection and identifying the risk of HCC progression.

AB  - Problem: HLA-G polymorphisms have a functional impact on its expression and may cause a breakdown of maternal tolerance towards the semi-allogenic fetus, resulting in recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA). This study reports on the association of HLA-G regulatory region polymorphisms with idiopathic RSA. Methods: Seventy-five couples with =2 spontaneous abortions were recruited in comparison to 75 healthy couples who had normal pregnancies. About 5 mL of blood samples were collected from all the participants, and DNA was extracted. Screening of HLA-G 5'-upstream regulatory region (5'-URR) was done by direct sequencing in 50 each of RSA and healthy couples, respectively. The 14 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) was genotyped in 75 each of RSA and healthy couples, respectively, by PCR amplification of HLA-G exon 8. MedCalc, Graph Pad Prism, Haploview, PLINK, and multifactor dimensionality reduction were used to analyze the data. Results: HLA-G screening revealed the presence of-762C/T,-725C/G,-716T/G, -689A/G, -486C/A, and-477C/G single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5'-URR. At positions -762 and -477, the frequency of CC homozygotes was significantly higher in controls compared to the patients. The 14 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism in the 3'-UTR showed an association with RSA with the heterozygous genotype being significantly higher in RSA compared to controls.Conclusions: The study indicates a protective role of the CC genotypes of the two HLA-G 5'-URR polymorphisms,-762C/T and-477C/G, against RSA. It also suggests that women with the 14 bp deletion/insertion genotype have a significantly higher risk of RSA.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the topographic distribution of neovascularization ( NV) and capillary nonperfusion (CNP) using ultra-wide field fluorescein angiography (UWFFA) in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Methods: This was a prospective, single-center, observational study in which all patients who presented between March 2019 and December 2020 and satisfied the inclusion criteria were recruited. In our study, patients with treatment-naive PDR without any fibrovascular proliferation underwent UWFFA. The images were analyzed qualitatively for the topographic distribution of NV and the CNP area was quantified. The number of lesions picked by UWFFA was compared with 7 standard field (7SF) image using overlay of 7SF. The main outcome measure was characteristics of neovascularization, such as the number, location, and area of CNP, measured using UWFFA, which was considered with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Two hundred and fifty-three eyes of 187 patients with a mean age of 56.03 +/- 8 years were included. Mean neovascularization elsewhere (NVE) was 2.91 +/- 3.43. Maximum NVEs were seen in the superotemporal (ST; 0.9 +/- 1.13) quadrant, followed by the inferotemporal (IT; 0.7 +/- 1.08), inferonasal (IN; 0.66 +/- 1.02) and superonasal (SN; 0.66 +/- 1.01) quadrants. Maximum CNP area was seen in the SN (13.75 +/- 8.83 disc diameter square [DD2]) quadrant, followed by the IN (13.48 +/- 8.59 DD2), IT (11.34 +/- 8.37 DD2), and ST (11.3 +/- 8.34 DD2) quadrants. Mean CNP area was maximum in patients with only neovascularization of disc (NVD; 64.99 +/- 41.47 DD2), followed by both NVD and NVE (61.37 +/- 35.61 DD2), and was minimum in patients with only NVE (36.44 +/- 22.03 DD2). Eighty-one (32%) eyes out of 253 had NVE and 189 (75%) out of 253 had CNP area outside 7SF (overlay) of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). Conclusion: Diabetic NV lesions and CNP areas are distributed asymmetrically throughout the retina and are not restricted to the posterior pole. Compared to conventional 7SF imaging, UWFFA reveals significantly more retinal vascular pathology in patients with PDR.

AB  - Purpose: To discuss the novel swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-ASOCT)-guided surgical approach in slipped medial rectus muscles. Methods: Prospectively (between February 2020 and July 2022), six patients with a clinical suspicion of slipped medial rectus muscle were recruited. After complete ophthalmic and orthoptic evaluation, the missing medial rectus muscle is screened using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (ASOCT). In presence of a traceable muscle, its morphology, depth, and distance from a fixed anatomical landmarks were noted; in its absence, the status of other recti was noted. Intraoperatively, the features were confirmed and the intended intervention was performed. Results: The mean age of six patients was 25.66 +/- 9.72 years, two with surgical trauma and four with penetrating trauma (66.66%). In five patients, the ASOCT traced the slipped medial rectus muscle successfully (83.33%); intraoperatively, the same was confirmed (within 1-2 millimeters) with favorable outcomes. ASOCT made a significant contribution in all subjects by reducing the number of interventions and muscle surgeries. Conclusions: In eyes with slipped medial rectus muscle, especially those which are within a finite distance from the angle can be traced using ASOCT. This approach impacts the outcomes in many ways.

AB  - Background and Aims:Despite a large body of research linking caregiver burden and social support in substance dependence, positive aspects of caregiving in these disorders have received very minimal attention. This exploratory observational study aimed to assess the positive aspects of caregiving for opioid dependence and evaluate the association of these positive aspects with caregiver quality of life, burden, and social support. Methods:This cross-sectional study included 199 caregivers of patients with opioid dependence recruited through purposive sampling. Participants were assessed using the Scale for Positive Aspects of Caregiving Experience (SPACE), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF version, Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS), and Social Support Questionnaire. Results:Of the 199 caregivers recruited, a majority of the caregivers were middle-aged women. About two-thirds of the patients were currently using opioids (n = 135, 67.8%), while the remaining were abstinent. Among the SPACE domain scores, the mean was highest for motivation for the caregiving role (2.07), which was followed by self-esteem and social aspect of caring (2.04), caregiving personal gains (1.76), and caregiver satisfaction (1.65). Caregivers of patients currently abstinent experienced greater positive aspects of caregiving (SPACE mean item score 2.57 versus 1.62, P < 0.001), and lesser burden (FBIS mean score 13.4 versus 29.3, P < 0.001). Conclusion:Positive aspects of caregiving can be potentially utilized for better caregiver engagement in treatment and improved caregiver outcomes.

AB  - Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disorder and has been proposed to have an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. Methods: This study was conducted on 41 participants {18 COPD patients (smokers, COPD S (n = 9); reformed smokers, COPD RS (n = 9)) and 23 controls (non-smokers, CNS (n = 14); smokers, CS (n = 9))}. Flow cytometry was used to identify circulatory immune cells and correlated with serum cytokines. Results: On comparison, significantly lower frequency of CD3+ T cells were observed in COPD S as compared to CNS (p < 0.01) and CS (p < 0.01); CD4+ T cells were lower in COPD S (p < 0.05), COPD RS (p < 0.05) and CNS (p < 0.01) as compared to CS. CD8+ T cells were elevated in COPD S as compared to CS (p < 0.05). Lower frequency of cDCs were observed in COPD S as compared to CS (p < 0.05) and COPD RS as compared to CNS (p < 0.01) and CS (p < 0.01). Lower frequency of pDCs were observed in COPD RS as compared to COPD S (p < 0.05), CNS (p < 0.05) and CS (p < 0.01). Lower frequency of Tregs was observed in COPD S as compared to CNS (p < 0.05) and CS (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Characteristic changes observed indicate a significant impact of immune cells in the progression of the disease.

AB  - PurposeHypercoagulable state is a complication of various infections, and inflammatory processes and is a common scenario in cancer patients also. Timely diagnosis and treatment are essential to reduce further complications in such patients. The present study aimed to assess the role of FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of benign vs. malignant tumor thrombus and to determine cut-off SUVmax to differentiate them. Patients and methodsWe retrospectively reviewed all FDG PET/CT scans of patients done in our department from January 2017 to March 2022. All scans were reviewed by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. A total of 135 patients who had venous or arterial thrombus in FDG PET/CT scans were included. All the FDG PET/CT scans of 135 patients were analyzed for primary tumor site and/or site of thrombus. Additional clinical data were collected for patients with benign conditions in the form of ESR and CRP if available and doubtful cases were followed up by HPE reports and/or CEMRI. The SUV max of the primary tumor(in cancer patients), thrombus, and background (aorta) were calculated. ResultsA total of 135 patients (108 cancer patients and 27 with benign thrombus) were included with an age range of 3 to 86 years (median 50 years). There were 91 males and 44 females. Of 108 cancer patients, the most common cancers were hepatocellular cancer - 38 (35.18%), renal cell cancer - 28(25.92%), and carcinoma of the thyroid - 6 (5.55%). Of 108 cancer patients, 36 (33.33%) had tumor thrombosis in inferior vena cava, 31 (28.70%) in the portal vein, and 41 (37.96%) in other vessels (renal vein, jugular vein, etc.). Of 27 patients with benign conditions,13 had venous thrombi, 11 had arterial thrombus and three had atrial thrombus and the most common thrombus sites were thoraco-abdominal aorta in seven (25.92%) and right atrium in three (11.11%) patients. In the subgroup of 108 oncological patients, the mean SUV max of the primary tumors was 17.67 (range 2.1-91.0; median 10.82), thrombi were 17.61 (range 2.14-90.11; median 14.56) and background was 5.29 (range 0.29-25.00; median 3.12). Of 27 patients with benign conditions, the mean SUV max of the thrombi was 11.09 (range 1.98-31; median 8.10) and the background was 9.80 (range 1.46-24.50; median 10.20) The ESR was raised in 13 of 26 patients (mean 35.84, range 10.98-62.00, median 35.00) and CRP was raised 22 of 26 patients (mean11.46, range 3.45-24.50, median 20.40). Upon plotting the receiver operating curve, a cutoff SUV max of 12.7 with a sensitivity of 62.96% and specificity of 77.77% was produced to demarcate tumor thrombus from benign thrombus. ConclusionFDG PET/CT plays a significant role in the detection of thrombo-embolic disease and can differentiate benign thrombus from tumor thrombus.

AB  - Polyureic nephropathy, a kidney disease characterized by excess thirst & frequent urination, are established manifestations of non-skeletal fluorosis. This study aimed to isolate the urinary exosomes from fluorosis patients with early renal impairment. Fluorosis patients having urinary fluoride above 1ppm were recruited as test group (Group-1). The recruited fluorosis patients were sub-divided in two groups i.e., fluorosis patients with normal renal functions (G-1A) and fluorosis paints with renal impairments (G-1B). Healthy individuals having urinary fluoride up to 1ppm were included as control (Group-2). Urinary Exosomes were isolated and correlated with fluoride toxicity associated nephrotoxicity. A significantly (P = 0.002) higher urinary fluoride (G-1A: 2.62 & PLUSMN; 0.94 ppm and G-1B: 3.87 & PLUSMN;1.6 ppm) in fluorosis patients were observed compared to the normal control (G-2: 0.40 & PLUSMN;0.19 ppm), (P = 0.004).The serum creatinine levels was significantly increased in G-1B (3.33 & PLUSMN;0.76 mg/dL) compared to G-1A (1.11 & PLUSMN;0.89 mg/dL), (P = 0.003) and G-2, (0.64 & PLUSMN;0.17), (P = 0.005). A significant (P = 0.001) increase in BUN were observed in G-1B, compared to G-1A and control. The urinary protein was also significantly higher in G-1A (P = 0.005) and G-1B (0.001) compared to G-2. The number of exosomes per/ml of urine in G1-B was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than the G-1A and G-2. The number of urinary exosomes in G-1A and G-1B were also significantly higher than G-2 (P = 0.05). Chronic fluoride toxicity may induce renal impairments and increased urinary excretion of exosomes.

AB  - Radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors ([177Lu]Lu-PSMA) is currently approved for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after progression with at least 1 taxane and 1 androgen-receptor- pathway inhibitor. However, the impact of prior chemotherapy on [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-RLT outcomes is debatable, with various studies showing inconsistent results. This study was conducted to precisely evaluate the impact of prior taxane chemotherapy on response and survival outcomes in mCRPC patients after [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-RLT. Methods:This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase were made using relevant key words, and articles up to December 2022 were included. The endpoints included prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Individual patient data were pooled when feasible. Univariate odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted from the individual articles, and pooled estimates and 95% CIs were generated using metaanalysis. Results:Thirteen articles comprising 2,068 patients were included. In 6 articles (553 patients), taxane-naive patients had significantly better odds of biochemical response after [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-RLT (pooled OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.21-2.71). Individual patient data metaanalysis for PSA RRs in 3 articles revealed a significantly higher PSA RR in the taxane-naive versus taxane-treated patients (57.1% vs. 39.5%; difference, 17.6%; 95% CI, 5.6%-28.9%). Further, taxane-naive status was also a predictor of significantly better progression-free survival (5 articles; 1,027 patients; pooled HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51-0.69) and OS (8 articles; 1,594 patients; pooled HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43-0.68) after [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-RLT. There was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusion:mCRPC patients with no prior taxanes had significantly better outcomes after [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-RLT than did taxane-treated patients. Further trials evaluating [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-RLT in the taxanenaive setting are now required.

AB  - Background: Since their introduction, both linear and radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) have become an integral component of the practice of Pulmonology and Thoracic Oncology. The quality of health care can be measured by comparing the performance of an individual or a health service with an ideal threshold or benchmark.The taskforce sought to evaluate quality indicators in EBUS bronchoscopy based on clinical relevance/importance and on the basis that observed significant variation in outcomes indicates potential for improvement in health care outcomes.Methods: A comprehensive literature review informed the composition of a comprehensive list of candidate quality indicators in EBUS. A multiple-round modified Delphi consensus process was subsequently performed with the aim of reaching consensus over a final list of quality indicators and performance targets for these indicators. Standard reporting items were developed, with a strong preference for items where evidence demonstrates a relationship with quality indicator outcomes.Results: Twelve quality Indicators are proposed, with performance targets supported by evidence from the literature. Standardized reporting items for both radial and linear EBUS are recommended, with evidence supporting their utility in assessing procedural outcomes presented.Conclusion: This statement is intended to provide a framework for individual proceduralists to assess the quality of EBUS they provide their patients through the identification of clinically relevant, feasible quality measures. Emphasis is placed on outcome measures, with a preference for consistent terminology to allow communication and benchmarking between centres.

AB  - Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can aid in alleviating clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). To better understand the neural mechanism of the intervention, neuroimaging modalities have been used to assess the effects of rTMS.Objective: To study the changes in cortical connectivity and motor performance with rTMS at supplementary motor area (SMA) in PD using clinical assessment tools and task-based functional MRI. Methodology: 3000 pulses at 5 Hz TMS were delivered at the left SMA once a week for a total of 8 consecutive weeks in 4 sham sessions (week 1-4) and 4 real sessions (week 5 to week 8) in 16 subjects with PD. The outcomes were assessed with UPDRS, PDQ 39 and task-based fMRI at baseline, after sham sessions at week 4, and after real sessions at week 8. Visuo-spatial functional MRI task along with T1 weighted scans (at 3 Tesla) were used to evaluate the effects of rTMS intervention. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to analyse task-based fMRI using Conn toolbox.Results: Improvements (p < 0.05) were observed in UPDRS II, III, Mobility and ADL of PDQ39 after real sessions of rTMS. MVPA of task-based connectivity revealed clusters of activation in right hemispheric precentral area, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, thalamus and cerebellum (cluster threshold pFDR=0.001).Conclusions: Weekly rTMS sessions at SMA incurred clinical motor benefits as revealed by an improvement in clinical scales and dexterity performance. These benefits could be attributed to changes in connectivity remote brain regions in the motor network.

The objective of the study, conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital and public school in north India, was to develop validated questionnaires to evaluate childhood and adolescent sleep awareness in caregivers and HCPs.Methods: The study participants (caregivers represented by parents of 2-18 year olds attending a public school and of those attending outpatient services at the study hospital and HCPs represented by medical interns and nursing graduates within 1 year of graduation) were enrolled after appropriate screening.Results: Two separate questionnaires in English for caregivers (also translated in Hindi) and HCPs were applied on 313 caregivers and 175 HCPs (110 medical interns and 65 nursing graduates) and developed and validated with a Cronbach a of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. The questionnaires covered three domains: sleep hygiene, sleep related health problems, and miscellaneous. Both group of respondents had >50% correct responses in sleep hygiene. The k agreement between knowledge and practice of sleep hygiene in caregivers was 0.2. Poor response (<50% correct responses) was seen in sleep-related health problems in both groups of respondents implying knowledge deficit in various sleep disorders. The HCPs performed poorly on basic theoretical questions in miscellaneous domain. For consultation of sleep problems, most caregivers (48%) chose pediatricians.Conclusion: There is a need to strengthen undergraduate medical and nursing curriculum in sleep. Caregivers should be made aware of implications of unhealthy sleep.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Diabetes is widespread and treatable, but little is known about the diabetes care continuum (diagnosis, treatment, and control) in India and how it varies at the national, state, and district levels.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the adult population levels of diabetes diagnosis, treatment, and control in India at national, state, and district levels and by sociodemographic characteristics.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional, nationally representative survey study from 2019 to 2021, adults in India from 28 states, 8 union territories, and 707 districts were surveyed for India's Fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). The survey team collected data on blood glucose among all adults (18-98 years) who were living in the same household as eligible participants (pregnant or nonpregnant female individuals aged 15-49 years and male individuals aged 15-54 years). The overall sample consisted of 1 895 287 adults. The analytic sample was restricted to those who either self-reported having diabetes or who had a valid measurement of blood glucose.
   EXPOSURES The exposures in this survey study were district and state residence; urban vs rural residence; age (18-39 years, 40-64 years, or >= 65 years); sex; and household wealth quintile.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diabeteswas defined by self-report or high capillary blood glucose (fasting: >= 126mg/dL [to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555]; nonfasting: >= 220 mg/dL). Among respondents who had previously been diagnosed with diabetes, the main outcome was the proportion treated based on self-reported medication use and the proportion controlled (fasting: blood glucose <126mg/dL; nonfasting: >= 180mg/dL). The findings were benchmarked against theWorld Health Organization (WHO) Global Diabetes Compact targets (80% diagnosis; 80% control among those diagnosed). The variance in indicators between and within states was partitioned using variance partition coefficients (VPCs).
   RESULTS Among 1 651 176 adult respondents (mean [SD] age, 41.6 [16.4] years; 867 896 [52.6%] female) with blood glucose measures, the proportion of individuals with diabetes was 6.5%(95% CI, 6.4%-6.6%). Among adults with diabetes, 74.2%(95% CI, 73.3%-75.0%) were diagnosed. Among those diagnosed, 59.4%(95% CI, 58.1%-60.6%) reported taking medication, and 65.5%(95% CI, 64.5%-66.4%) achieved control. Diagnosis and treatment were higher in urban areas, older age groups, and wealthier households. Among those diagnosed in the 707 districts surveyed, 246 (34.8%) districts met the WHO diagnosis target, while 76 (10.7%) districts met the WHO control target. Most of the variability in diabetes diagnosis (VPC, 89.1%), treatment (VPC, 85.9%), and control (VPC, 95.6%) were within states, not between states.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this survey study, the diabetes care continuum in India is represented by considerable district-level variation, age-related disparities, and rural-urban differences. Surveillance at the district level can guide state health administrators to prioritize interventions and monitor achievement of global targets.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2%-3% of the population worldwide. Clinical presentation of PD includes motor and non-motor symptoms. The interplay between pathogenic factors such as increased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis are responsible for neurodegeneration in PD. Intrastriatal administration of 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) in rat brain provoked oxidative and nitrosative stress by decreasing endogenous antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Consequently, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis-a, interferon-? and cyclooxygenase-2 mediated neuroinflammation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, involving inhibition of complex-II and IV activities, followed by apoptosis and degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons resulted in reduced dopamine turnover, consequently induced behavioural abnormalities in rats. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have protective role in PD by modulating response of antioxidant enzymes, neuroinflammation and apoptosis in various animal models of PD. Saroglitazar (SG) being dual PPAR-a/? agonist activates both PPAR-a and PPAR-? receptors and provide neuroprotection by reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis of dopaminergic cells in 6-OHDA induced PD in rats. Thereby, SG restored striatal histopathological damage and dopamine concentration in rat striatum, and behavioural alterations in rats. Thus, SG proved neuroprotective effects in rat model of PD. Potential benefits of SG in rat model of PD advocates to consider it for further preclinical and clinical evaluation.

AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis infection is a major cause of sexually transmitted diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been known to be upregulated/downregulated in various reproductive-associated diseases such as ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth and pre-eclampsia. However, there is paucity of literature on miRNA profile in C. trachomatis-infected RSA. The present study aimed to determine the profile of serum miRNAs followed by their validation in C. trachomatisinfected RSA and to find target genes involved in biological pathways. Non-heparinized blood and first void urine were collected from 30 non-pregnant women with RSA and 30 non-pregnant women with & GE;2 successful deliveries (controls) attending Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Safdarjung hospital, New Delhi, India. C. trachomatis detection was done in urine by PCR and chlamydial load was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). miRNA expression was studied by microarray analysis followed by in vitro validation by qRTPCR. Analysis of target genes/pathways was characterized in silico. 06 RSA patients were infected with C. trachomatis, while chlamydial load was found to be 6000-12,000 copies/ml. 110 circulating miRNAs were expressed differentially in infected RSA patients compared with controls. Of these, 16 were overexpressed and 94 downregulated. 06 differentially expressed circulating miRNAs were selected to validate the microarray results. qRT-PCR data confirmed the reliability of the microarray results: miR-4443, -5100, -7975 showed statistically significant upregulation, while miR-6808-5p, -3148, -6727-5p were significantly downregulated in infected RSA patients versus controls. Chlamydial load was positively correlated with these upregulated miRNAs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that target genes of miRNAs in RSA are involved in AMPK, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. Overall results indicate that differentially expressed circulating miRNAs are involved in pathogenesis of C. trachomatis-associated RSA and have the potential to be used as biomarkers for predicting RSA.

AB  - We provide the first comprehensive analysis of the association between two key household resources (drinking water and toilet access) and both non-partner violence (NPV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by women. We use data from a nationally representative household survey for India obtained from the latest (fourth) round of the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015-16. We employ logistic regression method and also use inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment to control for selection bias. We find that NPV decreases with access to drinking water, while IPV decreases with provision of toilets. These results are found to be robust to an alternative method viz. propensity score matching and selection on unobservables using the Rosenbaum bounds approach.

AB  - Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by tissue infiltration due to mononuclear phagocytes and lymphocytes and associated noncaseating granuloma formation. Pulmonary sarcoidosis (PS) shares a number of clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics with that of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Due to this, clinicians face issues in differentiating between PS and PTB in a substantial number of cases. There is a lack of any specific biomarker that can diagnose PS distinctively from PTB. We compared T-cell-based signature cytokines in patients with PS and PTB. In this study, we proposed a serum biomarker panel consisting of cytokines from cells: T helper (Th) 1 [interferon-gamma (IFN-& gamma;); tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-& alpha;)], Th9 [interleukin (IL)-9], Th17 [IL-17], and T regulatory (Treg) [IL-10; transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-& beta;)]. We performed the principal component analysis that demonstrated that our serum cytokine panel has a significant predictive ability to differentiate PS from PTB. Our results could aid clinicians to improve the diagnostic workflow for patients with PS in TB endemic settings where the diagnosis between PS and PTB is often ambiguous.

AB  - Nutritional status is an important aspect of childhood cancer, with a bearing on the disease and subsequent survivorship. We sought to evaluate the long-term anthropometric outcomes in a cohort of pediatric solid tumor survivors treated between 1994 and 2016. Anthropometry was noted at the time of presentation, after completion of therapy, and at the last follow-up. The z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age, and BMI-for-age were calculated using WHO growth charts for ages /= 5 years. BMI was calculated for adult survivors. We included 317 survivors, comprising 48, 81, and 188 survivors of Hepatoblastoma (HB), Malignant Germ cell Tumor (MGCT), and Wilms Tumor (WT) respectively. The median age at diagnosis was 24.5 (IQR 59-13.2) months, with a follow-up ranging from 5 to 19.54 years. The z-scores of the collective cohort and individual cohorts of HB, MGCT, and WT showed an improving trend from diagnosis to the last follow-up. The difference in the prevalence of malnutrition was found to be statistically significant when any two-time points were compared. Of the 28 adult survivors, 43% were noted to be underweight. Thus, anthropometric measures improve during follow-up, however, up to 15% of children persist in being malnourished.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder associated with considerable morbidity. However, there is an underrepresentation of data from India and other developing countries in global reviews of OSA prevalence. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the prevalence of OSA in India. The MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched for articles that reported the prevalence of OSA in the general Indian adult population using sleep studies. Eight studies were included comprising 11,009 subjects with mean age ranging from 35.5 to 47.8 years. On the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies, the study quality ranged from 3/9 to 9/9. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. The pooled prevalence of OSA (AHI = 5 events/hour) was 11% overall (95% CI: 7%-15%; I-2 = 98.0%, p<0.001), 13% in males (95% CI: 7%-18%; I2 = 96.0%, p<0.001), and 5% in females (95% CI: 3%-7%; I-2 = 73.3%, p = 0.01). The pooled prevalence of moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI >15 events/hour) was 5% (95% CI: 2%-8%, I-2 = 95.3%; p = 0.01). Based on these findings, approximately 104 million Indians of working age suffer from OSA, of whom 47 million have moderate-to-severe OSA. This represents a major public health problem in India with important implications for the global burden of the disease.

AB  - Impaired class switch memory (CSM) B cell formation is the hallmark of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Various T cell abnormalities have been observed in CVID patients indicating inadequate T-cell help to B cells. A major setback in understanding its pathogenesis is due to diverse clinical presentation. Therefore, we performed extensive immunological investigation in a cohort of CVID patients with similar clinical findings in order to unravel the T cell dysfunction and its influence on the defective humoral immune response. All recruited CVID patients exhibited B cells in the normal range, but reduced CSM B cells. However, patients showed reduced T cell proliferation, reduced level of serum Interleukin-9 (IL-9) and frequency of IL-9 expressing CD4 (Th-9) cells. IL-9 supplementation along with CD40 engagement was effective in inducing in vitro CSM B cells formation in CVID patients. Thus, IL-9 supplementation has the potential to restore impaired CSM B cell formation in CVID.

AB  - Clostridioides difficile is one of the most important causes of healthcare-associated diarrhea. The high incidence and recurrence rates of C. difficile infection, as well as its associated morbidity and mortality, are great concerns. The most common complication of C. difficile infection is recurrence, with rates of 20-30% after a primary infection and 60% after three or more episodes. Medical management of recurrent C. difficile infection involves a choice of therapy that is different from the antibiotic used in the primary episode. Patients with recurrent C. difficile infection also benefit from fecal microbiota transplantation or standardized microbiome restoration therapies (approved or experimental) to restore eubiosis. In contrast to antibiotics, microbiome restoration therapies restore a normal gut flora and eliminate C. difficile colonization and infection. Fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent C. difficile infection has demonstrated higher success rates than vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or placebo. Fecal microbiota transplantation has traditionally been considered safe, with the most common adverse reactions being abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea, and rare serious adverse events. Significant heterogeneity and a lack of standardization regarding the process of preparation, and administration of fecal microbiota transplantation remain a major pitfall. Standardized microbiome-based therapies provide a promising alternative. In the ECOSPOR III trial of SER-109, an oral formulation of bacterial spores, a significant reduction in the recurrence rate (12%) was observed compared with placebo (40%). In the phase III PUNCH CD3 trial, RBX2660 also demonstrated high efficacy rates of 70.6% versus 57.5%. Both these agents are now US Food and Drug Administration approved for recurrent C. difficile infection. Other standardized microbiome-based therapies currently in the pipeline are VE303, RBX7455, and MET-2. Antibiotic neutralization strategies, vaccines, passive monoclonal antibodies, and drug repurposing are other therapeutic strategies being explored to treat C. difficile infection.

AB  - Background: Hypertension (high blood pressure) during pregnancy has significant implications on maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Tobacco use during pregnancy amplifies this burden and increases the risk of hypertensive disorders along with adverse birth outcomes. The current study aimed to evaluate the joint risk atpopulation-level of tobacco use and hypertension among pregnant women in India.Methodology: Data of 32,428 "currently pregnant" women aged 15-49 years was obtained from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) 2015-16to estimate bivariate (tobacco user vs. non-user) and binomial logistic regression analysis in order to get odds ratios of having hypertension. The analysis included socio-demographic variables such as the respondent's age, type of residence, wealth index, and education status.Results: Prevalence of hypertension among pregnant tobacco users (7.5%) was significantly higher than that of non-users (6.1%). The unadjusted odds of having hypertension were 1.17 (95% CI: 1.02-1.35) times among tobacco users than non-users and increased with age (p < 0.001) and in rural areas (p = 0.02) after adjusting for other covariates. However, it varied inversely with education status (p > 0.05; NS) and wealth quintile (p = 0.01).Conclusion: The present study identifies the higher co-existence of hypertension among tobacco-using pregnant women and highlights the need for tobacco control/cessation and hypertension prevention and management during pregnancy considering socio-demographic disparities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Brachytherapy (BT) is integral in treatment of gynecological malignancies and is also an option for many other cancers. Data on training and proficiency levels of early career oncologists is limited. Like other continents a survey was conducted for early career oncologists in India. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An online survey was conducted from November 2019 to February 2020, through Association of Radiation Oncologists of India (AROI) for early career radiation oncologists expected to be within 6 years of training. The survey used a 22 item questionnaire that was also used for European survey. Responses to individual statements were recorded on a 1-5 Likert-type scale. Descriptive statistics were used to describe proportions.RESULTS: One-hundred twenty-four (17%) of 700 recipients responded to the survey. Majority of the respondents (88%) stated that being able to perform BT at the end of their training was important. Two-thirds of the respondents (81/124) had performed > 10 intracavitary procedure and 22.5% had performed > 10 intracavitary-interstitial implants. Many respondents had not performed predicted that in next 10 years, the role of BT is likely to increase. Lack of dedicated curriculum and training was perceived as the greatest barriers to achieving independence in BT (58%). Respondents suggested that BT training should be prioritized during conferences (73%) and online teaching modules (56%), along with development of BT skills labs (65%). CONCLUSION: This survey identified a lack of proficiency in gynecological intracavitaryinterstitial brachytherapy and non-gynecological brachytherapy, despite BT training being regarded as highly important. Dedicated programs, including standardized curriculum and assessment need to be developed for training early- career radiation oncologists in BT. & COPY; 2023 American Brachytherapy Society.

AB  - COVID-19 demanded urgent and immediate global attention, during which other public health crises such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) increased silently, undermining patient safety and the life-saving ability of several antimicrobials. In 2019, WHO declared AMR a top ten global public health threat facing humanity, with misuse and overuse of antimicrobials as the main drivers in the development of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. AMR is steadily on the rise, especially in low-income and middle-income countries across south Asia, South America, and Africa. Extraordinary circumstances often demand an extraordinary response as did the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the fragility of health systems across the world and forcing governments and global agencies to think creatively. The key strategies that helped to contain the increasing SARS-CoV-2 infections included a focus on centralised governance with localised implementation, evidence-based risk communication and community engagement, use of technological methods for tracking and accountability, extensive expansion of access to diagnostics, and a global adult vaccination programme. The extensive and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials to treat patients, particularly in the early phase of the pandemic, have adversely affected AMR stewardship practices. However, there were important lessons learnt during the pandemic, which can be leveraged to strengthen surveillance and stewardship, and revitalise efforts to address the AMR crisis.

AB  - ObjectiveThe 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend against radioiodine (RAI) ablation for patients with low-risk papillary microcarcinoma. However, its role in other low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients remains controversial. Here, we compare long-term outcomes with RAI versus no-RAI in a large cohort comprising all low-risk DTCs. MethodsPatients with low-risk, histologically-proven DTC post-thyroidectomy, treated with RAI or kept on follow-up without RAI, between 1990 and 2019 were included. The main outcomes included recurrence rate and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and were validated by propensity-score matching analysis. ResultsOf the 2074 low-risk DTC patients (median age: 35 years), 1686 patients underwent RAI-ablation (RAI group), while 388 patients underwent no-RAI follow-up (NOI group). Over a median follow-up of 8 years (range: 3-29), the recurrence rates were similar between the RAI and NOI groups (2.0% vs. 3.3%, p = .161). The 5- and 10-year RFS probabilities were 99.2% and 97.4%, respectively in RAI group versus 98.4% and 96.2%, respectively, in NOI group (p = .055). Subgroup regression analyses showed that patients with age <55 years (p = .044), male sex (p = .015), papillary histology (p = .043), pT3a tumours (p = .049) and postoperative thyroglobulin & GE;5 ng/mL (p = .002) had significantly better RFS with RAI compared to NOI follow-up. Propensity-score matching generated 776 matched pairs with no significantly different outcomes between the two groups. ConclusionsIn low-risk DTC patients post-thyroidectomy, RAI ablation does not confer significant survival advantage over no-RAI follow-up. Further studies are required to demonstrate any long-term benefit with RAI, specifically in patients with tumour size >4 cm and elevated postoperative thyroglobulin.

AB  - Both epigenetic and genetic changes in the cancer genome act simultaneously to promote tumor development and metastasis. Aberrant DNA methylation, a prime epigenetic event, is often observed in various cancer types. The elevated DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) enzyme creates DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands to drive oncogenic potential. This study emphasized to decipher the molecular mechanism of endogenous regulation of DNMT1 expression for finding upstream signaling molecules. Cancer database analyses found an upregulated DNMT1 expression in most cancer types including breast cancer. Overexpression of DNMT1 showed an increased cell migration, invasion, and stemness potential whereas 5-azacytidine (DNMT1 inhibitor) and siRNA mediated knockdown of DNMT1 exhibited inhibition of such cancer activities in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Infact, cancer database analyses further found a positive correlation of DNMT1 transcript with both cholesterol pathway regulatory genes and BMP signaling molecules. Experimental observations documented that the cholesterol-lowering drug, simvastatin decreased DNMT1 transcript as well as protein, whereas BMP-2 treatment increased DNMT1 expression in breast cancer cells. In addition, expression of various key cholesterol regulatory genes was found to be upregulated in response to BMP-2 treatment. Moreover, simvastatin inhibited BMP-2 induced DNMT1 expression in breast cancer cells. Thus, this study for the first time reveals that both BMP-2 signaling and cholesterol pathways could regulate endogenous DNMT1 expression in cancer cells.

AB  - Human viral oncogenesis is a complex phenomenon and amajor contributorto the global cancer burden. Several recent findings revealed cellular and molecular pathways that promote the development and initiationof malignancy when viruses cause an infection. Even, antiviral treatmenthas become an approach to eliminate the viral infectionsand prevent the activation of oncogenesis. Therefore, for a betterunderstanding, the molecular pathogenesis of various oncogenic viruseslike, hepatitis virus, human immunodeficiency viral (HIV), human papillomavirus(HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), could be explored, especially, to expand many potent antiviralsthat may escalate the apoptosis of infected malignant cells whilesparing normal and healthy ones. Moreover, contemporary therapies,such as engineered antibodies antiviral agents targeting signalingpathways and cell biomarkers, could inhibit viral oncogenesis. Thisreview elaborates the recent advancements in both natural and syntheticantivirals to control viral oncogenesis. The study also highlightsthe challenges and future perspectives of using antivirals in viraloncogenesis.

The objective of this study is to analyze our experience with SCM-I patients having dorsal bony spurs.MethodologyRetrospective analysis of SCM patients operated from 2010 to 2017 was performed. Their demographic profile, clinic-radiological features, operative findings, and outcome following surgery were recorded.ResultsTwenty-four cases of Type I SCM harboring dorsal bony spurs were identified with mean age of 4.96 years. The commonest split site was lumbar, documented in 62.5%. Scoliosis was observed in 58.3%. Pre-operative neurological deficits were seen in 66.6% cases with asymmetric weakness of limbs seen in 16.6%. There was no new neurological deficit observed post-operatively.ConclusionsThis is the largest series of dorsal spurs occurring in SCM, reported in literature so far. Meticulous pre-operative evaluation and imaging are important to identify dorsal spurs for appropriate management and good clinical outcome. Differentiating dorsal spur from ventral spur is important as it has a bearing on surgical approach.

AB  - A non-GMO method of RNA interference (RNAi) has been recently in practice through direct delivery of double stranded RNA into the plant cells. Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), a bipartitie begomovirus, is a significant viral pathogen of many crops in the Indian subcontinent. Conventional RNAi cargo delivery strategies for instance uses viral vectors and Agrobacterium-facilitated delivery, exhibiting specific host responses from the plant system. In the present study, we synthesized three different sizes of amine-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (amino-MSNPs) to mediate the delivery of dsRNA derived from the AC2 (dsAC2) gene of ToLCNDV and showed that these dsRNA loaded nanoparticles enabled effective reduction in viral load. Furthermore, we demonstrate that amino-MSNPs protected the dsRNA molecules from nuclease degradation, while the complex was efficiently taken up by the leaves and roots of Nicotiana benthamiana. The real time gene expression evaluation showed that plants treated with nanoparticles of different sizes similar to 10 nm (MSNPDEA), similar to 32 nm (MSNPTEA) and similar to 66 nm (MSNPNH3) showed five-, eleven- and threefold reduction of ToLCNDV in N. benthamiana, respectively compared to the plants treated with naked dsRNA. This work clearly demonstrates the size dependent internalization of amino-MSNPs and relative efficacy in transporting dsRNA into the plant system, which will be useful in convenient topical treatment to protect plants against their pathogens including viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The evolving epidemiologic patterns of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the world, in conjunction with advances in therapeutic treatments, may influence hospitalization rates of IBD. We performed a systematic review with temporal analysis of hospitalization rates for IBD across the world in the 21st century.METHODS: We systematically reviewed Medline and Embase for population-based studies reporting hos-pitalization rates for IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) in the 21st century. Log-linear models were used to calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) with associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Random-effects meta-analysis pooled country -level AAPCs. Data were stratified by the epidemiologic stage of a region: compounding preva-lence (stage 3) in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania vs acceleration of incidence (stage 2) in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America vs emergence (stage 1) in developing countries.RESULTS: Hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis of IBD were stable in countries in stage 3 (AAPC, -0.13%; 95% CI, -0.72 to 0.97), CD (AAPC, 0.20%; 95% CI, -1.78 to 2.17), and UC (AAPC, 0.02%; 95% CI, -0.91 to 0.94). In contrast, hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis were increasing in countries in stage 2 for IBD (AAPC, 4.44%; 95% CI, 2.75 to 6.14), CD (AAPC, 8.34%; 95% CI, 4.38 to 12.29), and UC (AAPC, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.29 to 6.52). No population-based studies were available for developing regions in stage 1 (emergence).CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization rates for IBD are stabilizing in countries in stage 3, whereas newly industrial-ized countries in stage 2 have rapidly increasing hospitalization rates, contributing to an increasing burden on global health care systems.

AB  - Acid attacks refer to assaults where caustic substances such as an acid are thrown onto a victim. The usual purpose is to maim and disfigure and cause lifelong health and societal issues. Deaths uncommonly occur. Three cases are described involving females who were aged 14, 20 and 35 years respectively, who survived for some time after the attacks but later died. Postmortem findings confirmed that the deaths were due to septicemia and multiorgan failure. After an acid attack, death may be caused by a range of immediate, early and delayed complications. Hypovolemic shock may occur from loss of fluid exuding from the sites of deep burns. If the caustic agent has been inhaled or swallowed there may be mucosal, submucosal or deeper tissue injuries associated with mucosal edema and sloughing of pseudomembranes resulting in critical narrowing of the airways. Inhalation of fumes may also result in diffuse alveolar damage as a significant pathological finding. Further complications include acute renal failure, septicemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. The prognosis of such injuries depends on the extent of the body surface that has been burned, the presence and extent of inhalation injuries, concomitant comorbid conditions and the age of the victim.

AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) are among the most common global healthcare challenges and they are usually precipitated by disruption to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Their successful management typically requires intensive resource utilization, and despite the best therapies, morbidity and mortality remain high. One of the main issues required to appropriately treat IAI that differs from the other etiologies of sepsis is the frequent requirement to provide physical source control. Fortunately, dramatic advances have been made in this aspect of treatment. Historically, source control was left to surgeons only. With new technologies non-surgical less invasive interventional procedures have been introduced. Alternatively, in addition to formal surgery open abdomen techniques have long been proposed as aiding source control in severe intra-abdominal sepsis. It is ironic that while a lack or even delay regarding source control clearly associates with death, it is a concept that remains poorly described. For example, no conclusive definition of source control technique or even adequacy has been universally accepted. Practically, source control involves a complex definition encompassing several factors including the causative event, source of infection bacteria, local bacterial flora, patient condition, and his/her eventual comorbidities. With greater understanding of the systemic pathobiology of sepsis and the profound implications of the human microbiome, adequate source control is no longer only a surgical issue but one that requires a multidisciplinary, multimodality approach. Thus, while any breach in the GI tract must be controlled, source control should also attempt to control the generation and propagation of the systemic biomediators and dysbiotic influences on the microbiome that perpetuate multi-system organ failure and death. Given these increased complexities, the present paper represents the current opinions and recommendations for future research of the World Society of Emergency Surgery, of the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery of Surgical Infection Society Europe and Surgical Infection Society America regarding the concepts and operational adequacy of source control in intra-abdominal infections.

Despite growing experience on surgical management, the long-term restoration of the cranial defect has been rarely discussed so far. Several alloplastic materials have been proposed as effective and safe solutions for cranioplasty even for pediatric patients, allowing for bone generation, good aesthetic results, and low complication rates. We report, for the first time, on a separated craniopagus child who underwent successf u l implant of a tailor-made system based on the combination of calciu m phosphate ceramic reinforced with a ti-tanium mesh.

AB  - BackgroundPediatric differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) differ in pathophysiology, presentation, and clinical outcomes from adult DTCs. However, the cutoff age for defining pediatric DTCs remains debatable, with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and International Incidence of Childhood Cancer (IICC) report recommending different cutoffs of 18 and 14 years, respectively. In this study, we investigated the appropriateness of 14-year cutoff by comparing the clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes in the 14 years and younger and 15-18 years age groups. MethodsData of DTC patients, aged 18 years and older, from 1981 to 2016, were sequentially extracted and compared between two age groups: & LE;14 and 15-18 years. ResultsTotal of 176 pediatric DTC patients were included (age group & LE;14 years: n = 75; age group 15-18 years: n = 101). None of the baseline clinical characteristics were significantly different between the two age groups. At 2-year follow-up, patients in the age group & LE;14 years had significantly higher incomplete response rate compared to those in the age group 15-18 years (69% vs. 42%, respectively, p < .001). However, over a median follow-up of 10.6 years (interquartile range: 7.7-15.5), the 5- and 10-year Disease-free survival (DFS) probabilities were not significantly different (p = .406). On multivariate analysis, incomplete response at 2-year follow-up was the sole independent predictor of poor DFS (hazard ratio: 5.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.69-20.23). ConclusionsSubdivision of pediatric DTCs into less than or equal to 14 years and 15-18 years age groups did not have any long-term predictive value. The cutoff of 18 years as recommended by ATA is reasonable and should be uniformly followed to avoid inconsistencies and confusion.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances are seen even in individuals on opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Established pharmacotherapy for sleep disturbances such as benzodiazepines have misuse potential and increased mortality risk in patients with OAT. No study has explored the role of trazodone on sleep disturbance in individuals maintained on buprenorphine. We aimed to assess the efficacy of trazodone in improving sleep disturbance among individuals maintained on buprenorphine. Methods: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomised trial. Adult males (18-60 years) stabilised on buprenorphine with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of above five, without other psychiatric comorbidity were randomised to receive either trazodone (50-150 mg per day) or placebo. Sleep-50 questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for opioid craving, and PSQI were assessed at baseline and at the end of six weeks. Results: Fifty-one patients were allocated to trazodone arm and 49 to placebo arm. Side-effects of trazodone were minimal and well-tolerated with comparable discontiuation rates between both groups. Significantly greater proportion of patients on trazodone (82%, mean dose 101.9 mg) had PSQI scores five or less than those on placebo (16%) at the end of six weeks. Sleep improvement was in various components like sleep quality, latency, efficiency, and duration of sleep. Conclusion: Trazodone is well-tolerated and effective in improving sleep disturbances in individuals with opioid dependence maintained on buprenorphine over a six-week period.

AB  - BACKGROUNDDepression and anxiety were both ranked among the top 25 leading causes of global burden of diseases in 2019 prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic affected, and in many cases threatened, the health and lives of millions of people across the globe and within the first year, global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by 25% with the greatest influx in places highly affected by COVID-19.AIMTo explore the psychological impact of the pandemic and resultant restrictions in different countries using an opportunistic sample and online questionnaire in different phases of the pandemic.METHODSA repeated, cross-sectional online international survey of adults, 16 years and above, was carried out in 10 countries (United Kingdom, India, Canada, Bangladesh, Ukraine, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia). The online questionnaire was based on published approaches to understand the psychological impact of COVID-19 and the resultant restrictions. Five standardised measures were included to explore levels of depression [patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9)], anxiety [generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) assessment], impact of trauma [the impact of events scale-revised (IES-R)], loneliness (a brief loneliness scale), and social support (The Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social support).RESULTSThere were two rounds of the online survey in 10 countries with 42866 participants in Round 1 and 92260 in Round 2. The largest number of participants recruited from the United Kingdom (112985 overall). The majority of participants reported receiving no support from mental health services throughout the pandemic. This study found that the daily cumulative COVID-19 cases had a statistically significant effect on PHQ-9, GAD-7, and IES-R scores. These scores significantly increased in the second round of surveys with the ordinary least squares regression results with regression discontinuity design specification (to control lockdown effects) confirming these results. The study findings imply that participants' mental health worsened with high cumulative COVID-19 cases.CONCLUSIONWhist we are still living through the impact of COVID-19, this paper focuses on its impact on mental health, discusses the possible consequences and future implications. This study revealed that daily cumulative COVID-19 cases have a significant impact on depression, anxiety, and trauma. Increasing cumulative cases influenced and impacted education, employment, socialization and finances, to name but a few. Building a database of global evidence will allow for future planning of pandemics, particularly the impact on mental health of populations considering the cultural differences.

AB  - Background: COVID-associated Rhino-Orbito-Cerebral Mucormycosis (CAROM) appeared as an epidemic in India during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic during the months of March to May 2021. Though many reports have highlighted cross sectional and short-term attributes related to CAROM, long term follow up data is sparse. Objective: This report aims to analyze the follow-up outcomes in consecutive patients presenting to us during the epidemic.Patients and methods: This was an ambispective observational analytical study, recruiting the consecutive patients admitted to our tertiary care centre during the period of the CAROM epidemic. The mortality rate during the follow-up and various factors affecting survival were studied using univariable and multivariable statistics with the Stata 14.0 software.Results: Of the 189 patients studied, eight were lost to follow-up. The outcome analysis was performed for the 181 patients. 93.6 % (162/173) of the patients had diabetes. The All-cause mortality was 45 % (81/181), while the ROCM-specific mortality was found to be 24 % (46/181) at a median follow-up of 176 days (IQR: 21-217 days). With univariable analysis, increasing age, higher serum IL-6 levels, presence of additional comorbidities (in addition to Diabetes and hypertension), bilateral disease, skin necrosis, palatal involvement, infratemporal fossa involvement, and impaired vision/ocular movements were found to be associated with increased mortality. However, on multivariable analysis, only 1) increasing age, 2) raised serum IL-6 levels, and 3) bilateral disease were predictive of increased mortality. Surgical debridement (endoscopic, palatal removal, orbital exenteration, neurosurgical intervention) was associated with significantly reduced mortality on both univariable and multivariable analysis.Conclusion: Our intermediate-term follow-up data showed advanced age at presentation, raised IL-6 levels, and bilateral sinonasal involvement to be predictive of increased mortality, while surgical debridement is significantly protective from mortality in CAROM patients.

AB  - PurposeDespite the existence of various treatment options, the prognosis for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains unfavorable. One potential therapeutic approach is the use of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617, a targeted alpha therapy (TAT) that administers alpha-particle radiation specifically to prostate cancer cells expressing PSMA. In this study, we report the long-term survival outcomes of this novel therapy in a series of patients with mCRPC who have exhausted all standard treatment options.MethodsThe study enrolled patients with mCRPC who had shown resistance to standard lines of therapies, including next-generation anti-androgen therapies and taxane-based chemotherapies. These eligible patients received treatment with [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 at 100-150 kBq/kg doses administered every 8 weeks. The primary objective of the study was to assess overall survival (OS), while secondary objectives included evaluating radiological progression-free survival (rPFS), monitoring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as a measure of biochemical response, and assessing adverse events using the CTCAE v5.0 grading system.ResultsAmong the 63 initially enrolled patients, a total of 56 patients who had completed at least two cycles of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 were included in this study. The mean age was 67 years (range, 39-87) and patients received a total of 204 cycles of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 TAT. 91% of patients exhibited any PSA decline, with 67.8% experiencing a decline of 50% or more. The median follow-up was of 22 months (range: 6-59 months). Imaging-based disease progression was observed in 68% of patients, and 66% of patients succumbed to the disease. The median OS was 15 months (95% CI: 10-19). In univariate analysis, factors such as lack of >50% PSA decline (P=0.031), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or higher (P=0.048), and radiological progression (rPD) (P<0.001) were found to be predictors of poor OS. However, in multivariate analysis, only rPD emerged as an independent prognostic factor with a hazard ratio (HR) of 8.264 (95% CI: 1.429-16.497, P=0.004). The estimated median rPFS was 9 months (95% CI: 7-15). Moreover, patients who demonstrated any PSA decline had a median rPFS of 10 months compared to only 3 months in patients without any PSA decline (multivariate HR: 6.749; 95% CI: 1.949-23.370; P=0.002). Fatigue was one of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events, with grades 1/2 occurring in 70% of patients and grades 3 or higher in 3.5% of patients. This fatigue was transient and resolved before the next treatment cycle. Additionally, approximately one-third of patients experienced xerostomia (grades 1/2: 32.1%).Conclusion[Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 targeted alpha therapy, was found to be well-tolerated with acceptable adverse events and effective in the treatment of patients with end-stage mCRPC.

AB  - Sesamol, a lignan obtained from roasted seeds of Sesamum indicum, has high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we have investigated the effect of sesamol on Bleomycin (BLM) induced pulmonary toxicity as well as fibrosis in Wistar rats. Lung toxicity was induced by administration of BLM, 0.015U/g ip, twice weekly for 28 days whereas lung fibrosis was induced by BLM, 0.015 U/g ip, every 5th day for 49 days. Sesamol administration was started 7 days before first dose of BLM in both the models. It was observed that sesamol 50mg/kg most effectively attenuated pulmonary toxicity by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. This dose was further evaluated for its anti-fibrotic effect. It was observed that there was a significant reduction in fibrosis. Lung collagen content was markedly reduced. Furthermore, expression of pro-fibrotic proteins, TGF-beta/SMAD and alpha-SMA, was reduced and that of anti-fibrotic protein, AMPK, was markedly increased. Even though the combination of sesamol with pirfenidone exhibited no additional protection than either drug alone, it is evident from our study that our test drug, sesamol is comparable in efficacy to pirfenidone. Thus, sesamol has promising therapeutic potential in treatment of pulmonary toxicity and fibrosis.

AB  - Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition which affects women in the reproductive age group. South Asian women with PCOS have a higher risk of insulin resistance and metabolic disorder compared to women from other ethnic backgrounds. Lifestyle interventions such as dietary advice and physical exercise are recommended as a first-line management option for infertile women with PCOS. Most of the randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of lifestyle interventions in infertile PCOS women were characterized by methodological issues. The uptake of lifestyle modifications as a treatment strategy in the South Asian population is complicated by a difficult-to-change conventional high-carbohydrate diet and limited availability of space for physical activity in the region.Methods The study is designed as an open-label, multicentre, randomized controlled trial in South Asian women with PCOS. Women attending the fertility clinic will be screened for eligibility, and women aged between 19 and 37 years who have been diagnosed with PCOS and wishing to conceive will be invited to participate in the trial. We will include women with body mass index (BMI) between = 23 and = 35 kg/m(2) and duration of infertility = 3 years. We plan to randomize women with PCOS into two groups: group A will receive the intervention which will consist of individualized advice on diet and physical exercise along with a telephonic reminder system and follow-up visits, and group B (control) will receive one-time advice on diet and physical exercise. Both groups will receive up to three cycles of ovulation induction with letrozole after 3 months of randomization during the 6-month treatment period. The primary outcome of the trial will be the live birth following conception during the intervention period. The secondary outcomes include clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, stillbirth, time to pregnancy, mean weight loss, differences in anthropometric parameters, improvement in menstrual regularity and quality of life score.Discussion The IPOS trial results could help clarify and provide more robust evidence for advocating an individualized lifestyle intervention in PCOS women who wish to conceive.

AB  - There are disparities in outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). We evaluated the influence of sociodemographic factors on global disparities in outcomes for patients with MM. This rapid evidence assessment (PROSPERO, CRD42021248461) followed PRISMA-P guidelines and used the PICOS framework. PubMed and Embase & REG; were searched for articles in English from 2011 to 2021. The title, abstract, and full text of articles were screened according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. The sociodemographic factors assessed were age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. Outcomes were diagnosis, access to treatment, and patient outcomes. Of 84 articles included, 48 were US-based. Worldwide, increasing age and low socioeconomic status were associated with worse patient outcomes. In the US, men typically had worse outcomes than women, although women had poorer access to treatment, as did Black, Asian, and Hispanic patients. No consistent disparities due to sex were seen outside the US, and for most factors and outcomes, no consistent disparities could be identified globally. Too few studies examined disparities in diagnosis to draw firm conclusions. This first systematic analysis of health disparities in patients with MM identified specific populations affected, highlighting a need for additional research focused on assessing patterns, trends, and underlying drivers of disparities in MM.

AB  - Septic shock is a leading cause of hospitalisation, morbidity, and mortality for children worldwide. In 2020, the paediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) issued evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for children with septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction based on the evidence available at the time. There are now more trials from multiple settings, including low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), addressing optimal fluid choice and amount, selection and timing of vasoactive infusions, and optimal monitoring and therapeutic endpoints. In response to developments in adult critical care to trial personalised haemodynamic management algorithms, it is timely to critically reassess the current state of applying SSC guidelines in LMIC settings. In this Viewpoint, we briefly outline the challenges to improve sepsis care in LMICs and then discuss three key concepts that are relevant to management of children with septic shock around the world, especially in LMICs. These concepts include uncertainties surrounding the early recognition of paediatric septic shock, choices for initial haemodynamic support, and titration of ongoing resuscitation to therapeutic endpoints. Specifically, given the evolving understanding of clinical phenotypes, we focus on the controversies surrounding the concepts of early fluid resuscitation and vasoactive agent use, including insights gained from experience in LMICs and high-income countries. We outline the key components of sepsis management that are both globally relevant and translatable to low-resource settings, with a view to open the conversation to the large variety of treatment pathways, especially in LMICs. We emphasise the role of simple and easily available monitoring tools to apply the SSC guidelines and to tailor individualised support to the patient's cardiovascular physiology.

AB  - Addiction medicine is a rapidly growing field with many young professionals seeking careers in this field. However, early-career professionals (ECPs) face challenges such as a lack of competency-based training due to a shortage of trainers, limited resources, limited mentorship opportunities, and establishment of suitable research areas. The International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) New Professionals Exploration, Training & Education (NExT) committee, a global platform for early-career addiction medicine professionals (ECAMPs), conducted a two-phase online survey using a modified Delphi-based approach among ECAMPs across 56 countries to assess the need for standardized training, research opportunities, and mentorship. A total of 110 respondents participated in Phase I (online key informant survey), and 28 respondents participated in Phase II (online expert group discussions on three themes identified in Phase I). The survey found that there is a lack of standardized training, structured mentorship programs, research funding, and research opportunities in addiction medicine for ECAMPs. There is a need for standardized training programs, improving research opportunities, and effective mentorship programs to promote the next generation of addiction medicine professionals and further development in the entire field. The efforts of ISAM NExT are well-received and give a template of how this gap can be addressed.

AB  - BACKGROUND The impact of complete revascularization (CR) on angina-related health status (symptoms, function, quality of life) in chronic coronary disease (CCD) has not been well studied. OBJECTIVES Among patients with CCD randomized to invasive (INV) vs conservative (CON) management in ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches), we compared the following: 1) the impact of anatomic and functional CR on health status compared with incomplete revascularization (ICR); and 2) the predicted impact of achieving CR in all INV patients compared with CON.METHODS Multivariable regression adjusting for patient characteristics was used to compare 12-month health status after independent core laboratory-defined CR vs ICR in INV patients who underwent revascularization. Propensity-weighted modeling was then performed to estimate the treatment effect had CR or ICR been achieved in all INV patients, compared with CON.RESULTS Anatomic and functional CR were achieved in 43.3% and 57.8% of 1,641 INV patients, respectively. Among revascularized patients, CR was associated with improved Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency compared with ICR after adjustment for baseline differences. After modeling CR and ICR in all INV patients, patients with CR and ICR each had greater improvements in health status than CON, with better health status with CR than ICR. The projected benefits of CR were most pronounced in patients with baseline daily/weekly angina and not seen in those with no angina.CONCLUSIONS Among patients with CCD in ISCHEMIA, health status improved more with CR compared with ICR or CON, particularly in those with frequent angina. Anatomic and functional CR provided comparable improvements in quality of life.

AB  - A regio- and stereoselective synthesis of hitherto unexplored novel class of dispiropyrrolidine embedded with indenoquinoxaline and chromanone hybrid heterocycle has been achieved employing an eco-friendly ionic liquid assisted multicomponent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition cascade protocol. The dipolarophile, 3-(4-methoxybenzylidene)chroman-4-one reacts with non-stabilized 1,3-dipole component derived from indenoquinoxalinone and L-phenylalanine through decarboxylative cascade reaction pathway affording (2 & PRIME;S,4 & PRIME;S)-5 & PRIME;-benzyl-4 & PRIME;(4-methoxyphenyl)dispiro[chromane-3,3 & PRIME;-pyrrolidine-2 & PRIME;,11 & PRIME;'-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin]-4-one (6) as the final product. The structure of 6 was confirmed through NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses. Further, stereochemistry of the spirocompound was undoubtedly determined through single crystal XRD analysis. In the crystal structure, the O...H and N...H interactions are the most common contacts and also have great importance in molecular packing. In addition, the C...H contacts are also important in the studied crystal structure. DFT and NBO calculations were performed on this system in order to discuss its electronic and reactivity parameters. The calculated dipole moment value is 2.9238 Debye indicating a polar compound. Compound 6 was assayed for antimicrobial efficacy and found to have potential activity against eight tested microbial pathogens. Among them, E. coli ML_KSUB22 and C. albicans ML_KSUF05 were found to be highly susceptible than the other pathogens.

KW  - neural networks (NNs)
KW  - Parkinson's disease (PD)
KW  - predictive models
AB  - Freezing of gait (FoG) is a widely observed movement disorder in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Its prediction is crucial for effectively giving the cue to avoid FoG occurrence. However, present methods of prediction of FoG are inaccurate for large but practical prediction horizons (PHs). Therefore, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to predict FoG advance in time. An ensemble model consisting of two neural networks (NNs), EEGFoGNet and IMUFoGNet, was developed and tested at different PHs and ensemble weights. Moreover, the model is tested for two practical scenarios: clinical or research applications and personal uses. For clinical or research applications, stratified fivefold cross-validation was used. For personal uses, a transfer learning technique was used for learning user-specific FoG-related features. The model obtained the best accuracy of 92.1% at 1-s PH and the least accuracy of 86.2% at 5-s PH. The presented results are encouraging and show the proposed model's clinical applicability. This study will also help practitioners in comparing the efficacy of different cueing methods.

AB  - The sinonasal tract is considered a second hotspot for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related tumors in the head and neck, with HPV being identified in up to 62% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 38% of papillomas. There is limited data from geographical regions with low prevalence of high-risk (HR)-HPV on the association of HR-HPV in sinonasal neoplasms and on utility of p16 as a surrogate marker. p16 immunohistochemistry, HR-HPV mRNA ISH and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were performed on a retrospective cohort of sinonasal papillomas and SCCs. KRAS mutation analysis was done in oncocytic papillomas. p16 positivity was present in 22/142 cases (15.5%) including eight inverted papillomas, one oncocytic papilloma (OP), and 13 SCC. Among these, mRNA ISH showed HR-HPV in the OP and two SCC, while another SCC was found to harbour HPV18 by qPCR. Two HPV-associated SCCs had foci of OP. mRNA ISH was negative in all p16 negative cases. p16 immunohistochemistry showed 68% concordance with mRNA ISH, and had sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%; specificity was 67%, and positive predictive value was 14.3%. Association with HR-HPV in sinonasal papillomas and SCC is rare, and may be seen in cases demonstrating oncocytic morphology. p16 immunohistochemistry has low specificity and positive predictive value in low-prevalence populations; thus, reflex direct HR-HPV testing should be performed in p16 immunopositive cases. This two-step approach is viable in resource-limited settings, as the proportion of p16 positive cases is small.

AB  - Abrus precatorius is a poisonous plant known since ancient times. Accidental poisoning is more common due to the intake of plant seeds containing deadly abrin which is a highly toxic and a thermolabile plant toxalbumin. Abrin has also been reported to be a potential chemical agent that can be used as bioweapon in military or terrorism. Abrin is a ribosome inactivating protein that contains multiple isotoxic forms of protein subunits called chain A and B. The identification of this toxalbumin in the plant is important to determine cause of death in poisoning cases. Therefore, the present review focuses on the structure, mode of administration, tokicokinetics, extraction procedures and forensic analysis of abrin and other constituents. It is observed that most of the researchers have utilized immunological methods for the detection of plant components. This technique has proved to be more sensitive, reliable and accurate for the detection of extremely low concentrations of toxin.

AB  - Objectives: Depression in persons with epilepsy (PWE) goes undiagnosed and untreated. Despite being common, there are no direct efficacy comparisons of available antidepressants in PWE. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of Venlafaxine (VEN) and Escitalopram (ESCIT) in comorbid depression in PWE. Methods: In a single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) 90 PWE (age & GE;18 years) with mild to moderate depression, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ESCIT (5-20 mg/ -day) or VEN (37.5-150 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was to study differences in the effi-cacy, based on the change in scores of the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) at 8 weeks. Seizure frequency, QOLIE-31, adverse event profile, and medication adherence were secondary outcome measures. Results: Using the NDDI-E scale, we screened 350 PWE, 90 were enrolled. ITT analysis included all partic-ipants and the PP analysis included 40 participants to VEN group and 42 to ESCIT group. Baseline mean (& PLUSMN;SD) HAM-D scores for both groups were similar (13.53 & PLUSMN; 3.27; 13.02 & PLUSMN; 3.57). The mean difference (95% CI) on HAM-D scores at 8 weeks was found to be significant within both groups (ITT/PP-VEN: 7.75(6.75, 8.79)/7.92 (7.06, 8.78); p < 0.001, ESCIT: 8.21 (7.39, 9.03)/8.23(7.43, 9.04); p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of VEN versus ESCIT at 8 weeks. A significant improvement in QOLIE-31 index and seizure frequency was observed from baseline in both the groups. 90% of those on VEN and 92.9% of those using ESCIT adhered to the treatment at week 8. Adverse events were more in VEN group than the ESCIT group. Conclusions: This study found that HAMD scores improved significantly in the ESCIT and VEN groups, despite the fact that there was no clinically meaningful difference observed between the two groups. Trials with a larger sample size and longer duration are required to establish whether ESCIT or VEN is superior. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among all the subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been associated with the worst prognosis. Recently, for many solid tumors (including breast cancer) metabolic reprogramming has appeared as a cancer cell hallmark, and the elevated glycolytic pathway has been linked to their aggressive phenotype. In the present study, we evaluated the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2- kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) in TNBCs. Prognostic significance of PFKFB3 expression was evaluated in overall breast cancers as well as in TNBCs. PFKFB3 inhibitor (3PO potent analogue i.e., PFK15) cytotoxicity in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) was analyzed using an MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Cancer cell physiological characteristics like clonogenicity and migration were also investigated after PFK15 treatment. As fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), has been associated with increased PFK-1 activity, the effect of PFKFB3 inhibition by PFK15 was investigated on two major isoforms of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) in breast cancer, that is, phosphofructokinase-platelet type (PFKP) and phosphofructokinase-liver type (PFKL) (relevant to breast cancer). For PFKL inhibition, the siRNA approach was used. PFKFB3 expression was significantly correlated with inferior overall survival in breast cancer patients including TNBCs. PFK15 treatment in TNBC cells (i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) resulted in a decreased PFKP expression, thereby leading to reduced colony formation ability, migration rate, and extracellular lactate levels. However, to our surprise PFK15 treatment in both TNBC cells also resulted in elevated PFKL levels. Our results demonstrated that the combinatorial inhibition of PFK15 with siPFKL was more effective in TNBC cells, as it led to a decrease in colony formation ability, migration rate, extracellular lactate levels, and PFK-1 activity when compared with individual treatments. Using bona fide PFKFB3 inhibitor, that is, AZ67, we further show that AZ67 treatment to TNBC cells has no effect either on the expression of PFKP and PFKL, or on the lactate production. In summary, our present in vitro study demonstrated that 3PO derived PFK15 mechanism of action is totally different from AZ67 in TNBC cells. However, we advocate that the PFK15-mediated inhibition (along with PFKL) on the TNBCs migration, colony formation, and PFK-1 activity can be further explored for the therapeutic advantage of TNBC patients.

AB  - Post vaccination with Covaxin (BBV152), Serum from healthcare professionals of Microbiology Department at apex tertiary referral hospital of India were tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies. 70% individuals at 14-30 days, 63.1% individuals at 30-60 days but only 36.8% individuals at 60-90 days after second dose of vaccine had detectable SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific IgG antibodies. However, 80% individuals at 14-30 days, 89.4% individuals at 30-60 days while 94.7% individuals at 60-90 days after second dose of vaccine had detectable SARS-CoV-2 whole cell antigen specific IgG antibodies. Males were lacking SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific IgG antibodies in higher proportion than females and had lower index wherever detected. Age and co-morbidities were non-significant factors for post vaccination IgG response but not in breakthrough infection. 8.3% individuals developed mild COVID-19 symptoms post 14-90 days of second dose and none had severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific IgG antibodies induced by Covaxin are drastically reduced in 60-90 days among fully vaccinated individuals which could be a potential risk for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, if not severe COVID-19. It may be essential to have additional antigenic stimulations/boosters for continued protection.

AB  - The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) is an instrument to screen substance -use-related health risks. However, little is known whether the ASSIST could be further shortened while remaining psychometrically sound across different countries, languages, gender identities, and sexual-orientation-based groups. The study aimed to validate a shortened 11-item ASSIST (ASSIST-11). Using the International Sex Sur-vey data, 82,243 participants (M age = 32.39 years) across 42 countries and 26 languages completed questions from the ASSIST-11 regarding gender identity, sexual orientation, and other information. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multigroup CFA (MGCFA) evaluated the ASSIST-11's structure and tested measurement invariance across groups. Cronbach's & alpha; and McDonald's & omega; were used to examine the internal consistency. Cohen's d and independent t-tests were used to examine known-group validity. The ASSIST-11 was unidimen-sional across countries, languages, age groups, gender identities (i.e., men, women, and gender-diverse in-dividuals), and sexual orientations (i.e., heterosexual and sexual minority individuals). Cronbach's & alpha; was 0.63 and McDonald's & omega; was 0.68 for the ASSIST-11. Known-group validity was supported by Cohen's d (range be-tween 0.23 and 0.40) with significant differences (p-values<0.001). The ASSIST-11 is a modified instrument with a unidimensional factor structure across different languages, age groups, countries, gender identities, and sexual orientations. The low internal consistency of the ASSIST-11 might be acceptable as it assesses a broad concept (i. e., use of several different substances). Healthcare providers and researchers may use the ASSIST-11 to quickly assess substance-use information from general populations and evaluate the need to follow up with more detailed questions about substance use.

AB  - Cancer cell lines play a crucial role as invaluable models in cancer research, facilitating the examination of cancer progression as well as the advancement of diagnostics and treatments. While they may not perfectly replicate the original tumor, they generally exhibit similar characteristics. Low-passage cancer cell lines are generally preferred due to their closer resemblance to the original tumor, as long-term culturing can alter the genetic and molecular profiles of a cell line thereby highlighting the importance of monitoring the passage number (PN). Variations in proliferation, migration, gene expression, and drug sensitivity can be linked to PN differences. PN can also influence DNA methylation levels, metabolic profiles, and the expression of genes/or proteins in cancer cell lines. When conducting research on cancer cell lines, it is crucial for researchers to carefully select the appropriate PN to maintain consistency and reliability of results. Moreover, to ensure dependability and replicability, scientists ought to actively track the growth, migration, and gene/or protein profiles of cancer cell lines at specific PNs. This approach enables the identification of the most suitable range of PNs for experiments, guaranteeing consistent and precise results. Additionally, such efforts serve to minimize disparities and uphold the integrity of research. In this review, we have laid out recommendations for laboratories to overcome these PN discrepancies when working with cancer cell lines.

AB  - BackgroundAsian Indians are at higher risk of cardiometabolic disease compared to other ethnic groups, and the age of onset is typically younger. Cardiac structure and function are poorly characterized in this ethnic group. In this study, we describe image-acquisition methods and the reproducibility of measurements and detailed echocardiography characteristics in two large Indian population-based cohorts (the New Delhi and Vellore Birth Cohorts) from India. MethodsThe IndEcho study captured transthoracic echocardiographic measurements of cardiac structure and function from 2,322 men and women aged 43-50 years. M-mode measurements in the parasternal long axis (PLAX) and 2-dimensional (2D) short axis recordings at the mitral valve, mid-papillary and apical level were recorded. Apical 2D recordings of two- three- and four-chamber (2C, 3C and 4C) views and Doppler images (colour, pulsed and continuous) were recorded in cine-loop format. Left ventricular (LV) mass, LV hypertrophy, and indices of LV systolic and diastolic function were derived. ResultsEchocardiographic measurements showed good/excellent technical reproducibility. Hetero-geneity across sites, sex and rural/urban differences in cardiac structure and function were observed. Overall, this cohort of South Asian Indians had smaller LV mass and normal systolic and diastolic function when compared with published data on other Asian Indians and the West, (LV mass indexed for body surface area: Delhi men: 68 g/m(2), women 63.9; Vellore men: 65.8, women 61.6) but were within ethnic-specific reference ranges. The higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and hypertension is reflected by the higher proportion of LV remodelling and lesser hypertrophy. ConclusionsOur study adds to scarce population-based echocardiographic data for mid-life Asian Indians. Compared to published literature on other ethnic groups, the Asian Indian heart is characterised by smaller cardiac dimensions and normal range systolic and diastolic function on a background of a high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease at a relatively young age. This data will form the basis for further analyses of lifecourse, metabolic and body composition predictors of cardiac structure and function, and echocardiographic predictors of future mortality.

AB  - There is an unmet need for tools that permit diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB) that are affordable, low-tech, and can differentiate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) from non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). In this study, we have developed a strip-based assay to detect the activity of a unique Carbapenem Resistance Factor A (CrfA) enzyme present only in M.tb. The strip comprises of PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane that has an immobilized anti-CrfA antibody to capture the CrfA enzyme from M.tb lysate. Lysate of mycobacteria is applied to the strip, washed, and incubated in the presence of chromogenic reporter dye which is a substrate for CrfA. A change in the color of the dye that is readily visible to the naked eye is the readout. We evaluated lysates from M.tb and various NTMs namely, M. abscessus, M. chelonae, M. avium, M. obuense, M. paraintracellulare, M. kansasi, including the patient-derived sputum samples. The strip assay selectively identified only those samples containing M.tb. Based on this evidence, this new assay enables the identification and differentiation of M.tb from NTMs in patient sputum samples. As this tool can be simple to use, therefore has the potential to serve the unmet need for diagnosis of TB and NTM infections in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Iodoform formulations are used as packing material following the surgical removal of jaw lesions. The purpose of this review was to explore the evidence and efficacy of iodoform-based dressings. We have systematically reviewed published articles according to the PRIS-MA statement. The search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and the Cochrane Library database for articles mentioning the use of iodoform as dressing material for jaw lesions from January 2000 to March 2022. Finally, 92 studies were included. A total of 386 patients whose ages ranged from five months to 86 years (male n = 180, female n = 117). Different formulations of iodoform used were BIPP (n = 67), Whitehead's varnish (n = 17), iodoform (n = 7) and, iodine (n = 1) for its antiseptic properties. An iodoform impregnated gauze pack was changed once a week, most commonly, for a stipulated duration, until complete healing of the cavity. In the present review, iodoform was used, most commonly, in pathological cavities following surgical treatment of ameloblastoma and odon-togenic keratocyst. Toxicity was reported in two studies. Based on the current review, iodoform is relatively safe and can be used in the management of extensive jaw lesions in which secondary healing is expected. Prospective and randomised control trials are recommended to assess the efficacy of various formulations and to delineate the timeframe for patient compliance. & COPY; 2023 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Background & Aims: Numerous studies have evaluated the role of human albumin (HA) in managing various liver cirrhosis -related complications. However, their conclusions remain partially controversial, probably because HA was evaluated in different settings, including indications, patient characteristics, and dosage and duration of therapy.Methods: Thirty-three investigators from 19 countries with expertise in the management of liver cirrhosis-related compli-cations were invited to organise an International Special Interest Group. A three-round Delphi consensus process was con-ducted to complete the international position statement on the use of HA for treatment of liver cirrhosis-related complications.Results: Twelve clinically significant position statements were proposed. Short-term infusion of HA should be recommended for the management of hepatorenal syndrome, large volume paracentesis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in liver cirrhosis. Its effects on the prevention or treatment of other liver cirrhosis-related complications should be further elucidated.Long-term HA administration can be considered in specific settings. Pulmonary oedema should be closely monitored as a potential adverse effect in cirrhotic patients receiving HA infusion.Conclusions: Based on the currently available evidence, the international position statement suggests the potential benefits of HA for the management of multiple liver cirrhosis-related complications and summarises its safety profile. However, its optimal timing and infusion strategy remain to be further elucidated.Impact and implications: Thirty-three investigators from 19 countries proposed 12 position statements on the use of human albumin (HA) infusion in liver cirrhosis-related complications. Based on current evidence, short-term HA infusion should be recommended for the management of HRS, LVP, and SBP; whereas, long-term HA administration can be considered in the setting where budget and logistical issues can be resolved. However, pulmonary oedema should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients who receive HA infusion.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer is a multifactorial disease which involves number of molecular factors that are critically involved in proliferation of breast cancer cells. MEN1 gene that is traditionally known for its germline mutations in neuroendocrine tumors is associated with high risk of developing breast cancer in females with MEN1 syndrome. However, the paradoxical role of MEN1 is reported in sporadic breast cancer cases. The previous studies indicate the functional significance of MEN1 in regulating breast cells proliferation but its relevance in development and progression of breast cancer is still not known. Our study targets to find the role of MEN1 gene aberration and its clinical significance in breast cancer. MethodsBreast tumor and adjacent normal tissue of 142 sporadic breast cancer patients were collected at the time of surgery. The expression analysis of MEN1 mRNA and protein was done through RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Further to find the genetic and epigenetic alterations, automated sequencing and MS-PCR was performed respectively. Correlation between our findings and clinical parameters was determined using appropriate statistical tests. ResultsMEN1 expression was found to be significantly increased in the breast tumor tissue with its predominant nuclear localization. The elevated expression of MEN1 mRNA (63.38% cases) and protein (60.56% cases) exhibited a significant association with ER status of the patients. Most of the cases had unmethylated (53.52%) MEN1 promoter region, which can be a key factor responsible for dysregulated expression of MEN1 in breast cancer cases. Our findings also revealed the significant association of MEN1 mRNA overexpression with Age and lymph node status of the patients. ConclusionOur results indicate upregulated expression of MEN1 in sporadic breast cancer patients and it could be critically associated with development and advancement of the disease.

AB  - Background Histologically assessed liver fibrosis stage has prognostic significance in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is accepted as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials for non-cirrhotic NAFLD. Our aim was to compare the prognostic performance of non-invasive tests with liver histology in patients with NAFLD. Methods This was an individual participant data meta-analysis of the prognostic performance of histologically assessed fibrosis stage (F0-4), liver stiffness measured by vibration-controlled transient elastography (LSM-VCTE), fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) in patients with NAFLD. The literature was searched for a previously published systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging and simple non-invasive tests and updated to Jan 12, 2022 for this study. Studies were identified through PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL, and authors were contacted for individual participant data, including outcome data, with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, or cirrhosis complications (ie, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or progression to a MELD score >= 15). We calculated aggregated survival curves for trichotomised groups and compared them using stratified log-rank tests (histology: F0-2 vs F3 vs F4; LSM: <10 vs 10 to <20 vs >= 20 kPa; FIB-4: <1<middle dot>3 vs 1<middle dot>3 to <= 2<middle dot>67 vs >2<middle dot>67; NFS: <-1<middle dot>455 vs -1<middle dot>455 to <= 0<middle dot>676 vs >0<middle dot>676), calculated areas under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (tAUC), and performed Cox proportional-hazards regression to adjust for confounding. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022312226.Findings Of 65 eligible studies, we included data on 2518 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD from 25 studies (1126 [44<middle dot>7%] were female, median age was 54 years [IQR 44-63), and 1161 [46<middle dot>1%] had type 2 diabetes). After a median follow-up of 57 months [IQR 33-91], the composite endpoint was observed in 145 (5<middle dot>8%) patients. Stratified log-rank tests showed significant differences between the trichotomised patient groups (p<0<middle dot>0001 for all comparisons). The tAUC at 5 years were 0<middle dot>72 (95% CI 0<middle dot>62-0<middle dot>81) for histology, 0<middle dot>76 (0<middle dot>70-0<middle dot>83) for LSM-VCTE, 0<middle dot>74 (0<middle dot>64-0<middle dot>82) for FIB-4, and 0<middle dot>70 (0<middle dot>63-0<middle dot>80) for NFS. All index tests were significant predictors of the primary outcome after adjustment for confounders in the Cox regression.Interpretation Simple non-invasive tests performed as well as histologically assessed fibrosis in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with NAFLD and could be considered as alternatives to liver biopsy in some cases.

AB  - Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare primary form of ciliopathy, with heterogeneous clinical and genetic presentation is characterized by rod cone dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, urogenital abnormalities, and cognitive impairment. Here, we delineate the genetic profile in a cohort of 108 BBS patients from India by targeted gene sequencing-based approach for a panel of ciliopathy (including BBS) and other inherited retinal disease genes. We report here a higher frequency of BBS10 and BBS1 gene variations. A different spectrum of variations including a putatively novel gene TSPOAP1, for BBS was identified. Increased percentage frequency of digenic variants (36%) in the disease cohort, role of modifiers in familial cases are some of the salient observations in this work. This study appends the knowledge of BBS genetics pertaining to patients from India. We observed a different molecular epidemiology of BBS patients in this study cohort compared to other reports, which emphasizes the need for molecular testing in affected patients.

KW  - Cyclophosphamide
KW  - Kawasaki disease
AB  - Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a medium-vessel vasculitis presenting with cutaneous and multisystem involvement with considerable morbidity. The necrotizing vasculitis in PAN typically involves renal, celiac, and mesenteric vascular beds. Coronary artery involvement is a characteristic feature of Kawasaki disease, another medium-vessel vasculitis; however, it has been rarely reported with PAN. Here, we present 2 cases with PAN involving coronaries mimicking Kawasaki disease. A 3.5-year-old boy with classical features of Kawasaki disease with giant coronary aneurysm refractory to IVIg, methylprednisolone, infliximab presented with persistent rise in inflammatory markers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed celiac artery branches stenosis and beading suggestive of PAN. Another 2-year-old girl presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, and distension. She had hypertension, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly on examination. Echocardiography revealed multiple coronary aneurysms and DSA revealed numerous renal artery aneurysms. Coronary aneurysm although is a rare presentation of childhood PAN, and can mimic Kawasaki disease. Although both are medium-vessel vasculitis differentiation between these two entities is pivotal, as there are differences in treatment modalities, duration of immunomodulatory therapy, and the outcome. This manuscript describes the salient differences which can help differentiate PAN masquerading as Kawasaki disease at initial presentation.

AB  - Background Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused by an autoimmune attack by cytotoxic T-cells. The clinical course is variable, with episodes of remission and exacerbation. A clinicopathological scoring system for cutaneous LP is not available for effectively assessing disease severity and monitoring treatment response. This study was designed with the aim of proposing an objective and reproducible scoring system, comprising histopathological features of active and chronic disease, and to correlate these scores with clinical morphology groups.Methodology This is a retrospective study of 200 cases of cutaneous LP, which were categorized into five clinical groups (I-V) at the time of biopsy. The corresponding histopathological feature was assigned a score based on feature of active and chronic disease. Individual scores were summated to calculate a histopathological index (index [AI] and chronicity index [CI]). The comparison of indices between various clinical groups was performed by Mann-Whitney U test.Results The median AI was lowest (1) for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (clinical group I) and highest (7) for the bullous group (clinical group IV). The median CI (7) was highest for the scarring group (clinical group V). The difference between median AI of clinical group I (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and rest of the groups (clinical groups II, III, IV, and V) was statistically significant (p value <0.05).Conclusion We present this clinico-histopathological scoring system as a reliable and facile method of assessing the activity and severity of LP.

AB  - The emergence of various deep learning approaches in diagnostic medical image segmentation has made machines capable of accomplishing human-level accuracy. However, the generalizability of these architectures across patients from different countries, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from distinct vendors, and varying imaging conditions remains questionable. In this work, we propose a translatable deep learning framework for diagnostic segmentation of cine MRI scans. This study aims to render the available SOTA (state-of-the-art) architectures domain-shift invariant by utilizing the heterogeneity of multi-sequence cardiac MRI. To develop and test our approach, we curated a diverse group of public datasets and a dataset obtained from private source. We evaluated 3 SOTA CNN (Convolution neural network) architectures i.e., U-Net, Attention-U-Net, and Attention-Res-U-Net. These architectures were first trained on a combination of three different cardiac MRI sequences. Next, we examined the M&M (multi-center & mutli-vendor) challenge dataset to investigate the effect of different training sets on translatability. The U-Net architecture, trained on the multi-sequence dataset, proved to be the most generalizable across multiple datasets during validation on unseen domains. This model attained mean dice scores of 0.81, 0.85, and 0.83 for myocardial wall segmentation after testing on unseen MyoPS (Myocardial Pathology Segmentation) 2020 dataset, AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) dataset and M&M dataset, respectively. Our framework achieved Pearson's correlation values of 0.98, 0.99, and 0.95 between the observed and predicted parameters of end diastole volume, end systole volume, and ejection fraction, respectively, on the unseen Indian population dataset.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the deadliest subtypes of breast cancer (BC) for its high aggressiveness, heterogeneity, and hypoxic nature. Based on biological and clinical observations the TNBC related mortality is very high worldwide. Emerging studies have clearly demonstrated that hypoxia regulates the critical metabolic, developmental, and survival pathways in TNBC, which include glycolysis and angiogenesis. Alterations to these pathways accelerate the cancer stem cells (CSCs) enrichment and immune escape, which further lead to tumor invasion, migration, and metastasis. Beside this, hypoxia also manipulates the epigenetic plasticity and DNA damage response (DDR) to syndicate TNBC survival and its progression. Hypoxia fundamentally creates the low oxygen condition responsible for the alteration in Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1alpha (HIF-1 & alpha;) signaling within the tumor microenvironment, allowing tumors to survive and making them resistant to various therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for society to establish target-based therapies that overcome the resistance and limitations of the current treatment plan for TNBC. In this review article, we have thoroughly discussed the plausible significance of HIF-1 & alpha; as a target in various therapeutic regimens such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy, adjuvant therapy photodynamic therapy, adoptive cell therapy, combination therapies, antibody drug conjugates and cancer vaccines. Further, we also reviewed here the intrinsic mechanism and existing issues in targeting HIF-1 & alpha; while improvising the current therapeutic strategies. This review highlights and discusses the future perspectives and the major alternatives to overcome TNBC resistance by targeting hypoxia-induced signaling.

AB  - ObjectivesGlasgow Coma Scale-Pupils (GCS-P) score has been found to be strongly related to in-hospital mortality in retrospective studies. We hypothesized that GCS-P would be better prognosticator than Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).MethodsIn this prospective, multicentric, observational study, GCS and GCS-P scores were noted in adult TBI patients at ICU admission. Demographic variables, relevant clinical history, clinical/radiological findings and ICU complications were also noted. Extended Glasgow Outcome scale was noted at hospital discharge and at 6 months post-injury. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate the odds for poor outcome adjusted for covariates. Sensitivity, specificity, area under curve (AUC) and odds ratio are reported for poor outcome at estimated cutoff point.ResultsA total of 573 patients were included in this study. The predictive power for mortality, shown by the AUC, was 0.81 [95% CI: 0.77-0.85] for GCS and 0.81 [95% CI: 0.77-0.86] for GCS-P score, both being comparable. Similarly, the predictive ability for outcome at discharge and 6 months, the AUC-ROC for both GCS and GCS-P were comparable.ConclusionsGCS-P is a good predictor of mortality and poor outcome. However, the predictive performance of GCS and GCS-P for in-hospital mortality and functional outcome at discharge and at 6 months remains comparable.

AB  - Synovial sarcoma (SS) is one of the commonest non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma with limited treatment options in the relapsed and advanced settings. The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has demonstrated its role predominantly in leiomyosarcoma and pleomorphic sarcomas but has not been prospectively studied in SS. This trial assesses the efficacy, tolerability and quality of life (QoL) with this regimen in metastatic/unresectable locally advanced relapsed SS.Patients and methods This was a single-arm, two-stage, phase II, investigator-initiated interventional study among patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced SS who had progressed after at least one line of chemotherapy. Gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 8 were administered intravenously every 21 days. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free rate (PFR); overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), safety and quality of life (QoL) constituted the secondary endpoints.Results Twenty-two patients were enrolled between March 2020 and September 2021 and the study had to be closed early due to slow accrual. The study population comprised of 18 (81.8%) patients with metastatic disease and 4 (18.2%) patients with locally advanced, unresectable disease. The most common primary sites of disease were extremity in 15 (68%) and the median number of lines of prior therapies received was 1 (range 1-4). 3-month PFR was 45.4% (95% CI 24.8-66.1) and ORR was 4.5%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months (95% CI 2.3-3.6) and median OS was 14 months (95% CI 8.9-19.0). 7 (31.8%) patients experienced grade 3 or worse toxicities, including anemia (18%), neutropenia (9%) and mucositis (9%). QoL analysis demonstrated significant decline in certain functional and symptom scales, while financial and global health scales remained stable.Conclusion This is the first prospective study on the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel performed specifically in patients with advanced, relapsed SS. Although the accrual of patients could not be completed as planned, the therapy did produce clinically meaningful outcomes and met its primary endpoint of 3-month PFR. This result, along with the manageable toxicity profile and stable global health status on QoL analysis, should encourage further studies.

AB  - Traditional cancer treatments use nonspecific drugs and monoclonal antibodies to target tumor cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, however, leverages the immune system's T-cells to recognize and attack tumor cells. T-cells are isolated from patients and modified to target tumor-associated antigens. CAR-T therapy has achieved FDA approval for treating blood cancers like B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, large B-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma by targeting CD-19 and B-cell maturation antigens. Bi-specific chimeric antigen receptors may contribute to mitigating tumor antigen escape, but their efficacy could be limited in cases where certain tumor cells do not express the targeted antigens. Despite success in blood cancers, CAR-T technology faces challenges in solid tumors, including lack of reliable tumor-associated antigens, hypoxic cores, immunosuppressive tumor environments, enhanced reactive oxygen species, and decreased T-cell infiltration. To overcome these challenges, current research aims to identify reliable tumor-associated antigens and develop cost-effective, tumor microenvironment-specific CAR-T cells. This review covers the evolution of CAR-T therapy against various tumors, including hematological and solid tumors, highlights challenges faced by CAR-T cell therapy, and suggests strategies to overcome these obstacles, such as utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and artificial intelligence to optimize clinical-grade CAR-T cells.

AB  - Despite a decrease in publication, case reports remain essential in medical literature as they offer detailed descriptions of individual patient cases and valuable insights for future management. These reports adhere to a standardized structure comprising sections such as abstract, introduction, case report, discussion, and conclusion. Obtaining informed consent and adhering to guidelines is essential. Case reports contribute to evidence-based medicine by detecting new therapies and adverse events. They also facilitate clear reporting, guideline adherence, and mentorship programs. These reports are vital for documenting rare occurrences, assisting clinicians in timely management, and communicating novel information to busy medical professionals. Following case report guidelines ensures comprehensive and standardized reporting, enhancing the acceptance and quality of case reports, and advancing medical knowledge.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has placed severe demands on healthcare facilities across the world, and in several countries, makeshift COVID-19 centres have been operationalised to handle patient overflow. In developing countries such as India, the public healthcare system (PHS) is organised as a hierarchical network with patient flows from lower-tier primary health centres (PHC) to mid-tier community health centres (CHC) and downstream to district hospitals (DH). In this study, we demonstrate how a network-based modelling and simulation approach utilising generic modelling principles can (a) quantify the extent to which the existing facilities in the PHS can effectively cope with the forecasted COVID-19 caseload; and (b) inform decisions on capacity at makeshift COVID-19 Care Centres (CCC) to handle patient overflows. We apply the approach to an empirical study of a local PHS comprising ten PHCs, three CHCs, one DH and one makeshift CCC. Our work demonstrates how the generic modelling approach finds extensive use in the development of simulations of multi-tier facility networks that may contain multiple instances of generic simulation models of facilities at each network tier. Further, our work demonstrates how multi-tier healthcare facility network simulations can be leveraged for capacity planning in health crises.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a heme containing mammalian enzyme which uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to catalyze the conversion of substrates into oxidized products. LPO is found in body fluids and tissues such as milk, saliva, tears, mucosa and other body secretions. The previous structural studies have shown that LPO converts substrates, thiocyanate (SCN-) and iodide (I-) ions into oxidized products, hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) and hypoiodite (IO-) ions respectively. We report here a new structure of the complex of LPO with an oxidized product, nitrite (NO2- ). This product was generated from NO using the two step reaction of LPO by adding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the solution of LPO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 as the first step. In the second step, NO gas was added to the above mixture. This was crystallized using 20% (w/v) PEG-3350 and 0.2 M ammonium iodide at pH 6.8. The structure determination showed the presence of NO2- ion in the distal heme cavity of the substrate binding site of LPO. The structure also showed that the propionate group which is linked to pyrrole ring D of the heme moiety was disordered. Similarly, the side chain of Asp108, which is covalently linked to heme moiety, was also split into two components. As a result of these changes, the conformation of the side chain of Arg255 was altered allowing it to form new interactions with the disordered carboxylic group of propionate moiety. These structural changes are indicative of an intermediate state in the catalytic reaction pathway of LPO.

AB  - BackgroundAdequate reconstruction of skull base following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery is the most crucial step in reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality. Although, the success rate of traditional nasoseptal flap is very high, specific surgical scenarios preclude its use. A variety of vascularised endonasal and tunnelled scalp flaps have been described in the literature to address such situations. Posterior pedicle inferior turbinate flap (PPITF) is one such locally available vascularised flap.MethodsTwo patients with recurrent CSF leak following endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma were included. The nasoseptal flap was not available in both patients due to previous surgery. Hence, a PPITF based on the posterolateral nasal artery, a branch of sphenopalatine artery, was harvested and used for skull base reconstruction.ResultsIn both patients, CSF leak subsided in the immediate postoperative period. In one patient, sensorium improved and was subsequently discharged in stable condition. Other patient succumbed to meningitis in the postoperative period.ConclusionsThe PPITF is a valuable alternative to the conventional nasoseptal flap when the latter is not available and it is very important for an endoscopic skull base surgeon to be familiar with the technique of harvesting and using the PPITF.

AB  - In India, the number of older adults is steadily increasing and expected to reach around 200 million by 2030. Along with demographic change, India is experiencing a shift in family structure from multi-generational to nuclear families, affecting the social and psychological support available to older adults. The majority of hematological malignancies are diagnosed after the age of 60 years. Multiple issues associated with ageing, denoted as geriatric impairments, adversely affect the care of patients with cancer. Geriatric assessment and management is conspicuously underutilized and missing from the medical education curriculum in developing countries including India. Geriatric assessments may provide valuable information for the care of older adults with hematological malignancies, but incorporating geriatrics into the care of older patients with cancer in India will require knowledge of different approaches and consideration of the local healthcare context. In this article we will discuss the distinctive considerations in caring for older adults with hematological malignancies in India and to examine the unmet needs, challenges, and opportunities in improving the care of this population in the Indian context.

AB  - Introduction: Candida auris is a notorious pathogen capable of forming biofilms on devices as well as host tissues, often culminating in infections. We evaluated characteristics of infections and the methods to diagnose C. auris over a period of three years in a tertiary care hospital. Methods: Patients admitted between 2018 and 2020, who had candidemia due to C. auris were included in the study. Identification was performed using HiCromeTM Candida Differential Agar, Vitek 2 (BioMe ⠁rieux, Inc., Marcy-l'Etoile, France) and MALDI-TOF, Vitek-MS. Identification was confirmed by detection of rDNA region covering part of 5.8S, entire of ITS2, and part of 28S by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Biofilm formation was assessed by crystal violet staining. Results: Presence of central line and broad spectrum antimicrobials were noted in all patients whereas total parenteral nutrition was given in 82.1% of these patients. Identification by Vitek2 v8.1 correlated with MALDI-TOF MS. PCR products of length 163 bp were obtained in all isolates as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The biofilm quantity measured as A560 of the twenty-eight C. auris isolates ranged from 0.16 to 0.80 compared to C. albicans. Conclusions: C. auris can be identified by PCR targeting specific rDNA region. Biofilm formation and quantification can be achieved by growing C. auris isolates in Mueller-Hinton broth over a duration of 48 h.

AB  - ObjectiveEndogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a known cause of secondary osteoporosis. Vertebral fractures (VFs) in endogenous CS may occur despite normal bone mineral density (BMD). Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a relatively new, non-invasive technique to assess bone microarchitecture. The objective of our study was to analyse the BMD and bone microarchitecture using TBS in endogenous CS and compare it with a group of age and sex-matched healthy controls, and also analyse the factors predicting BMD and TBS. DesignCross-sectional study of cases and controls. Patients and measurementsWe included 40 female patients with overt endogenous CS, out of which 32 were adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent CS and 8 were ACTH-independent. We also included 40 healthy, female controls. Both patients and controls were subjected to an assessment of biochemical parameters and BMD and TBS. ResultsPatients with endogenous CS had significantly lower BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip and significantly lower TBS than healthy controls (all p < .001), while no significant difference was noted in the distal radius BMD (p = .055). In endogenous CS, a large proportion of patients, n = 13 (32.5%) had normal BMD for age (BMD Z-score & GE; -2.0) with low TBS (L-1-L-4 TBS & LE; 1.34). TBS correlated negatively with HbA1c (p = .006), and positively with serum T4 (p = .027). ConclusionTBS should be considered an important complementary tool in addition to BMD for the routine assessment of skeletal health in CS.

AB  - Background: As there is a lack of comprehensive literature regarding the molecular environment of the human brain emphasizing on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) following high impact brain trauma. The protagonist of OPCs post severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) provides a significant thrust towards estimating time elapsed since trauma as well as developing novel therapeutic approaches. The present study was carried out to study post trauma alterations pertaining to myelin sheath and oligodendrocyte response with survival time.Materials and methods: In the present study, victims (both male and female) of sTBI (n = 64) were recruited and contrasted with age and gender matched controls (n = 12). Post mortem brain samples from corpus callosum and grey white matter interface were collected during autopsy examination. Extent of myelin degradation and response of OPC markers Olig-2 and PDGFR-a were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. STATA 14.0 statistical software was used for data analysis with P-value<0.05 considered statistically significant.Results: Timewise qualitative correlation with extent of demyelination performed using LFB-PAS/IHC-MBP, IHC Olig-2 and mRNA expression revealed tendency towards remyelination in both corpus callosum and grey white matter interface. Number of Olig-2 positive cells was significantly higher in sTBI group as compared to control group (P-value: 0.0001). Moreover, mRNA expression studies of Olig-2 showed significant upregulation in sTBI patients. mRNA expression of Olig-2 and PDGFR-a in sTBI patients showed significant variation with respect to survival time (p value:0.0001).Conclusion: Detailed assessment of post TBI changes implementing various immunohistochemical and molecular techniques shall potentially reveal intriguing and important inferences in medicolegal practices and neurotherapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic modalities including chemo, radiation, immunotherapy, etc. induce PD-L1 expression that facilitates the adaptive immune resistance to evade the antitumour immune response. IFN-gamma and hypoxia are some of the crucial inducers of PD-L1 expression in tumour and systemic microenvironment which regulate the expression of PD-L1 via various factors including HIF-1a and MAPK signalling. Hence, inhibition of these factors is crucial to regulate the induced PD-L1 expression and to achieve a durable therapeutic outcome by averting the immunosuppression.
   METHODS: B16-F10 melanoma, 4T1 breast carcinoma, and GL261 glioblastoma murine models were established to investigate the in vivo antitumour efficacy of Ponatinib. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA were performed to determine the effect of Ponatinib on the immunomodulation of tumour microenvironment (TME). CTL assay and flow cytometry were such as p-MAPK, p-JNK, p-Erk, and cleaved caspase-3 carried out to evaluate the systemic immunity induced by Ponatinib. RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were used to determine the mechanism of PD-L1 regulation by Ponatinib. Antitumour immunity induced by Ponatinib were compared with Dasatinib.
   RESULTS: Here, Ponatinib treatment delayed the growth of tumours by inhibiting PD-L1 and modulating TME. It also downregulated the level of PD-L1 downstream signalling molecules. Ponatinib enhanced the CD8 T cell infiltration, regulated Th1/Th2 ratio and depleted tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) in TME. It induced a favourable systemic antitumour immunity by enhancing CD8 T cell population, tumour specific CTL activity, balancing the Th1/Th2 ratio and lowering PD-L1 expression. Ponatinib inhibited FoxP3 expression in tumour and spleen. RNA sequencing data revealed that Ponatinib treatment downregulated the genes related to transcription including HIF-1a. Further mechanistic studies showed that it inhibited the IFN-gamma and hypoxia induced PD-L1 expression via regulating HIF-1a. Dasatinib was used as control to prove that Ponatinib induced antitumour immunity is via PD-L1 inhibition mediated T cell activation.
   CONCLUSIONS: RNA sequencing data along with rigorous in vitro and in vivo studies revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which Ponatinib can inhibit the induced PD-L1 levels via regulating HIF-1a expression which leads to modulation of tumour microenvironment. Thus, our study provides a novel therapeutic insight of Ponatinib for the treatment of solid tumours where it can be used alone or in combination with other drugs which are known to induce PD-L1 expression and generate adaptive resistance.

AB  - Objectives: The indications, timing, and results of the so-called "one-and-a-half ventricle repair", as a surgical alternative to the creation of the Fontan circulation, or high-risk biventricular repair, currently remain nebulous. We aimed to clarify these issues. Methods: We reviewed a total of 201 investigations, assessing selection of candidates, the need for atrial septal fenestration, the fate of an unligated azygos vein and free pulmonary regurgitation, the concerns regarding reverse pulsatile flow in the superior caval vein, the growth potential and function of the subpulmonary ventricle, and the role of the superior cavopulmonary connections as an interstage procedure prior to biventricular repair, or as a salvage procedure. We also assessed subsequent eligibility for conversion to biventricular repair and long-term functional results. Results: Reported operative mortalities ranged from 3% to 20%, depending on the era of surgical repair with 7% risk of complications due to a pulsatile superior caval vein, up to one-third incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias, and a small risk of anastomotic takedown of the superior cavopulmonary connection. Actuarial survival was between 80% and 90% at 10 years, with two-thirds of patients in good shape after 20 years. We found no reported instances of plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy, or hepatic cirrhosis. Conclusions: The so-called "one-and-a-half ventricular repair", which is better described as production of one-and-a-half circulations can be performed as a definitive palliative procedure with an acceptable risk similar to that of conversion to the Fontan circulation. The operation reduces the surgical risk for biventricular repair and reverses the Fontan paradox.

AB  - Introduction: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, progressive, and life-threatening form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) which is caused by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway (AP). Complement inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy in aHUS, though current therapies require intravenous administration and increase the risk of infection by encapsulated organisms, including meningococcal infection. Further studies are required to define the optimal duration of existing therapies, and to identify new agents that are convenient for long-term administration. Iptacopan (LNP023) is an oral, first-in-class, highly potent, proximal AP inhibitor that specifically binds factor B (FB). In phase 2 studies of IgA nephropathy, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and C3 glomerulopathy, iptacopan inhibited the AP, showed clinically relevant benefits, and was well tolerated. Iptacopan thus has the potential to become an effective and safe treatment for aHUS, with the convenience of oral administration. Methods: Alternative Pathway Phase III to Evaluate LNP023 in aHUS (APPELHUS; NCT04889430) is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in patients (N 1/4 50) with primary complement-mediated aHUS naive to complement inhibitor therapy (including anti-C5). Eligible patients must have evidence of TMA (platelet count <150 x 109/l, lactate dehydrogenase >_1.5 x upper limit of normal, hemoglobin # lower limit of normal, serum creatinine >_ upper limit of normal) and will receive iptacopan 200 mg twice daily. The primary objective is to assess the proportion of patients achieving complete TMA response without the use of plasma exchange or infusion or anti-C5 antibody during 26 weeks of iptacopan treatment. Conclusion: APPELHUS will determine if iptacopan is safe and efficacious in patients with aHUS.

AB  - Despite consensus on universal screening of women at 24-28 weeks for a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, controversy remains on an appropriate criterion. The study is aimed to find out the sensitivity and specificity of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) criteria compared to the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria for diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). A meta-analysis of studies comparing DIPSI as an index test to IADPSG as the reference test for diagnosing GDM was carried out. A total of 8 comparative studies were included. Pooled analysis showed a sensitivity of 0.44 [0.29 to 0.60] and specificity of 0.97 [0.94 to 0.98], which means the index test DIPSI will correctly identify only 44% of the subjects who have the disease (GDM positive) but it will also fail to identify 56% of the GDM positive subjects. Derek's funnel graph revealed fewerchances of publication bias. Though convenient, DIPSI criteria was not found to be sensitive enough for a diagnosis of GDM and missed an opportunity to improve pregnancy and subsequent long-term outcomes for a substantial number of women. Further studies should focus on comparing pregnancy outcomes for the two criteria, so that decision to adopt any criteria is more evidence-based.& COPY; 2023 Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

AB  - Intein enzymes catalyze the splicing of their flanking polypeptide chains and have found tremendous biotechnological applications. Their terminal residues form the catalytic core and participate in the splicing reaction. Hence, the neighboring N- and C-terminal extein residues influence the catalytic rate. As these extein residues vary depending on the substrate identity, we tested the influence of 20 amino acids at these sites in the Spl DnaX intein and observed significant variation of spliced product as well as N- and C-terminus cleavage product formation. We investigated the dependence of these reactions on the extein residues by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on eight extein variants, and found that the conformational sampling of the active-site residues of the intein enzyme differed among these extein variants. We found that the extein variants that sample higher population of near-attack conformers (NACs) of the active-site residues undergo higher product formation in our activity assays. Ground state conformers that closely resemble the transition state are referred to as NACs. Very good correlation was observed between the NAC populations from the MD simulations of eight extein variants and the corresponding product formation from our activity assays. Furthermore, this molecular detail enabled us to elucidate the mechanistic roles of several conserved active-site residues in the splicing reaction. Overall, this study shows that the catalytic power of Spl DnaX intein enzyme, and most likely other inteins, depends on the efficiency of formation of NACs in the ground state, which is further modulated by the extein residues.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection has an adverse effect on the functioning of various respiratory and hematopoietic cells in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) resulting from ultrastructural alterations. These ultrastructural changes were directly corroborated to understand the altered function of these cells. These changes have been sparingly reported and it is important for understanding the biology of COVID-19. We have reported various ultrastructural alterations of ciliated epithelium, type II pneumocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils individually from the BALF of patients with severe COVID-19. Ultrastructural alterations depend on various conditions such as age, immunity, associated comorbidities, disease severity, and medication received by patients. The ciliated epithelium mostly contained viral-containing compartments, horseshoe-shaped mitochondria, necrosis, and double-membrane vesicles. Type II pneumocyte cells showed cytoplasmic vacuolization, loss of lamellar bodies, and the formation of viral inclusion bodies. The alveolar macrophages displayed increased size and number of phagocytic vacuoles containing viral particles (phagosomes) and vacuolated cytoplasm. Neutrophils showed cytoplasmic granularity, vacuolization, and the presence of extracellular traps. This study provides important insights into the cellular and morphological changes associated with COVID-19 in BALF cells.

AB  - Background. Anaemia is a serious public health problem. It is the second-commonest contributing factor to years lost by adolescents to disability and death. Targeting adolescent girls will allow a window of opportunity to correct their nutritional health and improve their obstetric outcomes. Studies in India have reported varying prevalence rates of anaemia among adolescent girls. Hence, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of community-based studies to obtain a comprehensive pooled estimate of the prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls in India.
   Methods. We did a systematic electronic search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Google scholar to retrieve community-based studies that reported the prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls (10-19 years) in India, without any date or language restriction. To estimate the pooled prevalence and heterogeneity, the random-effects model and I2 statistical methods were used. We did subgroup analyses based on geographical region, study setting, method used to measure haemoglobin concentration, and year of publication.
   Results. We included 35 studies in this meta-analysis comprising 152 640 participants. The pooled prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls was 65.7% (95% CI 59.3%-71.9%). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I-2 99.6%; p<0.001).
   Conclusion. There is a high prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls in India. While all regions of the country have a high prevalence, tribal areas need special attention. Targeted actions need to focus on the identification of determinants of anaemia apart from iron supplementation.

AB  - Characterization of new potential probiotics is desirable in the field of research on probiotics for their extensive use in health and disease. Tribes could be an unusual source of probiotics due to their unique food habits and least dependence on medications and consumption of antibiotics. The aim of the present study is to isolate lactic acid bacteria from tribal fecal samples of Odisha, India, and characterize their genetic and probiotic attributes. In this context one of the catalase-negative and Gram-positive isolates, identified using 16S rRNA sequencing as Ligilactobacillus salivarius, was characterized in vitro for its acid and bile tolerance, cell adhesion and antimicrobial properties. The whole genome sequence was obtained and analyzed for strain level identification, presence of genomic determinants for probiotic-specific features, and safety. Genes responsible for its antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions were detected. The secreted metabolites were analyzed using high resolution mass spectroscopy; the results indicated that the antimicrobial potential could be due to the presence of pyroglutamic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid, homoserine, and glutathione, and the immuno-modulating activity, contributed by the presence of short chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. So, to conclude we have successfully characterized a Ligilactobacillus salivarius species with potential antimicrobial and immunomodulatory ability. The health-promoting effects of this probiotic strain and/or its derivatives will be investigated in future.

AB  - Background: Limited studies have been done regarding the prevalence of Rickettsial diseases in India and as far as UT of Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, only a few hospital-based studies are available. Objectives: The present study was therefore planned to find the seroprevalence of Rickettsial diseases in Kashmir Valley. Materials and Methods: A multistage sampling procedure was used for the collection of samples from 10 districts of Kashmir Valley and a total of 1740 samples were collected. In addition, 802 healthy blood donors were included to establish baseline titers for Weil-Felix (WF) Test. Results: Of 1734 subjects, 73 were positive by the WF test. The overall seroprevalence of Rickettsial diseases was 4.1% with the highest prevalence of scrub typhus (2.30%) followed by the spotted fever group (1.5%) and typhus group (0.40%). Maximum seropositive subjects were from district Kulgam (6.97%) followed by Pulwama (5.92%), Shopian (5.79%), Anantnag (5.47%), Ganderbal (5.00%), Kupwara (4.72%), Baramulla (4.62%), Srinagar (2.63%), Bandipora (2.41%), and Budgam (0.54%), respectively. Seropositivity was higher in females and subjects who had contact with ticks and mites like those involved in the collection of firewood and grass or had contact with uncut grass or shrub. The seropositivity was also significantly higher in those working in paddy fields and those living near the forest (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of the present study confirm the existence of Rickettsial diseases in this region. This data would promote awareness of rickettsioses among local physicians and will also serve as a baseline to detect changing prevalence in the future.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the disability and its correlates in persons with Bipolar Disorder during the remission phase. Materials and Methods: As part of the multicentric study, 773 patients with bipolar disorder, currently in clinical remission, were evaluated for disability on the Indian Disability Assessment Evaluation Scale. Results: About one-fifth of the participants had some level of disability in the domain of self-care, one-third had some level of disability in the interpersonal domain, one-fourth had some level of disability in communication and understanding, and a maximum proportion (43.7%) had some disability in the domain of work. Overall, about one-fifth (18.4%) were considered to have a benchmark disability (i.e., disability >40%). In terms of correlates, those with a disability had a short duration of current remission, a higher number of manic and mixed episodes, a higher mean number of total episodes, spent more time in the episodes, had lower severity of the depressive episodes, higher residual depressive and manic symptoms, had overall higher manic affective morbidity, had a higher level of cognitive deficits, and had poorer insight. Conclusion: A significant proportion of patients with bipolar disorder have disability in work domain, and the presence of residual symptoms of either polarity are associated with higher level of disability.

AB  - Background: There are limited number of studies evaluating insight among patients with bipolar disorder (BD).Aim: This study aimed to examine insight and its correlates in BD using the data from the multicenter BD course and outcome study from India (BiD-CoIN). The additional aim was to evaluate the insight in patients with BD using different scales and understand the correlates of insight.Materials and Methods: 773 BD patients presently in clinical remission were evaluated on the Insight Scale for Affective Disorders (ISAD), insight items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).Results: The assessment scales influenced the prevalence of poor insight. Poorer insight irrespective of the assessment scale was consistently associated with higher residual depressive and manic symptoms, and a higher level of cognitive impairment and disability. Poor insight as assessed by ISAD was associated with a higher number of episodes in the lifetime, shorter duration of current remission, a higher number of depressive episodes, a higher amount of time spent in depressive episodes, higher depressive affective morbidity, a higher number of manic episodes, and higher residual depressive and manic symptoms. Conclusion: Poor insight in BD is consistently associated with higher residual depressive and manic symptoms and a higher level of cognitive impairment and disability. However, in terms of course variables, the correlates vary depending on the assessment method.

Multiple reports of growth deceleration with IM have raised concerns, necessitating careful monitoring and evaluation in children with CML. We systematically searched the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and conferences-abstracts, reporting the effect of IM on growth among children with CML, and published in the English language from inception till March 2022. For observational studies, the modified Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Pooled estimates were derived using a random-effects meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane Q statistic test of heterogeneity and I-2 statistic. Of the 757 studies identified through electronic search, 15 (n=265) were included in the final analysis. Six studies (n=178) were included in the meta-analysis of the primary outcome. There was a significant deleterious effect of IM on height-standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.52 (95% CI: -0.76; -0.28) (I-2=13%). The adverse effect of IM on height was significant among studies with a follow-up period <3 years [SMD: -0.66 (95% CI: -0.93, -0.40), I-2=0%, P=0.59] but not in studies with follow-up period & GE;3 years [SMD: -0.26 (95% CI: -0.63, 0.11), I-2=0, P=0.44], indicating that the effect of IM on height is a short-term effect. The effect of IM on height was not dependent upon pubertal status at the initiation of therapy. Prospective studies with adequate sample size are required to confirm the findings of the effect of IM on height in children with CML.

AB  - Split thickness skin grafts are widely used in treating burn injuries. To date, with limited availability of donor skin and minimal expansions offered by conventional skin grafting, it is challenging to cover large and severe burns. In this study, novel synthetic skin grafts with alternating slit (AS) shaped cut patterns were developed and tested to evaluate the expansion potentials offered by auxetic or negative Poisson's ratio structures in skin grafting. A range of auxetic incision patterns were designed with varying unit cell dimensions, and these were projected onto skin using 3D printing. The mechanical properties and digital image correlation of the created synthetic skin grafts were used to determine stress, effective Poisson's ratio, meshing ratio (MR), and generated strains for strain loadings of up to 150%. The AS graft simulant with equal slit lengths and low slit spacings exhibited the maximum negative Poisson's effect, expansion, and Mr Expansions were inversely related with the spacing between slits. The lowest value for the MR and highest stress was observed with high spacing, high horizontal slit length, and low vertical slit length. The expansions were highly sensitive to the applied strain, with low strains exhibiting high auxeticity. Such an extensive experimental investigation of the expansion potentials and stress estimations of skin grafts with varying AS dimensional parameters have not been conducted previously. The findings would be crucial for advancing research on mitigation of large burn injuries using high expansion skin grafts.

AB  - Purpose: To identify the facial anthropometric parameters that predict the difficulty during femtosecond (FS) laser. Methods: This was a single-center observational study was conducted on participants between the ages 18 and 30 years who were planned for FS-LASIK (femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis) or SMILE (small incision lenticule extraction) at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. The front and side-facing images of the participants were analyzed using Image J software to measure different anthropometric parameters. The nasal bridge index, facial convexity, and other parameters were measured. The difficulty faced by the surgeon during docking was recorded for each subject. The data were analyzed on Stata 14. Results: A total of 97 subjects were included. The mean age was 24 (+/- 7) years. Twenty-three (23.71%) subjects were females while the rest were males. Difficulty in docking was seen in 1 (4.34%) female and 14 (19%) males. The mean nasal bridge index was 92.58 (+/- 4.01) in subjects with deep-set eyes and 89.72 (+/- 4.30) in normal subjects. The mean total facial convexity was 129.28 (+/- 4.24) in deep-set eyes, and 140.23 (+/- 4.74) in normal subjects. Conclusion: Total facial convexity appeared as the most important feature, with the value being less than 133 degrees in most subjects with unfavorable facial anthropometry.

AB  - Purpose of reviewPolysubstance use is very common in the world, but there has been limited research in this area. South Asia is sandwiched between two of the world's largest heroin producing areas: the Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle. The burden and prevalence of polysubstance use have not been estimated in this region of the world. We review the research findings on polysubstance use in different South Asian countries. The review also comments on the gaps in knowledge regarding polysubstance use in this region of the world.Recent findingsThe available literature on polysubstance use from South Asia suggests its widespread presence in the region, ranging from 20 to 90%, more commonly among illicit opioid drug users and injection drug users. Most of the available data is from epidemiological studies. There are few studies on the adverse effects of polysubstance use, but the limited data clearly suggests an elevated risk of comorbid psychopathology and health problems.Polysubstance use still lacks a consensus definition. There is a need of more research on its prevalence, effects on health, and prevention and treatment.

AB  - Globally, cervical cancer (CxCa) ranks 4th common cancer among females and led to 569,847 incidences and 311,365 deaths in 2018. 80% of CxCa cases occur due to persistent infection with a high-risk subtype of human papillomavirus (HPV-16 and 18). Smoking, high parity, and co-infection with type 2 herpes simplex or HIV are other known risk factors for CxCa. Major histological subtypes are squamous (70%) and adenocarcinoma (25%). Presently, concurrent radiation plus cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for CxCa patients. However, CDDP resistance and toxic side effects limit its efficacy, leading to a poorer response rate and an expected overall survival ranging from 10 to 17.5 months. Reduced drug uptake, increased DNA damage repair, increased CDDP inactivation, and overexpressed Bcl-2 or caspase inhibition, are primarily accountable mechanisms for CDDP resistance and improving CDDP's efficacy remains the major challenge. Poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1, an effective mediator of nucleotide excision repair pathway, is involved in DNA repair as well as maintaining genomic stability and is significantly expressed in malignant lymphomas, hepatocellular-, cervical- and colorectal carcinoma, which has been approved effective in maintenance therapy and may serve as an effective target to enhance CDDP sensitivity in CxCa. Here, we summarize the etiology and epidemiology of and treatment for CxCa, the mechanism responsible for chemotherapy resistance, PARP inhibitor as a possible therapy for CxCa, and other possible chemotherapeutic options for CxCa treatment. 2022 The Authors.

AB  - ObjectiveAccurate demarcation between multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1)- related primary hyperparathyroidism (MPHPT) and sporadic PHPT (SPHPT) is important to plan the management of primary parathyroid disease and surveillance for other endocrine and nonendocrine tumours. The objective of this study is to compare the clinical, biochemical and radiological features and surgical outcomes in patients with MPHPT versus SPHPT and to identify the predictors of MEN1 syndrome in PHPT. Design, Patients and MeasurementsThis was an ambispective observationalstudy involving 251 patients with SPHPT and 23 patients with MPHPT evaluated at the endocrine clinic of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India between January 2015 and December 2021. ResultsThe prevalence of MEN1 syndrome among patients with PHPT was 8.2% and a genetic mutation was identified by Sanger sequencing in 26.1% of patients with MPHPT. Patients with MPHPT were younger (p < .001), had lower mean serum calcium (p = .01) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; p = .03) levels and lower bone mineral density (BMD) Z score at lumbar spine (p < .001) and femoral neck (p = .007). The prevalence of renal stones (p = .03) and their complications (p = .006) was significantly higher in MPHPT group. On multivariable analysis, factors predictive of MPHPT were hyperplasia on histopathology [OR 40.1, p < .001], ALP levels within reference range [OR 5.6, p = .02] and lumbar spine BMD [OR 0.39 per unit increase in Z score, p < .001]. ConclusionsPatients with MPHPT have more severe, frequent and early onset of bone and renal involvement despite milder biochemical features. A normal serum ALP, low BMD for age and gender at lumbar spine and histopathology evidence of hyperplasia are predictive factors for MEN1 syndrome in PHPT.

AB  - Background & objectives: Dengue, chikungunya and malaria are mosquito-borne infections, which have shared endemicity and similar clinical presentation. Simultaneous co-infection with more than one infectious agent complicates the diagnosis and further course of treatment. This study aims to determine the seroprevalence and trend of malaria, dengue and chikungunya from 2014-2020 in a tertiary care hospital of western India.Methods: The present study was retrospective descriptive record-based. Serum samples from clinically suspected dengue and chikungunya were subjected to both IgM antibody capture ELISA kits produced by National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, India. They were also subjected to ELISA based NS1Ag testing. In Suspected malaria cases, blood collected in EDTA tubes was subjected for Rapid Malaria antigen testing. Statistical analysis was performed using MS Excel and JMP Software.Results: Seropositivity of malaria was comparatively higher in 2014 (5.53%) and a decreasing trend was observed in subsequent years. Majority of malarial infections were caused by Plasmodium vivax (81.67%). There is drastic increase in seropositivity of chikungunya from 2016 (23.67%) and thereafter as compared to 2014 (6.57%) and 2015 (7.29%) indicating its re-emergence. The dengue seropositivity in 2019 (40.19%) was highest in last seven years. Males were predominantly affected, and most affected age group was 21-30 years. Peak transmission was observed in post-monsoon seasons. Dengue and chikungunya co-infection was observed to be 5.79%.Interpretation & conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of surveillance studies to understand the trend of vector-borne diseases for prompt diagnosis, management of patients in hospital setup and for early detection and curtailment of outbreaks and epidemics by public health sectors through appropriate vector control programs.

AB  - During extraocular muscle surgery, an uneventful scleral suture pass is very essential. In presence of normal intraocular tension, the surgery is quite predictable and safe. However, in the presence of significant hypotony, it becomes challenging. Therefore, to mitigate complication rate in these cases, we have adopted a simple technique, that is, the "pinch and stretch" technique. The surgical steps of this technique are as follows: In eyes with significant ocular hypotony, the surgery is initiated with a routine forniceal/limbal peritomy, following which the muscle is sutured and dis-inserted. Using three tissue fixation forceps, the scleral surface is stabilized. Using first forceps, the surgeon rotates the globe toward themself from the muscle stump, and with the remaining two forceps, the assistant pinches and stretches the episcleral tissue in an outward and upward direction just beneath the intended marks. This creates a flat scleral surface with significant firmness. Sutures are passed over this rigid sclera and the surgery is completed without any complications.

AB  - Introduction: Chlamydia trachomatis is a frequent cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes including recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). However, regulation of infectious load by host immune response is unknown. Female sex hormones are known to affect C. trachomatis infection. The aim of this study was to determine correlation of chlamydial infectious load and gestational age with concentration of progesterone/estrogen in RSA.Methodology: Urine and non-heparinized blood were collected from patients with history of > 3 spontaneous abortions (n = 150, cases) and those with history of > 2 successful deliveries (n = 150, controls) from Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Safdarjung hospital, New Delhi, India. C. trachomatis positivity was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chlamydial load by real-time PCR. Estrogen and progesterone concentrations were estimated by ELISA and correlated with chlamydial load.Results: 22/150 case patients were positive for C. trachomatis. 2,000-10,000 copies/mL of chlamydial load were detected in infected RSA patients. Progesterone concentration showed significant decrease while estrogen concentration was significantly increased in C. trachomatis- positive RSA patients versus controls. Chlamydial load and estrogen concentration were positively correlated while progesterone concentration was negatively correlated with chlamydial load. Gestational age was positively correlated with concentration of estrogen and negatively correlated with concentration of progesterone in infected-RSA women. Conclusions: Overall findings suggest that interplay between chlamydial copy load, hormonal changes such as increased expression of estrogen and decreased expression of progesterone, and advanced gestational age may be contributing as deciding factors for ensuing RSA during C. trachomatis-infection.

AB  - Background: Asterion is the junction of lambdoid, parietomastoid, and occipitomastoid sutures. In traditional anatomy teaching, it is believed that asterion sits over the transverse-sigmoid sinus junction (TSSJ). It is a significant surgical landmark for the placement of a burr hole in the retrosigmoid approach.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the asterion's accuracy as a TSSJ-specific external surgical landmark in the Indian population.
   Materials and Methods: 16 human dried skulls were obtained from the Department of Anatomy, AIIMS, New Delhi. The point of TSSJ was taken between the two lips and just posterior to the entry of the superior petrosal sinus. Asterion internally was localized with the help of a geometrical divider. The x- horizontal/anterior and y- vertically superior (+)/ inferior (-) distances were measured from asterion (internally) to the TSSJ by a digital vernier caliper.
   Results: The mean horizontal distance (x) of the left side asterion & TSSJ was 10.3 +/- 1.0mm whereas the vertical distance (y) ranged between +2 to -4.3 mm. The mean horizontal distance (x) of the right side asterion & TSSJ was 13.5 +/- 1.4mm whereas the vertical distance (y) ranged between +3 to -4.2 mm.
   Conclusion: Asterion is not a reliable landmark for TSSJ in Indian skulls. The TSSJ with respect to asterion was found on average 10mm and 13.5mm anterior on the left and right side respectively, and mostly inferior (average 4.2mm) in 75% of the skulls. The TSSJ was closer to the asterion on the left side in comparison with the right side. However, further studies with a larger sample size will be needed to evaluate the population-specific relation of asterion with the TSSJ.

AB  - Myopia is a major public health problem worldwide, including India, with the global prevalence of myopia increasing rapidly over decades. The clinical and socioeconomic impact of myopia is also expected to rise with rising prevalence. Therefore, the focus has now been shifted to prevent the incidence and progression of myopia. However, there is lack of any standardized guidelines for myopia management. This document aims to generate a national-level expert consensus statement on the management of childhood myopia in the Indian scenario. The expert panel of pediatric ophthalmologists consisted of 63 members who met in a hybrid meeting. A list of topics deliberating discussion in the meeting was provided to the experts in advance and they were instructed to provide their opinions on the matter during the meet. The panel of experts then gave their views on each of the items presented, deliberated on different aspects of childhood myopia, and reached a consensus regarding the practice patterns in the Indian scenario. In case of opposing views or lack of a clear consensus, we undertook further discussion and evaluated literature to help arrive at a consensus. A written document is prepared based on recommendations explaining definition of myopia, refraction techniques, components and methods of workup, initiation of anti-myopia treatment, type and timing of interventions, follow-up schedule, and indications for revised or combination treatment. This article formulates evidence-based guidelines for progressing myopes and pre-myopes and also establishes uniformity in the management of childhood myopia in the country.

AB  - Objective: This review aims to explore the current status of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a cephalometric tool, summarize the equipment design and methods, and propose recommendations for future research. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases, including PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, LILACS, and Cochrane Library, using broad search terms. The articles published in any language till June 2022 were considered. Cephalometric studies conducted using the MRI dataset on human participants, phantom or cadaver were included. Two independent reviewers assessed the final eligible articles using the quality assessment score (QAS). Results: Nine studies were included in the final assessment. Studies used various methods, including 1.5 T or 3 T MRI systems and 3D or 2D MRI datasets. Among the imaging sequences, T1-weighted, T2 -weighted and black bone MR images were used for cephalometric analysis. In addition, the reference standards varied among studies, such as traditional 2D cephalogram, cone -beam CT and phantom measurements. The mean QAS of all the included studies was 79% (& PLUSMN; 14.4%). The main limitation of most studies was the small sample size and the heterogeneity of the methods, statistical tools used, and metric outcomes assessed. Conclusions: Despite the heterogeneity and lack of metrological evidence on the effectiveness of MRI- based cephalometric analysis, the preliminary results demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro studies are encouraging. However, future studies exploring MRI sequences specific to cephalometric diagnosis are required for wider adoption of this technique in routine orthodontic practice.

AB  - Background & objectives: High transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 has significant implications on healthcare workers' safety, preservation, handling, transportation and disposal of the deceased bodies. The objective of this study was to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen in nasopharyngeal samples and its implications in handling and care of COVID-19 deceased bodies.
   Methods: A study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 centre on deceased individuals from April to December 2020. Rapid antigen test (RAT) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was compared on all the SARS-CoV-2 positive cadavers recruited in the study.
   Results: A total of 115 deceased individuals were included in the study. Of these, 79 (68.7%) were male and 36 (31.3%) were female and majority were in the age group of 51-60 yr [31 (27%)]. SARS-CoV-2 antigen test was positive in 32 (27.8%) and negative in 83 (72.1%) individuals. The mean time interval between deaths to the sample collection was 13.2 h with interquartile range of eight to 20 h. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used as the reference test and 24 (20.9%) cases were true positive; 93.6 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI) 88.8-98.4%] sensitivity, 45.2 per cent (95% CI 35.5-55%) specificity, 60.2 per cent (95% CI 50.6-69.8%) positive predictive value and 88.8 per cent (95% CI 82.7-95%) negative predictive value of antigen test was computed.
   Interpretation & conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 antigen test was positive beyond 19 h in COVID-19 deceased individuals. Antigen test was found to be highly sensitive in the deceased. Patients, suspected of having died due to COVID-19, can be screened by this method. As infectiousness of the virus in the deceased bodies cannot be directly concluded from either the antigen or RT-PCR test, yet possible transmission cannot be completely ruled out. Strict infection control measures need to be followed during the handling and clearance of COVID-19 cadavers.

AB  - Background and Aims: There is lack of research on somatic symptoms in schizophrenia. We aimed at finding prevalence and types of somatic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and assessed their association with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods:We assessed somatic symptoms using Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) in 93 patients with schizophrenia diagnosed on ICD10-DCR. Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms and Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, WHO Quality of Life (BREF) Hindi version and Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side-Effect Rating Scale were used to assess psychopathology, disability, quality of life and side effects. Results: Significant somatic symptoms (n >= 5 on PHQ-15) were present in 62 (67.7%) patients with schizophrenia. Forty three (69.4%) had mild (n = 5-9 on PHQ-15), 17 (27.4%) had moderate (n = 10-14 on PHQ-15), and only 2 (3.2%) had severe (n = >= 15 on PHQ -15) somatic symptoms. Mean somatic symptoms score on PHQ-15 was 7.28 (+/- 3.83); 96.8% reported feeling tired, 76.3% had constipation or diarrhoea, 67.7% trouble in sleeping, 61.3% nausea or indigestion, 52.7% back pain and 51.6% headache. Patients with somatic symptoms were older in age, had longer duration of illness and treatment, and had more negative symptoms. They had higher disability and poor quality of life especially in physical domain. Conclusion: Somatic symptoms are common in patients with schizophrenia and are associated with chronicity, refractoriness and negative symptoms, significant disability and poor quality of life. Thus during routine clinical practice, somatic symptoms should be assessed and managed in these patients.

AB  - Background: The role of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in predicting further decompensation in cirrhosis patients with acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is not known. We aimed to evaluate the role of HVPG in predicting further decompensation in cirrhosis patients with AVB Methods: In this prospective study, 145 patients with cirrhosis with esophageal or gastric AVB were included. HVPG was measured on the day of the AVB. Decompensating events occurring after 42-days of AVB were considered further decompensation. Results: The median age of the study cohort was 44 years; 88.3% males. The predominant etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol (46.2%). Overall, 40 (27.6%) patients developed further decompensation during median follow-up of 296 days following AVB. Gastro intestinal bleeding n = 27 (18.6%) and new-onset/worsening ascites n = 20 (13.8%) were the most common decompensating events. According to the multivariate model, HVPG was an independent predictor of any further decompensation in esophageal AVB patients but not in gastric variceal bleeding patients. HVPG cut-off of & GE;16 mmHg predicted further decompensation in the esophageal AVB. However, HVPG was not an independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion: HVPG measured during an episode of acute variceal hemorrhage from esophageal varices predicts further decompensating events in cirrhosis patients.

AB  - The association between emergency department (ED) length of stay (EDLOS) with inhospital mortality (IHM) in older patients remains unclear. This retrospective study aims to delineate the relationship between EDLOS and IHM in elderly patients. From the ED patients (n = 383,586) who visited an urban academic tertiary care medical center from January 2010 to December 2016, 78,478 older patients (age >= 60 years) were identified and stratified into three age subgroups: 60-74 (early elderly), 75-89 (late elderly), and >= 90 years (longevous elderly). We applied multiple machine learning approaches to identify the risk correlation trends between EDLOS and IHM, as well as boarding time (BT) and IHM. The incidence of IHM increased with age: 60-74 (2.7%), 75-89 (4.5%), and >= 90 years (6.3%). The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was obtained by Light Gradient Boosting Machine model for age groups 60-74, 75-89, and >= 90 years, which were 0.892 (95% CI, 0.870-0.916), 0.886 (95% CI, 0.861-0.911), and 0.838 (95% CI, 0.782-0.887), respectively. Our study showed that EDLOS and BT were statistically correlated with IHM (p < 0.001), and a significantly higher risk of IHM was found in low EDLOS and high BT. The flagged rate of quality assurance issues was higher in lower EDLOS <= 1 h (9.96%) vs. higher EDLOS 7 h < t <= 8 h (1.84%). Special attention should be given to patients admitted after a short stay in the ED and a long BT, and new concepts of ED care processes including specific areas and teams dedicated to older patients care could be proposed to policymakers.

AB  - Globally, neurological diseases pose a major burden to healthcare professionals in terms of the management and prevention of the disorder. Among neurological diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 50%-70% of dementia and is the fifth leading cause of mortality worldwide. AD is a progressive, degenerative neurological disease, with the loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and subcortical regions. The management of AD remains a debate among physicians as no standard and specific "disease-modifying" modality is available. The concept of 'Regenerative Medicine' is aimed at regenerating the degenerated neural tissues to reverse the pathology in AD. Genetically modified engineered stem cells modify the course of AD after transplantation into the brain. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are an emerging new approach in cell communication that involves the transfer of cellular materials from parental cells to recipient cells, resulting in changes at the molecular and signaling levels in the recipient cells. EVs are a type of vesicle that can be transported between cells. Many have proposed that EVs produced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may have therapeutic promise in the treatment of AD. The biology of AD, as well as the potential applications of stem cells and their derived EVs-based therapy, were explored in this paper.

AB  - BackgroundConventionally, tracheal tubes have been used for general anesthesia in pediatric laparoscopic surgeries. Recently, supraglottic devices are being used for the same. The performance of supraglottic devices versus tracheal tubes in children undergoing laparoscopic surgery is uncertain. MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared supraglottic devices versus tracheal tubes in patients & LE;18 years undergoing laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia was conducted. The outcomes were peak airway pressures (cm H2O), end-tidal carbon dioxide during pneumoperitoneum (mm Hg), recovery time (min), postoperative sore throat and adverse events. Mean difference and odds ratio, with 95% confidence intervals were reported using a random effect model. ResultsEight trials (n = 591) were included in the final meta-analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in the peak airway pressures (MD 0.58, 95% CI: -0.65 to 1.8; p = .36) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (MD -0.60, 95% CI: -2.00 to 0.80; p = .40) during pneumoperitoneum in the supraglottic device and the tracheal tube group. The tracheal tube group had higher odds of sore throat (OR 3.30, 95% CI: 1.69-6.45; p = .0005) and the supraglottic airway group had faster recovery time (MD 4.21, 95% CI: 3.12-5.31; p < .0001), which were statistically significant. The certainty of evidence is graded low. ConclusionThere is low quality evidence to suggest that for pediatric laparoscopic surgeries of short duration, supraglottic devices could provide comparable intraoperative ventilation in terms of peak airway pressures and end tidal carbon dioxide, with lower odds of postoperative sore throat and faster recovery time when compared to tracheal tubes.

AB  - Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a rare, dominantly inherited multisystem developmental disorder characterized by highly variable manifestations of growth and developmental delays, upper limb involvement, hypertrichosis, cardiac, gastrointestinal, craniofacial, and other systemic features. Pathogenic variants in genes encoding cohesin complex structural subunits and regulatory proteins (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8, and RAD21) are the major pathogenic contributors to CdLS. Heterozygous or hemizygous variants in the genes encoding these five proteins have been found to be contributory to CdLS, with variants in NIPBL accounting for the majority (>60%) of cases, and the only gene identified to date that results in the severe or classic form of CdLS when mutated. Pathogenic variants in cohesin genes other than NIPBL tend to result in a less severe phenotype. Causative variants in additional genes, such as ANKRD11, EP300, AFF4, TAF1, and BRD4, can cause a CdLS-like phenotype. The common role that these genes, and others, play as critical regulators of developmental transcriptional control has led to the conditions they cause being referred to as disorders of transcriptional regulation (or "DTRs"). Here, we report the results of a comprehensive molecular analysis in a cohort of 716 probands with typical and atypical CdLS in order to delineate the genetic contribution of causative variants in cohesin complex genes as well as novel candidate genes, genotype-phenotype correlations, and the utility of genome sequencing in understanding the mutational landscape in this population.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a membrane barrier considered one of the most crucial protective architectures in the central nervous system (CNS). Its presence acts as a hurdle due to which most brain-targeted drug delivery systems (DDS) lose their therapeutic efficacy. Various strategies have been developed recently to assist drugs to cross the BBB. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated DDS has emerged as an effective non-invasive tool for treating brain diseases, including cancer. NPs are considered an effective DDS, which can mediate the delivery of drugs even to deep-seated regions in the brain. NPs protect the therapeutic agents by encapsulating them and ensuring they reach the target site without metabolic degradation. This review will explore BBB's structural and functional aspects, including physiological mechanisms governing its penetration and various pathological modifications. Such insights are critical in formulating innovative strategies for successfully targeting damaged regions. Once the drug crosses BBB, its concentration, metabolic decomposition, and BBB's structure hold significance. Also, the different designed NP systems exploited for drug delivery to the brain have been extensively reviewed. This review forebodes the importance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in developing personalized therapies.

AB  - Through comparative analyses using BLASTp and BLASTn of the 25 target sequences, our research identified two unique post-transcriptional modifiers, Rv1509 and Rv2231A, which serve as distinctive and characteristic proteins of M.tb - the Signature Proteins. Here, we have characterized these two signature proteins associated with pathophysiology of M.tb which may prove to be therapeutically important targets. Dynamic Light Scattering and Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography exhibited that Rv1509 exists as a monomer while Rv2231A as a dimer in solution. Secondary structures were determined using Circular Dichroism and further validated through Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Both the proteins are capable of withstanding a wide range of temperature and pH variations. Fluorescence spectroscopy based binding affinity experiments showed that Rv1509 binds to iron and may promote organism growth by chelating iron. In the case of Rv2231A, a high affinity for its substrate RNA was observed, which is facilitated in presence of Mg2+ suggesting it might have RNAse activity, supporting the prediction through in-silico studies. This is the first study on biophysical characterization of these two therapeutically important proteins, Rv1509 and Rv2231A, providing important insights into their structure -function correlations which are crucial for development of new drugs/ early diagnostics tools targeting these proteins.

AB  - Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a pervasive health issue affecting a large number of couples globally, which leads to increased emotional and financial strain on the affected families. While female factors have been extensively studied and are well known, the contribution of male factors to RPL remains largely unknown. As high as 40% of RPL cases are unexplained, which are termed as idiopathic RPL (iRPL), necessitating the investigation of male factors. The role of spermatozoa in early embryonic development is now well established, and recent research studies have shown that oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation in sperm cells are linked to RPL. The aim of this study was to identify proteomic markers of iRPL in human spermatozoa using tandem mass spectrometry. A label-free method quantified a total of 1820 proteins, and statistical analysis identified 359 differentially expressed proteins, the majority of which were downregulated in iRPL samples (344). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that proteomic alterations were mainly associated with biological processes such as response to stress, protein folding, chromatin organization, DNA conformation change, oxidative phosphorylation, and electron transport chain. In coherence with past studies, we determined fatty acid synthase (FASN) and clusterin (CLU) to be the most potential sperm markers for iRPL and confirmed their expression changes in iRPL by western blotting. Conclusively, we believe that FASN and CLU might serve as potential markers of iRPL and suggest exploratory functional studies to identify their specific role in pregnancy loss.

AB  - Background Non-communicable disease (NCD) rates are rapidly increasing in India with wide regional variations. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of metabolic NCDs in India and analyse interstate and inter-regional variations. Methods The Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study, a cross-sectional population based survey, assessed a representative sample of individuals aged 20 years and older drawn from urban and rural areas of 31 states, union territories, and the National Capital Territory of India. We conducted the survey in multiple phases with a stratified multistage sampling design, using three-level stratification based on geography, population size, and socioeconomic status of each state. Diabetes and prediabetes were diagnosed using the WHO criteria, hypertension using the Eighth Joint National Committee guidelines, obesity (generalised and abdominal) using the WHO Asia Pacific guidelines, and dyslipidaemia using the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Findings A total of 113 043 individuals (79 506 from rural areas and 33 537 from urban areas) participated in the ICMRINDIAB study between Oct 18, 2008 and Dec 17, 2020. The overall weighted prevalence of diabetes was 11 center dot 4% (95% CI 10 center dot 2-12 center dot 5; 10 151 of 107 119 individuals), prediabetes 15 center dot 3% (13 center dot 9-16 center dot 6; 15 496 of 107 119 individuals), hypertension 35 center dot 5% (33 center dot 8-37 center dot 3; 35 172 of 111 439 individuals), generalised obesity 28 center dot 6% (26 center dot 9-30 center dot 3; 29 861 of 110 368 individuals), abdominal obesity 39 center dot 5% (37 center dot 7-41 center dot 4; 40 121 of 108 665 individuals), and dyslipidaemia 81 center dot 2% (77 center dot 9-84 center dot 5; 14 895 of 18 492 of 25 647). All metabolic NCDs except prediabetes were more frequent in urban than rural areas. In many states with a lower human development index, the ratio of diabetes to prediabetes was less than 1. Interpretation The prevalence of diabetes and other metabolic NCDs in India is considerably higher than previously estimated. While the diabetes epidemic is stabilising in the more developed states of the country, it is still increasing in most other states. Thus, there are serious implications for the nation, warranting urgent state-specific policies and interventions to arrest the rapidly rising epidemic of metabolic NCDs in India.

AB  - Manual detection of colorectal polyps in the colonoscopy videos during diagnosis of colorectal cancer can be challenging due to the large no. of sequential frames and high chances of false positive rate. So, researchers are working to develop an automatic computer-aided decision system to successfully detect colorectal polyps for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. This work proposes an end-to-end, automatic colorectal polyp detection architecture called 'Window-based Detection after Mixed Convolutions Polyp Identification (WD-MCPI)'. It has been trained and validated on the Etis-Larib, CVC-Colon, and Kvasir v1 data. Varying sequential and non-sequential colonoscopy frames and developed occlusive frames have been considered in the test set. Systematic hyperparameter tuning of various convolutional layers, optimizers, kernel size, color space, image dimension, and filter size has been performed to build the proposed architecture. The robustness and explainability of the proposed architecture have been estimated through various evaluation metrics, feature mapping, ablation studies, occlusion testing, and class activation mapping. The proposed work has achieved an overall accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area-under-curve score up to 94.23, 91.16, 94.00, 92.67, 91.75, and 92.53%, respectively. An average test set accuracy up to 93% has been achieved on a newly developed test set named 'Gastrointestinal atlas-Colon Polyp' (available here). Upon comparison with the existing state-of-the-art works and vanilla inception v3 architecture, the proposed architecture has been tested on varying colonoscopy frames, achieving optimum results with reduced trainable parameters, and inference time per epoch.

AB  - Survival of childhood cancer is increasing, resulting in a growing population of childhood cancer survivors who enter the health care system. There is widespread agreement on the need for effective transition programs for age-appropriate care for these individuals. However, the transition from pediatric to adult care can be a particularly confusing and overwhelming experience for the survivors of childhood cancer or children requiring long term treatment. The concept of transition implies more than just transfer of a cancer patient /more often a survivor to adult care; the preparation of which must begin well before the event of transfer. The transfer of a pediatric case to adult team could have many implications like a feeling of insecurity culminating in psychosocial issues. There is another concept in management of cancers: 'Shared care' which is essentially integration and coordination of care to develop an effective and collaborative relationship between primary and cancer care physicians. The care of patients from diagnosis to treatment is complex and requires the expertise of a wide range of care providers who are new to patients/survivors. This review article elaborates on both transition of care and shared care as applicable to India.

AB  - Cancer is an intricate disease that develops as a response to a combination of hereditary and environmental risk factors, which then result in a variety of changes to the genome. The cluster of differentiation (CD44) is a type of transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a potential biomarker for cancer stem cells (CSC) and viable targets for therapeutic intervention in the context of cancer therapy. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear polysaccharide that exhibits a notable affinity for the CD44 receptor. This characteristic renders it a promising candidate for ther-apeutic interventions aimed at selectively targeting CD44-positive cancer cells. Treating cancer via non-viral vector-based gene delivery has changed the notion of curing illness through the incorporation of therapeutic genes into the organism. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of various hyaluronic acid -modified lipoplexes and polyplexes as potential drug delivery methods for specific forms of cancer by effec-tively targeting CD44.

AB  - BackgroundContinuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) is one of the advanced therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD). MethodsA systematic review of all published articles in English on CSAI for PD till January 30, 2022 was conducted. ResultsA total of 82 articles met the search criteria. Publications included retrospective or prospective open-label observational studies, with a limited number of randomized control trials (RCT). Publications were highly heterogeneous and focused on different aspects of CSAI and included clinical audits, effects on cognition/behavior, axial symptoms, nocturnal issues, adverse events/reasons for discontinuation and comparison with other continuous dopaminergic therapies. CSAI was used in patients who presented severe motor fluctuations not resolved by oral therapy, poor candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) due to cognitive/behavioral issues or in those with DBS weaning effect. Recent studies have also shown that CSAI was useful for nocturnal usage in advanced PD, in addition to daytime utilization. Adverse effects were common and include skin lesions, sedation and nausea. Pump management difficulties and patient decisions were common reasons for therapy dropout, predominantly during the initial stages of the CSAI. ConclusionThere is consistent agreement on the benefits of CSAI in reducing OFF periods and improving ON periods without troublesome dyskinesia and specific motor and non-motor symptoms. Although there is a paucity of RCTs, current data from almost 30 years of use suggests CSAI to be beneficial in advanced cases of PD.

AB  - Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common primary malignancy of the liver but is rare in the paediatric age group; thus, it may be misdiagnosed as the more common tumour, hepatoblastoma. Management varies in both these tumours, and pathological diagnosis thus plays an important role for definitive therapy. Only a few case reports available in the literature have described the cytological characteristics of paediatric HCC. The present study was thus planned to evaluate the cytomorphological features of paediatric HCC.Methods: Cases diagnosed with HCC on ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology over a period of 14 years were retrieved. The cases were evaluated for detailed cytological features including cellularity, architecture, sinusoidal wrapping, trabecular thickness, necrosis, anisonucleosis, chromatin, nucleoli, nuclear contours, bi- or multinucleation, intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions, naked nuclei, extra-medullary haematopoiesis, monomorphism, and nuclear overlapping.Results: Twelve cases of HCC were included in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 10 years. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level was raised in most of them. Five of the 12 cases were characterised as moderately differentiated, three as poorly differentiated, two as well differentiated, and two as the fibrolamellar type of HCC. Cytohistological correlation was performed in seven cases.Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration serves as a useful tool to diagnose paediatric HCC and differentiate it from other primary hepatic malignancies, especially hepatoblastoma which closely mimics HCC in this age group, as serum alpha protein levels and imaging findings are unable to distinguish these two tumours.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease was found to be one of the most attractive anti-viral targets for the development of new chemical entities to combat coronavirus and Michael acceptors were found to be appropriate 3-chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. In this regard, a series of Michael acceptor-based peptidyl beta-nitrostyrenes were synthesized and evaluated for their Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitory potentials using a 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 assay kit. Among the compounds evaluated, (E)-N-(2-morpholino-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)-2-(4-(2-nitrobut-1-en-1-yl)phenoxy)acetamide demonstrated better inhibition with an effective concentration (EC50) of 58 mu M. In silico ADME predictions showed that the majority of these compounds have drug-like properties. Furthermore, free energy calculation (Delta G Bind) and docking results demonstrate the suitable fitting of most active compound at the active site of the enzyme. Based on the in vitro and in silico studies, peptidyl beta-nitrostyrene based Michael acceptors could serve as an excellent ligand for the inhibition of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 and may be used as a potential template for further development of bioactive ligands to treat CORONA VIRUS Disease of 2019.

AB  - Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) is known to hyperphosphorylate tau protein, which subsequently causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). MARK4 is a well-validated drug target for AD; thus, we employed its structural features to discover potential inhibitors. On the other hand, complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) have been used for the treatment of numerous diseases with little side effects. In this regard, Bacopa monnieri extracts have been extensively used to treat neurological disorders because of their neuroprotective roles. The plant extract is used as a memory enhancer and a brain tonic. Bacopaside II is a major component of Bacopa monnieri; thus, we studied its inhibitory effects and binding affinity towards the MARK4. Bacopaside II show a considerable binding affinity for MARK4 (K = 107 M-1) and inhibited kinase activity with an IC50 value of 5.4 & mu;M. To get atomistic insights into the binding mechanism, we performed Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies for 100 ns. Bacopaside II binds strongly to the active site pocket residues of MARK4 and a number of hydrogen bonds remain stable throughout the MD trajectory. Our findings provide the basis for the therapeutic implication of Bacopaside and its derivatives in MARK4-related neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Metastasis is one of the major causes for cancer mortality. Its early steps comprise of invasion of basement membrane and migration. Thus, it is hypothesized that a platform, that allows quantification and grading of migration capability of cells can potentially be used for predicting metastatic potential. Two-dimensional (2D) models have been rendered inadequate for modelling in-vivo microenvironment due to various reasons. To attenuate homogeneity observed in 2D, three-dimensional (3D) platforms supplemented with bioinspired com-ponents have been designed. Unfortunately, till date there are no simple models to capture the migration of cells in 3D along with quantification of the process. In this study, we report an alginate-collagen based 3D model system, which can predict the migratory property of the cells within 72 h. The micron size of the scaffold enabled faster readout and the optimum pore-size provided conducive cellular growth environment. The platform's ability to allow observation of cellular migration was validated by encapsulating cells with transiently upre-gulated matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), which has been reported to play a significant role in migration of cells during metastasis. The readout for migration was clustering of cells in the microscaffolds detected in a short span of 48 h. The observed clustering in MMP9 upregulated cells was validated by observing changes in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Thus, this simple 3D platform can be used to study migration and predict the metastatic potential of cells.

AB  - Prevention of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pandemic needs markers that can precisely predict the disease risk in an individual. Alterations in DNA methylations due to exposure towards environmental risk factors are widely sought markers for T2DM risk prediction. To identify such individual DNA methylation signatures and their effect on disease risk, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in 844 Indian individuals of Indo-European origin. We identified and validated methylation alterations at two novel CpG sites in MIR1287 (cg01178710) and EDN2-SCMH1 (cg04673737) genes associated with T2DM risk at the epigenome-wide-significance-level (P < 1.2 x 10(-7)). Further, we also replicated the association of two known CpG sites in TXNIP, and CPT1A in the Indian population. With 535 EWAS significant CpGs (P < 1.2 x 10(-7)) identified in the discovery phase samples, we created a co-methylation network using weighted correlation network analysis and identified four modules among the CpGs. We observed that methylation of one of the module associates with T2DM risk factors (e.g. BMI, insulin and C-peptide) and can be used as markers to segregate T2DM patients with good glycemic control (e.g. low HbA1c) and dyslipidemia (low HDL and high TG) from the other patients. Additionally, an intronic SNP (rs6503650) in the JUP gene, a member of the same module, associated with methylation at all the 14 hub CpG sites of that module as methQTL. Our network-assisted EWAS is the first to systematically explore DNA methylation variations conferring risks to T2DM in Indians and use the identified risk CpG sites for patient segregation with different clinical outcomes. These findings can be useful for better stratification of patients to improve the clinical management and treatment effects.

AB  - Lay Summary In this multinational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence prior to vaccination, including the first data from India, where over half of patients seroconverted, geographical location conferred the highest risk of susceptibility to serologically detectable infection.
   Background Beyond systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there have been no direct studies of serological response to COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) across continents. In particular, there has been limited data from Asia, with no data reported from India. The ICARUS-IBD (International study of COVID-19 Antibody Response Under Sustained immunosuppression in IBD) consortium assessed serological response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with IBD in North America, Europe, and Asia. Methods The ICARUS-IBD study is a multicenter observational cohort study spanning sites in 7 countries. We report seroprevalence data from 2303 patients with IBD before COVID-19 vaccination between May 2020 and November 2021. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were analyzed. Results The highest and lowest SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike seropositivity rates were found in Asia (81.2% in Chandigarh and 57.9% in Delhi, India; and 0% in Hong Kong). By multivariable analysis, country (India: odds ratio [OR], 18.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.03-26.95; P < .0001; United Kingdom: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.58-3.72; P < .0001; United States: OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.27-3.85; P = .005), male sex (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.07-1.99; P = .016), and diabetes (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.04-5.46; P = .039) conferred higher seropositivity rates. Biological therapies associated with lower seroprevalence (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.15-0.33; P < .0001). Multiple linear regression showed associations between anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid titers with medications (P < .0001) but not with country (P = .3841). Conclusions While the effects of medications on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in patients with IBD were consistent across sites, geographical location conferred the highest risk of susceptibility to serologically detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over half of IBD patients in India were seropositive prior to vaccination. These insights can help to inform shielding advice, therapeutic choices, and vaccine strategies in IBD patients for COVID-19 and future viral challenges.

AB  - Slips and falls are among the major concerns for public safety. Slipping risks can be reduced by ensuring adequate traction at the shoe-floor interface. The outsole design of footwear is a critical factor to maintain sufficient shoe-floor traction in the presence of slippery contaminants such as water or oil. While the role of floorings and contaminants on footwear traction has been studied widely, limited works have investigated the role of footwear outsole geometry and tread patterns on shoe-floor traction. In this work, eight footwear outsole designs and their traction performance were tested on a common flooring with water contamination, through the development of a novel fluid-structure interaction based computational framework. Induced fluid pressure, mass flow rates, and contact areas were quantified across the outsole patterns, and their effect on footwear friction was investigated. The study results were validated using mechanical slip testing experiments. The results indicated that the outsoles which had horizontal treads or untreaded heel regions can lead to drastic reduction of footwear friction. Also, contact area alone was quantified to be a poor choice in estimating the traction performance of footwear on water contaminated floorings. Such novel study results have not been reported to date, and are anticipated to provide important guidelines to footwear manufacturers to evaluate and optimize footwear tread parameters which would help in reducing the risk of slips.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the status of brain tumor programs in Asia and Africa and propose comprehensive evidence -based short-and long-term measures for improving the existing systems.METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in June 2022 by the Asia-Africa Neurosurgery Collaborative. A 27-item questionnaire was designed and distributed to gain insight into the status and future di-rections of brain tumor programs in Asia and Africa. Six components of brain tumor programs were identified- surgery, oncology, neuropathology, research, training, and finances-and assigned scores of 0e14. The total scores allowed subclassification of each country into levels of brain tumor program from I to VI.RESULTS: A total of 110 responses from 92 countries were received. These were subdivided into 3 groups: group 1, countries with response from neurosurgeons (73 coun-tries); group 2, countries with no neurosurgeons (19 coun-tries); and group 3, countries without a neurosurgeon response (16 countries). The components associated with the highest level of brain tumor program were surgery, neuropathology, and oncology. Most countries in both continents had level III brain tumor programs with a mean surgical score of 2.24. The major lag between each group was with respect to the advances in neuropathology and financial support.CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to improve and develop existing and nonexistent neuro-oncology infra-structure, personnel, and logistics in countries across the continents, especially for the countries with no neurosurgeons.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the change in crystalline lens power (LP) in a cohort of Indian children with progressive myopia receiving atropine (0.01%) compared with an untreated control group.Design: Nonrandomised clinical trial.Methods: The study included 120 children (70 in the atropine group; 50 in the control group) with progressive myopia (=0.5 D/year) with a 1-year follow-up. The atropine group received 0.01% atropine eye drops once daily in both eyes, whereas the control group received no treatment. Changes in cycloplegic spherical equivalent, axial length (AL), keratometry (KER), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens thickness (LT) were recorded. LP was calculated using the formula proposed by Bennett.Results: Mean myopia progression at year 1 was significantly less in the atropine group (-0.18 D [0.2]) than in the control group (-0.59 [0.21]; p < 0.001). The increase in AL was significantly different between the two groups (atropine: 0.21 mm [0.12]; control: 0.29 mm [0.11], p < 0.001). A significantly greater loss of LP was noted in the atropine group (-0.67 D [0.34]) than in the placebo group (-0.28 D [0.42]; p < 0.001). The change in LT was significantly different between the atropine and control groups (p = 0.02), whereas the change in ACD and KER was similar in the two groups.Conclusion: The greater loss of LP could contribute to the anti-myopia effect of atropine and should therefore be evaluated in studies reporting the efficacy of atropine on myopia to assess its actual effect on myopic progression.

AB  - Analysis of the chemical composition of gallstones is vital for the etiopathogenesis of gallstone diseases that can ultimately help in the prevention of its formation. In the present study, gallstones from seven different regions of India were analyzed to highlight the major difference in their composition. Also, gallstones of different pathological conditions i.e., benign (chronic cholecystitis, CC) and malignant gallbladder disease (gallbladder cancer GBC) were characterized. The type of polymorphs of cholesterol molecules was also studied to provide insight into the structure of gallstones. H-1 solution state NMR spectroscopy 1D experiments were performed on a total of 94 gallstone (GS) samples collected from seven different geographical regions of India. Solid-State NMR spectroscopy C-13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) experiments were done on the 20 CC GS samples and 20 GBC GS samples of two regions. H-1 NMR spectra from the solution state NMR of all the stones reveal that cholesterol was a major component of the maximum stones of the north India region while in south Indian regions, GS had very less cholesterol. C-13 CPMAS experiments reveal that the quantity of cholesterol was significantly more in the GS of CC in the Lucknow region compared with GBC stones of Lucknow and Chandigarh. Our study also revealed that GS of the Lucknow region of both malignant and benign gallbladder diseases belong to the monohydrate crystalline form of cholesterol while GS of Chandigarh region of both malignant and benign gallbladder diseases exists in both monohydrate crystalline form with the amorphous type and anhydrous form. Gallstones have a complicated and poorly understood etiology. Therefore, it is important to understand the composition of gallstones, which can be found in various forms and clinical conditions. Variations in dietary practices, environmental conditions, and genetic factors may influence and contribute to the formation of GS. Prevention of gallstone formation may help in decreasing the cases of gallbladder cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE Preventing metastases by using perioperative interventions has not been adequately explored. Local anesthesia blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and thereby prevents activation of prometastatic pathways. We conducted an open-label, multicenter randomized trial to test the impact of presurgical, peritumoral infiltration of local anesthesia on disease-free survival (DFS).
   METHODS Women with early breast cancer planned for upfront surgery without prior neoadjuvant treatment were randomly assigned to receive peritumoral injection of 0.5% lidocaine, 7-10 minutes before surgery (local anesthetics [LA] arm) or surgery without lidocaine (no LA arm). Random assignment was stratified by menopausal status, tumor size, and center. Participants received standard postoperative adjuvant treatment. Primary and secondary end points were DFS and overall survival (OS), respectively.
   RESULTS Excluding eligibility violations, 1,583 of 1,600 randomly assigned patients were included in this analysis (LA, 796; no LA, 804). At a median follow-up of 68 months, there were 255 DFS events (LA, 109; no LA, 146) and 189 deaths (LA, 79; no LA, 110). In LA and no LA arms, 5-year DFS rates were 86.6% and 82.6% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.95; P 5.017) and 5-year OS rates were 90.1% and 86.4%, respectively (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94; P 5.019). The impact of LA was similar in subgroups defined by menopausal status, tumor size, nodal metastases, and hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Using competing risk analyses, in LA and no LA arms, 5-year cumulative incidence rates of locoregional recurrence were 3.4% and 4.5% (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.11), and distant recurrence rates were 8.5% and 11.6%, respectively (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.99). There were no adverse events because of lidocaine injection.
   CONCLUSION Peritumoral injection of lidocaine before breast cancer surgery significantly increases DFS and OS. Altering events at the time of surgery can prevent metastases in early breast cancer (CTRI/2014/11/005228).

AB  - In view of WHO's "End-TB" strategy, we developed a non-invasive, urine-based ELISA, targeting 2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens namely MPT51 and MPT64 for extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) diagnosis. Suspected EPTB patients (n = 137) [Pleural TB, Abdominal TB and Tuberculous meningitis] were categorized in "Definite" EPTB (n = 10) [Xpert-MTB/RIF and/or culture-positive], "Probable" EPTB (n = 77) and "Non-EPTB" (n = 50) groups using defined composite reference standards. ROC-curves were generated using ELISA results of "Definite" EPTB and "Non-EPTB" groups for both antigens independently and cut-off values were selected to provide 86.3% (95%CI:73.3-94.2) specificity for MPT51 and 92% (95%CI:80.8-97.8) for MPT64. The sensitivity of MPT51-ELISA and MPT64-ELISA was 70% (95%CI:34.7-93.3) and 90% (95%CI:55.5-99.7) for "Definite" EPTB group and 32.5% (95%CI:22.2-44.1) and 30.8% (95%CI:20.8-42.2) for "Probable" EPTB group, respectively. Combining the results of both ELISAs showed a 100% (95%CI:69.1-100) sensitivity in "Definite" EPTB group and 41.6% (95%CI:30.4-53.4) in "Probable" EPTB group, with an 80% (95%CI:66.3-89.9) specificity. The results demonstrated the potential of urine-based ELISAs as screening tests for EPTB diagnosis.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - PurposeThe orthopaedic surgeons, especially the young budding surgeons should have a well-balanced knowledge of the past evidence as well the current evidence in the literature for the appropriate as well as optimum management of tibial plateau fractures. Bibliometric analysis of the top-cited papers on tibial plateau fracture management can help know their concurrent interests, deficiencies and conflicting issues regarding their management. This study aimed to identify the 50 most cited research articles in tibial plateau research and analyse their characteristics.MethodsWe searched the Thompson Reuters Web of Science database for articles relevant to tibial plateau fracture and prepared a list of top 50 cited articles that included original articles and review articles concerning tibial plateau fractures. The included articles were analysed for contributing journals, corresponding author's country, publication year, cumulative citations, annual citations, citation trends over time, level of evidence and a qualitative review.ResultsThe search strategy resulted in 2263 articles. The top 50 cited articles were published from 1974 to 2014 and belonged to 12 journal sources. There were 47 original articles and 3 review articles. The average citations per article were 126.2, and the annual citations per article were 6.478 per year. The top-cited articles were relevant to the strategies in the management, classification, fracture reduction, articular restoration, types and number of fixation devices, surgical approaches, associated menisco-ligamentous injuries and applicability of bone grafts/substitutes in tibial plateau fractures.ConclusionThe current bibliometric analysis summarises the top-cited evidence concerning tibial plateau fractures and can be a potential resource for reviewing and locating the same. The analysis shows that most top-cited evidence belongs to the year 2000 onwards. Also, recent articles have a higher annual citation rate. A limited number of journals and mostly, western countries have contributed to the top-cited evidence. Whilst the top-cited evidence has touched several aspects of tibial plateau fractures, it is in the form of level IV case series. It needs better prospective evidence to establish sound recommendations.

AB  - Introduction: It is unclear if serum procalcitonin (PCT) estimated at sepsis suspicion can help detect culture-positive sepsis in neonates. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of PCT in culture-positive sepsis in neonates. Methods: This was a prospective study (February 2016 to September 2020) conducted in four level-3 units in India. We enrolled neonates suspected of sepsis in the first 28 days of life. Neonates with birth weight <750 g, asphyxia, shock, and major malformations were excluded. Blood for PCT assay was drawn along with the blood culture at the time of suspicion of sepsis and before antibiotic initiation. The investigators labeled the neonates as having culture-positive sepsis or "no sepsis" based on the culture reports and clinical course. PCT assay was performed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, and the clinicians were masked to the PCT levels while assigning the label of sepsis. Primary outcomes were the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios to identify culture-positive sepsis. Results: The mean birth weight (SD) and median gestation (IQR) were 2,113 (727) g and 36 (32-38) weeks, respectively. Of the 1,204 neonates with eligible cultures, 155 (12.9%) had culture-positive sepsis. Most (79.4%) were culture-positive within 72 h of birth. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios at 2 ng/mL PCT threshold were 52.3% (95% confidence interval: 44.1-60.3), 64.5% (60.7-68.1), 1.47 (1.23-1.76), and 0.74 (0.62-0.88), respectively. Adding PCT to assessing neonates with 12.9% pretest probability of sepsis generated posttest probabilities of 18% and 10% for positive and negative test results, respectively. Conclusion: Serum PCT did not reliably identify culture-positive sepsis in neonates.

AB  - BackgroundThe rising economic burden of cancer on patients is an important determinant of access to treatment initiation and adherence in India. Several publicly financed health insurance (PFHI) schemes have been launched in India, with treatment for cancer as an explicit inclusion in the health benefit packages (HBPs). Although, financial toxicity is widely acknowledged to be a potential consequence of costly cancer treatment, little is known about its prevalence and determinants among the Indian population. There is a need to determine the optimal strategy for clinicians and cancer care centers to address the issue of high costs of care in order to minimize the financial toxicity, promote access to high value care and reduce health disparities. MethodsA total of 12,148 cancer patients were recruited at seven purposively selected cancer centres in India, to assess the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) and financial toxicity among cancer patients. Mean OOPE incurred for outpatient treatment and hospitalization, was estimated by cancer site, stage, type of treatment and socio-demographic characteristics. Economic impact of cancer care on household financial risk protection was assessed using standard indicators of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) and impoverishment, along with the determinants using logistic regression. ResultsMean direct OOPE per outpatient consultation and per episode of hospitalization was estimated as (sic)8,053 (US$ 101) and (sic)39,085 (US$ 492) respectively. Per patient annual direct OOPE incurred on cancer treatment was estimated as (sic)331,177 (US$ 4,171). Diagnostics (36.4%) and medicines (45%) are major contributors of OOPE for outpatient treatment and hospitalization, respectively. The overall prevalence of CHE and impoverishment was higher among patients seeking outpatient treatment (80.4% and 67%, respectively) than hospitalization (29.8% and 17.2%, respectively). The odds of incurring CHE was 7.4 times higher among poorer patients [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 7.414] than richest. Enrolment in PM-JAY (CHE AOR = 0.426, and impoverishment AOR = 0.395) or a state sponsored scheme (CHE AOR = 0.304 and impoverishment AOR = 0.371) resulted in a significant reduction in CHE and impoverishment for an episode of hospitalization. The prevalence of CHE and impoverishment was significantly higher with hospitalization in private hospitals and longer duration of hospital stay (p < 0.001). The extent of CHE and impoverishment due to direct costs incurred on outpatient treatment increased from 83% to 99.7% and, 63.9% to 97.1% after considering both direct and indirect costs borne by the patient and caregivers, respectively. In case of hospitalization, the extent of CHE increased from 23.6% (direct cost) to 59.4% (direct+ indirect costs) and impoverishment increased from 14.1% (direct cost) to 27% due to both direct and indirect cost of cancer treatment. ConclusionThere is high economic burden on patients and their families due to cancer treatment. The increase in population and cancer services coverage of PFHI schemes, creating prepayment mechanisms like E-RUPI for outpatient diagnostic and staging services, and strengthening public hospitals can potentially reduce the financial burden among cancer patients in India. The disaggregated OOPE estimates could be useful input for future health technology analyses to determine cost-effective treatment strategies.

AB  - BackgroundNeuropathic Tremor (NT) is a postural/kinetic tremor of the upper extremity, often encountered in patients with chronic neuropathies such as paraprotein-associated and hereditary neuropathies. ObjectivesTo describe the clinical and electrophysiological features of NT in a previously underrecognized setting- during recovery from Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). MethodsPatients with a documented diagnosis of GBS in the past, presenting with tremor were identified from review of clinical records. Participants underwent structured, videotaped neurological examination, and electrophysiological analysis using tri-axial accelerometry-surface electromyography. Tremor severity was assessed using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale. ResultsWe describe the clinical and electrophysiological features of 5 patients with GBS associated NT. Our cohort had a fine, fast, and slightly jerky postural tremor of frequency ranging from 8 to 10 Hz. Dystonic posturing and overflow movements were noted in 4/5 patients. Tremor appeared 3 months-5 years after the onset of GBS, when patients had regained near normal muscle strength and deep tendon jerks were well elicitable. Electrophysiological analysis of tremor strongly suggested the presence of a central oscillator in all patients. ConclusionNT is not limited to chronic inflammatory or hereditary neuropathies and may occur in the recovery phase of GBS. The tremor is characterized by a high frequency, jerky postural tremor with dystonic posturing. Electrophysiological evaluation suggests the presence of a central oscillator, hypothetically the cerebellum driven by impaired sensorimotor feedback.

AB  - We present N-imidazopyridine-noscapinoids, a new class of noscapine derivatives that bind to tubulin and exhibit antiproliferative activity against triple positive (MCF-7) and triple negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. The N-atom of the isoquinoline ring of noscapine scaffold was altered in silico by coupling the imidazo [(Ye et al., 1998; Ke et al., 2000) 1,21,2-a] pyridine pharmacophore to rationally develop a series of N-imidazo-pyridine-noscapinoids (7-11) with high tubulin binding affinity. The predicted & UDelta;Gbinding of the N-imidazopyr-idine-noscapinoids 7-11 varied from-27.45 to-36.15 kcal/mol, a much lower value than noscapine with & UDelta;Gbinding-22.49 kcal/mol. The cytotoxicity of N-imidazopyridine-noscapinoids was evaluated using hormone dependent MCF-7, triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds (represented as IC50 concentration) ranges between 4.04 and 33.93 & mu;M against breast cancer cells without affecting normal cells (IC50 value > 952 & mu;M). All the compounds (7-11) perturbed the cell cycle progression at G2/M phase and triggered apoptosis. Among all the N-imidazopyridine-noscapinoids, N-5-Bromoimidazopyridine-noscapine (9) showed promising antiproliferative activity and was selected for detailed investigation. The onset of apoptosis treated with 9 using MDA-MB-231 revealed morphological changes like cellular shrinkage, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic bodies formation. Along with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), there was a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting in-duction of apoptosis to cancer cells. Compound 9 was also found to significantly regress the implanted tumour in nude mice as xenografts of MCF-7 cells without any apparent side effects after drug administration. We conclude that N-imidazopyridine-noscapinoids possess excellent potential as a promising drug for treating breast cancers.

AB  - With a high mortality rate that accounts for millions of cancer-related deaths each year, breast cancer is the second most common malignancy in women. Chemotherapy has significant potential in the prevention and spreading of breast cancer; however, drug resistance often hinders therapy in breast cancer patients. The identification and the use of novel molecular biomarkers, which can predict response to chemotherapy, might lead to tailoring breast cancer treatment. In this context, accumulating research has reported microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for early cancer detection, and are conducive to designing a more specific treatment plan by helping analyze drug resistance and sensitivity in breast cancer treatment. In this review, miRNAs are discussed in two alternative ways-as tumor suppressors to be used in miRNA replacement therapy to reduce oncogenesis and as oncomirs to lessen the translation of the target miRNA. Different miRNAs like miR-638, miR-17, miR-20b, miR-342, miR-484, miR-21, miR-24, miR-27, miR-23 and miR-200 are involved in the regulation of chemoresistance through diverse genetic targets. For instance, tumor-suppressing miRNAs like miR-342, miR-16, miR-214, and miR-128 and tumor-promoting miRNAs like miR101 and miR-106-25 cluster regulate the cell cycle, apoptosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and other pathways to impart breast cancer drug resistance. Hence, in this review, we have discussed the significance of miRNA biomarkers that could assist in providing novel therapeutic targets to overcome potential chemotherapy resistance to systemic therapy and further facilitate the design of tailored therapy for enhanced efficacy against breast cancer.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause mild to severe illness in children. It is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children under the age of one year, and it can also affect older children and adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions. In the post-COVID period, there seems to be an increase in the incidence, possibly due to 'immunity debt'. Symptoms of RSV infection in children may include fever, runny nose, and cough. In severe cases, it can lead to bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lungs) or pneumonia (infection of the lungs). Most children with RSV infection recover within a week or two, but some may require hospitalization, especially those who are premature or have underlying medical conditions. As there is no specific treatment for RSV infection, supportive care is the mainstay of management. In severe cases, oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation may be necessary. High flow nasal cannula seems to be beneficial. There have been promising advances in development of RSV vaccines; few trials in adults and pregnant women have reported encouraging results. The US FDA has approved two RSV vaccines for use in older adults (GSK's Arexvy and Pfizer's ABRYSVO)

AB  - Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) management during pregnancy is challenging. In this retrospective study, hospital records of CML patients treated between 2000 and 2021 were screened to identify patients who tried to conceive/got pregnant (planned and unplanned) on TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors)/were pregnant at CML onset/fathered a child. We found ninety-three pregnancies involving thirty-three women and thirty-eight men, and they were analyzed for the pregnancy outcomes and the strategies utilized for CML management during pregnancy and the pre-conception period. There were two women and four men with primary infertility and five women with secondary infertility. TKIs were discontinued before conception in four planned pregnancies and at the time of recognition of pregnancy in unplanned pregnancies (n = 21). Unplanned pregnancy outcomes were two miscarriages, eight elective terminations, and eleven live births. Planned pregnancies led to four healthy babies. Outcomes of pregnancies at CML onset (n = 17) were six live births, one stillbirth, five elective terminations, and five abortions. Except for one child with congenital micro-ophthalmia, no other child born to the women on TKI had any malformations. Thirty-eight men fathered 51 healthy children. All but two patients (one planned and one unplanned pregnancy) lost their hematological responses during pregnancy and gained their previous best response after restarting TKI. In women who were pregnant at CML onset, complete cytological remission (CCYR) was achieved between 7 and 24 months (median:14 months) after starting TKI. During pregnancy, intermittent hydroxyurea +/- TKI (in the second and third trimesters) was used to keep WBCs less than 30,000/mm3. Outcomes of pregnancies in CML patients can be optimized with our approach. TKIs (Imatinib and Nilotinib) can be safely used in the second and third trimesters. Delayed initiation or interruption of TKI during pregnancy does not negatively affect response to TKIs.

AB  - Diabetes is a major public health problem due to morbidity and mortality associated with end organ complications. Uptake of fatty acids by Fatty Acid Transport Protein-2 (FATP2) contributes to hyperglycemia, diabetic kidney and liver disease pathogenesis. Because FATP2 structure is unknown, a homology model was constructed, validated by AlphaFold2 prediction and site-directed mutagenesis, and then used to conduct a virtual drug discovery screen. In silico similarity searches to two low-micromolar IC50 FATP2 inhibitors, followed by docking and pharmacokinetics predictions, narrowed a diverse 800,000 compound library to 23 hits. These candidates were further evaluated for inhibition of FATP2-dependent fatty acid uptake and apoptosis in cells. Two compounds demonstrated nanomolar IC50, and were further characterized by molecular dynamic simulations. The results highlight the feasibility of combining a homology model with in silico and in vitro screening, to economically identify high affinity inhibitors of FATP2, as potential treatment for diabetes and its complications.

AB  - This paper reports on glycogen store in the retinal horizontal cells (HC) of the African mud catfish Clarias gariepinus, as seen by histochemical reaction with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and transmission electron microscopy in light- as well as dark-adapted state. Glycogen is abundant in the large somata and less in their axons, characterised ultrastructurally by many microtubules and extensive gap junctions interconnecting them. There was no apparent difference in glycogen content in HC somata between light- and dark adaptation, but the axons clearly showed absence of glycogen in dark condition. The HC somata (presynaptic) make synapses with dendrites in the outer plexiform layer. Muller cell inner processes, which contain more densely packed glycogen, invest the HC. Other cells of the inner nuclear layer do not show any appreciable content of glycogen. Rods, but not cones, contain abundant glycogen in their inner segments and synaptic terminals. It is likely that glycogen is used as energy substrate in hypoxia for this species that dwell muddy aquatic environment with low oxygen content. They appear to have high energy demand, and a high glycogen content in HC could act as a ready source to fulfil physiological processes, like microtubule-based transport of cargo from the large somata to axons and the maintenance of electrical activities across the gap junctions between the axonal processes. It is also likely that they can supplement glucose to the neighbouring inner nuclear layer neurons, which are clearly devoid of glycogen.

AB  - Male reproductive functions and bone health are both adversely affected by the high salt diet (HSD). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism via which it alters the sperm function remains largely unknown. This study examines the mechanism by which HSD affects male fertility by impairing bone health. For investigating the same, male BALB/c mice were categorized into three groups-HSD group (fed with 4% NaCl), a low salt diet (LSD) group (fed with 0.4% NaCl), and a control group (fed with a normal diet) for 6 weeks and thereafter assessed for various sperm parameters, bone turnover markers, and testosterone levels. Furthermore, the quantitative assessment of testosterone biosynthesis enzymes was performed. Interestingly, we observed that mice fed with HSD showed significant alterations in sperm parameters-motility, count, and vitality, including morphological changes compared to both the LSD and the control groups. In addition, serum analysis showed an increase in bone resorption markers and a decrease in bone formation markers in the HSD group (p < 0.05). Further, HSD caused a decrease in the testosterone level and mRNA expression of testosterone biosynthesis enzymes. Importantly, a significant decrease in bone formation marker osteocalcin (OC) was observed to coincide with the dip in testosterone level in the HSD group. Given that OC plays a key role in maintaining male fertility, the above findings suggest that a decrease in OC levels may affect the testosterone biosynthesis pathway, reducing testosterone hormone secretion and thereby resulting in decreased spermatogenesis. The study for the first time delineates and bridges the mechanism of HSD-mediated bone loss (results in a deficiency of OC) with decreased testosterone biosynthesis and thus impaired male fertility.

AB  - Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS) is a rare variant of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors located mostly in the intra-abdominal region. Herein, we present a case of a 32-year-old male with a lobulated growth in the right maxilla. Radi-ology revealed a solitary osteolytic lesion with an irregular margin, causing buccal and palatal cortex erosion. Histopathology revealed a tumor composed of spindle-shaped fascicles that blend into sheets of round to ovoid-shaped epithelioid cells, areas of myxoid changes, and necrosis. Tumor cells showed a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, large vesicular nuclei with coarse chromatin, nuclear pleomorphism, and increased mitoses. Tumor cells were immunopositive for ALK-1, focal positivity for smooth muscle actin, panCK, epithelial membrane antigen, and immunonegativity for CD 30, desmin, CD34, and STAT6. P53 showed a wild-type staining pattern, and INI-1 expression was retained. The Ki-67 proliferative index was 22%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of EIMS occurring in the maxilla. (Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol 2023;136: e15-e19)

AB  - Introduction: Despite an 18%-30% prevalence, there is no consensus regarding pathogenesis of emergence delirium after anesthesia in children. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical neuroimaging modality that relies on blood oxygen level-dependent response, translating to a mean increase in oxyhemoglobin and a decrease in deoxyhemoglobin. We aimed to correlate the emergence delirium in the postoperative period with the changes in the frontal cortex utilizing fNIRS reading primarily and also with blood glucose, serum electrolytes, and preoperative anxiety scores.Methods: A total of 145 ASA I and II children aged 2-5 years, undergoing ocular examination under anesthesia, were recruited by recording the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score after acquiring the Institute Ethics Committee approval and written informed parental consent. Induction and maintenance were done with O2, N2O, and Sevoflurane. The emergence delirium was assessed using the PAED score in the postoperative period. The frontal cortex fNIRS recordings were taken throughout anesthesia.Results: A total of 59 children (40.7%) had emergence delirium. The ED+ group had a significant activation left superior frontal cortex (t = 2.26E+00; p = .02) and right middle frontal cortex (t = 2.27E+00; p = .02) during induction, significant depression in the left middle frontal (t = -2.22E+00; p = .02), left superior frontal and bilateral medial (t = -3.01E+00; p = .003), right superior frontal and bilateral medial (t = -2.44E+00; p = .015), bilateral medial and superior (t = -3.03E+00; p = .003), and right middle frontal cortex (t = -2.90E+00; p = .004) during the combined phase of maintenance, and significant activation in cortical activity in the left superior frontal cortex (t = 2.01E+00; p = .0047) during the emergence in comparison with the ED- group.Conclusion: There is significant difference in the change in oxyhemoglobin concentration during induction, maintenance, and emergence in specific frontal brain regions between children with and without emergence delirium.

AB  - Late detection and lack of precision diagnostics are the major challenges in cancer prevention and management. Biomarker discovery in specific cancers, especially at the pre-invasive stage, is vital for early diagnosis, positive treatment response, and good disease prognosis. Traditional diagnostic measures require invasive procedures such as tissue excision using a needle, an endoscope, and/or surgical resection which can be unsafe, expensive, and painful. Additionally, the presence of comorbid conditions in individuals might render them ineligible for undertaking a tissue biopsy, and in some cases, it is difficult to access tumours depending on the site of occurrence. In this context, liquid biopsies are being explored for their clinical significance in solid malignancies management. These non-invasive or minimally invasive methods are being developed primarily for identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted therapeutics. In this review, we have summarised the use and importance of liquid biopsy as significant tool in diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and therapeutic development. We have also discussed the challenges that are encountered and future perspective.

AB  - Background: Probiotics have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates. The probiotic species with the maximal benefits in neonates from low- and middle-income countries are unknown.
   Objective: To identify the strain of probiotics with the maximum benefit in preventing neonatal mortality, sepsis, and NEC using the Bayesian network meta-analysis.
   Search methods: We searched Medline via PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We also hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews to identify eligible studies.
   Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from LMICs comparing enteral supplementation of one or more probiotics with another probiotic species or placebo were included. Data collection and analysis: Two authors screened the studies, extracted the data, and examined the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tools. Bayesian networkmeta-analysis was performed using the "BUGSnet" package in R and RStudio (version 1.4.1103). The confidence in the findings was assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-analysis (CINeMA) web application.
   Results: Twenty-nine RCTs enrolling 4,906 neonates and evaluating 24 probiotics were included. Only 11 (38%) studies had a low risk of bias. All the studies compared the probiotics with a placebo; none had a head-to-head comparison of different probiotic species. Also, only one study each had evaluated most probiotic regimens. When compared to placebo, the combination of B longum, B bifidum, B infantis, and L acidophilusmay reduce the risk of mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.26; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.07 to 0.72), sepsis (RR 0.47; 95% CrI 0.25 to 0.83), and NEC (RR 0.31; 95% CrI 0.10 to 0.78) but the evidence is very uncertain. There is low certainty evidence that the single probiotic species, B lactis, could reduce the risk of mortality (RR 0.21; 0.05 to 0.66) and NEC (RR 0.09; 0.01 to 0.32).
   Conclusion: Given the low to very low certainty of evidence for the efficacy of the two probiotics found to reduce mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis, no firm conclusions can be made on the optimal probiotics for use in preterm neonates in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - BackgroundCongenital anomalies are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We aimed to review the common surgically correctable congenital anomalies with recent updates on the global disease burden and identify the factors affecting morbidity and mortality.MethodA literature review was done to assess the burden of surgical congenital anomalies with emphasis on those that present within the first 8000 days of life. The various patterns of diseases were analyzed in both low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC).ResultsSurgical problems such as digestive congenital anomalies, congenital heart disease and neural tube defects are now seen more frequently. The burden of disease weighs more heavily on LMIC. Cleft lip and palate has gained attention and appropriate treatment within many countries, and its care has been strengthened by global surgical partnerships. Antenatal scans and timely diagnosis are important factors affecting morbidity and mortality. The frequency of pregnancy termination following prenatal diagnosis of a congenital anomaly is lower in many LMIC than in HIC.ConclusionCongenital heart disease and neural tube defects are the most common congenital surgical diseases; however, easily treatable gastrointestinal anomalies are underdiagnosed due to the invisible nature of the condition. Current healthcare systems in most LMICs are still unprepared to tackle the burden of disease caused by congenital anomalies. Increased investment in surgical services is needed.

AB  - Purpose: To excise external angular dermoid cyst (EADC) by transconjunctival approach and compare the surgical outcomes with the standard transcutaneous approach.
   Design: This was a prospective, pilot, interventional, comparative study.
   Methods: Patients with EADC with no or minimal fixity to the underlying bone on palpation and limited to eyelid were recruited. Patients were randomized into 2 groups; group 1 included patients with transcutaneous approach, and group 2 included patients with transconjunctival approach. The parameters assessed were intraoperative complications, duration and ease of surgery, postoperative complications, and overall satisfaction.
   Results: Six children with a painless, round lesion in outer aspect of eyelid were recruited in each group. None of the patients had any intraoperative or postoperative complications, including dysfunction of eyelid contour and fold, persistence or late occurrence of lateral eyelid droop, excessive or recurrence of swelling, and ocular surface problems, especially in group 2, but a skin scar though hidden was inevitable in group 1. The duration of surgery was comparable with better ease of surgery in group 1 and a gradual learning curve in group 2. The overall satisfaction scores were significantly better in group 2 (p < 0.0001). In group 1, parents of 5 of 6 patients had to be reassured that the skin scar will fade with time.
   Conclusion: Transconjunctival excision of EADC is a viable and novel approach in patients with mobile cyst that is limited to the eyelid with no obvious bony fossa. Main limitations of the approach are that it requires surgical expertize, provides less surgical space, and has a gradual learning curve.

AB  - Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated chronic disorder triggered by the ingestion of wheat gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten is a major food ingredient, infamously containing proline and glutamine-rich domains that are highly resistant to digestion by mammalian proteolytic enzymes. Thus, adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only known treatment for CeD, albeit with many complications. Therefore, any therapy that eliminates the gluten immunogenic part before it reaches the small intestine is highly desirable. Probiotic therapy containing gluten-degrading bacteria (GDB) and their protease enzymes are possibly new approaches to treating CeD. Our study aimed to identify novel GDB from the duodenal biopsy of the first-degree relative (FDR) subjects (relatives of diseased individuals who are healthy but susceptible to celiac disease) with the potential to reduce gluten immunogenicity. Using the gluten agar plate technique, bacterial strains Brevibacterium casei NAB46 and Staphylococcus arlettae R2AA77 displaying glutenase activity were screened, identified, and characterized. Whole-genome sequencing found gluten-degrading prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) in the B. casei NAB46 genome and glutamyl endopeptidase (GEP) in the S. arlettae R2AA77 genome. Partially purified PEP has a specific activity of 1.15 U/mg, while GEP has a specific activity of 0.84 U/mg, which are, respectively, 6- and 9-fold times higher after concentrating the enzymes. Our results showed that these enzymes could hydrolyse immunotoxic gliadin peptides recognized in western blot using an anti-gliadin antibody. Additionally, a docking model was proposed for representative gliadin peptide PQPQLPYPQPQLP in the active site of the enzymes, where the residues of the N-terminal peptide extensively interact with the catalytic domain of the enzymes. These bacteria and their associated glutenase enzymes efficiently neutralize gliadin immunogenic epitopes, opening possibilities for their application as a dietary supplement in treating CeD patients.

AB  - IntroductionIntracranial myeloid sarcoma is a rare extramedullary presentation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It can involve the meninges and ependyma presenting as extra-axial mass lesion. Rarely, it can also invade the brain parenchyma. It is commonly seen in children. It is usually misdiagnosed due to its close resemblance to other intracranial tumors (meningioma, metastasis, Ewing's sarcomas, and lymphoma). These are underdiagnosed if they precede the diagnosis of leukemia.Case reportA 7-year-old boy with isolated intracranial myeloid sarcoma who presented with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) which was successfully managed by surgical excision.ConclusionIsolated intracranial myeloid sarcoma is a rare presentation of AML. Leukemia can be diagnosed early during the postoperative period and can be started on therapy timely. These patients requires regular follow-ups (clinical, laboratory and radiological) to detect relapses early.

AB  - In patients with movement disorders, voluntary movements can sometimes be accompanied by unintentional muscle contractions in other body regions. In this review, we discuss clinical and pathophysiological aspects of several motor phenomena including mirror movements, dystonic overflow, synkinesia, entrainment and mirror dystonia, focusing on their similarities and differences. These phenomena share some common clinical and pathophysiological features, which often leads to confusion in their definition. However, they differ in several aspects, such as the body part showing the undesired movement, the type of this movement (identical or not to the intentional movement), the underlying neurological condition, and the role of primary motor areas, descending pathways and inhibitory circuits involved, suggesting that these are distinct phenomena. We summarize the main features of these fascinating clinical signs aiming to improve the clinical recognition and standardize the terminology in research studies. We also suggest that the term "mirror dystonia" may be not appropriate to describe this peculiar phenomenon which may be closer to dystonic overflow rather than to the classical mirror movements.

AB  - Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) or exosomes are secretory vesicles largely involved in cell-cell communications and found to play a role in development as well as diseases including atherosclerosis. They hold a huge potential for translational research by devising better clinical diagnostics, biomarker discovery, drug delivery, and therapeutic strategies. Variations terms of morphology and distribution are crucial to biological function integrity. Moreover, it is dependent on susceptibility to influential factors of the environment like cell stress, inflammation, and secretion by different cells in subsequent biofluids. We have observed the morphological variations in sEVs or exosomes freshly isolated from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (AsCVD), in blood plasma, saliva, and urine biofluids compared to healthy controls. High-resolution images were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the characterization of sEVs morphology. Western blotting and immuno-TEM gold labeling confirmed the presence of exosome markers. For the first time, we report size and shape variations, which suggest the existence of different functions of sEVs in the disease state. Morphological variations in sEVs were observed significantly in noninvasive AsCVD saliva and urine samples, important to understand the cell behavior and physiological state. These variations will be useful to investigate their possible role in the disease process.

AB  - Thalassemia is among the most common hereditary disorders in the world. Approximately 5% of the world's population are carriers of hemoglobinopathies, and 2.9% are carriers of beta thalassemia. Haemoglobin A2 (HbA2) constitutes less than 3% of the total hemoglobin (Hb) in adults, and the determination of Hb A2 levels is important to diagnose the beta thalassemia trait (BTT). In some cases, the level of HbA2 is not typically elevated, and some difficulties may arise in making the diagnosis. Cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and HbCZE (haemoglobin capillary zone electrophoresis) are considered acceptable methods to diagnose BTT, but these vary in their accuracy and cut-offs. In this study, we attempted to compare HbA2 values using two methods, HPLC and HbCZE, in 536 whole blood samples sent by physician-ordered hemoglobinopathy screening over two years. This included antenatal women, patients with anemia not responding to iron, and cases of familial screening where either a child or a sibling had been diagnosed with hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia. The performance characteristics of both machines were compared for the detection of the 5 most common hemoglobin variants: Hb A, HbF, HbS, Hb C, and HbE. On comparing the HbA2 values, the HPLC showed higher values for HbA2 as compared to HbCZE, while the HbF and HbS measurement agreement was good between both methods. Normal ranges and mean normal values of HbA2 differ between different methods and different manufacturers; hence, each institute using these machines should validate its cutoffs.

AB  - Gliomas harbouring mutations in IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) are characterized by greater sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. These mutants also exhibit diminished levels of transcriptional coactivator YAP1 (yesassociated protein 1). Enhanced DNA damage in IDH1 mutant cells, as evidenced by & gamma;H2AX formation (phosphorylation of histone variant H2A.X) and ATM (serine/threonine kinase; ataxia telangiectasia mutated) phosphorylation, was accompanied by reduced FOLR1 (folate receptor 1) expression. Diminished FOLR1, concomitant with heightened & gamma;H2AX levels, was also observed in patient-derived IDH1 mutant glioma tissues. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, overexpression of mutant YAP1, and treatment with YAP1-TEAD (TEA domain transcription factors) complex inhibitor verteporfin demonstrated regulation of FOLR1 expression by YAP1 and its partner transcription factor TEAD2. TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data analysis demonstrated better patient survival with reduced FOLR1 expression. Depletion of FOLR1 rendered IDH1 wild-type gliomas more susceptible to temozolomide-mediated death. Despite heightened DNA damage, IDH1 mutants exhibited reduced levels of IL6 (interleukin 6) and IL8 (interleukin 8) - pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be associated with persistent DNA damage. While both FOLR1 and YAP1 influenced DNA damage, only YAP1 was involved in regulating IL6 and IL8. ESTIMATE and CIBERSORTx analyses revealed the association between YAP1 expression and immune cell infiltration in gliomas. By identifying the influence of YAP1-FOLR1 link in DNA damage, our findings suggest that simultaneous depletion of both could amplify the potency of DNA damaging agents, while concomitantly reducing the release of inflammatory mediators and potentially affecting immune modulation. This study also highlights the novel role of FOLR1 as a probable prognostic marker in gliomas, predicting responsiveness to temozolomide and other DNA damaging agents.

AB  - The benefits of large-scale genetic studies for healthcare of the populations studied are well documented, but these genetic studies have traditionally ignored people from some parts of the world, such as South Asia. Here we describe whole genome sequence (WGS) data from 4806 individuals recruited from the healthcare delivery systems of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, combined with WGS from 927 individuals from isolated South Asian populations. We characterize population structure in South Asia and describe a genotyping array (SARGAM) and imputation reference panel that are optimized for South Asian genomes. We find evidence for high rates of reproductive isolation, endogamy and consanguinity that vary across the subcontinent and that lead to levels of rare homozygotes that reach 100 times that seen in outbred populations. Founder effects increase the power to associate functional variants with disease processes and make South Asia a uniquely powerful place for population-scale genetic studies.

AB  - The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex of SARS-CoV-2 lies at the core of its replication and transcription processes. The interfaces between holo-RdRp subunits are highly conserved, facilitating the design of inhibitors with high affinity for the interaction interface hotspots. We, therefore, take this as a model protein complex for the application of a structural bioinformatics protocol to design peptides that inhibit RdRp complexation by preferential binding at the interface of its core subunit nonstructural protein, nsp12, with accessory factor nsp7. Here, the interaction hotspots of the nsp7-nsp12 subunit of RdRp, determined from a long molecular dynamics trajectory, are used as a template. A large library of peptide sequences constructed from multiple hotspot motifs of nsp12 is screened in-silico to determine sequences with high geometric complementarity and interaction specificity for the binding interface of nsp7 (target) in the complex. Two lead designed peptides are extensively characterized using orthogonal bioanalytical methods to determine their suitability for inhibition of RdRp complexation. Binding affinity of these peptides to accessory factor nsp7, determined using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, is slightly better than that of nsp12: dissociation constant of 133nM and 167nM, respectively, compared to 473nM for nsp12. A competitive ELISA is used to quantify inhibition of nsp7-nsp12 complexation, with one of the lead peptides giving an IC50 of 25 mu M . Cell penetrability and cytotoxicity are characterized using a cargo delivery assay and MTT cytotoxicity assay, respectively. Overall, this work presents a proof-of-concept of an approach for rational discovery of peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 protein-protein interactions.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of inferior vena cava (IVC) distensibility index ( increment IVC) and respiratory variation in peak aortic blood flow velocity ( increment Vpeak) to predict fluid responsiveness in ventilated children with shock and to find out the best cut-off values for predicting fluid responsiveness.MethodsIn this prospective observational study, conducted in a pediatric ICU from January 2019 through May 2020, consecutive children aged 2 mo to 17 y with shock requiring fluid bolus were included. increment IVC and increment Vpeak were measured before and immediately after 10 ml/kg fluid bolus administration. increment IVC and increment Vpeak were compared between responders and non-responders, defined by a change in stroke volume index (SVI) of >= 10%.ResultsThirty-seven ventilated children [26 (70.4%) boys] with median age of 60 (36, 108) mo were included. The median (IQR) increment IVC was 21.7% (14.3, 30.9) and the median (IQR) Delta Vpeak was 11.3% (7.2, 15.2). Twenty-three (62%) children were fluid responsive. The median (IQR) increment IVC was higher in responders compared to non-responders [26% (16.9, 36.5) vs. 17.2% (8.4, 21.9); p = 0.018] and mean (SD) Delta Vpeak was higher in responders [13.9% (6.1) vs. 8.4% (3.9), p = 0.004]. The prediction of fluid responsiveness with Delta IVC [ROC curve area 0.73 (0.56-0.9), p = 0.01] and Delta Vpeak [ROC curve area 0.78 (0.63-0.94), p = 0.002] was similar. The best cut-off of increment IVC to predict fluid responsiveness was 23% (sensitivity, 60.8%; specificity, 85.7%) and Delta Vpeak was 11.3% (sensitivity, 74%; specificity, 86%).ConclusionsIn this study, authors found that increment IVC and Delta Vpeak were good predictors of fluid responsiveness in ventilated children with shock.

AB  - A chest radiograph is the most common and the initial radiological investigation for evaluating a child presenting with respiratory complaints. However, performing and interpreting chest radiography optimally requires training and skill. With the relatively easy availability of computed tomography (CT) scanning and more recently multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), these investigations are often performed. Although these can be the cross-sectional imaging modalities of choice in certain situations where detailed and exact anatomical and etiological information is required, both these investigations are associated with increased radiation exposure which has more detrimental effects on children, especially when repeated follow-up imaging is necessary to assess the disease status. Ultrasonography (USG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have evolved as radiation-free radiological investigations for evaluating the pediatric chest pathologies over the last few years. In the present review article, the utility and the current status, as well as the limitations of USG and MRI for evaluation of pediatric chest pathologies, are discussed. Radiology has grown beyond having just the diagnostic capabilities in managing children with chest disorders in the last two decades. Image-guided therapeutic procedures (percutaneous and endovascular) are routinely performed in children with pathologies in the mediastinum and lungs. The commonly performed image-guided pediatric chest interventions, including biopsies, fine needle aspiration, drainage procedures and therapeutic endovascular procedures, are also discussed in the current review.

AB  - This review aims to discuss the role of medical and surgical therapy in the management of pediatric empyema. There is considerable debate on the optimal treatment for the same. Early intervention is crucial as it allows rapid recovery of these patients. Antibiotics and adequate pleural drainage form the two pillars in the management of empyema. Chest tube drainage alone has significant failure rates due to its inability to clear loculated effusion. The two main modalities which target these loculations to augment drainage are video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. The latest evidence shows that both these interventions are equally effective. Children who present late are usually not candidates for intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy or VATS; for them, decortication remains the only option.

AB  - Thrombocytopenia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. We report frequency, associations and short-term outcome of moderate-severe thrombocytopenia in a prospective inception cohort from India (INSPIRE). We evaluated consecutive SLE patients classified per SLICC2012 for the occurrence of thrombocytopenia and its associations. The outcomes assessed included bleeding manifestations, kinetics of thrombocytopenia recovery, mortality and recurrence of thrombocytopenia. Among a total of 2210 patients in the cohort, 230 (10.4%) had incident thrombocytopenia, of whom moderate (platelet count [PC] 20-50 x 10(9)/L) and severe thrombocytopenia (PC < 20 x 10(9)/L) were noted in 61 (26.5%) and 22 (9.5%), respectively. Bleeding manifestations were generally limited to the skin. Compared to controls, cases had a higher proportion of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (p < 0.001), leukopenia (p < 0.001), lymphopenia (p < 0.001), low complement (p < 0.05), lupus anticoagulant (p < 0.001), higher median SLEDAI 2 K (p < 0.001) and lower proportion of anti-RNP antibody (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in these variables between moderate and severe thrombocytopenia. There was a sharp rise in PC by 1 week that was sustained in the majority through the period of observation. There was three times higher mortality in the severe thrombocytopenia group as compared to moderate thrombocytopenia and controls. The thrombocytopenia relapse and lupus flare rates were similar across categories. We report a low occurrence of major bleeds and higher mortality in those with severe thrombocytopenia as compared to moderate thrombocytopenia and controls.

AB  - Background: Moisturizers are first-line therapy for treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Although there are multiple types of moisturizers available, head-to-head trials between different moisturizers are limited.Objective: To evaluate if a paraffin-based moisturizer is as effective as ceramidebased moisturizer in children with AD.Materials and Methods: In this double-blind, randomized comparative trial of pediatric patients with mild to moderate AD, subjects applied either a paraffin-based or ceramide-based moisturizer twice daily. Clinical disease activity using SCOring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), quality of life using Children/Infants Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI/IDLQI), and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured at baseline and at follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months.Results: Fifty-three patients were recruited (27 ceramide group and 26 paraffin group) with a mean age of 8.2 years and mean disease duration of 60 months. The mean change in SCORAD at 3 months in the ceramide-based and paraffin-based moisturizer groups was 22.1 and 21.4, respectively (p = .37). The change in CDLQI/IDLQI, TEWL over forearm and back, amount and days of topical corticosteroid required, median time to remission and disease-free days at 3 months were similar in both groups. As the 95% confidence interval (CI) of mean change in SCORAD at 3 months in both groups (0.78, 95% CI:-7.21 to 7.52) was not within the predefined margin of equivalence (-4 to +4), the conclusion of equivalence could not be proven.Conclusion: Both the paraffin-based and ceramide-based moisturizers were comparable in improving the disease activity in children with mild to moderate AD.

AB  - Single crystals of piperazinium hydrogenisophthalate have been grown by slow cooling of a saturated ethanol solution. The crystalline compound has been confirmed and the structure refinement of the grown crystal is revealed for the first time in the literature. The title molecule is found to have P2(1)/c space group in the monoclinic crystal system. The crystals are comprised of a 1:2 ratio of piperazinium cations, which lie on a centre of symmetry, and hydrogenisophthalate anions which are linked together into a 3D network by N-H center dot center dot center dot O, O-H center dot center dot center dot O and C-H center dot center dot center dot O intermolecular and intra molecular hydrogen bonds. Optical transmittance study revealed that the grown crystal is significantly transparent to be utilized for optical applications. Birefringence study of the grown crystal reveals that the compound has uniform fringes thus proving the optical homogeneity and better quality of the grown crystal. Theoretical calculations were done using Gaussian 09 software and the results are given in comparison with the experimental data. The nonlinear optical property of the grown crystal has been assessed by Z- scan study.

AB  - Background: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is part of India's HIV prevention policy. We aimed to determine awareness of and willingness-to-use PrEP among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) and transgender-persons (TG) in Delhi, India.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at five purposively selected targeted-intervention projects in Delhi. Participants included self-identified MSM/TG aged >= 18 years, with negative/unknown HIV serostatus. A structured interview schedule, developed using formative research, was used. Primary outcomes were awareness of, and willingness-to-use PrEP. Socio-demographic and behaviour variables included age, living situation, education, anal-sex, condom-use and experiences of physical-violence. Determinants of outcome were identified in univariable logistic regression; variables associated at p < .25 were included in multivariable regression models.Results: Of 400 (224 MSM, 176 TG), mean +/- SD age 25.7 +/- 7.2 years, 14.5% (95% CI 11.0, 18.0) were aware of PrEP, while 63.3% (95% CI: 58.6, 68.1) reported willingness-to-use PrEP. PrEP-awareness was independently associated with formal-education (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20), professional occupation (AOR = 5.45) and condom-use (AOR = 3.07). Willingness-to-use PrEP was higher if participants had recent anal-sex (AOR = 2.29), had used condoms during anal-sex (AOR = 2.09), or recently experienced physical-violence (AOR = 3.65).Conclusions: PrEP awareness was low, but most were willing to use PrEP, implying that communication is key to PrEP awareness and uptake.

AB  - Objective: Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) is an iono-tropic transmembrane receptor for glutamate. AMPA receptor blockers have been reported to prevent neurological damage and enhance the post stroke recovery in rats. Decanoic acid, a medium-chain fatty acid, has been reported to exhibit non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonism. This study evaluated the effect of dec-anoic acid administered before and after ischemia reperfusion injury on neurologi-cal damage and post stroke recovery in rats. Methods: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) was performed by using the intraluminal method to induce focal cerebral ischemia. Decanoic acid (120 mg/kg) was administered orally for 1 day (5-10 min post reperfusion) in one group and for 2 days (24 h pre and 5-10 min post reperfusion) in the other group. Effect on neurological damage and post stroke recovery was assessed by neurobehavioral parameters, MRI and TTC staining along with inflammatory, oxidative, apoptotic, and neuroprotective biomarkers. Results: Decanoic acid significantly reduced the MCAo induced neurological dam-age and infarct size. Decanoic acid treatment increased the motor coordination and grip strength. Furthermore, levels of inflammatory (TNFa, IL-1b and IL-6), oxida-tive stress (MDA), apoptotic (TUNEL positive cells) and neurological injury (GFAP) biomarkers were reduced after decanoic acid treatment. Anti-inflammatory cyto-kine (IL-10) and neuroprotective markers (NT-3, BDNF and TrkB) were found to be significantly increased with decanoic acid treatment. Conclusion: This study showed protective effects of decanoic acid against ischemia reperfusion injury in rats. Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-apoptotic properties may be responsible for the beneficial effects of decanoic acid observed in the study.

AB  - ObjectivesThe primary objective of the study was to assess the feasibility and sustainability of the implementation of the point of care quality improvement (POCQI) methodology for improving the quality of neonatal care at the level 2 special newborn care unit (SNCU). Additional objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the quality improvement (QI) and preterm baby package training model.MethodsThis study was conducted in a level-II SNCU. The study period was divided into baseline; intervention and sustenance phases. The primary outcome i.e., feasibility was defined as completion of training for 80% or more health care professionals (HCPs) through workshops, their attendance in subsequent review meetings and, successful accomplishment of at least two plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles in each project.ResultsOf the total, 1217 neonates were enrolled during the 14 mo study period; 80 neonates in the baseline, 1019 in intervention and 118 in sustenance phases. Feasibility of training was achieved within a month of initiation of intervention phase; 22/24 (92%) nurses and 14/15 (93%) doctors attended the meetings. The outcomes of individual projects suggested an improvement in proportion of neonates being given exclusive breast milk on day 5 (22.8% to 78%); mean difference (95% CI) [55.2 (46.5 to 63.9)]. Neonates on any antibiotics declined, proportion of any enteral feeds on day one and duration of kangaroo mother care (KMC) increased. Proportion of neonates receiving intravenous fluids during phototherapy decreased.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates the feasibility, sustainability, and effectiveness of a facility-team-driven QI approach augmented with capacity building and post-training supportive supervision.

AB  - Tumor-induced changes in the peritumoral neocortex play a crucial role in generation of seizures. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in peritumoral epilepsy in low-grade gliomas (LGGs). Intraoperative peritumoral brain tissues resected from LGG patients with seizures (pGRS) or without seizures (pGNS) were used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Comparative transcriptomics was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pGRS compared to pGNS using deseq2 and edgeR packages (R). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes & Genomes (KEGG) pathways was performed using the clusterProfiler package (R). The expression of key genes was validated at the transcript and protein levels in the peritumoral region using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A total of 1073 DEGs were identified in pGRS compared to pGNS, of which 559 genes were upregulated and 514 genes were downregulated (log2 fold-change >= 2, padj < 0.001). The DEGs in pGRS were highly enriched in the "Glutamatergic Synapse" and "Spliceosome" pathways, with increased expression of GRIN2A (NR2A), GRIN2B (NR2B), GRIA1 (GLUR1), GRIA3 (GLUR3), GRM5, CACNA1C, CACNA1A, and ITPR2. Moreover, increased immunoreactivity was observed for NR2A, NR2B, and GLUR1 proteins in the peritumoral tissues of GRS. These findings suggest that altered glutamatergic signaling and perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis may be potential causes of peritumoral epilepsy in gliomas. This explorative study identifies important genes/pathways that merit further characterization for their potential involvement in glioma-related seizures.

AB  - BackgroundAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) frequently complicates asthma. There is urgent need to develop evidence-based guidelines for the management of ABPA in children. The Evidence Based Guideline Development Group (EBGDG) of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) National Respiratory Chapter (NRC) addressed this need.MethodsThe EBGDG shortlisted clinical questions relevant to the management of ABPA in asthma. For each question, the EBGDG undertook a systematic, step-wise evidence search for existing guidelines, followed by systematic reviews, followed by primary research studies. The evidence was collated, critically appraised, and synthesized. The EBGDG worked through the Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework, to formulate recommendations, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.ResultsSeven clinical questions were prioritized, and the following recommendations formulated. (1) Children with poorly controlled asthma should be investigated for ABPA (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). (2) Low dose steroid therapy regimen (0.5 mg/kg/d for the first 2 wk, followed by a progressive tapering) is preferable to higher dose regimens (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). (3) Oral steroid regimens longer than 16 wk (including tapering), should not be used (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). (4) Antifungals may or may not be added to steroid therapy as the evidence was neither in favour nor against (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). (5) For clinicians using antifungal agents, the EBGDG recommends against using voriconazole instead of itraconazole (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). (6) No evidence-based recommendation could be framed for using pulse steroid therapy in preference to conventional steroid therapy. (7) Immunotherapy with biologicals including omalizumab or dupilumab is not recommended (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).ConclusionsThis evidence-based guideline can be used by healthcare providers in diverse clinical settings.

AB  - Foreign body (FB) aspiration is a potentially life-threatening accident in children. Traditionally, rigid bronchoscopy has been the procedure of choice for FB removal, however it may miss distally lodged FBs. We report two pediatric cases with distal impacted FBs that could not be retrieved by rigid bronchoscopy (RB) and were mobilised using Fogarty balloon followed by flexible bronchoscopic cryoextraction. The advantage of a cryoprobe is lower risk of fragmentation of FB that may occur with forceps. Cryoextraction is particularly advantageous for removing water-containing FBs. In both patients, FB was removed more than 2 weeks following aspiration, leading to the formation of granulation tissue around the FB, which considerably hampered the process. Using a laryngeal mask airway to secure the airway, FB removal by flexible bronchoscopy may be a safe and effective technique in skilled hands, especially for FBs impacted in distal airways with granulation tissue where RB fails.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in tears/conjunctival epithelium and assess the cytomorphological changes in the conjunctival epithelium of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: In this pilot study, patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 were recruited from the COVID ward/intensive care unit of the institute. Tears and conjunctival swabs were collected from COVID-19 patients and sent to the virology laboratory for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Conjunctival swabs were used to prepare smears, which underwent cytological evaluation and immunocytochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Results: Forty-two patients were included. The mean age of participants was 48.61 (range: 5-75) years. Seven (16.6%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in tears samples, four (9.5%) of which were positive on conjunctival swab by RT-PCR in the first test. Cytomorphological changes were observed significantly more in smears from patients with positive RT-PCR on tear samples, including bi-/multi-nucleation (p = 0.01), chromatin clearing (p = 0.02), and intra-nuclear inclusions (p < 0.001). One case (3.2%) showed immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2; this patient had severe disease and the lowest Ct values for tear and conjunctival samples among all positive cases. Conclusion: Conjunctival smears from patients with COVID-19 revealed cytomorphological alterations, even in the absence of clinically significant ocular infection. However, viral proteins were demonstrated within epithelial cells only rarely, suggesting that although the conjunctival epithelium may serve as a portal for entry, viral replication is possibly rare or short-lived.

AB  - Collagen vascular disorders (CVDs), also known as connective tissue diseases (CTDs), are a heterogeneous group of entities that affect the connective tissues and are capable of causing end-organ damage to multiple systems, primarily cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal. However, the occurrence and severity are highly variable among patients. Ocular involvement occurs in a significant number of these disorders and may precede the onset of other extraocular features, thereby serving as an important marker in the diagnosis of these diseases. A timely and accurate diagnosis enables the management of complications. CTDs are primarily immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; however, classifications have encompassed heritable disorders affecting collagen-containing structures and disorders of vascular development. A review of literature published until 25 January 2022 and collected from various databases using the relevant keywords was conducted. All publications (original articles, review articles, as well as case reports) describing the ocular features in CTDs were studied in detail. The objective of this review is to recognize the common ophthalmic presentations of various autoimmune and heritable CTDs, distinguish them from overlapping diseases, elaborate on the prognosis and management of these varied eye presentations, and deliberate on their impact on other ophthalmic surgeries.

AB  - Background: A theranostic probe for accurate staging and treatment is crucial for the management of medullary thyroid cancers (MTCs). The abundance of stroma in most of thyroid cancers, including MTC, opens new avenues for selecting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as new molecular imaging and therapeutic targets. [Ga-68]Ga-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPi) molecules have gained importance as alternative molecular imaging agents in the imaging of thyroid cancers. The purpose of this study was to compare the detection efficiency of primary and metastatic lesions of MTCs between [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi and [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers.Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC and [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT (computed tomography) images were compared using patient-based and lesion-based analysis in patients with MTC for follow-up assessment. The quantitative assessment included comparing standardized uptake values corrected for lean body mass (SULpeak) and tumor-to-background ratios (TBR). The findings on both scans were validated with the morphological findings of the diagnostic CT.Results: Twenty-seven patients (21 males and 6 females) with a mean age of 42.4 +/- 13.2 years (range 14-66 years) were included in the study. [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi had similar sensitivities as that of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT for detecting primary tumors (100% [18 of 18] vs. 94.4% [17 of 18], p = 0.979) involved lymph nodes (98.3% [118 of 120] vs. 95% [114 of 120], p = 0.288), and brain metastases (100%). [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi demonstrated significantly higher sensitivities than [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT for detecting lung nodules (93.5% [87 of 93] vs. 68.9% [64 of 93], p < 0.0001), liver (100% [105 of 105] vs. 46.4% [49 of 105], p < 0.0001), bone (92.4% [110 of 119] vs. 76.5% [91 of 119], p = 0.001), and pleural metastases 98.2% versus 0%. Higher uptake values and TBR values were reported with [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi compared with that of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC.Conclusion: [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi outperformed [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT in the detection of distant metastases with both patient-based and lesion-based analysis in MTCs.

AB  - Background and aims: Despite its inclusion in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, there is a virtual paucity of high-quality scientific evidence about compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD), especially in underrepresented and underserved populations. Therefore, we comprehensively examined CSBD across 42 countries, genders, and sexual orientations, and validated the original (CSBD-19) and short (CSBD-7) versions of the Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder Scale to provide standardized, state-of-the-art screening tools for research and clinical practice. Method: Using data from the International Sex Survey (N = 82,243; Mage = 32.39 years, SD = 12.52), we evaluated the psychometric properties of the CSBD-19 and CSBD-7 and compared CSBD across 42 countries, three genders, eight sexual orientations, and individuals with low vs. high risk of experiencing CSBD. Results: A total of 4.8% of the participants were at high risk of experiencing CSBD. Country-and gender-based differences were observed, while no sexual-orientation-based differences were present in CSBD levels. Only 14% of individuals with CSBD have ever sought treatment for this disorder, with an additional 33% not having sought treatment because of various reasons. Both versions of the scale demonstrated excellent validity and reliability. Discussion and conclusions: This study contributes to a better understanding of CSBD in underrepresented and underserved populations and facilitates its identification in diverse populations by providing freely accessible ICD-11-based screening tools in 26 languages. The findings may also serve as a crucial building block to stimulate research into evidence-based, culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies for CSBD that are currently missing from the literature.

AB  - Sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality in children, yet definitions for pediatric sepsis are outdated and lack global applicability and validity. In adults, the Sepsis-3 Definition Taskforce queried databases from high-income countries to develop and validate the criteria. The merit of this definition has been widely acknowledged; however, important considerations about less-resourced and more diverse settings pose challenges to its use globally. To improve applicability and relevance globally, the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce sought to develop a conceptual framework and rationale of the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the optimal operationalization of future pediatric sepsis definitions. It is important to address challenges in developing a set of pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illnesses with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. Ideal criteria need to be unambiguous, and capable of adapting to the different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. Additionally, criteria need to facilitate early recognition and timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression and limit life-threatening organ dysfunction. To address these challenges, locally adaptable solutions are required, which permit individualized care based on available resources and the pretest probability of sepsis. This should facilitate affordable diagnostics which support risk stratification and prediction of likely treatment responses, and solutions for locally relevant outcome measures. For this purpose, global collaborative databases need to be established, using minimum variable datasets from routinely collected data. In summary, a "Think globally, act locally" approach is required.

AB  - Despite revolutionizing the field of oncological imaging, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with [F-18]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as its workhorse is limited by a lack of specificity and low sensitivity in certain tumor subtypes. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that form a major component of the tumor stroma. FAP holds the promise to be a pan-cancer target, owing to its selective over-expression in a vast majority of neoplasms, particularly epithelial cancers. Several radiolabeled FAP inhibitors (FAPI) have been developed for molecular imaging and potential theranostic applications. Preliminary data on FAPI PET/CT remains encouraging, with extensive multi-disciplinary clinical research currently underway. This review summarizes the existing literature on FAPI PET/CT imaging with an emphasis on diagnostic applications, comparison with FDG, pitfalls, and future directions.

AB  - The world is heading towards an era of intractable and impending untreatable N. gonorrhoeae, thereby underlining the significance of rapid and accurate prediction of drug resistance as an indispensable need of the hour. In the present study, we optimized and evaluated a stable isotope labeling-based approach using the MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry) for rapid and reliable detection of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. All the isolates were cultured under three varied condition setups viz. medium supplemented with normal lysine, heavy lysine (isotope), and heavy lysine along with the antibiotics (ciprofloxacin/azithromycin), respectively. After incubation, spectra were acquired using the MALDI-TOF MS which were further screened for unique patterns (media-specific spectra) to differentiate drug-susceptible and resistant isolates. The results of the stable isotope labeling assay were comparable to the results of phenotypic methods used for susceptibility testing.

AB  - BackgroundWe present post-vaccination nasal shedding findings from the phase IV, community-based, triple-blinded RCT conducted to assess efficacy of trivalent LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccines in rural north India. MethodsChildren aged 2-10 years received LAIV or intranasal placebo across 2015 and 2016, as per initial allocation. On days 2 and 4 post-vaccination, trained study nurses collected nasal swabs from randomly selected subset of trial participants based on operational feasibility, accounting for 10.0% and 11.4% of enrolled participants in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Swabs were collected in viral transport medium and transported under cold chain to laboratory for testing by reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction. ResultsIn year 1, on day 2 post-vaccination, 71.2% (74/104) of LAIV recipients shed at least one of vaccine virus strains compared to 42.3% (44/104) on day 4. During year 1, on day 2 post-vaccination, LAIV-A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected in nasal swabs of 12% LAIV recipients, LAIV-A(H3N2) in 41%, and LAIV-B in 59%. In year 2, virus shedding was substantially lower; 29.6% (32/108) of LAIV recipients shed one of the vaccine virus strains on day 2 compared to 21.3% on day 4 (23/108). ConclusionAt day 2 post-vaccination in year 1, two-thirds of LAIV recipients were shedding vaccine viruses. Shedding of vaccine viruses varied between strains and was lower in year 2. More research is needed to determine the reason for lower virus shedding and vaccine efficacy for LAIV-A(H1N1)pdm09.

AB  - Background and Aim: There is limited literature on the prevalence of mixed features in patients with depression, especially from countries in Asia. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of "mixed features" in patients with first-episode depression. Materials and Methods: Patients with first-episode depression were evaluated for the presence of mixed features as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-5 criteria. They were additionally evaluated on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Results: About one-sixth (16%) of the patients fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria for the mixed features specifier. The most common manic/hypomanic clinical feature was increased talkativeness or pressure of speech, followed by elevated expansive mood (12.5%), and inflated self-esteem or grandiosity was the least common feature (8.7%). Those with mixed features had higher prevalence of comorbid tobacco dependence and psychotic symptoms. In terms of frequency of depressive symptoms as assessed on HDRS, compared to those without mixed features, those with mixed features had higher frequency of symptoms such as depressed mood, insomnia during early hours of morning, work and activities, agitation, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, and poorer insight. Conclusion: Mixed features specifier criteria were fulfilled by 16% patients with first-episode depression. This finding suggests that the extension of this specifier to depression can be considered as a useful step in understanding the symptom profile of patients with depression.

AB  - Lung function testing is an essential modality of investigation in children as it provides objective evidence of lung disease/health. With advances in technology, various tests are available that can aid in the diagnosis of lung disease, assess the progression and response to therapy and document the lung development and evolving lung diseases in infants. This narrative review discusses lung function tests in infants and children. Currently, lung function tests can be performed in every age group, from neonates to the elderly. Spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) are the most employed tests in children more than six years of age. Spirometry helps diagnose and monitoring of both obstructive and restrictive diseases. There is a need for expertise to perform and interpret spirometry correctly. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) or impulse oscillometry (IOS) is done with tidal volume breathing and is feasible even in preschool children. Their utility is mainly restricted to asthma in children at present. Lung function tests can be performed in neonates, infants and children using infant pulmonary function test (PFT) equipment, although their availability is limited. Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is a valuable tool in restrictive lung diseases. Lung volumes can be assessed by body plethysmography and multiple washout technique. The latter can also assess lung clearance index. It is essential to perform and interpret the lung function test results correctly and correlate them with the clinical condition for optimum treatment and outcome.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for similar to 2% of global cancers and deaths. Survival depends on initial staging and shows poor survival rate in metastatic disease. CT and MRI are used for evaluating RCC, and PET/CT is used for metastatic disease assessment. We report a case of RCC, where both F-18-FDG and Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT showed increased uptake in liver metastatic lesions; however, a subhepatic peritoneal deposit showed uptake only in PSMA. Also, liver lesions were seen better in PSMA owing to lesser background uptake, suggesting a possibility of Ga-68-PSMA being a potential tracer for RCC evaluation.

AB  - Purpose: To derive a formula for accurate axial length (AL) assessment using routine ultrasound in silicone oil-filled eyes, where optical biometry is unavailable or not possible. Methods: This was a prospective, consecutive, nonrandomized study of 50 eyes of 50 patients conducted in a tertiary care hospital in North India. AL measurements were taken using both manual A-scan and IOL master, both in silicone oil-filled status and 3 weeks after silicone oil removal. A correction factor of 0.7 was used for AL adjustment in oil-filled eyes. The corrected AL (cAL) was compared with IOL master values in oil-filled eyes. Agreement analysis was carried out using Bland Altman plot. Linear regression analysis was done using uncorrected manual AL to find a new equation. Data was analyzed using Stata 14. A P value <0.05 was taken as significant. Results: The study included 40 males and 10 females, with an age range of 6-83 years (mean 41.9 years). The mean AL of the oil-filled eye as measured by manual A-scan was 31.76 mm +/- 3.09 and by IOL master was 24.7 mm +/- 1.74. Linear regression analysis was performed in randomly selected 35 eyes of the observed data to obtain a new equation: predicted AL (PAL) = 14 + 0.3 x manual AL. The mean difference between PAL and optically measured AL with silicone oil in situ was 0.98 +/- 1.67. Conclusion: We propose a new formula for better prediction of the correct AL in silicone oil-filled eyes using ultrasound-based AL measurement.

AB  - Cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment due to its complex mechanism, different progressing stages, and lack of adequate procedures for screening and identification. Pancreatic cancer is typically identified in its advanced progression phase with a low survival of similar to 5 years. Among cancers, pancreatic cancer is also considered a high mortality-causing casualty over other accidental or disease-based mortality, and it is ranked seventh among all mortality-associated cancers globally. Henceforth, developing diagnostic procedures for its early detection, understanding pancreatic cancer-linked mechanisms, and various therapeutic strategies are crucial. This review describes the recent development in pancreatic cancer progression, mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches, including molecular techniques and biomedicines for effectively treating cancer.

AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the effect of maternal audiotaped voice on clinical parameters of sedated children.MethodsA randomized controlled trial was conducted on 25 sedated critically ill children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. An audiotaped maternal voice was played to the children in the experimental group (n=13) via a headphone for 15 minutes, twice a day for 3 days. Children in the control group (n=12) received routine care without any additional auditory stimulation. Clinical and hemodynamic variables were recorded at 5 minutes interval three times.ResultsSignificant changes were observed in the mean (SD) heart rate (per minute) at 10 minutes [129.83 (19.14) vs 124.29 (14.90), P=0.051], respiratory rate at 5 minutes [44.38 (17.79) vs 34.65 (7.64), P=<0.001] and 10 minutes [42.79 (13.89) vs 35.44 (7.65) P=<0.001], systolic blood pressure at 5 minutes [95.24 (15.01) vs 101.02 (19.83) P=0.045], and mean blood pressure at 15 minutes [68.66 (13.61) vs 73.61 (17.59) P=0.051] mmHg between the experimental and the control group, respectively.ConclusionListening to recorded maternal voice had a positive effect on clinical parameters of sedated critically ill children.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of preloaded toric intraocular lens (IOLs) implantation in eyes undergoing phacoemulsification. Methods: This prospective study included 51 eyes of 51 patients with visually significant cataracts and corneal astigmatism ranging between 0.75 and 5.50 D. All patients underwent phacoemulsification with SupraPhob toric intraocular lens implantation under topical anesthesia. The main outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), residual refractive cylinder, spherical equivalent, and IOL stability at 3 months follow-up. Results: At 3 months, 49% (25/51) of patients had UDVA equal to or better than 20/25 with 100% of eyes achieving better than 20/40. Mean logMAR UDVA improved from 1.02 +/- 0.39, preoperatively to 0.11 +/- 0.10 at 3 months follow-up (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The mean refractive cylinder improved from - 1.56 +/- 1.25 D preoperatively to - 0.12 +/- 0.31 D at 3 months follow-up (P < 0.001) while the mean spherical equivalent value changed from - 1.93 +/- 3.71D preoperatively to - 0.16 +/- 0.27D (P = 0.0013). The mean root mean square value for higher order aberrations was 0.30 +/- 0.18 mu m while the average contrast sensitivity value (Pelli-Robson chart) was 1.56 +/- 0.10 log unit, at the final follow-up. The mean IOL rotation at 3 weeks was 1.7 +/- 1.61 degrees, which did not change significantly at 3 months (P = 0.988) follow-up. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Conclusion: SupraPhob toric IOL implantation is an effective method for addressing preexisting corneal astigmatism in eyes undergoing phacoemulsification with good rotational stability.

AB  - Objectives: To assess disability and quality of life (QOL) in treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS) on long term clozapine therapy and assess their correlation with positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Methodology: Disability and QOL in forty patients with TRS (as per modified Kane's criteria) were assessed using World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF. Scale for assessment of positive symptoms, scale for assessment of negative symptoms and Addenbrooke's cognitive examination-III were used to assess positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Medication adherence rating scale assessed medication adherence. Results: Disability and QOL correlated significantly with medication adherence, negative and cognitive symptoms but not with positive symptoms. Subgroup analysis revealed significant difference between medication adherence (good vs poor) and cognitive (impairment vs non-impairment) groups. Conclusion: Negative and cognitive symptoms, and medication adherence correlated with disability and QOL.

AB  - Background & objectives: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a serious threat for human health worldwide. The studies on agents targeting A. baumannii are imperative due to identified A. baumannii co-infections in COVID-19. Bacteriophages are promising antibacterial agents against drug-resistant bacteria. This study intended to isolate bacteriophages against MDR A. baumannii from the water of river Ganga, to be used potentially as therapeutic and disinfectant particles.
   Methods: Acinetobacter phages were isolated from the Ganga water collected from Kanpur and further tested on 50 MDR A. baumannii isolates to determine host range. The phages were morphologically characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The disinfectant property of the isolated phages was tested by spraying of bacteriophage cocktail on MDR A. baumannii contaminated plastic surface, analyzed by colony-forming unit (CFU) and bioluminescence assay (adenosine triphosphate monitoring).
   Results: A total of seven bacteriophages were isolated against MDR A. baumannii. The bacteriophages lysed three MDR A. baumannii isolates out of 50 tested, showing narrow host range. Electron microscopy revealed hexagonal heads and long tails of bacteriophages, belonging to order Caudovirales. The bacteriophage cocktail reduced the MDR A. baumannii load efficiently on plastic surface, evidenced by reduction in CFUs and bioluminescence.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the isolated bacteriophages are potential lytic agents for MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates, and may be used as potential therapeutic agents as well as disinfectant to combat MDR A. baumannii with due consideration to phage host specificity, with further characterization.

AB  - BackgroundThere is limited data on antibiotic treatment in hospitalized neonates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to describe patterns of antibiotic use, pathogens, and clinical outcomes, and to develop a severity score predicting mortality in neonatal sepsis to inform future clinical trial design.Methods and findingsHospitalized infants <60 days with clinical sepsis were enrolled during 2018 to 2020 by 19 sites in 11 countries (mainly Asia and Africa). Prospective daily observational data was collected on clinical signs, supportive care, antibiotic treatment, microbiology, and 28-day mortality. Two prediction models were developed for (1) 28-day mortality from baseline variables (baseline NeoSep Severity Score); and (2) daily risk of death on IV antibiotics from daily updated assessments (NeoSep Recovery Score). Multivariable Cox regression models included a randomly selected 85% of infants, with 15% for validation.A total of 3,204 infants were enrolled, with median birth weight of 2,500 g (IQR 1,400 to 3,000) and postnatal age of 5 days (IQR 1 to 15). 206 different empiric antibiotic combinations were started in 3,141 infants, which were structured into 5 groups based on the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe classification. Approximately 25.9% (n = 814) of infants started WHO first line regimens (Group 1-Access) and 13.8% (n = 432) started WHO second-line cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftriaxone) (Group 2-"Low" Watch). The largest group (34.0%, n = 1,068) started a regimen providing partial extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/pseudomonal coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, or fluoroquinolone-based) (Group 3-"Medium" Watch), 18.0% (n = 566) started a carbapenem (Group 4-"High" Watch), and 1.8% (n = 57) a Reserve antibiotic (Group 5, largely colistin-based), and 728/2,880 (25.3%) of initial regimens in Groups 1 to 4 were escalated, mainly to carbapenems, usually for clinical deterioration (n = 480; 65.9%).A total of 564/3,195 infants (17.7%) were blood culture pathogen positive, of whom 62.9% (n = 355) had a gram-negative organism, predominantly Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 132) or Acinetobacter spp. (n = 72). Both were commonly resistant to WHO-recommended regimens and to carbapenems in 43 (32.6%) and 50 (71.4%) of cases, respectively. MRSA accounted for 33 (61.1%) of 54 Staphylococcus aureus isolates.Overall, 350/3,204 infants died (11.3%; 95% CI 10.2% to 12.5%), 17.7% if blood cultures were positive for pathogens (95% CI 14.7% to 21.1%, n = 99/564). A baseline NeoSep Severity Score had a C-index of 0.76 (0.69 to 0.82) in the validation sample, with mortality of 1.6% (3/189; 95% CI: 0.5% to 4.6%), 11.0% (27/245; 7.7% to 15.6%), and 27.3% (12/44; 16.3% to 41.8%) in low (score 0 to 4), medium (5 to 8), and high (9 to 16) risk groups, respectively, with similar performance across subgroups. A related NeoSep Recovery Score had an area under the receiver operating curve for predicting death the next day between 0.8 and 0.9 over the first week. There was significant variation in outcomes between sites and external validation would strengthen score applicability.ConclusionAntibiotic regimens used in neonatal sepsis commonly diverge from WHO guidelines, and trials of novel empiric regimens are urgently needed in the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The baseline NeoSep Severity Score identifies high mortality risk criteria for trial entry, while the NeoSep Recovery Score can help guide decisions on regimen change.

AB  - We present a case of post-trabeculectomy encapsulated dysesthetic bleb with scleral fistula, managed successfully with autograft. The child was operated on twice before for trabeculectomy, and intraocular pressure (IOP) recorded was in the normal range for the initial few years. This time child presented with a large encapsulated dysesthetic bleb with borderline IOP. As the IOP was on the lower side, an underlyings cleral fistula was suspected and planned for bleb revision with a donor patch graft. We describe the novel technique of bleb revision along with the repair of the scleral fistula with an autologous free fibrotic Tenon's tissue graft instead of a donor patch graft with a successful outcome.

AB  - The utility of telemedicine in healthcare has been brought to the forefront by the COVID-19 pandemic. SwasthGarbh' (Healthy Pregnancy) is a multi-functional, interactive smartphone application for providing antenatal care and real-time medical support to all pregnant women (especially those in rural areas and/or do not have easy access to doctors). A randomized controlled trial (n = 150) demonstrates its utility in improving the quality of antenatal care, reducing obstetric/medical complications and achieving a positive pregnancy experience. The test group (patients registered on the App) showed a significantly higher number of mean (+/- SD) antenatal visits (7.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 5.7 +/- 1.8; P < 0.001) as well as better compliance with the WHO visit protocol (87.2% vs. 69.8%, P < 0.001) and antenatal investigations (73.2% vs. 41.7%, P<0.001) in comparison to the control group (followed-up conventionally), respectively. Furthermore, substantial reduction in medical (38.0% vs. 55.5%, P = 0.04) and obstetric (52.1% vs. 59.7%, P = 0.36) complications during pregnancy as well as significant improvement in mean (+/- SD) maternal systolic BP (118.9 +/- 11.8 vs. 123.4 +/- 14.2 mmHg; P = 0.046), diastolic BP (76.0 +/- 8.4 vs. 80.0 +/- 10.9 mmHg; P = 0.02) and hemoglobin (11.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 10.9 +/- 1.4 g/dL; P = 0.03) parameters at delivery was observed in the test group compared to the controls, respectively. All the above mentioned positive clinical outcomes were the result of the provision of high quality antenatal care, timely detection of complications, prompt medical assistance and improved medication adherence. This is first pregnancy App that provides instantaneous access to doctor's advice and is clinically endorsed as well as credible.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of the inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM)-flap technique on the visual outcome and anatomical recovery for small (<250 mu), medium (<400 mu), and large (>400 mu) macular holes (MHs). Methods: Retrospective study included consecutive idiopathic MH cases operated on using the inverted ILM-flap technique. Clinical data were retrieved from electronic medical records (EMRs), surgical videos, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) machines. Eyes with axial length >25 mm, coexisting macular diseases, and follow-up <6 weeks were excluded. Data included the presence or absence of ILM flap and restoration of External Limiting Membrane (ELM), Ellipsoid Zone (EZ) lines. Mean visual improvement and structural recovery were compared between eyes showing ILM flap and those showing no flap in three MH size groups. Results: Forty eyes of 38 patients with a mean age of 62.7 +/- 10.1 years and a mean MH diameter of 348 +/- 152 mu m were included. The mean follow-up was 527 +/- 478 days with anatomical closure observed in all eyes. Mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved significantly from 0.87 +/- 0.38 to 0.35 +/- 0.26. ILM flap was visible in 29 (72.5%) all MHs, 7 (53.8%) small MHs (n = 13), 8 (61.5%) medium MHs (n = 13), and 14 (100%) large MHs (n = 14). The mean BCVA change was 0.47 +/- 0.34, 0.53 +/- 0.48, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 in large, medium, and small MHs, respectively, and the difference between eyes showing ILM flap versus no flap in each MH size group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, for medium MHs, it was higher in the ILM flap (0.66 +/- 0.52) group compared to the no flap (0.32 +/- 0.37) group. One eye with small MH developed significant gliosis resulting in reduced BCVA. ELM was restored in all eyes with small and medium MHs. Conclusion: We observed that the ILM flap did not adversely affect anatomical and visual outcomes for MHs <400 mu m. Restoration of ELM suggests minimal interference in structural recovery by an ILM flap.

AB  - ImportanceThe Cochrane review (2016) on kangaroo mother care (KMC) demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of mortality in low birth weight infants. New evidence from large multi-centre randomised trials has been available since its publication. ObjectiveOur systematic review compared the effects of KMC vs conventional care and early (ie, within 24 hours of birth) vs late initiation of KMC on critical outcomes such as neonatal mortality. MethodsEight electronic databases, including PubMed(& REG;), Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, from inception until March 2022, were searched. All randomised trials comparing KMC vs conventional care or early vs late initiation of KMC in low birth weight or preterm infants were included. Data extraction and synthesisThe review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO. Main outcomes and measuresThe primary outcome was mortality during birth hospitalization or 28 days of life. Other outcomes included severe infection, hypothermia, exclusive breastfeeding rates, and neurodevelopmental impairment. Results were pooled using fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses in RevMan 5.4 and Stata 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). ResultsIn total, 31 trials with 15 559 infants were included in the review; 27 studies compared KMC with conventional care, while four compared early vs late initiation of KMC. Compared with conventional care, KMC reduces the risks of mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.86; 11 trials, 10 505 infants; high certainty evidence) during birth hospitalisation or 28 days of age and probably reduces severe infection until the latest follow-up (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92; nine trials; moderate certainty evidence). On subgroup analysis, the reduction in mortality was noted irrespective of gestational age or weight at enrolment, time of initiation, and place of initiation of KMC (hospital or community); the mortality benefits were greater when the daily duration of KMC was at least 8 hours per day than with shorter-duration KMC. Studies comparing early vs late-initiated KMC demonstrated a reduction in neonatal mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91; three trials, 3693 infants; high certainty evidence) and a probable decrease in clinical sepsis until 28-days (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96; two trials; low certainty evidence) following early initiation of KMC. Conclusions and relevanceThe review provides updated evidence on the effects of KMC on mortality and other critical outcomes in preterm and low birth weight infants. The findings suggest that KMC should preferably be initiated within 24 hours of birth and provided for at least 8 hours daily.

AB  - A modified phaco chop technique for nuclear emulsification in posterior polar cataracts with nuclear sclerosis that avoids hydrodissection or nuclear rotation has been described. After performing a vertical chop maneuver to divide the nucleus, two pie-shaped nuclear fragments are removed from either side of the initial chop. The remaining nuclear fragments are then sequentially tumbled toward the center using the second instrument and emulsified while maintaining an intact epinuclear shell, which safeguards the fragile posterior capsule. The technique was successfully performed in 62 eyes of 54 patients with posterior polar cataract and grade II-IV nuclear sclerosis. The Chop and Tumble nucleotomy is a safe and effective technique for phacoemulsification in posterior polar cataracts with nuclear sclerosis, where hydrodissection and nuclear rotation are typically avoided.

TI  - Lung water estimation on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
KW  - CONGESTION
KW  - PRESSURE
KW  - FLUID
AB  - Objectives: Pulmonary congestion is a central feature of heart failure (HF) seen in acute decompensated state as well as in chronic stable disease. The present study sought to determine whether simplified cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)-derived lung water density (LWD) measurement has prognostic relevance in predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)<50%.Methods: Eighty consecutive patients referred for CMR with HF and LVEF<50% along with 22 healthy age-and sex-matched controls were prospectively recruited. LWD was the lung -to -liver signal intensity ratio multi-plied by 70% (estimated hepatic water density). The primary endpoint was composite of all -cause mortality or HF-related hospitalization within 6 months from CMR.Results: The mean LWD was significantly higher in HF patients compared to healthy controls (19.78 +/- 6.1 vs 13.6 +/- 2.3; p < 0.001). The mean LWD was significantly different among patients with NYHA class I/II and NYHA class III/IV (17.88 +/- 4.8 vs 21.77 +/- 1.08; p = 0.004). At 6 months, the primary endpoint was reached in 12 (15%) patients. Patients with "wet lungs" (LWD > 18.1%) had higher incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to patients with "dry lungs". LWD was an inde-pendent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in multivariable analysis. At the optimal cut -off of LWD > 23.38%, the sensitivity and specificity were 91.67 and 91.18%, respectively, to predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Conclusion: LWD on CMR is independently associated with increased risk of mortality and HF-related hospital-ization in HF patients with LVEF<50%. Advances in knowledge: Non-invasive quantitative esti-mation of LWD on CMR can improve risk stratification and guide management in HF patients.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) +/- chemotherapy is the standard treatment for driver mutation-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, accessibility to ICIs in LMICs is limited due to high cost, and platinum-based chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Metformin has anticancer properties, and studies suggest synergism between metformin and pemetrexed. Based on preclinical evidence, this combination may be more beneficial for STK11-mutated NSCLC, a subgroup, inherently resistant to ICIs. In this Simon two-stage, single-arm phase 2 trial, we investigated metformin with pemetrexed-carboplatin (PC) in patients with treatment-naive stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. The primary outcome was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary outcomes were safety, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), proportion of STK11 mutation, and effect of STK11 mutation on 6-month PFS rate. The study was terminated for futility after interim analysis. The median follow-up was 34.1 months. The 6-month PFS rate was 28% (95% CI 12.4-0.46). The median PFS and OS were 4.5 (95% CI 2.2-6.1) and 7.4 months (95% CI 5.3-15.3), respectively. The ORR was 72%. Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most common. No grade 4/5 toxicities were reported. Targeted sequencing was possible in nine cases. Two patients had STK11 mutation and a poor outcome (PFS < 12 weeks). We could not demonstrate the benefit of metformin with CP in terms of improvement in 6-month PFS rate; however, the combination was safe (CTRI/2019/02/017815).

AB  - Most of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV-V patients have deficiency of vitamin D. Active vitamin D binds to vitamin D receptor (VDR) to regulate target gene transcription and mediates diverse biological functions. Various genetic variations such as FokI polymorphism, may affect the VDR gene expression and may play an important role in pathogenesis of CKD. In this context, here, we looked into the association of FokI polymorphism of VDR gene with serum vitamin D and PTH levels in stage IV-V CKD patients. A total of 150 patients of CKD stage IV-V, aged 25-60 years, and 150 healthy controls (HC), age and sex matched, were enrolled for the study. FokI polymorphism was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction -restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in the study subjects. The prevalence of different genotypes and allelic frequency distributions were compared in study subjects. Serum PTH and vitamin D were estimated by eCLIA method. No significant differences in genotype and in allelic frequencies between CKD patients and HC were observed. No significant differences in biochemical parameters based on genotypic variations were observed. The results suggest no association of VDR FokI polymorphism with CKD. No significant association was noticed between FokI variants and PTH or VitD.

AB  - Germ cell tumour (GCT) is the most common testicular tumour that commonly presents as a painless mass. Bone marrow metastasis in cases of testicular GCT is rare; only few case reports are available till date in the literature. Here an adult male presented with an intra-abdominal mass in right iliac fossa with inguinal lymphadenopathy with a deranged kidney function test. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate smear revealed metastatic tumour cells, but BM-biopsy was unremarkable. High serum Beta -HCG (38286 mIU/L) pointed towards germ cell lesion. Lymph node biopsy along with immunomarkers confirmed metastatic foci from germ cell tumor and managed as per standard protocol. Rarely BM aspirate is seen positive for malignancy, while biopsy turns out to be negative. Secondly, BM metastasis of GCT should be considered while dealing with cases like this. Informed consent: This is certified that the informed consent has been obtained from the patient.

It is important to inform people of risk factors and methods for risk management through interactive risk communication techniques. Affordable, easy-to-understand transmedia tools for the communication of BC risk were co-created by a multidisciplinary team of doctors, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, health economists, digital designers, and public representatives. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted in regional languages to assess the views of patients, relatives, the public, and health professionals in India of these prototypes. There was low awareness of BC, with some understanding of age and hereditary risk factors but limited knowledge of reproductive factors amongst the general public, patients, and relatives. Participants favored storytelling techniques (animation and comic strips/infographics) to explain complex issues such as genetic risk and testing. Co-created BC risk communication transmedia tools should be used to support informed decision making.Background: Low awareness of BC and its associated risk factors causes delays in diagnosis and impacts survival. It is critical to communicate BC risk to patients in a format that they are easily able to understand. Our study aim was to develop easy-to-follow transmedia prototypes to communicate BC risk and evaluate user preferences, alongside exploring awareness of BC and its risk factors. Methods: Prototypes of transmedia tools for risk communication were developed with multidisciplinary input. A qualitative in-depth online interview study was undertaken using a pre-defined topic guide of BC patients (7), their relatives (6), the general public (6), and health professionals (6). Interviews were analyzed using a thematic approach. Findings: Most participants preferred pictographic representations (frequency format) of lifetime risk and risk factors and storytelling using short animations and comic strips (infographics) for communicating genetic risk and testing: "In a short time, they explained it very well, and I liked it". Suggestions included minimizing technical terminology, decreasing the delivery speed, "two-way dialogue", and using local "language for different locations". There was low awareness of BC, with some understanding of age and hereditary risk factors but limited knowledge of reproductive factors. Interpretation: Our findings support use of multiple context-specific multimedia tools in communicating cancer risk in an easy-to-understand way. The preference for storytelling using animations and infographics is a novel finding and should be more widely explored.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the integrity of autonomic nervous system in spino-cerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1 and 2 patients using battery of autonomic function tests and their comprehensive scoring using composite autonomic severity score (CASS). Material and methods: Battery of autonomic function test comprising of cardiovascular (baroreflex dependent and non-baroreflex dependent) and sudomotor functions were assessed in age and gender-matched SCA1 (n = 31), SCA2 (n = 40) patients along with healthy controls (n = 40). To assess the grade of autonomic abnormalities, the composite autonomic severity score (CASS) was computed using the results of the standard autonomic function tests. Results: We found reduction in baroreflex dependent autonomic reactivity parameters predominantly a signifi-cant fall of systolic blood pressure (<0.001) and lower 30:15 ratio (<0.001) during head up tilt in both the SCA1 and SCA2 as compared to controls. On sudomotor assessment, distal leg latency of sweat response was prolonged in SCA1 than SCA2 patients. Moderate generalized autonomic failure was commonly found amongst SCA1 (80.65%) and SCA2 (85%) patients. Severe autonomic failure was found to be more in SCA1 (6.45%) than SCA2 (2.50%) patients. Conclusions: Cardiovascular autonomic function assessment in SCA1 and SCA2 patients revealed a significant impairment in the baroreflex loop integrity. Severity scoring using CASS suggests the existence of moderate autonomic failure in majority of both SCA1 and SCA2 patients.

AB  - Background and objective: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic progressive autoimmune disorder, characterised by destruction of cartilage and under line bones. Though exact etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unknown. It is believed that alteration in control of cellular or molecular responses is involved in the chronic inflammation. Earlier in RA patients it was observed the circulating RA specific biomarkers and immunoglobulin deposits in the synovial joints. Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) is used as an anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent, however there is nil/very less scientific data shows the anti-arthritic activity of green synthesis ZnO nanoparticles (Ocimum sanctum water extract in-situ synthesis of ZnO NPs having active compound Caffeic acid and Rosmerinic acid). Hence, the present activity was planned to assess the anti-arthritic activity of ZnO NPs in CIA rats.
   Methods: Arthritis in rats were induced by subcutaneous injection of collagen type II (CII) (200 mu l) at the base of tail on day 0 followed by booster dose on day 14. ZnO NPs were given (2 mg/kg b.wt./day) orally for 20 days. At the end of the study serum, joint homogenate was used to assess the level of biomarkers (RF, a-CCP, a-CII and CRP) and inflammatory mediators. In addition, m-RNA expression of various genes such as Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), inflammatory mediators like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) etc. were assayed in joint tissue. Finally all these biochemical and molecular results were confirmed by microscopic study of joint tissue.
   Results: ZnO NPs, treated rats showed decrease in inflammation and clinical severity. This was related with decrease in the level of biomarkers (like RF, a-CCP and CRP), inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, COX-2) and activity of transcription factor NF-kB. All these findings were positively correlated with microscopic analysis of joint tissue that showed reduced inflammation and bone erosion in treated group.
   Conclusion: This study validates the anti-arthritic activity of ZnO NPs as it mitigates the arthritis related symptoms in CIA rats.

AB  - Objective: To report on vaccination status by 12 months of age among tribal children from nine districts of India.Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2631 tribal women having a child aged 12 months or below from nine Indian districts with a considerable proportion of the tribal population. Socio-demographic details, reception of various vaccines by 12 months of age, mother's antenatal care utilisation and health system-related details were collected through a pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaire from mothers. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with complete vaccination by 12 months of age.Results: Only 52% of children were fully vaccinated by the age of 12 months among the tribal populations; 11% did not receive any vaccine, and 37% of the tribal children received some vaccines. The age-appropriate vaccination was unsatisfactory as only 75% of the infants received all birth dose vaccines, and only 60.5% received all doses by 14 weeks. Only 73% were vaccinated against measles. Illness of the child, home births and communication gaps concerning vaccination were the main rea-sons for an infant not being vaccinated appropriately. Frequency of health worker's visits to the village, hospital birth, reception of advice on vaccination and educational status of the head of the households were significantly associated with full vaccination status.Conclusion: A relatively low proportion of children were fully vaccinated among the tribal populations. Health systems factors, mainly the outreach services and advice by the health workers, were positively and significantly associated with a child being fully vaccinated by 12 months of age. Improving outreach services is crucial to improve vaccination coverage in tribal areas, and there is a need to address the social determinants in the long run.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewSouth Asia has around 1/6(th) of the current global population. Epidemiological studies suggest that South Asians living in South Asia and diaspora are at an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs). This is due to an interplay of genetic, acquired, and environmental risk factors. Due to its increasing share of the global population, clinicians need to know the reasons for this early predisposition, and strategies for early identification and mitigation.Recent FindingsSouth Asians have earlier onset of cardiometabolic risk factors such as insulin resistance, hypertension, and central adiposity. This increased risk is seen in both native South Asians and the diaspora.South Asians have earlier onset of ASCVD due to an earlier onset of cardiometabolic risk factors. Health promotion and early identification of these risk factors are essential to mitigate this ongoing crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common sports-related injuries. Their incidence is not the same either for all the sports or for the same sport across various nations. This information is maintained by many sports leagues in their registries. However, very few nationwide registries exist for such injuries. This study is carried out to know the demographic characteristics of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at our hospital in India.AIMTo know the demographic characteristics of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at a tertiary care hospital in India.METHODSAll the patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from January 2020 to December 2021 were retrospectively studied. Patients with multi-ligament injuries or a history of previous knee surgery were excluded. The patients' history was obtained from the hospital records, they were interviewed telephonically, and online questionnaires were given. Their demographic data was analyzed and compared to the existing literature.RESULTSA total of 124 patients were operated on for ACL reconstruction during this period. The mean age of the patients was 27.97 years. One hundred and thirteen patients (91.1%) were male and 11 (8.9%) were female. The majority of the patients (47.6%) sustained this injury by road traffic accidents (RTA) followed by sports-related injuries (39.5%). The commonest presenting complaint was giving way of the knee in 118 patients (95.2%). The mean duration from the injury to the first hospital visit among the patients was 290.1 d. The mean duration from the injury to surgery was 421.8 d.CONCLUSIONACL patients' demography is different in developing nations as compared to the developed world. RTA are the leading cause of ACL injuries and are followed by recreational sports as a cause. There is delayed access to healthcare leading to delayed diagnosis as well as even greater time to surgery. This, in turn, leads to poorer prognosis and longer rehabilitation. National registries for developing nations are the need of the hour due to the different demographics of ACL injuries in developing countries.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to report on the educational placement, quality of life and speech reception changes in a prospectively recruited group of children after they received a cochlear implant (CI). Method: Data was collected on 1085 CI recipients of as part of a prospective, longitudinal, observational, international, multi-centre, paediatric registry, initiated by Cochlear Ltd (Sydney, NSW, Australia). Outcome data from children (<= 10 years old) implanted in routine practice was voluntarily entered into a central, externally hosted, e-platform.
   Collection occurred prior to initial device activation (baseline) and at six monthly follow-up intervals up to 24 months and then at 3 years post activation. Clinician reported baseline and follow up questionnaires and Categories of Auditory Performance version II (CAP-II) outcomes were collated. Self-reported evaluation forms and patient information were provided by the parent/caregiver/patient via the implant recipient baseline and follow up, Children Using Hearing Implants Quality of Life (CuHIQoL) and Speech Spatial Qualities (SSQ-P) Parents Version questionnaires.
   Results: Children were mainly bilaterally profoundly deaf, unilaterally implanted and used a contralateral hearing aid. Prior to implant 60% used signing or total communication as their main mode of communication. Mean age at implant was 3.2 +/- 2.2 years (range 0-10 years). At baseline 8.6% were in mainstream education with no additional support and 82% had not yet entered school. After three years of implant use, 52% had entered mainstream education with no additional support and 38% had not yet entered school. In the sub-group of 141 children who were implanted at or after three years of age and were thus old enough to be in mainstream school at the three-year follow up, an even higher proportion (73%) were in mainstream education with no support. Quality of life scores for the child improved statistically significantly post implant compared to baseline and continued to improve significantly at each interval up to 3 years (p < 0.001). Parental expectation scores reduced statistically significantly from baseline compared to all intervals (p < 0.028) and then increased significantly at 3 years compared to all post baseline follow-up intervals (p < 0.006). The impact on family life was reduced post implant compared to baseline and continued to reduce between annual intervals (p < 0.001). At three years post follow up median CAP II scores were 7 (IQR 6-7) and mean SSQ-P scores were 6.8 (SD1.9) 6.0 (SD1.9) and 7.4 (SD 2.3) for speech spatial and qualities scales respectively. SSQ-P and CAP II scores improved statistically and clinically significantly compared to baseline by one year post implantation. CAP II scores continued to improve at each test interval up to three years post implant. Speech and Qualities scores improved significantly between years 1 and 2 (p < 0.001), but only the Speech scores improved significantly between years 2 and 3 (p = 0.004).
   Conclusions: Mainstream educational placement was achievable for most of the children, including those implanted at an older age. Quality of life for the child and the wider family improved. Future research could focus on the impact of mainstream school placement on children's academic progress, including measures of academic attainment and social functioning.

AB  - IntroductionUnplanned hospital readmission (UHR) is an important indicator of the quality of the healthcare system in place. It has various implications for the patients and the healthcare system at large. In this article, we have attempted to understand the various factors influencing UHR and the start of adjuvant treatment following cancer surgery. Patients & MethodsIn this study adult patients above 18 years of age with upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma who underwent surgery at our center between July 2019 to December 2019 were included in the study. Various factors influencing UHR and delay in receiving adjuvant treatment were analyzed. ResultsA total of 245 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Surgical site infection (SSI) was the factor that had the maximum influence on the UHR (p < 0.002, OR: 5.6, 95% CI: [1.911-16.4]) and delaying the start of adjuvant treatment (p = 0.008, OR: 3.786, 95% CI: [1.421-10.086]) on multivariate analysis. Surgery lasting for >4 h and patients who had received prior treatment tended to develop SSI postoperatively. The presence of SSI also seemed to have had a negative influence on disease-free survival (DFS) as well. ConclusionsSSI is an important postoperative complication having major implications in terms of increased UHR and delays in starting adjuvant treatment which in turn is reflected as a poorer DFS among patients who develop SSI postoperatively.

AB  - Ultrafast lasers pulses induced ablation of nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy substrates immersed in deionized water yielded a high-throughput of polycrystalline core - amorphous shell NiTi nanoparticles (NPs) owing to the high pulse energy of femtosecond (fs) lasers. In this study, the alloy NPs were fabricated by varying the laser fluences from 15 to 45 J/cm2. The polycrystalline core - amorphous shell NiTi were confirmed by selected area diffraction patterns via High resolution - Transmission Electron microscopy. Theoretical investigations were carried out via hybrid simulation approach of molecular dynamics simulation and analytical modelling. Molecular dynamics study revealed the spatial and temporal evolution of electron and lattice temperature of NiTi melt pool due to ablation at various laser fluences. The subsequent temporal dynamics of melt-pool temperature along the depth revealed the phase separation via spinodal decomposition process after 40 picoseconds post irradiation of NiTi with ultrafast laser pulse. The analytical modelling incorporating phase explosion theory estimated the thermophysical expansion of ablated chunks and subsequent fragmentation of NiTi melt pool in liquid-vapor co-existing phase. The parameters of mathematical modelling were evaluated in-conjunction with the experimental results of size distribution of NPs at the laser fluence of 15 J/cm2. Later, the hybrid mathematical model was employed to predict the size of NiTi NPs ablated at higher laser fluences of 30 J/cm2 and 45 J/cm2 and the results were experimentally verified.

AB  - The present study evaluates the effect of modulating alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor (AMPAR) by inhibiting them in the acute phase and activating them in the sub-acute phase on post-stroke recovery in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model of stroke in rats. After 90 min of MCAo, perampanel (an AMPAR antagonist, 1.5 mg/kg i.p) and aniracetam (an AMPA agonist, 50 mg/kg i.p.) were administered for different durations after MCAo. Later, after obtaining the best time point for the antagonist and the agonist treatment protocols, sequential treatment with perampanel and aniracetam were given, and the effect on neurological damage and post stroke recovery were assessed. Perampanel and aniracetam significantly protected MCAo-induced neurological damage and diminished the infarct percentage. Furthermore, treatment with these study drugs improved the motor coordination and grip strength. Sequential treatment with perampanel and aniracetam reduced the infarct percentage as assessed by MRI. Moreover, these compounds diminished the inflammation via reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta) and increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) along with reductions in GFAP expression. Moreover, the neuroprotective markers (BDNF and TrkB) were found to be significantly increased. Levels of apoptotic markers (Bax, cleaved-caspase-3; Bcl2 and TUNEL positive cells) and neuronal damage (MAP-2) were normalized with the AMPA antagonist and agonist treatment. Expressions of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits of AMPAR were significantly enhanced with sequential treatment. The present study thus showed that modulation of AMPAR improves neurobehavioral deficits and reduces the infarct percentage through anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effects.

AB  - Background: Repetitive TMS is used in stroke rehabilitation with predefined passive low and high-frequency stimulation. Brain State-Dependent Stimulation (BSDS)/Activity-Dependent Stimulation (ADS) using bio-signal has been observed to strengthen synaptic connections. Without the personalization of brain-stimulation protocols, we risk a one-size-fits-all approach.
   Methods: We attempted to close the ADS loop via intrinsic-proprioceptive (via exoskeleton-movement) and extrinsic-visual-feedback to the brain. We developed a patient-specific brain stimulation platform with a two-way feedback system, to synchronize single-pulse TMS with exoskeleton along with adaptive performance visual feedback, in real-time, for a focused neurorehabilitation strategy to voluntarily engage the patient in the brain stimulation process.
   Results: The novel TMS Synchronized Exoskeleton Feedback (TSEF) platform, controlled by the patient's residual Electromyogram, simultaneously triggered exoskeleton movement and single-pulse TMS, once in 10 s, implying 0.Hz frequency. The TSEF platform was tested for a demonstration on three patients (n=3) with different spasticity on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS=1, 1+, 2) for one session each. Three patients completed their session in their own timing; patients with (more) spasticity tend to take (more) inter-trial intervals. A proof-of-concept study on two groups-TSEF-group and a physiotherapy control-group was performed for 45min/day for 20-sessions. Dose-matched Physiotherapy was given to control-group. Post 20 sessions, an increase in ipsilesional cortical-excitability was observed; Motor Evoked Potential increased by similar to 48.5 mu V at a decreased Resting Motor Threshold by similar to 15.6%, with improvement in clinical scales relevant to the Fugl-Mayer Wrist/Hand joint (involved in training) by 2.6 units, an effect not found in control-group. This strategy could voluntarily engage the patient.
   Conclusion: A brain stimulation platform with a real-time two-way feedback system was developed to voluntarily engage the patients during the brain stimulation process and a proof-of-concept study on three patients indicates clinical gains with increased cortical excitability, an effect not observed in the control-group; and the encouraging results nudge for further investigations on a larger cohort.

AB  - Objective Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) is one of the severe secondary complications of diabetes mellitus in humans. Vinpocetine is an alkaloid having pleiotropic pharmacological effects. The present study is designed to investigate the effect of vinpocetine in DC in rats.
   Methods Rats were fed a high-fat diet for nine weeks along with single dose of streptozotocin after the second week to induce DC. The haemodynamic evaluation was performed to assess the functional status of rats using the Biopac system. Cardiac echocardiography, biochemical, oxidative stress parameters and inflammatory cytokine level were analysed in addition to haematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichome staining to study histological changes, cardiomyocyte diameter and fibrosis, respectively. Phosphodiesterase-1 (PDE-1), transforming growth factor-ss (TGF-ss) and p-Smad 2/3 expression in cardiac tissues were quantified using western blot/RT-PCR.
   Key finding Vinpocetine treatment and its combination with enalapril decreased the glucose levels compared to diabetic rats. Vinpocetine improved the echocardiographic parameters and cardiac functional status of rats. Vinpocetine decreased the cardiac biochemical parameters, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine levels, cardiomyocyte diameter and fibrosis in rats. Interestingly, expressions of PDE-1, TGF-ss and p-Smad 2/3 were ameliorated by vinpocetine alone and in combination with enalapril.
   Conclusions Vinpocetine is a well-known inhibitor of PDE-1 and the protective effect of vinpocetine in DC is exerted by inhibition of PDE-1 and subsequent inhibition of the expression of TGF-ss/Smad 2/3.

AB  - Background Children with lupus have a higher chance of nephritis and worse kidney outcome than adult patients.
   Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical presentation, treatment and 24-month kidney outcome in a cohort of 382 patients (<= 18 years old) with lupus nephritis (LN) class >= III diagnosed and treated in the last 10 years in 23 international centers.
   Results The mean age at onset was 11 years 9 months and 72.8% were females. Fifty-seven percent and 34% achieved complete and partial remission at 24-month follow-up, respectively. Patients with LN class III achieved complete remission more often than those with classes IV or V (mixed and pure). Only 89 of 351 patients maintained stable complete kidney remission from the 6(th) to 24(th) months of follow-up. eGFR >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) at diagnosis and biopsy class III were predictive of stable kidney remission. The youngest and the oldest age quartiles (2y-9y, 5m) (14y, 2m-18y,2m) showed lower rates of stable remission (17% and 20.7%, respectively) compared to the two other age groups (29.9% and 33.7%), while there was no difference in gender.
   No difference in achieving stable remission was found between children who received mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide as induction treatment.
   Conclusion Our data show that the rate of complete remission in patients with LN is still not high enough. Severe kidney involvement at diagnosis was the most important risk factor for not achieving stable remission while different induction treatments did not impact outcome. Randomized treatment trials involving children and adolescents with LN are needed to improve outcome for these children.

AB  - Early breast cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide. Recent advances continue to improve outcomes and increase long-term survivorship. However, therapeutic modalities are deleterious for pa-tients' bone health. While antiresorptive therapy may partially negate this, consequent reduction in rates of fragility fractures remains unproven. Selective prescription of bisphosphonates or denosumab may be an amicable middle ground. Recent evidence also suggests a possible role of osteoclast inhibitors as adju-vant therapy, but the evidence is modest at best. In this narrative clinical review, we explore the impact of various adjuvant modalities on bone mineral density and fragility fracture rates of early breast cancer sur-vivors. We also review optimal patient selection for antiresorptive agents, their impact on rates of fragility fractures, and the possible role of these agents as adjuvant therapy.

AB  - Identification of genes dysregulated during the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-host cell interaction adds to the under-standing of underlying molecular mechanisms and aids in discovering effective therapies to improve prognosis in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected individuals. Through bioinformatics analyses of transcriptomics data, this study aimed to identify potential genes involved in the cross-talk of human hepatocytes expressing the HBV viral protein HBx with endothelial cells. Transient transfection of HBV viral gene X (HBx) was performed in THLE2 cells using pcDNA3 constructs. Through mRNA Sequencing (RNA Seq) analysis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. THLE2 cells transfected with HBx (THLE2x) were further treated with conditioned medium from cultured human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC-CM). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that interferon and cytokine signaling pathways were primarily enriched for the downregulated DEGs in THLE2x cells treated with HUVEC-CM. One significant module was selected following protein-protein interaction (PPI) network generation, and thirteen hub genes were identified from the module. The prognostic values of the hub genes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter, and three genes (IRF7, IFIT1, and IFITM1) correlated with poor disease specific survival (DSS) in HCC patients with chronic hepatitis. A comparison of the DEGs identified in HUVEC-stimulated THLE2x cells with four publicly available HBV-related HCC microarray datasets revealed that PLAC8 was consistently downregulated in all four HCC datasets as well as in HUVEC-CM treated THLE2x cells. KM plots revealed that PLAC8 correlated with worse relapse free survival and progression free survival in HCC patients with hepatitis B virus infection. This study provided molecular insights which may help develop a deeper understanding of HBV-host stromal cell interaction and open avenues for future research.

AB  - BackgroundCancer remains an escalating and challenging public health issue. The management, especially palliative care (PC), is disintegrated and out of reach of in need patients. The overall aim of the project is to develop a feasible and scalable Comprehensive Coordinated Community based PC model for Cancer Patients (C3PaC); congruent with socio-cultural, context and unmet needs in north India.MethodsA mixed method approach will be used for three-phased pre- and post-intervention study in one of the districts of North India, having a high incidence of cancer. During phase I, validated tools will be used for quantitative assessment of palliative needs among cancer patients and their caregivers. Barriers and challenges for provision of palliative care will be explored using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions among participants and health care workers. The findings of phase I along with inputs from national experts and literature review will provide inputs for the development of the C3PAC model in phase II. During phase III C3PAC model will be deployed over a period of 12 months and its impact assessed. Categorical and continuous variables will be depicted as frequency (percentages) and mean +/- SD/median (IQR) respectively. Chi-square test/Fischer test, independent samples Student t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests will be used for categorical, normally and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively. Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis using Atlas.ti 8 software.DiscussionThe proposed model is designed to address the unmet palliative care needs, to empower community-based healthcare providers in comprehensive home-based PC and to improve the quality of life of cancer patients and caregivers. This model will provide pragmatic scalable solutions in comparable health systems particularly in low- and lower-middle Income countries.

AB  - Bronchoscopy in children has been utilized primarily to diagnose airway anomalies and obtain bronchoalveolar lavage. Gradual development of thinner bronchoscopes and instruments has opened the gates to the world of bronchoscopic interventions in children. Endobronchial ultrasound guided mediastinal aspiration has been used in adults and children. In younger children, esophageal approach has also been used for sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes. Lung biopsies using cryoprobe have been increasingly used in children. Other bronchoscopic interventions discussed include dilatation of tracheobronchial stenosis, airway stenting, foreign body removal, hemoptysis control, re-expansion of atelectasis etc. Patient safety during the procedure is of paramount importance. Expertise and availability of equipment to handle complications is of huge significance.

AB  - Background/Aim: Contact-sports are known to have higher risk of orofacial injuries due to the bodily contact with other players or equipment. Kabaddi is a traditional contact-sport of India that has gained an international recognition. There is a paucity of data regarding prevalence of traumatic dental and orofacial injuries among the Kabaddi players. Hence this study aimed to assess the prevalence, distribution and pattern of orofacial injuries among the Kabaddi players of Delhi and NCR region.Material and Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was designed as per the best practices of epidemiology and reported as per the STROBE guidelines. The sample size was calculated as 440 and comprised of 10-18 years old players of either gender. Cluster random sampling was performed and the information was collected by one-calibrated evaluator by using a self-designed proforma. The injuries were classified as per standard criteria and the description of each episode was recorded. Statistical anal-ysis was performed using the Statistical software-STATA-version-14(StataCorpLLC,Texas,USA). Results: Total of 393 players were included in the study (Males-295, Females-98) with majority of them between 15 and 18 years of age. The prevalence of traumatic episode was 49.11% and the prevalence orofacial-trauma was 44.02%.The frequency of extraoral-injuries was higher when compared to the intrao-ral injuries, with orbit(26.67%) being the commonest-site. Most of the players had not received adequate emergency treatment in the first incident which had improved in the second.Conclusions: The prevalence of traumatic orofacial injuries in 10-18 years old Kabaddi players of Delhi -NCR region was found to be 44.02% while the prevalence of traumatic episodes was 49.11%. The preva-lence of dental injuries was 5.1%. Majority of the players perceived that Kabaddi can lead to orofacial-injuries.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - ObjectivesTo analyze the performance of deep learning in isodense/obscure masses in dense breasts. To build and validate a deep learning (DL) model using core radiology principles and analyze its performance in isodense/obscure masses. To show performance on screening mammography as well as diagnostic mammography distribution.MethodsThis was a retrospective, single-institution, multi-centre study with external validation. For model building, we took a 3-pronged approach. First, we explicitly taught the network to learn features other than density differences: such as spiculations and architectural distortion. Second, we used the opposite breast to enable the detection of asymmetries. Third, we systematically enhanced each image by piece-wise-linear transformation. We tested the network on a diagnostic mammography dataset (2569 images with 243 cancers, January to June 2018) and a screening mammography dataset (2146 images with 59 cancers, patient recruitment from January to April 2021) from a different centre (external validation).ResultsWhen trained with our proposed technique (and compared with baseline network), sensitivity for malignancy increased from 82.7 to 84.7% at 0.2 False positives per image (FPI) in the diagnostic mammography dataset, 67.9 to 73.8% in the subset of patients with dense breasts, 74.6 to 85.3 in the subset of patients with isodense/obscure cancers and 84.9 to 88.7 in an external validation test set with a screening mammography distribution. We showed that our sensitivity exceeded currently reported values (0.90 at 0.2 FPI) on a public benchmark dataset (INBreast).ConclusionModelling traditional mammographic teaching into a DL framework can help improve cancer detection accuracy in dense breasts.

AB  - Intracranial cavernous sinus metastases of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are rare, with a reported incidence of 0.4 %. Due to their extremely infrequent presentation the etiology and management modalities of such complications are not clearly represented in the literature. Here we present a case of a 58-year-old male diagnosed with OSCC of Right Lower Alveolus with underlying bone invasion, cT4aN1M0, Stage IV. He un-derwent Right Hemi-mandibulectomy with Modified Neck Dissection, Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap, and 60 Gy/30# adjuvant radiotherapy. Six months later, the patient was diagnosed with recurrence involving the right infratemporal fossa with associated right cavernous sinus thrombosis. Immunohistochemistry block review showed PDL1 - Positive. The patient was subjected to Cisplatin and Pembrolizumab immunotherapy. After receiving 35 cycles of Pembrolizumab over a period of 2 years the patient is doing well with no recurrence.

AB  - BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 was reported to induce cell fusions to form multinuclear syncytia that might facilitate viral replication, dissemination, immune evasion, and inflammatory responses. In this study, we have reported the types of cells involved in syncytia formation at different stages of COVID-19 disease through electron microscopy.MethodsBronchoalveolar fluids from the mild (n = 8, SpO2 > 95%, no hypoxia, within 2-8 days of infection), moderate (n = 8, SpO2 90% to <= 93% on room air, respiratory rate >= 24/min, breathlessness, within 9-16 days of infection), and severe (n = 8, SpO2 < 90%, respiratory rate > 30/min, external oxygen support, after 17th days of infection) COVID-19 patients were examined by PAP (cell type identification), immunofluorescence (for the level of viral infection), scanning (SEM), and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy to identify the syncytia.ResultsImmunofluorescence studies (S protein-specific antibodies) from each syncytium indicate a very high infection level. We could not find any syncytial cells in mildly infected patients. However, identical (neutrophils or type 2 pneumocytes) and heterotypic (neutrophils-monocytes) plasma membrane initial fusion (indicating initiation of fusion) was observed under TEM in moderately infected patients. Fully matured large-size (20-100 mu m) syncytial cells were found in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS-like) patients of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophage origin under SEM.ConclusionsThis ultrastructural study on the syncytial cells from COVID-19 patients sheds light on the disease's stages and types of cells involved in the syncytia formations. Syncytia formation was first induced in type II pneumocytes by homotypic fusion and later with haematopoetic cells (monocyte and neutrophils) by heterotypic fusion in the moderate stage (9-16 days) of the disease. Matured syncytia were reported in the late phase of the disease and formed large giant cells of 20 to 100 mu m.

AB  - The purpose is to discuss abdominal tuberculosis mimicking malignancy involving the abdominal viscera. TB of the abdominal viscera is common, especially in countries where tuberculosis is endemic and in pockets of non-endemic countries. Diagnosis is challenging as clinical presentations are often non-specific. Tissue sampling may be necessary for definitive diagnosis. Awareness of the early and late disease imaging appearances of abdominal tuberculosis involving the viscera that can mimic malignancy can aid detecting TB, providing a differential diagnosis, assessing extent of spread, guiding biopsy, and evaluating response.

TI  - Oral Propranolol Therapy for Infantile Hemangioma: Long-term Follow-up

AB  - beta-blocker therapy is currently the treatment of choice for infantile hemangiomas (IH), albeit with limited data on long-term treatment outcomes. Herein, authors treated 67 IH lesions in 47 patients with oral propranolol at 2 mg/kg/d for a median of 9 mo and followed them up for a median of 48 mo. While no maintenance therapy was required for 18 lesions (26.9%), the rest needed maintenance therapy. Both treatment regimens had comparable efficacy (83.3 +/- 23.9% and 92.0 +/- 13.8%) but chances of IH recurrence was higher in lesions requiring maintenance therapy. Also, patients treated at >5 mo of age had a significantly better response and a lower recurrence rate than patients treated at >5 mo of age (95.0 +/- 7.9% vs. 87.0 +/- 17.5%, p = 0.05). Authors' experience suggests that longer durations of maintenance therapy offered no added advantage to the overall improvement of IH while treatment initiation at an earlier age showed better improvement and lower recurrence rates.

TI  - Eight versus twelve weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir in treatment-naive non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Study protocol for a multicentric, open labelled, randomized, non-inferiority trial (RESOLVE trial)
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - NATURAL-HISTORY
AB  - Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, nearly 71 million people have chronic HCV infection, and approximately 399,000 dies annually. In patients without cirrhosis, HCV infection is treated with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination. Results from available small, single-centre observational studies suggest that the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination given for 8 weeks may be as effective as the standard 12 weeks of treatment. We propose to compare the treatment response of 12 weeks versus 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in non-cirrhotic people with chronic HCV infection.Methods This multicentric, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial will include 880 (2 arms x 440) treatment naive, viraemic (HCV RNA >10,000 IU/mL), non-cirrhotic adults (age >18 years) with chronic hepatitis C. People who are at high-risk for HCV reinfection such as haemophiliacs, people who inject drugs, those on maintenance hemodialysis or having HIV will be excluded. The presence or absence of cirrhosis will be determined with a combination of history, examination, ultrasound, liver stiffness measured with transient elastography, APRI, FIB-4, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Participants will be randomized to receive either 8- or 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment. A blood specimen will be collected before starting the treatment (to determine the HCV genotype), after 4 weeks of treatment (for early virological response), and at 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation for SVR12.Discussion The study will provide data on the efficacy of 8 weeks of treatment as compared to the standard of care (12 weeks) in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV infection. Treatment for a shorter duration may improve treatment compliance, reduce the cost of treatment, and ease the treatment implementation from a public health perspective.

AB  - Objectives: Compare the efficacy and safety of daily vs. monthly oral vitamin D-3 in treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants.
   Methods: 90 infants with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency were randomized into Daily (D) [46 infants] and Bolus (B) [44 infants] groups to receive oral vitamin D3, daily (2000 IU/day) and bolus (60,000 IU/month) for three months respectively. Both groups received daily oral calcium @50 mg/kg/day. Serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, urine calcium: creatinine ratio and radiological score were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, 78 infants were available for evaluation of efficacy and safety of both regimens.
   Results: Both regimens led to a statistically significant increase in Ca and P levels and fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no inter-group difference. Infants in group D had statistically significant higher mean 25(OH)D levels as compared to group B at 4 weeks (groupD 130.89 +/- 43.43 nmol/L, group B - 108.25 +/- 32.40 nmol/L; p - 0.012) and 12 weeks (group D - 193.69 +/- 32.47 nmol/L, group B - 153.85 +/- 33.60 nmol/L; p<0.001). Eight infants [group D - 6/41 (14.6%); group B - 2/37 (5.4 %), p=0.268] developed mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia without hypercalciuria at 12 weeks that corrected spontaneously within a week.
   Conclusions: Both daily and monthly oral vitamin D3 in equivalent doses are efficacious and safe for treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants.

AB  - Background & aim: MicroRNAs associated with the Notch pathway play a critical role in the progression of pancreatic carcinoma. Our aim was to study the clinical significance of miR-107 and NOTCH2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods: The circulating miR-107 levels in PDAC and controls were determined by qPCR. NOTCH2 protein (target) expression in tissue of PDAC, periampullary carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis and normal pancreatic tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: The circulating miR-107 levels were found to be significantly reduced in PDAC as compared with controls. Additionally, NOTCH2 protein expression was higher in PDAC tissue as compared with controls and was clinically associated with metastasis. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the utility of circulating miR-107 as a potential differentiating marker in PDAC.

AB  - The bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum (Rsc) affects many economically important crop plants, including tomatoes. This bacterium enters the plant through the root system, which plays a vital role in defence against this phytopathogen. However, till now researches have mostly focused on managing the bacterial wilt disease by inducing defence in the aerial plant parts. To understand the efficacy of root-priming with the extract of an endophytic fungus Penicillium sp. PM031 on its host tomato plant for controlling wilt disease, we checked its toxicity effects and disease severity in primed plants. Additionally, we explored the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms responsible for disease resistance in primed plants. This study demonstrates natural extract from Penicillium sp. PM031 at the concentration up to 0.06% (w/v) was found to be non-toxic against human liver cell line, and it was not phytotoxic at a concentration of 0.05% (w/v) towards tomato seeds and seedlings. The endophytic fungal extract at a non-toxic concentration elicits the root immunity in the host tomato plant to control Rsc. Root-priming evoked the levels of total phenolics (39%), flavonoid (3.74-fold), lignin (43%), peroxidase (1.8-fold), hydrogen peroxide, and significantly reduced the wilt symptoms by similar to 57% compared to the unprimed plants. We conclude that host can be protected by enhancing precise, tissue-specific immunity using endophytic fungal metabolites acting as plant elicitors.

AB  - RNA viruses continue to remain a threat for potential pandemics due to their rapid evolution. Potentiating host antiviral pathways to prevent or limit viral infections is a promising strategy. Thus, by testing a library of innate immune agonists targeting pathogen recognition receptors, we observe that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), TLR8, and Dectin-1 ligands inhibit arboviruses, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus, and Zika virus to varying degrees. STING agonists (cAIMP, diABZI, and 20,30-cGAMP) and Dectin-1 agonist scleroglucan demonstrate the most potent, broad-spectrum antiviral function. Furthermore, STING agonists inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) infection in cardiomyocytes. Transcriptome analysis reveals that cAIMP treatment rescue cells from CHIKV-induced dysregulation of cell repair, immune, and metabolic path-ways. In addition, cAIMP provides protection against CHIKV in a chronic CHIKV-arthritis mouse model. Our study describes innate immune signaling circuits crucial for RNA virus replication and identifies broad-spec-trum antivirals effective against multiple families of pandemic potential RNA viruses.

AB  - Importance Most epidemiological studies of heart failure (HF) have been conducted in high-income countries with limited comparable data from middle- or low-income countries.
   Objective To examine differences in HF etiology, treatment, and outcomes between groups of countries at different levels of economic development.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Multinational HF registry of 23341 participants in 40 high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income countries, followed up for a median period of 2.0 years.
   Main Outcomes and Measures HF cause, HF medication use, hospitalization, and death.
   Results Mean (SD) age of participants was 63.1 (14.9) years, and 9119 (39.1%) were female. The most common cause of HF was ischemic heart disease (38.1%) followed by hypertension (20.2%). The proportion of participants with HF with reduced ejection fraction taking the combination of a beta-blocker, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist was highest in upper-middle-income (61.9%) and high-income countries (51.1%), and it was lowest in low-income (45.7%) and lower-middle-income countries (39.5%) (P<.001). The age- and sex- standardized mortality rate per 100 person-years was lowest in high-income countries (7.8 [95% CI, 7.5-8.2]), 9.3 (95% CI, 8.8-9.9) in upper-middle-income countries, 15.7 (95% CI, 15.0-16.4) in lower-middle-income countries, and it was highest in low-income countries (19.1 [95% CI, 17.6-20.7]). Hospitalization rates were more frequent than death rates in high-income countries (ratio=3.8) and in upper-middle-income countries (ratio=2.4), similar in lower-middle-income countries (ratio=1.1), and less frequent in low-income countries (ratio=0.6). The 30-day case-fatality rate after first hospital admission was lowest in high-income countries (6.7%), followed by upper-middle-income countries (9.7%), then lower-middle-income countries (21.1%), and highest in low-income countries (31.6%). The proportional risk of death within 30 days of a first hospital admission was 3- to 5-fold higher in lower-middle-income countries and low-income countries compared with high-income countries after adjusting for patient characteristics and use of long-term HF therapies.
   Conclusions and Relevance This study of HF patients from 40 different countries and derived from 4 different economic levels demonstrated differences in HF etiologies, management, and outcomes. These data may be useful in planning approaches to improve HF prevention and treatment globally.

AB  - Cancer is a cause of high deaths worldwide and also a huge burden for the health system. Cancer cells have unique properties such as a high rate of proliferation, self-renewal, metastasis, and treatment resistance, therefore, the development of novel diagnoses of cancers is a tedious task. Exosomes are secreted by virtually all cell types and have the ability to carry a multitude of biomolecules crucial for intercellular communication, hence, contributing a crucial part in the onset and spread of cancer. These exosomal components can be utilized in the development of markers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes for various cancers. This review emphasized primarily the following topics: exosomes structure and functions, isolation and characterization strategies of exosomes, the role of exosomal contents in cancer with a focus in particular on noncoding RNA and protein, exosomes, and the cancer microenvironment interactions, cancer stem cells, and tumor diagnosis and prognosis based on exosomes.

AB  - BackgroundMonitoring the transmission patterns of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a population is fundamental for identifying the key population and designing prevention interventions. In the present study, we aimed to estimate the gender disparities in HIV incidence and the age, period, and cohort effects on the incidence of HIV in India for identifying the predictors that might have led to changes in the last three decades. Data and methodsThis study utilizes data from the Global Burden of Disease Study for the period 1990-2019. The joinpoint regression analysis was employed to identify the magnitude of the changes in age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of HIV. The average annual percentage changes in the incidence were computed, and the age-period-cohort analysis was performed. ResultsA decreasing trend in the overall estimates of age-standardized HIV incidence rates were observed in the period 1990-2019. The joinpoint regression analysis showed that the age-standardized incidence significantly declined from its peak in 1997 to 2019 (38.0 and 27.6 among males and females per 100,000 in 1997 to 5.4 and 4.6, respectively, in 2019). The APC was estimated to be 2.12 among males and 1.24 among females for the period 1990-2019. In recent years, although the gender gap in HIV incidence has reduced, females were observed to bear a proportionately higher burden of HIV incidence. Age effect showed a decline in HIV incidence by 91.1 and 70.1% among males and females aged between 15-19 years and 75-79 years. During the entire period from 1990-1994 to 2015-2019, the RR of HIV incidence decreased by 36.2 and 33.7% among males and females, respectively. ConclusionIndia is experiencing a decline in new HIV infections in recent years. However, the decline is steeper for males than for females. Findings highlight the necessity of providing older women and young women at risk with effective HIV prevention. This study emphasizes the need for large-scale HIV primary prevention efforts for teenage girls and young women.

AB  - Coronavirus-induced disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is still a major global health challenge. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) represent retroviral elements that were integrated into the ancestral human genome. HERVs are important in embryonic development as well as in the manifestation of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and viral infections. Here, we analyze the expression of several HERVs in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and observe increased activity of HERV-E, HERV-V, HERV-FRD, HERV-MER34, HERV-W, and HERV-K-HML2. In contrast, the HERV-R envelope is downregulated in cell-based models and PBMCs of COVID-19 patients. Overexpression of HERV-R inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, suggesting its antiviral activity. Further analyses demonstrate the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in regulating HERV-R antiviral activity. Lastly, our data indicate that the crosstalk between ERK and p38 MAPK controls the synthesis of the HERV-R envelope protein, which in turn modulates SARS-CoV-2 replication. These findings suggest the role of the HERV-R envelope as a prosurvival host factor against SARS-CoV-2 and illustrate a possible advantage of integration and evolutionary maintenance of retroviral elements in the human genome.

AB  - IntroductionPost-stroke sleep disorders (PSSD) are an important part of post-stroke disability. PSSD is neglected as a part of stroke rehabilitation. We aimed to study the prevalence and determinants of PSSD in a hospital based, single center setting.MethodsIn a cross-sectional study, adult patients (>= 18 years) with stroke (one month to one year after the onset), were enrolled in the study. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and motor and functional disabilities were assessed. Sleep quality was assessed with Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and STOP BANG questionnaire (for obstructive sleep apnea [OSA]). Patients with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) were analyzed for risk factors.ResultsA total of 103 patients were recruited in the study period (January 2021 to June 2022). The self-reported prevalence of PSSD was 16% which increased to 72% when the PSQI was administered. High risk of OSA was present in 33%. In bivariate analysis, factors associated with PSQI > 5 were involvement of >= 2 lobes, lower body mass index (BMI), worse modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL). In multivariate analysis, only depression was associated with PSQI > 5 (OR: 1.3 (1.0; 1.7); p-value = 0.03).ConclusionPSSD had a prevalence of 72%. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with PSQI > 5 was worse HAM-D score.

AB  - Osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells, are essential for the bone remodeling process and are involved in the pathophysiology of several bone-related diseases. The extensive corpus of in vitro research and crucial mouse model studies in the 1990s demonstrated the key roles of monocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and integrin alpha v beta 3 in osteoclast biology. Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which these variables control osteoclast differentiation and function has significantly advanced in the first decade of this century. Recent developments have revealed a number of novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing the differentiation and functional activity of osteoclasts; however, these mechanisms have not yet been adequately documented. Thus, in the present review, we discuss various regulatory factors including local and hormonal factors, innate as well as adaptive immune cells, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), etc., in the molecular regulation of the intricate and tightly regulated process of osteoclastogenesis. ncRNAs have a critical role as epigenetic controllers of osteoclast physiologic activities, including differentiation and bone resorption. The primary ncRNAs, which include micro-RNAs, circular RNAs, and long noncoding RNAs, form a complex network that affects gene transcription activities associated with osteoclast biological activity. Greater knowledge of the involvement of ncRNAs in osteoclast biological activities will contribute to the treatment and management of several skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Moreover, we further outline potential therapies targeting these regulatory pathways of osteoclastogenesis in distinct bone pathologies.

AB  - Bhramari Pranayama, which belongs to the group of pranayama, is a calming breadth practice. In the present study, we aim to investigate the cortical dynamics associated with Bhramari pranayama. We evaluated the power spectral density and cross-spectral density matrices in thirty trained practitioners before, during, and after they performed Bhramari pranayama. A significant increase (p < 0.05) in overall theta (12.64 mu V2/Hz and 17.51 mu V2/ Hz) and alpha spectral power (19.36 mu V2/Hz and 26.11 mu V2/Hz) in the right temporal region of the brain was found during and after the pranayama. Additionally, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in gamma spectral power in the right (1.99 mu V2/Hz) and left temporal (1.66 mu V2/Hz) and parietal (1.62 mu V2/Hz) regions, was observed during and after the pranayama. The cross-spectral density significantly increases after performing the Bhramari pranayama compared to before the pranayama in the alpha band (p < 0.05). Subsequently, all-to-all functional connectivity between EEG channels in sensor space is presented using circular graphs. Further graph theory analysis is employed to assess the effects of Bhramari pranayama on functional brain networks. These findings reveal that the alpha band's functional network topology of Bhramari meditators is more integrated during and after the meditation. Also, the power spectral changes are more prominent in the temporal region of the brain due to the generation of humming sound. By measuring these changes, meditators can determine the effec-tiveness of their pranayama practice inducing relaxation. Therefore, these results are valuable for enhancing pranayama practice and help in understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying pranayama.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation alleviates metabolic defects in diseased recipient cells by intercellular mitochondrial transport (IMT). However, the effect of host metabolic conditions on IMT and thereby on the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs has largely remained unexplored. Here we found impaired mitophagy, and reduced IMT in MSCs derived from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse (MSC-Ob). MSC-Ob failed to sequester their damaged mitochondria into LC3-dependent autophagosomes due to decrease in mitochondrial cardiolipin content, which we propose as a putative mitophagy receptor for LC3 in MSCs. Functionally, MSC-Ob exhibited diminished potential to rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in stress-induced airway epithelial cells. Pharmacological modulation of MSCs enhanced cardiolipin-dependent mitophagy and restored their IMT ability to airway epithelial cells. Therapeutically, these modulated MSCs attenuated features of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) in two independent mouse models by restoring healthy IMT. However, unmodulated MSC-Ob failed to do so. Notably, in human (h)MSCs, induced metabolic stress associated impaired cardiolipin-dependent mitophagy was restored upon pharmacological modulation. In summary, we have provided the first comprehensive molecular understanding of impaired mitophagy in obese-derived MSCs and highlight the importance of pharmacological modulation of these cells for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - High blood levels of lead have been shown to relate to its toxicity, and its early detection in occupational workers is important to take necessary measures. The genes associated with lead toxicity were identified by in silico analysis of expression profile (GEO-GSE37567) based on lead exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells maintained in culture. The GEO2R tool was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among three groups: control versus day-1 treatment, control versus day-2 treatment, and control versus day-1 treatment versus day-2 treatment, and their enrichment analysis was performed to categorize them for molecular function, biological process, cellular component, and KEGG pathways. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed using a STRING tool and hub genes were identified by using the CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. Top 250 DEGs were screened in the first and second groups and 211 DEGs were in the third group. Fifteen critical genes viz. MT1G, ASPH, MT1F, TMEM158, CDK5RAP2, BRCA2, MT1E, EDNRB, MT1H, KITLG, MT1X, MT2A, ARRDC4, MT1M, and MT1HL1 were selected for functional enrichment and pathway analysis. The DEGs were primarily enriched in metal ion binding, metal absorption, and cellular response to metal ions. The significantly enriched KEGG pathways included mineral absorption, melanogenesis, and cancer signaling pathways. PPI network analysis revealed that seven genes of the MT family exhibited good connectedness and served as a marker of lead induced toxicity. Our study suggests that MT1E, MT1H, MT1G, MT1X, MT1F, MT1M, and MT2A of the metallothioneins gene family may act as potential biomarkers to monitor lead exposure.

AB  - Disc diffusion testing by Kirby-Bauer technique is the most used method for determining antimicrobial susceptibility in microbiological laboratories. The current guidelines by The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2022 specify using an 18- to 24-h growth for testing by disc diffusion. We aim to determine if using an early growth (6 h and 10 h) would produce comparable results, thus ultimately leading to reduced turnaround time. Six-hour, 10-h, and 24-h growths of 20 quality control strains and 6-h and 24-h growths of 48 clinical samples were used to perform disc diffusion testing using a panel of appropriate antimicrobial agents. Disc diffusion zone sizes were interpreted for all and comparative analyses were performed to determine categorical agreement, minor errors (mE), major errors (ME), and very major errors (VME) according to CLSI guidelines. On comparing with the standard 24 h of incubation, disc diffusion from 6-h and 10-h growths of quality control strains showed 94.38% categorical agreement, 5.10% mE, 0.69% MEs, and no VMEs. Disc diffusion testing for the additional 40 clinical samples yielded a similarly high level of categorical agreement (98.15%) and mE, ME, and VME of 1.29%, 1.22%, and 0% respectively. Disc diffusion testing using early growth is a simple and accurate method for susceptibility testing that can reduce turnaround time and may prove to be critical for timely patient management.

AB  - Objective: End-stage ocular diseases usually end up with atrophic bulbi or phthisis bulbi leading to orbital volume loss which needs to be addressed. We studied the use of autologous fat for volume augmentation of the orbit because it is minimally invasive and allows early rehabilitation with the use of an artificial eye.
   Design: It was a prospective, interventional study.
   Methods: A total of 14 eyes of 14 patients with atrophic bulbi with shrinkage or phthisis bulbi with no perception of light (PL) and aged older than 18 years were included for the study purpose. Painful or inflamed eyes or suspected intraocular tumors were excluded. An autologous fat graft was obtained from the lower abdomen or buttocks and injected into the retrobulbar space using a 20-gauge cannula after adequate peribulbar anesthesia. Outcomes measures were patient satisfaction, change in Hertel's exophthalmometry, vertical and horizontal palpebral aperture, and socket volume.
   Results: Hertel exophthalmometry showed a significant improvement both with and without an artificial eye from 14.92 +/- 2.3 mm to 16.71 +/- 1.94 mm (p-value 0.003 without an artificial eye). The vertical palpebral aperture also showed a significant improvement from 5 +/- 1.70 mm to 6.71 +/- 1.58 mm (p-value < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in the socket volume from 1.22 ml to 0.39 ml (p-value < 0.001). No local or donor site complications were seen.
   Conclusions: Autologous fat transfer is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective procedure for orbital volume augmentation in small, nonseeing eyes. The short-term outcome of our study was good in most patients and can be considered for such patients.

AB  - Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) remains incurable, despite the current checkpoint-blockade-driven, limited overall response rate. The CD8+ memory T cells can mount a rapid and an effective response. The ubiquitin ligase RAD6-KCMF1-UBR4-mediated regulation of autophagy in CD8+ memory T cells in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unexplored. Consequently, flow cytometry was used to study memory T cells, and their subsets, including activation and regulatory phenotypes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Expression of the ubiquitin ligase and autophagy was measured both at the cellular and molecular levels in memory T cells of patients with RCC. JC.1 staining and Annexin/PI assays were used to evaluate the memory T cells depolarization and apoptosis rates. The results indicated that the disruption of Ub-E2-E3 complex and impaired autophagy in memory T cells diminished their ability to survive and combat against tumor cells. Inhibition of memory T cells apoptosis by targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase or autophagy pathways can be explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the long-term survival of memory T cells in RCC.

AB  - IntroductionRadioisotope and blue dye are standard agents for performing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer. The paucity of nuclear medicine facility poses logistic challenge. This study evaluated performance of radioisotope & methylene blue (MB) with indocyanine green (ICG) and MB for SLNB.Patients and MethodsThis randomized controlled trial was conducted from December 2019 to July 2022 comparing SLN identification proportions of radioisotope-blue dye [Group A] with dual dye (MB + ICG; Group B]. Secondary objective included time required and cost effectiveness of performing SLNB. Sample size of 70 (35 in each arm) was calculated. Upfront operable node negative early breast cancer was included in the study. Clinico-demographic data, number & type of SLN, time taken were noted. Cost analysis was done including the equipment, manpower & consumables. Chi-square/Fisher exact test was used to compare proportion between two groups. p value of less than 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.ResultsSeventy patients randomized to either group were similar in clinico-demographic and tumor characteristics. SLN identification rate (IR) was 91.43% in group A and 100% in group B. Overall IR of MB, radioisotope and ICG were 91.43%, 91.43% and 100%, respectively. Mean number of SLNs identified were 3 in group A and 4 in group B. Median time required for SLNB was 12 min and 14 min in either group, respectively. Cost of performing SLNB was higher in Group B.ConclusionSLNB using dual dye is non-inferior to radioisotope-blue dye in upfront operable early breast cancer.Trial registration number Clinical Trial registry India CTRI/2020/02/023503.

AB  - Multiple studies have shown that the progression of breast cancer depends on multiple signaling pathways, suggesting that therapies with multitargeted anticancer agents will offer improved therapeutic benefits through synergistic effects in inhibiting cancer growth. Dual-targeted inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) have emerged as promising cancer therapy candidates. However, poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability limited their efficacy in cancer. The present study investigates the encapsulation of a PI3-K delta/HDAC6 dual inhibitor into hybrid block copolymers (polylactic acid-methoxy polyethylene glycol; polylactic acid-polyethylene glycol-polypropylene glycol-polyethylene glycolpolylactic acid) (HSB-510) as a delivery system to target PI3-K delta and HDAC6 pathways in breast cancer cells. The prepared HSB-510 showed an average diameter of 96 +/- 3 nm, a zeta potential of -17 +/- 2 mV, and PDI of <0.1 with a slow and sustained release profile of PI3-K delta/HDAC6 inhibitors in a nonphysiological buffer. In vitro studies with HSB-510 have demonstrated substantial growth inhibition of breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468, SUM-149, MCF-7, and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) as well as downregulation of phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK, and c-Myc levels. Importantly, bi-weekly treatment of Balb/c wild-type mice harboring EAC cells with HSB-510 at a dose of 25 mg/kg resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition. The treatment with HSB-510 was without any significant effect on the body weights of the mice. These results demonstrate that a novel Quatramer encapsulation of a PI3-Kd/HDAC6 dual inhibitor (HSB-510) represents an approach for the successful targeting of breast cancer and potentially other cancer types.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the SimSpine (indigenously developed, low-cost model) and EasyGO! (Karl Storz, Tut-tlingen, Germany) systems for simulation of endoscopic discectomy.METHODS: Twelve neurosurgery residents, 6 in post-graduate years 1-4 or equivalent (junior) and 6 in post-graduate years 5-6 or equivalent (senior), were randomly allocated (1:1) to either EasyGO! or SimSpine endoscopic visualization systems for endoscopic lumbar discectomy simulation on the same physical simulator. After the first exercise, the participants switched over to the other sys-tem, and the exercise was repeated. Time taken to dock the system, time to reach annulus, time required for task completion, dural violation, and volume of disc material removed were used for calculating objective efficiency score. Subjective scoring (Neurosurgery Education and Training School [NETS] criteria) was performed by 4 blin-ded mentors based on recorded video on 2 separate oc-casions 2 weeks apart. Cumulative score was calculated based on efficiency and Neurosurgery Education and Training School scores.RESULTS: Performance metrics were similar across the 2 platforms, regardless of participant seniority (P > 0.05). Time to reach disc space and discectomy time improved for both EasyGO! (P = 0.07 and P = 0.03, respectively) and SimSpine (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively) between first and second exercises. Efficiency and cumulative scores were better (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03 respectively) when EasyGO! was used as the first device compared with SimSpine. -CONCLUSIONS: SimSpine is a cost-effective viable alternative to EasyGO for endoscopic lumbar discectomy simulation-based training.

AB  - Background: Obesity is recognised as an important risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with obese individuals at a four times higher risk of being diagnosed with the syndrome. Treating obesity with lifestyle modification is associated with a reduction in the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Yoga comprises lifestyle modification that includes asana (postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), dhyana (meditation) and guideline principles for healthy living (Yama and Niyama). There is a scarcity of data to evaluate the effect of yoga on OSA. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga based lifestyle modification on OSA. Methods: Consenting obese patients (BMI >23) diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (AHI>5) on Polysomnography (PSG) were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomized into two groups. The control group received counselling for dietary modification (staple Indian) with regular exercise and the active intervention group received Yoga intervention as treatment (OSA module) in addition to similar dietary modification and regular exercise counselling. Polysomnography (PSG) was conducted at baseline and one year follow-up. All patients were evaluated at baseline, six months, and one year for compliance and anthropometric parameters. Additional assessment with Hamilton scales for depression and anxiety, SF-36, and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index was also conducted.Results: A total of 37 eligible patients (19 in the control group and 18 in the yoga group) were recruited for the study. The age [45.73 +/- 10.71 vs. 46.22 +/- 9.39 years, p = 0.88] and gender [15(78.95%) vs. 12(66.67%), p = 0.48 (males)] distribution was similar in both groups. After adjusting for age and gender, the percentage reduction in weight between the two groups did not reach statistical significance at one year. There was no significant difference in mean AHI between the two groups at one year. However, the number of patients with more than 40% AHI reduction [2/19 (10.52%) vs 8/18 (44.44%), p = 0.02] was significantly higher in the yoga group. Additionally, within the groups, the mean AHI at one year was significantly reduced in the yoga group [51.2 +/- 28.0 to 36.8 +/- 21.0/hour, p = 0.003], while no significant change was found in the control group [47.2 +/- 23 to 38.8 +/- 19.9/hour, p = 0.08]. Conclusions: Lifestyle alteration using Yoga intervention and modification of staple Indian diet may be effective in reducing OSA severity among obese patients. CTRI number: CTRI/2017/05/008462.

AB  - Background There is a crucial need to devise optimum rehabilitation programs for children with cerebral palsy (CP). Objective This study aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of combining 6-Hz primed, low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) in improving upper limb function in children with unilateral CP. Methods Children aged 5 to 18 years with unilateral CP were randomized (23 in each arm) to receive 10 sessions of mCIMT with real rTMS (intervention arm) or mCIMT with sham rTMS (control arm), on alternate weekdays over 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in mean change in Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) scores. Secondary outcomes were changes in QUEST domain scores, speed and strength measures, CP quality of life (CP-QOL) scale scores, and safety of rTMS. Results All 46 children completed the trial except one. At 4 weeks, the mean change in total QUEST scores was significantly higher in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm (11.66 +/- 6.97 vs 6.56 +/- 4.3, d = 5.1, 95% CI 1.7-8.5, P = .004). Change in "weight bearing" and "protective extension" domain score was significantly higher for children in the intervention arm. These improvements were sustained at 12 weeks (P = .028). CP-QOL scores improved at 12 weeks. No serious adverse events were seen. Conclusion A 6-Hz primed rTMS combined with mCIMT is safe, feasible, and superior to mCIMT alone in improving the upper limb function of children with unilateral CP.

AB  - Purpose: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Moreover, the burden of HAIs is higher in ICU admitted patients. Long term studies are beneficial to evolution pattern of AMR. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the evolution of AMR pattern over the years in one of the ICUs of a level 1 Trauma Center. This will enable us to modify the prescribing practices according to emerging resistance patterns.Methods: This study was conducted at one of the ICU of level-1 trauma center of tertiary care hospital. The study reports the findings of the AMR surveillance from January 2012 to December 2019. Standard definitions were used to define HAI (www.hais.com). The clinical records of the patients were maintained using ASHAIN indigenous software. Outbreak analysis was done by WHONET. Results: From 1st January 2012-31st December 2019, 4305 isolates were obtained from 1969 patients. Most frequent occurring organism were gram negatives among which A. baumannii was common followed by K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. Retrospective analysis showed 7 outbreaks/clusters during the study period and all the outbreaks occurred from October to December in each year. The increasing trend of AMR pattern emphasizes to strengthen infection control practices and sustained AMR surveillance.

AB  - Postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) in neurosurgery are rare. However, they pose a formidable challenge to the treating neurosurgeon and substantially worsen patient outcomes. These infections require prompt intervention in the form of debridement, including removal of craniotomy bone. Reconstruction of the craniotomy defect can be performed along with the debridement or can be performed at a later time. Although there have been concerns about performing cranioplasty at the same time as debridement, recent studies have advocated performance of cranioplasty at the same time as the debridement, as it avoids the morbidity associated with having a craniectomy defect and avoids the need for another surgical procedure. We conducted a literature review and metaanalysis to examine the data on immediate cranioplasties and delayed cranioplasties performed for postcraniotomy SSIs. We analyzed 15 articles with a total of 353 patients. Our analysis revealed that the pooled proportion of treatment failure was 10.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.9%-17.8%) when an immediate cranioplasty was done and 16.1% (95% CI 7.2%-32.1%) when delayed cranioplasty was done. The pooled proportion of treatment failure was 12% (95% CI 5.9%-22.9%) when the same bone was used for cranioplasty and was 8% (95% CI 3%-20%) when prosthetic material such as titanium was used for cranial vault reconstruction. Thus, the rate of treatment failure was less when an immediate single-stage cranioplasty was done compared with a delayed cranioplasty following SSIs.

AB  - -BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical patients are considered to be at higher risk for infections including nosocomial infections compared with other critically ill individuals. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is of utmost importance for the survival of infected neurosurgical patients.-METHODS: The microbial distribution and antimicrobial resistance patients from January 2012 to December 2021 (10 years) were analyzed retrospectively. Identification was done using VITEK-2 and MALDI-TOF systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by the Kirby Bauer Disk Diffusion Agar method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) and VITEK-2.-RESULTS: A total of 48,474 samples were received, out of which 10,134 (21%) had growth. Respiratory specimens showed the maximum isolation of pathogens (42% n = 4292). The predominant bacterial pathogens were gram negative (n = 8972; 88.5%), whereas gram positives were only 11.5% (n = 1162) of the total organisms. Among the gram positives, the most common was Staphylococcus aureus (64.6%), and among gram negatives, the most common pathogen was Acinetobacter baumanni (38.6%). The weighted average of the drug-resistance profile across all gram positives was >50% for fluoroquinolones (levo-floxacin, ciprofloxacin), gentamicin, erythromycin, and ampicillin, and in the case of gram negatives it was >90% for ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone. Thirty-two patients were found to havecandidemia, out of which 6 were C. albicans and the rest were nonalbican. Six neurosurgery patients had infection with C. auris, 4 from blood samples and 2 from urine.-CONCLUSIONS: This study will add to the current knowledge and provide a better understanding of pathogen profile and resistance patterns in traumatic brain injury patients.

AB  - Airwriting Recognition refers to the problem of identification of letters written in space with movement of the finger. It can be seen as a special case of dynamic gesture recognition wherein the set of gestures are letters in a particular language. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive approach used to capture electrical signals generated as a result of contraction and relaxation of the muscles. sEMG has been widely adopted for gesture recognition applications. Unlike static gestures, dynamic gestures are user-friendly and can be used as a method for input with applications in Human Computer Interaction. There has been limited work in recognition of dynamic gestures such as airwriting, using sEMG signals and forms the core of the current work. In this work, a multi-loss minimization framework for sEMG based airwriting recognition is proposed. The proposed framework aims at learning a feature embedding vector that minimizes the triplet loss, while simultaneously learning the parameters of a classifier head to recognize corresponding alphabets. The proposed method is validated on a dataset recorded in the lab comprising of sEMG signals from 50 participants writing English uppercase alphabets. The effect of different variations of triplet loss, triplet mining strategies and feature embedding dimension is also presented. The best-achieved accuracy was 81.26% and 65.62% in user-dependent and independent scenarios respectively by using semihard positive and hard negative triplet mining. The code for our implementation will be made available at https://github.com/ayushayt/TripCEAiR

AB  - BackgroundSpinal atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is an extremely rare tumor and represents less than 2% of all AT/RTs.MethodsAvailable medical literature on spinal AT/RT in English was retrieved from PubMed and comprehensively reviewed. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, prognosis, and outcome in patients with spinal AT/RT have been elucidated by citing a case of extradural AT/RT of the cervicodorsal spine.ResultsThe age at presentation is usually less than 3 years. The most common site is the cervicodorsal spine. The most frequent tumor location is intradural extramedullary. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire neuraxis is the imaging modality of choice. The incidence of leptomeningeal dissemination is high (15-30%). Histopathological examination shows an admixture of primitive neuroectodermal, mesenchymal, and epithelial elements along with rhabdoid cells. Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 is considered pathognomonic of AT/RT. Maximal safe resection of tumor is the initial management of choice. Thereafter focal radiotherapy for localized tumor or craniospinal irradiation for leptomeningeal dissemination should be considered. Post-operative intensive polychemotherapy including intrathecal and high-dose chemotherapy (with autologous stem cell rescue) is usually considered to optimize survival. Typically, the time to recurrence and overall survival are less than 6 and 12 months, respectively. However, with judicious multimodality management long-term survivors are increasingly being recognized. The illustrative patient was a 18-month-old girl diagnosed with extradural AT/RT of the cervicodorsal spine (C3-D1), who was managed with maximal safe resection of tumor, multiagent chemotherapy (ICE-ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and focal RT to the tumor bed-50.4 Gy/28 fractions/5.5 weeks. At the last follow-up visit, 30 months after surgery, she had complete clinicoradiological response.ConclusionMultimodal treatment comprising maximal safe resection of tumor, multiagent chemotherapy (ICE), and focal RT can lead to successful outcome in patients with localized spinal AT/RT, under the age of 3 years.

AB  - We report the results of studies relating to the development of a conductive ink-coated, paper-based electrochemical DNA hybridization assay for the detection of the porA pseudogene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcal DNA), the causative agent of gonorrhoea. Briefly, a conductive and highly homogenous ink was prepared by dispersing carboxylated MWCNTs (cMWCNTs) in a stable emulsion consisting of terpineol as solvent, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as binder and polysorbate 80 (PS80) as the stabilizing agent. This cMWCNT-based ink was coated onto paper substrates to obtain cMWCNT@paper electrodes with a mean (+/- standard deviation, SD) resistivity of 1.066 (+/- 0.33) omega cm. Furthermore, a magnetic bead (MB)-mediated hybridization assay comprising a specific 5 '-biotinylated capture DNA probe (C) and 3 '-methylene blue (MetB)-tagged detector DNA probe (D) was designed. These probes hybridized specifically with a porA target DNA sequence (T) forming a sandwich hybridization complex (C-T-D) at the MB surface. Thus formed C-T-D/Av/MB samples with different T concentrations were drop cast and adsorbed onto the cMWCNT@paper for electrochemical detection. The linear detection range and sensitivity of the electrochemical biosensing assay were found to be 100 fM-100 nM and 5.09 mu A (log[concentration])(-1), respectively. The biosensing assay was further shown to detect the target genomic gonococcal DNA in a mixture consisting of different DNA and protein interferents indicating its clinical viability. The results of rheological studies reveal that this thixotropic cMWCNT ink can be utilized for screen printing. These studies demonstrate the utilization of a conductive ink formulation for the fabrication of paper-based electrochemical sensing electrodes having high potential for cost-effective batch production and application in point-of-care (PoC) clinical diagnostics.

AB  - Adrenocortical neoplasms are rare in childhood. Their histopathological categorization into benign and malignant is often challenging, impacting further management. While the AFIP/Wieneke scoring system is widely used for the prognostic classification of these tumors, it has limitations. Few other tumor scoring systems have evolved over the past few years. These have been validated in adults but not yet in pediatric patients. We evaluated a cohort of pediatric adrenocortical neoplasms to assess the applicability of AFIP/Wieneke criteria and the recently introduced Helsinki score and reticulin algorithm in predicting clinical outcomes. A tumor was considered 'clinically aggressive' in the presence of any of the following: metastases, recurrence, progressive disease, or death due to disease. Cases without any such event were considered 'clinically good'. Event-free survival time was the duration from the date of clinical presentation to any post-operative adverse event. For overall survival analysis, the endpoint was either the last follow-up or death due to disease.Using ROC curve analysis, the obtained cut-off Helsinki score of 24 could stratify the cases into two prognostically relevant groups. Survival analysis showed significant differences in the event-free and overall survival of these two groups of patients, validating the proposed cut-off. None of the three histopathological scoring systems could predict an unfavorable outcome with 100% accuracy. All showed a sensitivity of >= 80%, with the reticulin algorithm achieving 100% sensitivity. The specificity and accuracy of the AFIP/Wieneke criteria were the lowest (62.5% and 73.08%, respectively). While the Helsinki score (at the cut-off score of 24) and the reticulin algorithm had similar accuracy rates (80.77%, and 80%, respectively), the specificity of the former was higher (81.25%) than the latter (68.75%). A separate analysis revealed that the Ki-67 index at a cut-off of 18% had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 81.25% for predicting an unfavorable outcome.

AB  - Loss of function in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is the most common alteration seen in human cancer. In mice, P53 deletion in all cells leads predominantly to the development of T-cell lymphomas, followed by B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas and teratomas. In order to dissect the role of P53 in the hematopoietic system, we generated and analyzed two different mouse models deficient for P53. A pan-hematopoietic P53 deletion mouse was created using Vav1-Cre based deletion; and a B-cell-specific deletion mouse was created using a CD19-Cre based deletion. The Vav1-P53CKO mice predominantly developed T-cell malignancies in younger mice, and myeloid malignancies in older mice. In T-cell malignancies, there was accelerated thymic cell maturation with overexpression of Notch1 and its downstream effectors. CD19-P53CKO mice developed marginal zone expansion in the spleen, followed by marginal zone lymphoma, some of which progressed to diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Interestingly, marginal zone and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas had a unique gene expression signature characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway, compared with wild type marginal zone or follicular cells of the spleen. This study demonstrates lineage specific P53 deletion leading to distinct phenotypes secondary to unique gene expression programs set in motion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid (TA) is used to control bleeding in patients with hemoptysis. However, the effectiveness of the different routes of TA administration has not been studied.RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the nebulized route of TA administration reduce the amount of hemoptysis compared with the IV route in patients presenting to the ED with hemoptysis?STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a pragmatic, open-label, randomized, parallel, single-center, pilot trial of nebulized TA (500 mg tid) vs IV TA (500 mg tid) in adult patients pre-senting to the ED with active hemoptysis. The primary outcome was cessation of bleeding at 30 min. Secondary outcomes included amount of hemoptysis at 6, 12, and 24 h; interventional procedures; and side effects of TA. Patients who were hemodynamically unstable or requiring immediate interventional procedure or mechanical ventilation were excluded from the study.RESULTS: Of the 55 patients in each arm, hemoptysis cessation at 30 min following TA administration was significantly higher in the nebulization arm (n = 40) compared with the IV arm (n = 28): c2 (1, n = 110) = 5.55; P = .0019. Also, hemoptysis amount was reduced significantly in the nebulization arm at all time periods of observation (P value at 30 min = .011, at 6 h = .002, 12 h = .0008, and at 24 h = .005). Fewer patients in the nebulization arm required bronchial artery embolization (13 vs 21; P = .024) and thereby had higher discharge rates from the ED (67.92% vs 39.02%; P = .005). Two patients in the nebulization arm had asymptomatic bronchoconstriction that resolved after short-acting beta-agonist nebulization. No patient discharged from the ED underwent any interventional procedure or revisited the ED with rebleed during the 72 h follow-up period. INTERPRETATION: Nebulized TA may be more efficacious than IV TA in reducing the amount of hemoptysis and need for ED interventional procedures. Future larger studies are needed to further explore the potential of nebulized TA compared with IV TA in patients with mild hemoptysis.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials Registry-India; No.: CTRI/2019/05/019337;URL: http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/advancesearchmain.php.CHEST 2023; 163(5):1176-1184

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the second-most common type and among the leading causes of worldwide cancer-related deaths. There is marked person-to-person variability in susceptibility to, and phenotypic expression and prognosis of BC, a predicament that calls for personalized medicine and individually tailored therapeutics. In this study, we report new observations on prognostic hub genes and key pathways involved in BC. We used the data set GSE109169, comprising 25 pairs of BC and adjacent normal tissues. Using a high-throughput transcriptomic approach, we selected data on 293 differentially expressed genes to establish a weighted gene coexpression network. We identified three age-linked modules where the light-gray module strongly correlated with BC. Based on the gene significance and module membership features, peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15) and KRT5 were identified as our hub genes from the light-gray module. These genes were further verified at transcriptional and translational levels across 25 pairs of BC and adjacent normal tissues. Their promoter methylation profiles were assessed based on various clinical parameters. In addition, these hub genes were used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and their correlation with tumor-infiltrating immune cells was investigated. We found that PI15 and KRT5 may be potential biomarkers and potential drug targets. These findings call for future research in a larger sample size, which could inform diagnosis and clinical management of BC, thus paving the way toward personalized medicine.

AB  - Two normotensive male patients came with complaints of low back pain. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral spine revealed an enhancing intradural extramedullary lesion (at the L4-L5 vertebral level in the first patient and at the L2-L3 vertebral level in the second patient). The tumor resembled the head and caudal blood vessels the tail of a tadpole, thereby giving the "tadpole sign." This sign is an important radiologic and histopathologic correlate, which is helpful in preoperative diagnosis of spinal paraganglioma.

AB  - BackgroundIntegrated care is essential for improving the management and health outcomes for people with Parkinson's disease (PD); reliable and objective measures of care integration are few. ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care Measurement Tool (RMIC-MT, provider version) for healthcare professionals involved in PD care. MethodsA cross-sectional survey was administered online to an international network representing 95 neurology centers across 41 countries and 588 healthcare providers. Exploratory factor analysis with principal axis extraction method was used to assess construct validity. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate model fit of the RMIC-MT provider version. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency reliability. ResultsOverall, 371 care providers (62% response rate) participated in this study. No item had psychometric sensitivity problems. Nine factors (professional coordination, cultural competence, triple aims outcome, system coordination, clinical coordination, technical competence, community-centeredness, person-centeredness, and organizational coordination) with 42 items were determined by exploratory factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.76 (clinical coordination) to 0.94 (system coordination) and showed significant correlation among all items in the scale (>0.4), indicating good internal consistency reliability. The confirmatory factor analysis model passed most goodness-of-fit tests, thereby confirming the factor structure of nine categories with a total of 40 items. ConclusionsThe results provide evidence for the construct validity and other psychometric properties of the provider version of the RMIC-MT to measure integrated care in PD. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Cellular therapy has shown promise as a strategy for the functional restoration of ischemic tissues through promoting vasculogenesis. Therapy with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has shown encouraging results in preclinical studies, but the limited engraftment, inefficient migration, and poor survival of patrolling endothelial progenitor cells at the injured site hinder its clinical utilization. These limitations can, to some extent, be overcome by co-culturing EPCs with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Studies on the improvement in functional capacity of late EPCs, also referred to as endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), when cultured with MSCs have mostly focused on the angiogenic potential, although migration, adhesion, and proliferation potential also determine effective physiological vasculogenesis. Alteration in angiogenic proteins with co-culturing has also not been studied. We co-cultured ECFCs with MSCs via both direct and indirect means, and studied the impact of the resultant contact-mediated and paracrine-mediated impact of MSCs over ECFCs, respectively, on the functional aspects and the angiogenic protein signature of ECFCs. Both directly and indirectly primed ECFCs significantly restored the adhesion and vasculogenic potential of impaired ECFCs, whereas indirectly primed ECFCs showed better proliferation and migratory potential than directly primed ECFCs. Additionally, indirectly primed ECFCs, in their angiogenesis proteomic signature, showed alleviated inflammation, along with the balanced expression of various growth factors and regulators of angiogenesis.

AB  - Introduction: Role of CT scan, MRI, ophthalmoscopy, direct monitoring by a transducer probe in identifying raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in emergency department is limited. There are few studies correlating elevated optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measured by point of care ultrasound (POCUS) with raised ICP in pediatrics emergencies. We studied the diagnostic accuracy of ONSD, crescent sign, and optic disc elevation in identifying increased ICP in pediatrics. Methods: Prospective observational study was done between April 2018 and August 2019 after ethics approval. Out of 125 subjects, 40 patients without clinical features of raised ICP were recruited as external controls and 85 with clinical features of raised ICP as study subjects. Their demographic profile, clinical examination, and ocular ultrasound findings were noted. This was followed by CT scan. Out of 85 patients, 43 had raised ICP (cases) and 42 had normal ICP (disease controls). Diagnostic accuracy of ONSD in identifying raised ICP was evaluated using STATA. Results: The mean ONSD in case group was 5.5 +/- 0.6 mm, 4.9 +/- 0.5 mm in disease control group and external control group was 4.8 +/- 0.3 mm. Cut-off of ONSD for raised ICP at >= 4.5 mm had a sensitivity and specificity of 97.67% and 10.98%, while >= 5.0 mm showed a sensitivity and specificity of 86.05% and 71.95%. Crescent sign and optic disc elevation had good correlation with increased ICP. Conclusion: ONSD >= 5 mm by POCUS identified raised ICP in pediatric population. Crescent sign and optic disc elevation may function as additional POCUS signs in identifying raised ICP.

AB  - Menisci are crescent-shaped fibrocartilagenous structures that increase the tibiofemoral congruity, act as shock absorbers, and provide secondary anteroposterior stability. The root tears affect the biomechanical integrity of the whole meniscus, simulating a total meniscectomy, which can lead to early degeneration of the joint. Most of the root tears affect the posterior part rather than the anterior root. Very few reports have been described in the literature regarding anterior root tears and repairs. We present two such patients with anterior meniscal root tears, one of the lateral meniscus and one of the medial meniscus.

AB  - In this paper, two novel Cu(II) complexes [CuL(S-1-amino-2-propanol)] (R1) and [CuL(S-2-amino-1-propanol)] (R2) have been synthesized and characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) technique. The single-crystal XRD analyses show that compounds R1 and R2 crystallized in triclinic and monoclinic crystal systems with P-1 and P2(1) space groups, respectively. The tau 5 parameter values of R1 and R2 confirmed distorted square pyramidal geometry around Cu(II) centre. The compounds R1 and R2 possess 2D polymeric chains with (4,4)IIIa and 2C1 topology, respectively. The non-covalent interactions and electrostatic properties were investigated using Hirshfeld surface analysis and density functional theory (DFT). DFT calculations revealed higher stability of R1 over R2. The presence of strong hyper conjugative interactions in carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds has been confirmed by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. Time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations were also performed to determine the excited state properties. Based on theoretical calculations, the simulated spectra showed absorption maxima at 506 and 743 nm for both complexes. Antimicrobial assays revealed that R1 is significantly antimicrobial against Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 512 and 256 mu g/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, correspondingly. Serum binding studies of R1 confirm the existence of instinctive bonding interactions due to negative values on account of increment G, increment S and increment H obtained from thermodynamics studies. In silico molecular dynamics and docking approaches have been used to validate the experimental findings of anti-microbial assay and serum binding studies. A high dock score for R1 over R2 revealed the high binding energy of the former with bacterial protein. It was found that the protein-ligand complex remained stable throughout the dynamic simulation process, and substantial interactions between R1 and bovine serum albumin were observed.

ResultsAn expected total of 104 parathyroid glands were assessed in 35 patients (17 total-thyroidectomy, 18 hemi-thyroidectomy). 54/104 (51.9%) were identified by naked eye, and sequentially greater numbers identified by microscope magnification (n = 61; 58.7%; p = 0.33), and by ICG-NIRF (n = 72; 69.2%; p = 0.01). ICG-NIRF detected additional parathyroid glands in 16/35 patients (45.7%). Confident identification of at least one parathyroid remained unachieved in 5/35 by naked eye, in 4/35 by microscopic magnification, and in no patient by ICG-NIRF. ICG-NIRF indicated end-of-surgery devascularization in 12/72 glands and informed decisions regarding gland implantation. ConclusionSignificantly greater parathyroid glands are identified and preserved with surgical magnification and with ICG-NIRF. Both techniques merit routine adoption for thyroidectomy.

AB  - The C12-alkyl chain-conjugated Fe(III) catecholate complex [Fe(C12CAT)3]3-, Fe(C12CAT)3 [C12CAT = N-(3,4dihydroxyphenethyl)dodecanamide], was synthesized and characterized, reported as a dual-modal T1-MRI and an optical imaging probe. The DFT-optimized structure of Fe(C12CAT)3 reveals a distorted octahedral coordination geometry around the high spin Fe(III) center. The formation constant (-log K) of Fe(C12CAT)3 was calculated as 45.4. The complex exhibited r1-relaxivity values of 2.31 +/- 0.12 and 1.52 +/- 0.06 mM-1 s-1 at 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively, on 1.41 T at pH 7.3 via second-sphere water interactions. The interaction of Fe(C12CAT)3 with human serum albumin showed concomitant enhancement of r1-relaxivity to 6.44 +/- 0.15 mM-1 s-1. The MR phantom images are significantly brighter and directly correlate to the concentration of Fe(C12CAT)3. Adding an external fluorescent marker IR780 dye to Fe(C12CAT)3 leads to the formation of self-assembly by C12-alkyl chains. It resulted in the fluorescence quenching of the dye, and its critical aggregation concentration was calculated as 70 mu M. The aggregated matrix of Fe(C12CAT)3 and IR780 dye is spherical, with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 189.5 nm. This self-assembled supramolecular system is found to be non-fluorescent and was "turn-on" under acidic pH via dissociation of aggregates. The r1-relaxivity is found to be unchanged during the matrix aggregation and disaggregation. The probe showed MRI ON and fluorescent OFF under physiological conditions and MRI ON and fluorescent ON under acidic pH. The cell viability experiments showed that the cells are 80% viable at 1 mM probe concentration. Fluorescence experiments and MR phantom images showed that Fe(C12CAT)3 is a potential dual model imaging probe to visualize the acidic pH environment of the cells.

AB  - There are limited data on head-to-head performance of Freestyle Libre Pro (FSL-Pro) and blinded Medtronic iPro2 continuous glucose monitoring system in pregnancy. In this prospective observational study, women with hyperglycemia in pregnancy (n = 42) underwent simultaneous FSL-Pro and Medtronic iPro2 sensor insertion and self-monitoring of blood glucose using Contour Plus meter (reference). The overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for iPro2 and FSL-Pro systems were 8.0% +/- 9.2% and 19.0% +/- 12.7%, respectively. At hypoglycemic range, both sensors performed less accurately (MARD: 18.0% and 16.8%, respectively), whereas iPro2 showed higher accuracy at euglycemic (8.2% and 19.3%, respectively) and hyperglycemic (6.8% and 18.0%, respectively) ranges. On Bland-Altman analysis, iPro2 and FSL-Pro underestimated glucose by 0.01 and 1.09 mmol/L, respectively. The ISO criteria were fulfilled for 88.5% and 44.9% of all values, respectively. To conclude, iPro2 was more accurate; however, both sensors demonstrated inaccuracy at hypoglycemic range, highlighting the need for refinements in the current generation of sensors to address this problem.

AB  - The purpose of this longitudinal study was to surveil the serum titanium ion levels at various time intervals in patients with indigenous 3D-printed total temporomandibular joint replacement (TMJ TJR). The study was conducted on 11 patients (male: 8; female: 3) who had undergone unilateral or bilateral TMJ TJR. Blood samples were drawn preoperatively (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), and 1 year (T3) postoperatively. Data were analyzed and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean serum titanium ion levels at T0, T1, T2, and T3 was 9.34 & PLUSMN; 8.70 & mu;g/L (mcg/L), 35.97 & PLUSMN; 20.27 mcg/L, 31.68 & PLUSMN; 17.03 mcg/L, and 47.91 & PLUSMN; 15.47 mcg/L respectively. The mean serum titanium ion levels increased significantly at T1 (p = 0.009), T2 (p = 0.032), and T3 (p = 0.00) interval. There was no significant difference between unilateral and bilateral groups. Serum titanium ion continued to show increased levels till the last follow-up of 1 year. These initial serum titanium ion levels increase is due to the initial wear phase of the prosthesis which manifests over 1 year. Further studies with large sample sizes and long-term follow-ups are required to see the deleterious effect if any on the TMJ TJR.

AB  - PurposeThe Zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) is a potential schizophrenia candidate gene that has emerged from genome-wide association studies. The aim of the study is to investigate whether this gene variant influences the response of positive or negative symptoms to antipsychotic drug olanzapine in North Indian schizophrenia patients.Materials and methodsOur study involved 184 unrelated schizophrenia cases (114 males and 70 females; mean age: 52.8 +/- 11.6 years) and 300 normal controls (168 males and 132 females; mean age: 54.9 +/- 6.9 years). At the start of treatment and after four weeks, we assessed the response of positive and negative symptoms by positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Olanzapine drug level was estimated using HPLC Method and Genotyping was performed using PCR-Snap Shot technique.ResultsSignificant differences were observed in the genotype distribution (chi(2) = 6.10, d.f. = 2, p = 0.04) and allele frequencies (chi(2) = 5.14, d.f. = 1, p = 0.02; odds ratio = 0.57, 95% confidence interval =1.09-3.48) between schizophrenia patients and controls group. The improvement of positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment with olanzapine was assessed. Patients homozygous for the ZNF804A risk allele for AA show poorer improvement of positive symptoms compared to patients with a protective allele.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that ZNF804A gene polymorphism plays a significant role in the treatment of schizophrenia, suggesting that ZNF804A may be an effective marker for schizophrenia treatment.

AB  - The world is seeking hard for sustainable agricultural practices with one of the prime objectives to improve crop yield through effective pest management. Scientific diaspora has already established that a significant amount of the pesticide is not being used by the crops and finds its way into the environment through leaching, evaporation, sorption etc., leading to adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. Undoubtedly, nanotechnology is bringing a revolutionary change in agriculture through effective pest management. The main purpose of intro-ducing nano-pesticides is to reduce the indiscriminate use of conventional pesticides and their harmful impacts on the environment. Nano-formulations can improve the efficiency of pesticides by enhancing permeability, solubility, and stability along-with controlling their release profile and protecting them from premature degra-dation. The present review is accordingly assembled to significantly investigate the developmental updates of nano-pesticides since the past decades, their ultimate fate, ecotoxicological risks and betterment over their conventional analogues. Nano-pesticides including nanomaterials as active ingredients, nano-encapsulations, nano-emulsions, nano-suspensions are discussed. Additionally, critical information and the foreseeable research gaps in this emerging area are highlighted. Currently, there is a dearth of fundamental knowledge about how nano-formulations will behave in the environment. It is still unclear whether they will genuinely produce noticeable benefits or represent a new class of hazards. Very scanty information is available on their ecotoxi-cological behaviour, guidelines, and policymaking for their safer use globally. Introducing these smart nano-formulations within the domain of the current pesticide regulatory frameworks is still under debate. Thus, a discussion of the pros and cons of nano-pesticides is of prime importance for justifying their status of cleaner production.

AB  - A designed Rhodamine-B-quinoline based Schiff base chemosensor (RhBQ) has been synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. It shows 'turn on' fluorescence emission and also colorimetric sensitivity and selectivity towards trivalent metal ions (Al3+ and Cr3+) and anion (HSO4-) present in aqueous medium. Stoichiometry of both metal (Al3+ & Cr3+) - RhBQ complexes are found to be 1:1 using Job's plot. A notable enhancement in emission intensity for RhBQ-Al3+ (similar to 341 fold), RhBQ-Cr3+ (similar to 292 fold), and RhBQ-HSO4- (similar to 136 fold) complexes compare to RhBQ are observed. Sensing mechanism i.e. opening of spirolactam ring of RhBQ has been confirmed through various spectroscopic techniques such as; H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, ESI-MS, TRPL, FT-IR, and DFT based computational study. The limit of detection (LOD) for Al3+, Cr3+, and HSO4- are found to be 2.2 x 10(-8) M, 2.12 x 10(-8) M and 8.63 x 10(-7) M respectively. An advanced level 3 input OR-INHIBIT logic gate are constructed using chelating ligand EDTA. For onsite detection, TLC paper strip spot of the probe, RhBQ is prepared and the detection of Al3+ in few antacid drug are presented. In addition, cell-imaging analysis of Al3+, Cr3+, and HSO4- ions in the Human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line (TPC-1) & Human anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (HtH-7) are presented and shows promising concentration and time-dependent detection results.

AB  - Surface colonization and the formation of biofilms by microbes are well acknowledged. Communities of microorganisms are coated in these biofilms, which frequently include polysaccharides, DNA, and proteins in a self-made matrix. One of the main threats to modern medicine is biofilm-associated illnesses. The extracellular polymeric substances surrounding biofilm-forming bacteria give them the ability to develop a high level of resistance to both the host immune system and conventional antibiotics. New medications that are effective against microbial biofilms are thus urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are one possibility being considered more and more in this area. AMPs have been utilized to prevent the growth of mature biofilms and to remove them. AMPs, whether organic or synthetic, have been demonstrated to inhibit microbial colonization of surfaces, eradicate bacteria from biofilms, and alter biofilms' structure. This review discusses the severity of diseases/infections caused due to formation of microbial biofilms. Further, it describes the use and various mechanisms of AMPs against microbial biofilms by interacting with different components of biofilms. It also briefly describes the drawbacks of using AMPs against microbial biofilms and different strategies to enhance anti-biofilm activity.

AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a nosocomial infection contracted by ventilator patients in which bacteria colonize the upper digestive tract and contaminated secretions are released into the lower airway. This nosocomial infection increases the morbidity and mortality of the patients as well as the cost of treatment. Probiotic formulations have recently been proposed to prevent the colonization of these pathogenic bacteria. In this prospective observational study, we aimed to investigate the effects of probiotics on gut microbiota and their relation to clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients. For this study, 35 patients were recruited (22 probiotic-treated and 13 without probiotic treatment) from a cohort of 169 patients. Patients in the probiotic group were given a dose of 6 capsules of a commercially available probiotic (VSL#3 (R):112.5 billion CFU/cap) in three divided doses for 10 days. Sampling was carried out after each dose to monitor the temporal change in the gut microbiota composition. To profile the microbiota, we used a 16S rRNA metagenomic approach, and differences among the groups were computed using multivariate statistical analyses. Differences in gut microbial diversity (Bray Curtis and Jaccard distance, p-value > 0.05) between the probiotic-treated group and the control group were not observed. Furthermore, treatment with probiotics resulted in the enrichment of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus in the gut microbiota of the probiotic-treated groups. Our results demonstrated that probiotics might lead to favorable alterations in gut microbiome characteristics. Future studies should focus on the appropriate dosages and frequency of probiotics, which can lead to improved clinical outcomes.

AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic childhood illness with gradually improving survival and significant burden of disease during adult life. Transition of CF care from pediatric to an adult based multidisciplinary team is a complex process and careful coordination with a transition key worker is necessary for successful transition without adverse outcome. Transition is associated with a key change in CF management with shift from family-centred care to self-reliance and independence on part of the patient. Readiness and skills of self-managed care play central part in successful transition. Resource materials for transition are available online for different countries for improved readiness and smooth transition. Situation is worse in resource-limited settings as facilities of fully functional adult multidisciplinary care for CF is not readily available.

AB  - Background: Hand hygiene is the single most effective strategy for preventing healthcare associated infections (HCAI) but compliance is usually low and effective improvement strategies are needed. We assessed hand hygiene (HH) compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO) prescribed five moments of hand hygiene among health-care workers (HCW).Methods: A retrospective analysis of one-year data on hand hygiene was done. WHO single observer direct observation technique was used and HH compliance was noted among HCWS.Results: A total of 16,552 opportunities were recorded. Overall compliance as per WHO Guidelines was 69.2%. Sanitation worker had an adherence rate of 73.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]:70.6-75.4) followed by the nurses 71.2% (95% CI: 70.4-72.1). Physicians and technicians had a compliance rate of 64.9% (95% CI: 63.1-66.6) and 64% (95% CI: 60.1-67.9) respectively. Physiotherapists had a compliance rate of 62.2 (95% CI: 50.1-73.2) and the compliance of Phlebotomists was observed to be 23.1% (95% CI: 9.0-43.6). HCW stood best for WHO moment 5 and worst for moment 1 with compliance of 79.1% (95% CI:77.4-80.7) and 55.8% (95% CI:54.5-57.1) respectively.Discussion: The moment 1 of the WHO's five moments is the most important for preventing the transmission of resistant pathogens between patients. Missed opportunities in moment 1 need to be focused on while planning new strategies to promote hand hygiene.

AB  - A wide variety of cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been known to affect the differentiation of stem cells in vivo. In particular, the biophysical cues and cell shape have been known to affect the stem cell function, yet very little is known about the interplay between how these cues control differentiation. For the first time, by using photolithography to pattern poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), patterns of square and triangular geometries were created, and the effect of these structures and the biophysical cues arising were utilized to differentiate cells into multiple lineages inside a same pattern without the use of any adhered protein or growth factors. The data from these studies showed that the cells present at the edges were well elongated, exhibit high aspect ratios, and differentiated into osteogenic lineage, whereas the cells present at the center exhibit lower aspect ratio and were primarily adipogenic lineage regardless of the geometry. This was correlated to the higher expression of focal adhesion proteins at the edges, the expression of which have been known to affect the osteogenic differentiation. By showing MSC lineage commitment relationships due to physical signals, this study highlights the importance of these cues and cell shape in further understanding stem cell behavior for tissue engineering applications.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the profile of non-urgent patients triaged 'green', as part of a triage trial in the emergency department (ED) of a secondary care hospital in India. The secondary aim was to validate the triage trial with the South African Triage Score (SATS).DesignProspective cohort study.SettingA secondary care hospital in Mumbai, India.ParticipantsPatients aged 18 years and above with a history of trauma defined as having any of the external causes of morbidity and mortality listed in block V01-Y36, chapter XX of the International Classification of Disease version 10 codebook, triaged green between July 2016 and November 2019.Primary and secondary outcome measuresOutcome measures were mortality within 24 hours, 30 days and mistriage.ResultsWe included 4135 trauma patients triaged green. The mean age of patients was 32.8 (+/- 13.1) years, and 77% were males. The median (IQR) length of stay of admitted patients was 3 (13) days. Half the patients had a mild Injury Severity Score (3-8), with the majority of injuries being blunt (98%). Of the patients triaged green by clinicians, three-quarters (74%) were undertriaged on validating with SATS. On telephonic follow-up, two patients were reported dead whereas one died while admitted in hospital.ConclusionsOur study highlights the need for implementation and evaluation of training in trauma triage systems that use physiological parameters, including pulse, systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale, for the in-hospital first responders in the EDs.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder with alterations in cortical functional activity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is known to incur motor benefits in PD by inducing motor activity through cortical connectivity, although the mechanisms are unclear.Objective: The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (at three cortical sites) on functional and structural plasticity were studied in PD to understand inhibitory or excitatory rTMS-induced motor improvement.Methodology: The study was a single blind, randomized, sham-controlled type involving three groups. Three thousand rTMS pulses of frequency 1 Hz were given at primary motor area (in 13 patients of Group A) or premotor area (in Group B, n = 18) and a frequency 5 Hz at supplementary motor area in Group C (n = 19). Clinical rating scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Parkinson's Disease Questionaire-39 [PDQ-39]) and motor dexterity were assessed at baseline, after sham and real rTMS sessions. Visuospatial functional magnetic resonance imaging task along with T1-weighted scans (at three Tesla) were used to evaluate the motor execution and planning post rTMS intervention.Results: Improvements (p < 0.05) in UPDRS II, III, Mobility, and activities of daily living of PDQ-39, Purdue Pegboard were observed. Increased blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activations (family-wise error [FWE]-corrected P-value [pFWE] <0.01) were observed in motor cortices, parietal association areas, and cerebellum in groups C and decrease in group A and B after real TMS as compared with sham.Conclusions: Repetitive TMS at motor (1 Hz) and supplementary motor (5 Hz) areas resulted in significant clinical benefits by inducing cortical plasticity. Impact statementTMS daily protocols have been commonly employed to modulate cortical connectivity in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess rTMS-related effects in PD. Repetitive TMS protocol at higher pulses (3000/session) in primary and supplementary motor cortices administered weekly was clinically effective and safe. The results revealed functional restoration along with cortical plasticity mechanisms of externally generated movement in PD in response to noninvasive brain stimulation.

AB  - Background:Supermicrosurgical simulators and experimental models promote test viability, a faster learning curve, technical innovations, and improvements of the surgical dexterities. The authors aimed to present a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical experimental models and simulation platforms used for supermicrosurgery. Methods:An electronic search was conducted across the PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Data collection included the types of experimental models and outcomes. Pooled estimates were calculated with a random-effect meta-analysis using the DerSimonian-Laird model. Results:Thirty-eight articles were incorporated in the qualitative synthesis. Twenty-three articles reported the use of in vivo models (60.5%), 12 used ex vivo models (31.5%), and three used synthetic models (7.9%). The superficial inferior epigastric system of rats was the most common in vivo model, whereas chicken wings and hindlimbs were the most common methods used in ex vivo models. The most common methods to evaluate patency of anastomoses were gross inspection, passage of nylon thread into the lumen, and intravascular flow of an injected dye. Nineteen studies were incorporated in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of a successful anastomosis was 94.9% (95% CI, 92.3 to 97.5%). The success rate of in vivo models using rats was 92.5% (95% CI, 88.8 to 96.3%). The success rate of ex vivo models was 97.7% (95% CI, 94.6 to >99%). Conclusion:Simulators that have high fidelity concerning the dissection of the vascular pedicle, flap elevation, supermicrovascular anastomosis, and adequate assessment of a successful anastomosis possess adequate predictive validation to evaluate and simulate the supermicrosurgical technique.

AB  - Central insulin resistance, the diminished cellular sensitivity to insulin in the brain, has been implicated in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. However, whether and how central insulin resistance plays a role in the eye remains unclear. Here, we performed intracerebroventricular injection of S961, a potent and specific blocker of insulin receptor in adult Wistar rats to test if central insulin resistance leads to pathological changes in ocular structures. 80 mg of S961 was stereotaxically injected into the lateral ventricle of the experimental group twice at 7 days apart, whereas buffer solution was injected to the sham control group. Blood samples, intraocular pressure, trabecular meshwork morphology, ciliary body markers, retinal and optic nerve integrity, and whole genome expression patterns were then evaluated. While neither blood glucose nor serum insulin level was significantly altered in the experimental or control group, we found that injection of S961 but not buffer solution significantly increased intraocular pressure at 14 and 24 days after first injection, along with reduced porosity and aquaporin 4 expression in the trabecular meshwork, and increased tumor necrosis factor alpha and aquaporin 4 expression in the ciliary body. In the retina, cell density and insulin receptor expression decreased in the retinal ganglion cell layer upon S961 injection. Fundus photography revealed peripapillary atrophy with vascular dysregulation in the experimental group. These retinal changes were accompanied by upregulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes, downregulation of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neurotrophic genes, as well as dysregulation of genes involved in insulin signaling. Optic nerve histology indicated microglial activation and changes in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and aquaporin 4. Molecular pathway architecture of the retina revealed the three most significant pathways involved being inflammation/cell stress, insulin signaling, and extracellular matrix regulation relevant to neurodegeneration. There was also a multimodal crosstalk between insulin signaling derangement and inflammation-related genes. Taken together, our results indicate that blocking insulin receptor signaling in the central nervous system can lead to trabecular meshwork and ciliary body dysfunction, intraocular pressure elevation, as well as inflammation, glial activation, and apoptosis in the retina and optic nerve. Given that central insulin resistance may lead to neurodegenerative phenotype in the visual system, targeting insulin signaling may hold promise for vision disorders involving the retina and optic nerve.

AB  - Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally. Over the last decade, digital health and related technology has emerged as a useful adjunct in the management of persons with stroke, particularly with the development of a large number of mobile phone applications dedicated to various aspects of stroke. However, whether social media can provide similar key support in stroke is an intriguing question. In this systematic review, we aimed to the scope and limits of social media platforms in care and research pertinent to persons with stroke. Methods: PubMed database was searched using Medical Subject Headings terms and exploded keywords. The search retrieved 556 abstracts, which were screened by two reviewers. Of these, 14 studies met the review inclusion criteria. Given the small number of studies and heterogeneity of outcomes, quantitative analysis was not possible. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022324384). Results: The social media platforms employed by the included studies comprised YouTube (n = 5), Twitter (n = 5), Facebook (n = 2), both Twitter and Facebook (n = 1), and WhatsApp (n = 1). Four assessed quality and accuracy of videos on YouTube available for stoke patients and caregivers. Three used social media to research link between role of gender and stroke descriptors on social media platforms, and one studied Twitter-derived racial/ethnic perceptual construction on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Three studies described use of social media by stroke survivors, in post-stroke care and engagement. 11 studies were assessed to be of "fair" quality and three were assessed to be of "poor" quality. Conclusions: Limited preliminary data of low quality indicates that social media is used by persons with stroke and their caregivers, and may be harnessed as a tool of education and research. Future studies must address the current lack of high-quality evidence for the use of social media in stroke care.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Dissociative convulsions represent complex biopsychosocial etiopathogenesis and have semiological similarities with epilepsy, which leads to delays in definitive diagnosis as well as treatment. We explored the neurobiological underpinnings of dissociative convulsions using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design targeting cognitive, affective, and resting state characteristics in our subjects.
   Materials and Methods: Seventeen female patients with dissociative convulsions without any co-morbid psychiatric or neurological illness and 17 matched healthy controls underwent standardized task-based (affective and cognitive) and resting state fMRI. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation results were compared across the groups, and correlation with the severity of dissociation was measured.
   Results: Patients with dissociative convulsions had lower activation in the left cingulate gyrus, left paracentral lobule, right middle and inferior frontal gyrus, right caudate nucleus, and right thalamus. There was increased resting state functional connectivity (FC) between the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and left superior parietal lobule; left amygdala and Default Mode Network (DMN) of right lateral parietal cortex; right supramarginal gyrus and left cuneus in the patient group. Patients also had decreased FC between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left thalamus; ACC and right central opercular cortex; DMN of PCC, posterior cingulate gyrus, and right middle temporal lobe.
   Conclusions: Patients with dissociative convulsions have significant deficits in the areas associated with the processing of emotional, cognitive, memory, and sensory-motor functions. There is a significant correlation between dissociative severity and the functioning of areas involving the processing of emotions, cognition, and memory.

TI  - Rivastigmine for Cognitive Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis: A Prospective Randomized Open Label Study with Blinded End-Point Assessment
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
KW  - Multiple sclerosis
KW  - Rivastigmine
KW  - Wechsler memory scale
KW  - DYSFUNCTION
KW  - RECOMMENDATIONS
AB  - Background and Objective: Nearly 40-65% patients with MS develop cognitive impairment during the disease. There is no treatment clearly effective in improving the cognitive deficits. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Rivastigmine in cognitively impaired MS patients.
   Materials and Methods: This was a parallel group randomized open label study with blinded end-point assessment. The patient allocation to treatment and control arm was done by telephonic contact with an independent statistician who used a computer to generate a random sequence of allocation using permuted block randomization (varying block size of 4 and 6) in 1:1 ratio. The outcome assessor was blinded to this allocation. A total of 60 patients were in included in the study (30 in each arm). Primary outcome was improvement in memory functions (using logical memory subset of Wechsler Memory Scale III, India) assessed after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, depression, and safety.
   Results: In modified intention to treat analysis (N = 22), treatment arm showed statistically significant improvement in memory function with mean difference of 7.56 [95% CI (0.67,14.46), p 0.032] as compared to control arm. There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes such as fatigue and depression. Vomiting was the most common side effect. No major adverse events were observed in either group.
   Conclusion: Rivastigmine is safe and effective in improving memory functions in cognitively impaired MS patients. However, our study has a small sample size and tested only a single domain. Larger studies with a validated single comprehensive neuropsychological test are needed.

TI  - Assessing the Risk of Further Decompensation and Survival in Patients With Cirrhosis With Variceal Bleeding as Their First Decompensation Event
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
KW  - AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on long-term outcomes of patients with compensated cirrhosis presenting with acute variceal bleeding (AVB) as an index and lone decompensating event. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of further decompensation, survival, and risk factors of mortality in these patients.
   METHODS: Patients with otherwise compensated cirrhosis presenting with AVB as their index decompensating event (n 5 463) were analyzed in this single-center retrospective study. The incidence of individual decompensation events and survival was estimated using competing risk analysis. Risk factors for poor outcomes were identified.
   [Graphics]
   RESULTS: The mean age was 47.4 (13.2) years, with most patients (86.5%) being males. Alcohol-related liver disease (42.3%) and viral cirrhosis (22.4%) were the main etiologies with a median Model for EndStage Liver Disease score of 14 (11-15) at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 42 (24-62) months, 292 patients experienced further decompensations: ascites (n = 283; 96.9%), rebleeding (n = 157; 53.8%), and hepatic encephalopathy (n = 71; 24.3%). Most events occurred with similar frequency across different etiologies, except acute-on-chronic liver failure, which was more common in nonviral cirrhosis (Gray test, P = 0.042). Patients with viral and nonviral cirrhosis had similar survival (5-year survival: 91% and 80.1%, respectively; P = 0.062). Patients with early further decompensations (onset <6 weeks of index AVB event) (n = 40) had a higher mortality (52.5% vs 20.2% for late decompensations; P < 0.001). Active alcohol consumption (hazard ratio [HR]: 9 [5.31-15.3], P < 0.001), high white blood cell count at presentation (HR: 2.5 [1.4-4.4], P 5 0.001), and early decompensation (HR: 6.2 [3.6-10.6], P < 0.001) predicted poor survival.
   DISCUSSION: Despite a high incidence of further decompensation, 5-year survival of patients at this stage of cirrhosis is more than80% across all etiologies in the absence of early further decompensation and active alcohol consumption.

AB  - Cardiac injuries are rare but potentially life-threatening, with a significant proportion of victims dying before arrival at the hospital. The in-hospital mortality among patients who arrive in-hospital alive also remains significantly high, despite major advancements in trauma care including the continuous updating of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program. Stab and gunshot wounds due to assault or self-inflicted injuries are the common causes of penetrating cardiac injuries, while motor vehicular accidents and fall from height are attributable causes of blunt cardiac injury. Rapid transport of victim to trauma care facility, prompt recognition of cardiac trauma by clinical evaluation and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, quick decision-making to perform emergency department thoracotomy, and/or shifting the patient expeditiously to the operating room for operative intervention with ongoing resuscitation are the key components for a successful outcome in cardiac injury victims with cardiac tamponade or exsanguinating hemorrhage. Blunt cardiac injury with arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, or cardiac failure may need continuous cardiac monitoring or anesthetic care for operative procedure of other associated injuries. This mandates a multidisciplinary approach working in concert with agreed local protocols and shared goals. An anesthesiologist has a pivotal role to play as a team leader or member in the trauma pathway of severely injured patients. They are not only involved in in-hospital care as a perioperative physician but also participate in the organizational aspects of prehospital trauma systems and training of prehospital care providers/paramedics. There is sparse literature available on the anesthetic management of cardiac injury (penetrating as well as blunt) patients. This narrative review discusses the comprehensive management of cardiac injury patients, focusing on the anesthetic concerns and is guided by our experience in managing cardiac injury cases at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. JPNATC is the only level 1 trauma center in north India, providing services to a population of approximately 30 million with around 9000 operations being performed annually.

TI  - Cross-Cultural Teachings from Cremation Practices: Atmaram for the Departed, Shiva Linga for the Living, and Odontoid Fracture for the Neurosurgeons!

AB  - Atmaram bone ( C2 axis vertebra) is usually handed over to the family of the deceased on the next day after cremation during the ''Asthi sanchaya '' commemoration. ''Asthi visarajan'' involves the practice of immersing the bones and ashes of the deceased in the Holy Ganges river as per Hindu beliefs. Atmaram bone, which usually does not burn during cremation, is handed over to the family of the departed ( asthi sanchaya) after cremation which is then immersed in the holy Ganges river ( asthi visarajan). Atma means soul, Ram means Lord and Atmaram combined means the one who is Lord of his own soul." Worshiping of Lord Shiva (while living) and Asthi sanchaya-Asthi visarajan (of the departed) are two religious venerations in Hinduism. Atmaram bone was handed over to me for immersion in the holy Ganges on November 6, 2020, after conducting the asthi sanchaya of my mother during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Atmaram bone looked like a Shivalinga statue to most who looked at it, whereas it resembled the image of the axis vertebrae ( C2 vertebra) to me when I saw it that sacred day. Atmaram bone, the Shivalinga, and the C2 axis vertebra are among the most precious and sacred objects that humans can handle as relatives, as devotees, and as neurosurgeons, respectively. Asclepius, possibly a skilled war surgeon/neurosurgeon, was worshipped at Asclepieia. Trephination surgery in neurosurgery and religion are intertwined historically. Though there is no published literature, neurosurgeons in various parts of the world do offer religious prayers prior to major neurosurgical operations. In line with the religious veneration of worshipping Shiva Ling or immersion of bones of the departed soul in the Holy Ganges river, we believe it is the sacred responsibility of the operating neurosurgeon to perform surgery in complex craniovertebral junction. As neurosurgeons, we cannot ignore the axis in the living, the odontoid fracture in the injured, and the Atmaram in the deceased.

AB  - Purpose: The research activity in pediatric glaucoma (PG) was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using a scientometric approach. Methods: The "Web of Science" database was accessed for primary bibliometric data regarding PG using search terms "pediatric glaucoma," " paediatric glaucoma," "congenital glaucoma," and "childhood glaucoma." The data was analyzed for total research productivity, citations, and scientific output in terms of journals, countries, institutions, and authors. The results were further characterized for coauthorship links and visualized by VOS viewer software. Also, the top 25 cited articles were reviewed with the above bibliometric characteristics. Results: One thousand two hundred and sixty-nine items were obtained from our search query from 1955 to 2022; these received 15,485 citations, originated from 78 countries. The top-3 contributing countries were the United States of America (n = 369), India (n = 134), and China (n = 127). LV Prasad Eye Institute (n = 58), Duke University (n = 44), and King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital (n = 42) were the top-3 productive institutes. The top-3 prolific authors were Mandal AK (n = 53), Freedman, SF (n = 36), and Sarfarazi, M (n = 33). Journal wise, "Investigative Ophthalmology" (n = 187), "Journal of Glaucoma" (n = 92), and "Journal of AAPOS" (n = 68) were the journals in which the most articles were published. The top-25 cited documents received 3564 citations and were published between 1977 and 2016. The key areas of interest were basic sciences (genetics of childhood glaucoma) and surgical management. Conclusion: United States of America, LVPEI, Mandal AK, and "Investigative Ophthalmology" were the top rankers as far as the productivity and publications related to PG are concerned. Articles on molecular genetics in PG have received interest among the ophthalmology community.

TI  - Pilot testing of mobile app-based blended learning on selected skills of cardiopulmonary resuscitation among nursing students
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background.Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a skill-oriented training programme required to be practised and updated periodically by every healthcare provider.
   Methods. In an open-label randomized controlled trial, 81 fourth-year BSc Nursing students were randomized to experimental (n=41) and control (n=40) groups using a computer-generated table. The learning resource material was shared through a mobile-app with the experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG) received the internet link for retrieving the learning resource material, 4 days before a 1-day training programme. Baseline knowledge and skills assessment of the students was done before the commencement of the training programme, using a prevalidated self-developed questionnaire based on standardized CPR guidelines of professional bodies. Post- intervention assessment of knowledge, skills, confidence and satisfaction of the students with the training methodology was done at the end of the training programme. The confidence and satisfaction of the students with the training methodology were assessed using a standardized confidence scale and a self-developed satisfaction scale, respectively.
   Results. The baseline knowledge and skills scores of the students were comparable (EG v. CG, knowledge: 16.04 [2.35] v. 15.52 [2.69], p=0.34; skill: 13.41 [5.28] v. 15.02 [4.66], p=0.16). A comparable improvement was seen in post-intervention knowledge and skills scores between the groups (EG v. CG, knowledge 17.78 [1.49] v. 17.70 [1.51], p= 0.82; skill 29.85 [2.44] v. 30.08 [2.79], p=0.60). The post-intervention confidence in performing the skills ( 20.22 [2.76] v. 19.41 [3.63], p=0.331) and satisfaction with the method of dissemination of educational resource material (29.85 [2.4] v. 30.08 [2.79], p=0.73) were also comparable in both the groups.
   Conclusion. Both mobile app-based and internet linkbased learning resource material along with hands-on sessions were effective in bringing comparable improvement in knowledge, skills, self-confidence and satisfaction of students in performing the selected skills of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

AB  - The most common cause of corneal graft failure is corneal graft rejection (CGR). Although cornea is one of the immune-privileged sites, it can still get a rejection episode due to a breach in its natural protective mechanism. Both anatomical and structural properties of cornea and anterior chamber contribute toward its immune tolerance. Clinically, every layer of the transplanted cornea can get a rejection episode. A proper understanding of immunopathogenesis will help in understanding the various mechanism of CGR and the development of newer strategies for the prevention and management of such cases.

AB  - Bronchoscopy for research purposes is a valuable tool to understand lung-specific biology in human participants. Despite published reports and active research protocols using this procedure in critically ill patients, no recent document encapsulates the important safety considerations and downstream applications of this procedure in this setting. The objectives were to identify safe practices for patient selection and protection of hospital staff, provide recommendations for sample procurement to standardize studies, and give guidance on sample preparation for novel research technologies. Seventeen international experts in the management of critically ill patients, bronchoscopy in clinical and research settings, and experience in patient-oriented clinical or translational research convened for a workshop. Review of relevant literature, expert presentations, and discussion generated the findings presented herein. The committee concludes that research bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation is valuable and safe in appropriately selected patients. This report includes recommendations on standardization of this procedure and prioritizes the reporting of sample management to produce more reproducible results between laboratories. This document serves as a resource to the community of researchers who endeavor to include bronchoscopy as part of their research protocols and highlights key considerations for the inclusion and safety of research participants.

AB  - Until very recently, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have been the mainstay of treatment in non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLCs). However, recent advances in molecular immunology have unveiled some of the complexity of the mechanisms regulating cellular immune responses and led to the successful targeting of immune checkpoints in attempts to enhance antitumor T-cell responses. Immune checkpoint molecules such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4, programmed cell death protein-1, and programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 have been shown to play central roles in evading cancer immunity. Thus, these molecules have been targeted by inhibitors for the management of cancers forming the basis of immunotherapy. Advanced NSCLC has been the paradigm for the benefits of immunotherapy in any cancer. Treatment decisions are made based on the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cells and the presence or absence of driver mutations. Patients with high PD-L1 expression (= 50%) and no driver mutations are treated with single-agent immunotherapy whereas, for all other patients with a lower level of PD-L1 expression, a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is preferred. Thus, PD-L1 blockers are the only immunotherapeutic agents approved in advanced NSCLC without any oncogenic driver mutations. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, however, may not be the best biomarker in view of its dynamic nature in time and space, and the benefits may be seen regardless of PD -L1 expression. Each immunotherapy molecule is prescribed based on the levels of PD-L1 expression as assessed by a Food and Drug Administration-approved companion diagnostic assay. Other biomarkers that have been studied include tumor mutational burden, the T-effector signature, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, radiomic assays, inflammation index, presence or absence of immune-related adverse events and specific driver mutations, and gut as well as local microbiome. At the current time, none of these biomarkers are routinely used in the clinical decision-making process for immunotherapy in NSCLC. However, in individual cases, they can be useful adjuncts to conventional therapy. This review describes our current understanding of the role of biomarkers as predictors of response to immune checkpoint molecules. To begin with a brief on cancer immunology in general and in NSCLC, in particular, is discussed. In the end, recent advancements in laboratory techniques for refining biomarker assays are described.

AB  - Purpose: Barrett toric calculator (BTC) is known for its accuracy in toric IOL (tIOL) calculation over standard calculators; however, there is no study in literature to compare it with real-time intraoperative aberrometry (IA). The aim was to compare the accuracy of BTC and IA in predicting refractive outcomes in tIOL implantation. Methods: This was an institution-based prospective, observational study. Patients undergoing routine phacoemulsification with tIOL implantation were enrolled. Biometry was obtained from Lenstar-LS 900 and IOL power calculated using online BTC; however, IOL was implanted as per IA (Optiwave Refractive Analysis, ORA, Alcon) recommendation. Postoperative refractive astigmatism (RA) and spherical equivalent (SE) were recorded at one month, and respective prediction errors (PEs) were calculated using predicted refractive outcomes for both methods. The primary outcome measure was a comparison between mean PE with IA and BTC, and secondary outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), postoperative RA, and SE at one month. SPSS Version-21 was used; P < 0.05 considered significant. Results: Thirty eyes of 29 patients were included. Mean arithmetic and mean absolute PEs for RA were comparable between BTC (-0.70 +/- 0.35D; 0.70 +/- 0.34D) and IA (0.77 +/- 0.32D; 0.80 +/- 0.39D) (P = 0.09 and 0.09, respectively). Mean arithmetic PE for residual SE was significantly lower for BTC (-0.14 +/- 0.32D) than IA (0.001 +/- 0.33D) (-0.14 +/- 0.32D; P = 0.002); however, there was no difference between respective mean absolute PEs (0.27 +/- 0.21 D; 0.27 +/- 0.18; P = 0.80). At one-month, mean UCDVA, RA, and SE were 0.09 +/- 0.10D, -0.57 +/- 0.26D, and -0.18 +/- 0.27D, respectively. Conclusion: Both IA and BTC give reliable and comparable refractive results for tIOL implantation.

AB  - Ras GTPases are central to cellular signaling and oncogenesis. The three loci of the Ras gene encode for four protein isoforms namely Harvey-Ras (H-Ras), Kirsten-Ras (K-Ras 4A and 4B), and Neuroblastoma-Ras (N-Ras) which share similar to 80% sequence similarity and used to be considered functionally redundant. The small molecule inhibitors of Ras lack specificity for the isoforms leading to widespread toxicity in Ras-targeted therapeutics. Ras isoforms' tissue-specific expression and selective association with carcinogenesis, embryonic development, and infection suggested their non-redundancy. We show that CD40, an antigen-presenting cell (APC)-expressed immune receptor, induces selective relocation of H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras to the Plasma membrane (PM) lipid rafts, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but not to the Golgi complex (GC). The two palmitoylated Ras isoforms-H-Ras and N-Ras-have a similar pattern of colocalization into the lipid-rich raft microdomain of the PM at early time points when compared to non-palmitoylated K-Ras (4B) with polylysine residues. CD40-induced trafficking of H-Ras and K-Ras to mitochondria and ER was found to be similar but different from that of N-Ras. Trafficking of all the Ras isoforms to the GC was independent of CD40 stimulation. The receptor-driven trafficking and spatial segregation of H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras imply isoform-specific subcellular signaling platforms for the functional non-redundancy of Ras isoforms.

AB  - Risperidone is commonly used in postnatal mothers for depression and psychotic symptoms in spite of little data on its safety profile in neonates. It is reported previously that 6 mg/day can be used in mothers without having any untoward in breastfed neonates. Excretion of risperidone is dependent on the enzyme CYP2D6 whose activity varies as per individual phenotype. Maximum therapeutic levels are achieved at 2 h of administration of the drug. We are reporting a case of preterm breastfed neonate who presented with respiratory depression twice due to risperidone usage in its mother. This is the first reported case where 1 mg/day dosage of risperidone in nursing mother was associated with acute adverse effects such as respiratory depression in her neonate. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Assessment Scale scored to 8 which suggests probable relation between the drug and its reaction in neonates. It underscores cautious use in mothers and close monitoring of neonates when risperidone is prescribed irrespective of dosage.

AB  - Purpose: To study the long-term microvasculature changes at the macula and the optic disk in eyes with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Methods: Patients with acute NAION of less than 6 weeks duration were included. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) of the macula and the optic disk was performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months and compared with the controls. Results: The mean age of 15 patients was 52.25 (+/- 9.06) years. The whole image superficial peripapillary density (42.49 +/- 5.28) was significantly low when compared to that of control eyes (46.36 +/- 2.09); similarly, radial peripapillary capillary density (49.35 +/- 5.64) was also significantly reduced when compared to controls (53.45 +/- 1.96, P < 0.05). These parameters showed significant progressive decrease at 3 and 6 months (P < 0.05). At the macula, both superficial (41.83 +/- 3.64) and deep macular vasculature densities (47.30 +/- 2.04) were significantly reduced when compared to control eyes (52.15 +/- 4.84 and 55.13 +/- 1.81, respectively). The vascular density at the macula remained stable at 3- and 6-months period. Conclusion: The study shows that the microvasculature in case of NAION is significantly reduced both in peripapillary area and in macular area.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a clinical entity called "rectus muscle pseudo-adherence syndrome" following buckling surgery. Methods: A retrospective data review was undertaken to analyze the clinical profile of strabismus patients who had developed it following buckling surgery. Between 2017 and 2021, a total of 14 patients were identified. The demography, surgical details, and intraoperative challenges were reviewed. Results: The average age of the 14 patients was 21.71 +/- 5.23 years. The mean pre-op deviation was 42.35 +/- 14.35 prism diopters (PD) of exotropia, and the mean post-op deviation was 8.25 +/- 4.88 PD of residual exotropia at 26.16 +/- 19.53 months follow-up. Intraoperatively, in the absence of a buckle, the thinned-out rectus adhered to the underlying sclera with much denser adhesions along its margins. When there was a buckle, the rectus muscle adhered to the outer surface of the buckle again, but less densely, with marginal union into the surrounding tenons. In both scenarios, due to the absence of protective muscle coverings, the rectus muscles were naturally adsorbed onto the immediately available surface in the presence of active healing by the tenons. Conclusion: While correcting ocular deviations following buckling surgery, a false sense of an absent, slipped, or thinned-out rectus muscle is very much possible. This is due to active healing of the muscle with the surrounding sclera or the buckle in a single layer of tenons. This is the rectus muscle pseudo-adherence syndrome, where the culprit is the healing process and not the muscle.

AB  - Background & objectives: Research studies in the 1970s reported that in pre-school children, undernutrition increased the risk of infections and infections aggravated undernutrition. Over decades, there has been a reduction in prevalence of undernutrition and improvement in access to healthcare for treatment of infections. A mixed longitudinal study was undertaken to assess whether over time there were any changes from the earlier reported effect of undernutrition prior to infection on the risk of morbidity and effect of morbidity on nutritional status in pre-school children.
   Methods: Pre-school (0-59 months of age) children from urban low- and middle-income families whose parents were willing to allow their participation in the study were enrolled. Information on sociodemographic profile of the families was collected at enrolment. Weight of all children and length in infants were recorded every month; length/height in children 12-59 months of age was recorded once in three months. Morbidity information was collected through fortnightly visits.
   Results: 3888 pre-school children were followed up in 74636 home visits. Among these children, underweight and wasting were associated with a small increase in risk of infections. The odds ratio for risk of infection for underweight children was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.16) and for wasting was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.29). The deterioration in Z scores for weight-for-age and body mass index-for-age in children during illness and convalescence was small but significant (P<0.001).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The increased risk of infections in undernourished children living in overcrowded tenements in areas with poor environmental hygiene was not significant, perhaps because the risk of infection in normally nourished children was also high. The deterioration in nutritional status following infection was small because of the ready access to and utilization of health and nutrition care.

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Background: The effects of chronic pancreatitis (CP) on pregnancy and vice versa have not been studied well. We aimed to study the impact of CP on pregnancy-related outcomes and the effect of pregnancy on clinical profile of CP.
   Study and Goals: We did a retrospective analysis of all female patients of CP of child-bearing age (above 18 y). The pregnancy-related outcomes of patients with CP were compared with the age-matched 115 controls from the low-risk pregnancy group identified using a simplified antepartum high-risk pregnancy scoring form. The clinical course of CP during pregnancy was compared with the pre-pregnancy course.
   Results: Among the 338 eligible patients, 46 patients were included after exclusions. All these 46 patients had at least 1 conception and 41 had at least 1 completed pregnancy with a total of 117 conceptions and 96 completed pregnancies. The pregnancy-related outcomes in patients with CP like abortions (21.7% vs. 11.3%; P= 0.087), preterm deliveries (14.6% vs. 10.4%; P= 0.47), antepartum course (82.7% vs. 82.6%; P= 0.58), stillbirths (4.9% vs. 4.3%; P= 0.88), cesarean section (36.6% vs. 34%; P= 0.849) were comparable with controls. There was overall improvement in the severity and frequency of pain during pregnancy as compared with the pre-pregnancy symptoms (P= 0.001).
   Conclusion: CP is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Also, there is trend toward improvement in the clinical symptoms because of CP during the pregnancy.

AB  - The world, today, recognizes the increasing importance of assistive technology (AT) that can reduce the functional limitations of persons with disabilities, individuals with chronic debilitating diseases, and elders. This indicates that at some point, everyone, either temporary or permanent, will require AT to improve their physical and functional abilities, thus contributing to independent living, social inclusion, and education. Besides this, the need for AT will be growing with a majority from low-middle-income countries. The same is true for India though we are not sure how many people have met a need, and unmet need for AT to date, but the requirement will continue to increase. There is a significant gap between needs and access to AT. Recently, the WHO has led many initiatives related to AT services after the 71st World Health Assembly's resolution in 2018, to improve access to AT for its member states. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have pledged that no one should be left behind irrespective of personal characteristics. India, a ratified member state, needs to align with various initiatives undertaken by the WHO and the UN. Despite many challenges, India needs to formulate evidence-based AT policy, planning within the purview of the healthcare delivery system in collaboration with various government and nongovernment sectors, including industries. This article explores the need, access, and potential challenges associated with AT services in India. Finally, we discussed various initiatives on AT in the country and possible recommendations to improve AT services across.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude and practice towards Ayurveda among patients attending cardiology and neurology clinics at a tertiary care institute in India
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
KW  - COMPLEMENTARY
AB  - Background. Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine, has been practised in India since ages. We evaluated the overall awareness regarding Ayurveda among patients attending two specialty clinics at a tertiary care institute.
   Methods. We did a cross- sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 14.2.
   Results. Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs ( 77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations ( 44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%). Principal sources of information were TV promotional programmes (34.7%) and newspaper advertisements ( 13.9%). Nearly two-thirds (63%) of participants opined that Ayurveda is effective in chronic disorders. Although only 9.1% of participants reported the use of Ayurvedic medicines, 89.2% believed it would be beneficial if the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi had Ayurveda services. Three-fourths (75.8%) of respondents were interested to participate in research studies integrating Ayurveda with modern medicine.
   Conclusion. Imprecise knowledge and awareness towards Ayurveda appears to prevail in addition to the low practice among the patients surveyed. We found imprecise knowledge of Ayurvedic therapies and its low usage among patients attending specialized OPDs in a tertiary care hospital. The major source of information reported was promotional advertisements in the print and electronic media. Our survey shows a need for awareness programmes for general public at various levels.

AB  - Acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA) is a self-limited syndrome that is frequently post-infectious, most commonly following Varicella infection having an autoimmune mechanism. ACA is the commonest cause of childhood ataxia. We report a 14-year-old male who presented with acute onset wide-based gait and slurring of speech with dysdiadochokinesia, incoordination of voluntary movements, pendular knee jerk, and intentional tremors. He had worsening transaminitis and rising bilirubin during his hospital course and was subsequently found to be hepatitis A virus (HAV) immunoglobulin-M antibody positive. Thus, we report a case of ACA with HAV infection who developed jaundice after three weeks of onset of ataxia, a rarity that has not been reported so far in medical literature.

AB  - This surgical technique describes a modification of the continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) to achieve an adequate-sized capsulorhexis in pediatric cataracts with high intralenticular pressure. Performing CCC in pediatric cataracts is challenging, especially when the intralenticular pressure is high. This technique involves 30 G needle decompression of the lens to reduce positive intralenticular pressure and subsequent flattening of the anterior capsule. This minimizes the chances of extension of CCC without using any special equipment. This technique was used in two eyes of two patients (age 8 and 10 years) with unilateral developmental cataracts. Both surgeries were performed by a single surgeon (PKM). In both eyes, a well-centered CCC was achieved with no extension, and a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) was placed in the capsular bag. Thus, our technique of 30 G needle aspiration could be extremely useful to achieve an adequately sized CCC in pediatric cataracts with high intralenticular pressure, especially for beginner surgeons.

AB  - Background: Cervical discharge as part of cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease is a cause of significant morbidity in sexually active women worldwide. Non-gonococcal and non- chlamydial bacterial pathogens are becoming more prevalent.Aims: This study aims to determine bacterial pathogens causing cervical discharge using culture and/or polymerase chain reaction and assess the clinical and laboratory response to the conventional syndromic kit regimen established by the World Health Organisation.Methods: A retrospective review of records of women with cervical discharge over one year period. Culture and/or polymerase chain reaction results of endocervical swabs of various bacterial pathogens at baseline and after four weeks of treatment with syndromic kit regimen were recorded.Results: A total of 70 case records were reviewed for clinical details, out of which results of bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction were available for 67 cases. Infectious aetiology was found in 30 (44.7%) patients with Ureaplasma species being the most common organism isolated on culture (18, 26.8%) and polymerase chain reaction (25, 37.3%), respectively. Polymerase chain reaction for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis was positive in ten (14.9%) and four (6%) cases, respectively. None of the patients showed positive culture for Neissena gonorrhoeae. Coinfection was seen in eight (11.9%) patients with the majority showing Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma spp. coinfection (five patients). Forty one cases (58.5%) received tab. cefixime 400 mg and tab. azithromycin one gram stat (kit 1), while 29 cases (43.3%) received tab. cefixime 400 mg stat, tab. metronidazole 400 mg and cap. doxycycline 100 mg, both twice daily for 14 days (kit 6). Minimal to no clinical improvement with treatment was seen in 14 out of 32 cases (44%) at the end of four weeks with the conventional kit regimen. Post-treatment culture and/or polymerase chain reaction were positive in nine out of 28 cases (32.1%) with Ureaplasma spp. being the most common.Limitations: Retrospective study design, small sample size and fewer cases with follow-up data were the main limitations.Conclusion: Ureaplasma spp. was the most common infectious cause of cervical discharge in our patients. Treatment given as part of syndromic management led to a clinical and microbiological response in around half and two-third cases, respectively.

AB  - Glaucoma is a series of linked optic diseases resulting in progressive vision loss and total blindness due to the acquired loss of retinal ganglion cells. This harm to the optic nerve results in visual impairment and, ultimately, total blindness if left untreated. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most frequent variety within the large family of glaucoma. It is a multifaceted and heterogeneous condition with several environmental and genetic variables aiding in its etiology. By 2040, there will be 111.8 million glaucoma patients globally, with Asia and Africa accounting for the vast majority. The goal of this review is to elaborate on the role of genes (nuclear and mitochondrial) as well as their variants in the pathogenesis of POAG. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched online for papers until September 2022. Prevalence and inheritance patterns vary significantly across different ethnic and geographic populations. Numerous causative genetic loci may exist; however, only a few have been recognized and characterized. Further investigation into the genetic etiology of POAG is expected to uncover novel and intriguing causal genes, allowing for a more precise pathogenesis pattern of the disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION:A subset of patients with celiac disease (CeD) has liver involvement in the form of hypertransaminasemia, liver cirrhosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses to determine the pooled prevalence of CeD in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, all-cause cirrhosis, cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia, and all-cause hypertransaminasemia.METHODS:We searched PubMed and EMBASE up to January 2022. Cross-sectional, case-control, and prospective cohort studies performing serological tests and/or intestinal biopsy for CeD on patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, all-cause cirrhosis, cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia, and all-cause hypertransaminasemia were included to calculate pooled estimates of seroprevalence and the prevalence of biopsy-confirmed CeD in these 4 groups.RESULTS:Of 6,871 articles screened, 20 articles were included finally in 3 meta-analyses for cryptogenic cirrhosis, all-cause cirrhosis, and cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia. For the all-cause hypertransaminasemia group, a qualitative review of 4 studies was conducted instead of a meta-analysis due to significant differences in studies. The pooled prevalence (95% confidence interval) of biopsy-confirmed CeD in cryptogenic cirrhosis was 4.6% (2.2%-7.5%) while the pooled prevalence of biopsy-confirmed CeD in all-cause cirrhosis was 0.8% (0%-3.4%). The pooled prevalence of biopsy-confirmed CeD in cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia was 5.7% (3.2%-8.8%).DISCUSSION:Nearly 1 in 20 patients each with cryptogenic cirrhosis and cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia have CeD; hence, they should both be considered high-risk groups for CeD. While the prevalence of CeD in those with all-cause cirrhosis is similar to that in general population, it may be worth screening them for CeD because liver pathology has the potential for reversal in them.

AB  - Pediatric steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (pSSNS) is the most common childhood glomerular disease. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a risk locus in the HLA Class II region and three additional independent risk loci. But the genetic architecture of pSSNS, and its genetically driven pathobiology, is largely unknown. Here, we conduct amulti-population GWAS meta-analysis in 38,463 participants (2440 cases). We then conduct conditional analyses and population specific GWAS. We discover twelve significant associations-eight from the multi-population meta-analysis (four novel), two from the multi-population conditional analysis (one novel), and two additional novel loci from the European meta-analysis. Fine-mapping implicates specific amino acid haplotypes in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 driving the HLA Class II risk locus. Non-HLA loci colocalize with eQTLs of monocytes and numerous T-cell subsets in independent datasets. Colocalization with kidney eQTLs is lacking but overlap with kidney cell open chromatin suggests an uncharacterized disease mechanism in kidney cells. A polygenic risk score (PRS) associates with earlier disease onset. Altogether, these discoveries expand our knowledge of pSSNS genetic architecture across populations and provide cell-specific insights into its molecular drivers. Evaluating these associations in additional cohorts will refine our understanding of population specificity, heterogeneity, and clinical and molecular associations.

AB  - Background: Men with idiopathic obstructive azoospermia (OA) are candidates for surgical reconstruction with a vasoepididymal anastomosis (VEA) performed on one or both testis. There are no randomised trials comparing the success of unilateral versus bilateral VEA. Objective: We conducted a randomised trial to compare the two surgical options. Design, setting, and participants: Between April 2017 and March 2022, men with infertility due to idiopathic OA were randomised to a unilateral (group 1) or bilateral (group 2) VEA in an ethics committee-approved clinical trial, registered with the Clinical Trials Registry. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary outcome was successful surgery, defined as appearance of sperm in the ejaculate, evaluated at 3 mo intervals after surgery. Additional outcomes were pregnancy rates and complications between the two groups. Men with successful surgery were compared with those without patency to identify the predictors of success. Results and limitations: Fifty-four men fulfilled the criteria and 52 who completed follow-up were included in the analysis. The overall patency rate was 36.5% (19/52 individuals). This was higher in men with bilateral surgery (12/26 patients, 46%) than in those with unilateral surgery (7/26 patients, 27%) but was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). The overall pregnancy rate with ejaculated sperm was significantly higher in the bilateral surgery group (4 vs 0, p = 0.037), while the spontaneous conception rate was higher but not statistically significant (3 vs 0, p = 0.074). The complication rates in the two groups were similar (p = 0.7), and all complications were Clavien-Dindo grade 1. Although bilateral surgery and presence of sperm in epididymal fluid were higher in men with patency, these were not statistically significant. Conclusions: A bilateral VEA was associated with higher patency and spontaneous pregnancy rates than unilateral surgery, but the results were not statistically

AB  - ObjectivesThis was a prospective, randomized controlled trial to test functional outcomes between a single lag screw and helical blade nails in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures.Methods72 patients with intertrochanteric fractures between March 2019 to November 2020 were randomized into two groups and treated with a lag screw or a helical blade nail. Intraoperative parameters such as operative time, blood loss, and radiation exposure were calculated. Postoperatively, tip apex distance, neck length, neck-shaft angle, lateral impingement of implant, union rate, and the functional outcomes were measured at the end of 6 month follow-up period.ResultsThere was a significant decrease in tip apex distance (p=0.03) and neck length(p-0.04) with significant lateral impingement of the implant (p=0.04) in the helical blade group compared to the lag screw group. The functional outcome calculated using the modified Harris Hip score & Parker and Palmer mobility score, at the end of 6 months, had no significant difference between the two groups.ConclusionBoth lag screw and helical blade devices can be used to successfully treat these fractures, although there is greater medial migration in the helical blade as compared to the lag screw.

AB  - Geraniol (GE), an acyclic monoterpene, is a chief constituent of essential oils of herbs and fruits. It possesses diverse pharmacological actions like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-parkinson. However, its neuroprotective potential in stroke is yet to be explored at large. The present study evaluated the neuroprotective potential of GE against the global model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury in rats. Bilateral common carotid artery (BCCA) occlusion for 30 min followed by 7 days of reperfusion caused varied biochemical/enzymatic alterations viz. increase in levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), xanthine oxidase (XO), and decrease in the levels of cerebroprotectives like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total thiols, and glutathione (GSH). GE-pretreatment markedly reversed these changes and restored the levels of protective enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants near to normal compared to I/R group. Besides, GE treatment showed marked improvement in anxiety-related behavior and neuronal deficits in animals subjected to I/R injury. Moreover, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained rat brain coronal sections and histopathological studies revealed neuronal protection against I/R-injury, as evidenced by a reduction in infarct area (%) and an increase in hippocampal CA1 neuronal density in the GE-treated groups. The results of this study revealed that GE exhibited potential neuroprotective activity by reducing oxidative stress and infarction area, and protecting hippocampal CA1 neurons against I/R-injury in the global stroke model in rats.

AB  - BackgroundOsteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that predominantly affects young individuals, including children and adolescents. The disease progresses through heterogeneous genetic alterations, and patients often develop pulmonary metastases even after the primary tumors have been surgically removed. Ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs) regulate several critical cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, transcriptional activation, and signal transduction. Various studies have revealed the significance of USP37 in the regulation of replication stress and oncogenesis.MethodsIn this study, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed to investigate USP37 expression. RNA sequencing was utilized to assess the impact of USP37 overexpression and depletion on gene expression in osteosarcoma cells. Various molecular assays, including colony formation, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and DNA replication restart, were employed to examine the physical interaction between USP37 and PCNA, as well as its physiological effects in osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, molecular docking studies were conducted to gain insight into the nature of the interaction between USP37 and PCNA. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed on archived tissue blocks from osteosarcoma patients to establish a correlation between USP37 and PCNA expression.ResultsAnalysis of the TCGA database revealed that increased expression of USP37 was linked to decreased progression-free survival (PFS) in osteosarcoma patients. Next-generation sequencing analysis of osteosarcoma cells demonstrated that overexpression or knockdown of USP37 led to the expression of different sets of genes. USP37 overexpression provided a survival advantage, while its depletion heightened sensitivity to replication stress in osteosarcoma cells. USP37 was found to physically interact with PCNA, and molecular docking studies indicated that the interaction occurs through unique residues. In response to genotoxic stress, cells that overexpressed USP37 resolved DNA damage foci more quickly than control cells or cells in which USP37 was depleted. The expression of USP37 varied in archived osteosarcoma tissues, with intermediate expression seen in 52% of cases in the cohort examined.ConclusionThe results of this investigation propose that USP37 plays a vital role in promoting replication stress tolerance in osteosarcoma cells. The interaction between USP37 and PCNA is involved in the regulation of replication stress, and disrupting it could potentially trigger synthetic lethality in osteosarcoma. This study has expanded our knowledge of the mechanism through which USP37 regulates replication stress, and its potential as a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma merits additional exploration.

AB  - IntroductionThe outcomes of osteosarcoma in low middle income countries (LMICs) are different due to patients presenting in advanced stages, resource constraints and the use of non-high-dose-methotrexate (HDMTX)-based regimens. This study derived and validated a prognostic score for osteosarcoma that integrates biologic and social factors and is tailored for patients from an LMIC setting using a non-HDMTX-based protocol. Materials and methodsA retrospective study including osteosarcoma patients enrolled for treatment at a single tertiary care centre in India between 2003-19 was conducted. Baseline biologic and social characteristics were extracted from medical records and survival outcomes were noted. The cohort was randomised into a derivation and validation cohort. Multivariable Cox regression was used to identify baseline characteristics that were independently prognostic for survival outcomes in the derivation cohort. A score was derived from the prognostic factors identified in the derivation cohort and further validated in the validation cohort with estimation of its predictive ability. Results594 patients with osteosarcoma were eligible for inclusion in the study. Around one-third of the cohort had metastatic disease with 59% of the patients residing in rural areas. The presence of metastases at baseline (HR 3.39; p<0.001; score=3), elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) >450 IU/L (HR 1.57; p=0.001; score=1) and baseline tumour size > 10 cm (HR 1.68; p<0.001; score=1) were identified to be independent factors predicting inferior event free survival (EFS) and were included in development of the prognostic score. Patients were categorized as low risk (score 0), intermediate risk (score 1-3) and high risk (4-5). Harrell's c-indices for the score were 0.682, 0.608 and 0.657 respectively for EFS in the derivation, validation and whole cohort respectively. The timed AUC of ROC was 0.67 for predicting 18-month EFS in the derivation, validation and whole cohorts while that for 36-month EFS were 0.68, 0.66 and 0.68 respectively. ConclusionsThe study describes the outcomes among osteosarcoma patients from an LMIC treated uniformly with a non-HDMTX-based protocol. Tumor size, baseline metastases and SAP were prognostic factors used to derive a score with good predictive value for survival outcomes. Social factors did not emerge as determinants of survival.

AB  - Background: Carcinoma penis is a rare neoplasm, and the literature is scarce on long-term survival and its predictors. The aim of the study was to determine the clinical profile and management patterns, identify predictors of survival, and the impact of education and rural/urban dwelling on survival. Methods: Patients with a histological diagnosis of carcinoma penis from January 2015 to December 2019 were included in the study. Demographics, clinical profile, education status, primary residence address, and outcomes were obtained from the case records. Distance from the treatment centre was obtained from the postal code. The primary objectives were to assess relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The secondary objectives were to identify the predictors of RFS and OS and to determine the clinical profile and treatment patterns in patients with carcinoma penis in India. Time-to-event was calculated by Kaplan-Meir analysis and survival was compared by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to find independent predictors of relapse and mortality. Logistic regression analyses to examine the associations of rural residence, education status, and distance from the treatment centre with the relapse adjusting for measured confounding variables. Results: Case records of 102 patients treated during the above period were retrieved. The median age was 55.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 42-65 years). Ulcero-proliferative growth (65%), pain (57%), and dysuria (36%) were the most common presenting features. Clinical examination or imaging revealed inguinal lymphadenopathy in 70.6% of patients, however, only 42% of these lesions were pathologically involved. A total of 58.8% of patients were from rural areas, 46.9% had no formal education, and 50.9% had a primary residence =100 km from the hospital. Patients with lower education and rural households had higher TNM stages and nodal involvement. Median RFS and OS were 57.6 months (15.8 months to not reached) and 83.9 months (32.5 months to not reached), respectively. On univariate analysis tumor stage, involvement of lymph nodes, T stage, performance status, and albumin was predictive for relapse and survival. However, on multivariate analysis, the stage remained the only predictor of RFS and nodal involvement, and metastatic disease was a predictor of OS. Education status, rural habitation, and distance from the treatment centre were not predictors for relapse or survival. Conclusions: Patients with carcinoma have locally advanced disease at presentation. Rural dwellings and lower education were associated with the advanced stage but did not have a significant bearing on the survival outcomes. The stage at diagnosis and nodal involvement is the most important predictor of RFS and OS.

AB  - Rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive diagnostic assays are essential for global tuberculosis (TB) control, especially in high TB burden, resource-limited settings. The current study was designed to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of Truenat MTB-Rif Dx (MolBio) in children less than 18 years of age, with symptoms suggestive of TB. Gastric aspirate, induced sputum, and broncho-alveolar lavage samples were subjected simultaneously to AFB-smear, GeneXpert MTB/RIF, liquid culture (MGIT-960) and Truenat MTB-Rif Dx. The index-test results were evaluated against microbiological reference standards (MRS). Truenat MTB-Rif Dx had a sensitivity of 57.1%, specificity of 92% against MRS. The sensitivity and specificity of the Truenat MTB-RIF Dx compared with liquid culture was 58.7% and 87.5% while GeneXpert MTB/RIF was 56% and 91.4%. The performance of both GeneXpert MTB/RIF and Truenat MTB-Rif Dx are comparable. Result of our study demonstrates that Truenat MTB-Rif can aid in early and efficient diagnosis of TB in children.

AB  - Acute pancreatitis (AP) has varying severity, and moderately severe and severe AP has prolonged hospitalization and requires multiple interventions. These patients are at risk of malnutrition. There is no proven pharmacotherapy for AP, however, apart from fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and organ support, nutrition plays an important role in the management of AP. Oral or enteral nutrition (EN) is the preferred route of nutrition in AP, however, in a subset of patients, parenteral nutrition is required. EN has various physiological benefits and decreases the risk of infection, intervention, and mortality. There is no proven role of probiotics, glutamine supplementation, antioxidants, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in patients with AP.

AB  - A simple, cost-effective, eco-friendly and novel approach using Stenotaphrum secundatum (buffalo grass) extract for ZnO-Ag nanocomposites (NCs) formation. S. secundatum grass mediated nanoparticles have high anticancer and antibacterial activities. Phenol and octadecanoic acid are major phytochemical compounds involved in the biosynthesis of ZnO-Ag NCs as identified by GC-MS. Biosynthesized ZnO-Ag NCs were characterised, compared with ZnONPs and AgNPs. UV-Vis spectra revealed the absorption maxima observed at 360 nm for ZnONPs, 428 nm for AgNPs, double bands of 350 nm and 449 nm for ZnO-Ag NCs. Polydispersed ZnO-Ag NCs, ZnONPs and AgNPs were globular, rectangular and spherical shape and size of 26.02 +/- 1.6, 20.03 +/- 1.2 and 14.44 +/- 0.4 nm respectively, revealed by FESEM and TEM. Zeta potential and average hydrodynamic diameter size of ZnO-Ag NCs were-25.5 mV and 57.14 +/- 2.82 nm respectively. The antibacterial activity (well diffusion method) of ZnO-Ag NCs were exhibited strong inhibition of Escherichia coli MTCC 43 (52.6 +/- 0.08 mm) and Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 439 (36.1 +/- 0.3 mm) growth among other tested, when compared with ZnONPs and AgNPs at a concentration of 10 mu g/mL. Anticancer activity (MTT assay) of ZnO-Ag NCs showed significant cell death (99.1 +/- 0.9%) with an IC50 value 15 +/- 1.1 mu g/mL against oral squamous cell carcinoma (CAL 27) cell lines after 48 h of incubation. ZnO-Ag NCs arrested cell cycle progression in G2/M phase, potentially leading to the induction of apoptosis revealed by annexin-V/PI assay. These results suggest that ZnO-Ag NCs could be used as antimicrobial agents, human carcinoma treatments and also merit future biomedicine and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Epirubicin is widely used anthracycline to treat various human malignancies. However, dose limiting therapeutic efficacy, cardiac toxicity, and drug resistance are major concerns associated with the Epirubicin treatment for cancer therapy. In the present study, we synthesized a series of novel Pluronic (R) modified PLA based hybrid block copolymers comprising PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG-PLA and mPEG-PLA block copolymers. Nanoparticles prepared with these block copolymers were evaluated for the encapsulation of Epirubicin with an aim to reduce its toxicity and enhance anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy. Epi-NPs were showed an average diameter of 102 +/- 3 nm, and encapsulation efficiency of 94 +/- 2 %. The in-vitro drug release profile of Epi-NPs exhibited slow and sustained release in PBS (pH-7.4). In-vitro cytotoxicity studies of Epi-NPs demonstrated the efficient growth inhibition of breast cancer cell lines. Twice a week treatment of EAC syngeneic breast cancer tumor bearing Balb/c mice with commercially available Epirubicin and Epi-NPs at a dose of 3 mg/kg showed tumor growth inhibition of -62 % and -80%, respectively. In contrast, the 6 mg/kg dosing of Epi-NPs resulted in complete tumor eradication. These findings demonstrate that the synthesized Pluronic (R) modified PLA based block copolymer NPs can effi-ciently deliver Epirubicin with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity.

AB  - Aims: Mental disorders characterized by preoccupation with distressing bodily symptoms and associated func-tional impairment have been a target of major reconceptualization in the ICD-11, in which a single category of Bodily Distress Disorder (BDD) with different levels of severity replaces most of the Somatoform Disorders in ICD-10. This study compared the accuracy of clinicians' diagnosis of disorders of somatic symptoms using either the ICD-11 or ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines in an online study. Methods: Clinically active members of the World Health Organization's Global Clinical Practice Network (N = 1065) participating in English, Spanish, or Japanese were randomly assigned to apply ICD-11 or ICD-10 diag-nostic guidelines to one of nine pairs of standardized case vignettes. The accuracy of the clinicians' diagnoses as well as their ratings of the guidelines' clinical utility were assessed. Results: Overall, clinicians were more accurate using ICD-11 compared to ICD-10 for every presentation of a vignette characterized primarily by bodily symptoms associated with distress and impairment. Clinicians who made a diagnosis of BDD using ICD-11 were generally correct in applying the severity specifiers for the condition. Limitations: This sample may represent some self-selection bias and thus may not generalize to all clinicians. Additionally, diagnostic decisions with live patients may lead to different results. Conclusions: The ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for BDD represent an improvement over those for Somatoform Disorders in ICD-10 in regard to clinicians' diagnostic accuracy and perceived clinical utility.

AB  - Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. The multi-omic data has revolutionized the methodology to unravel molecular heterogeneity in breast cancer. As genetic variations captured from Copy Number Variation (CNV) data are considered the most stable amongst the multi-omic data, it leads to robust biomarkers. Thus, this paper targets the discovery of a set of CNV biomarkers for dissecting this heterogeneity. The existing algorithms yield biomarkers, too huge to be interpreted clinically. So, in this paper, we have proposed XAI-CNVMarker-an explainable AI-based post-hoc biomarker discovery framework to discover a small set of interpretable biomarkers. We exploit the power of deep learning to build DLmodel-a deep learning model for breast cancer classification. Subsequently, the trained model is analyzed using different explainable AI methods to arrive at a set of 44 CNV biomarkers. Using 5-fold cross-validation, we obtained a classification accuracy of 0.712 (+/- 0.048) at a 95% confidence interval. Gene set analysis revealed 37 subtype-specific enriched Reactome and Kegg pathways, 21 druggable genes, and 13 biomarkers linked with the prognostic outcome. Finally, we validated the efficacy of the identified biomarkers on METABRIC. Thus, the proposed framework demonstrates the role of explainable AI in discovering clinically reliable biomarkers.

AB  - The automatic segmentation of blood vessels in fundus images can help analyze the condition of retinal vasculature, which is crucial for identifying various systemic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, etc. Despite the success of Deep Learning-based models in this segmentation task, most of them are heavily parametrized and thus have limited use in practical applications. This paper proposes IterMiUnet, a new lightweight convolution-based segmentation model that requires significantly fewer parameters and yet delivers performance similar to existing models. The model makes use of the excellent segmentation capabilities of Iternet (Li et al (2020)) architecture but overcomes its heavily parametrized nature by incorporating the encoder-decoder structure of MiUnet (Hu et al. (2019) IEEE Access 7:174167-174177) model within it. Thus, the new model reduces parameters without any compromise with the network's depth, which is necessary to learn abstract hierarchical concepts in deep models. This lightweight segmentation model speeds up training and inference time and is potentially helpful in the medical domain where data is scarce and, therefore, heavily parametrized models tend to overfit. The proposed model was evaluated on three publicly available datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1. Further cross-training and inter-rater variability evaluations have also been performed. The proposed model has a lot of potential to be utilized as a tool for the early diagnosis of many diseases.

AB  - Elastography has emerged as one of the most promising non-invasive clinical tools. In elastography, a stiffness map or elastogram is generated by solving an inverse problem of elasticity utilizing the tissue motion data acquired using magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. Among various inverse algorithms devoted to elastography, non-linear inversion coupled with the finite element method has demonstrated excellent applicability in extracting complex physics of the tissue. The development and implementation of such an inverse algorithm are challenging and often unavailable to clinicians. In the present work, we offer an open -source parallel MATLAB implementation of an efficient non-linear inversion algorithm based on the finite element method for different isotropic material models, viz., linear elastic and viscoelastic materials in the regime of compressible and nearly incompressible materials. Additionally, the framework has been extended to account for anisotropy by assuming transversely isotropic material. For the optimization module, the gradient of the objective function to the model parameters has been computed using the Adjoint method. Different case studies involving smooth variations and piece-wise discontinuities in the material property distribution are explored, and the efficacy of the inversion algorithm in reconstructing the stiffness map is discussed. In addition, noise is added to the synthetic data to depict a realistic setup, i.e., to prevent inverse crimes, and enhance the numerical stability and robustness of the current implementation. The present framework with general-purpose computer implementation could be beneficial for academic and clinical uses and may aid researchers in strengthening their existing frameworks and developing new algorithmic ideas.

AB  - Isolated extramedullary relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the breast is extremely rare. We herein report a case of a 38-year-old female with B cell ALL, who had isolated extramedullary relapse initially in the left breast and subsequently in the right breast, 3 and 4 years, respectively, after hematopoietic allogenic stem cell transplantation. She was successfully salvaged with bilateral whole breast radiotherapy, 24 Gy/12 fractions/2.5 weeks. This brief report highlights the importance of awareness of extramedullary leukemic relapse in the breast as one of the differential diagnoses of breast masses in the context of ALL. Since these tumors are extremely radioresponsive, radiation therapy is a safe and effective treatment option for isolated extramedullary relapse of ALL in the breast.

AB  - IntroductionCurrently, there are no guidelines for the management of B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) from an Indian perspective. The diagnostic workup, monitoring, and treatment of B-ALL vary among different physicians and institutes. ObjectiveTo develop evidence-based practical consensus recommendations for the management of B-ALL in Indian settings. MethodsModified Delphi consensus methodology was considered to arrive at a consensus. An expert scientific committee of 15 experts from India constituted the panel. Clinically relevant questions belonging to three major domains were drafted for presentation and discussion: (i) diagnosis and risk assignment; (ii) frontline treatment; and (iii) choice of therapy (optimal vs. real-world practice) in relapsed/refractory (R/R) settings. The questionnaire was shared with the panel members through an online survey platform. The level of consensus was categorized into high (>= 80%), moderate (60%-79%), and no consensus (< 60%). The process involved 2 rounds of discussion and 3 rounds of Delphi survey. The questions that received near or no consensus were discussed during virtual meetings (Delphi rounds 1 and 2). The final draft of the consensus was emailed to the panel for final review. ResultsExperts recommended morphologic assessment of peripheral blood or bone marrow, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and conventional cytogenetic analysis in the initial diagnostic workup. Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-based protocol is the preferred frontline therapy in pediatric and adolescent and young adult patients with B-ALL. BFM/German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-based regimen is suggested in adult patients with B-ALL. Immunotherapy (blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamicin) followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the optimal choice of therapy that would yield the best outcomes if offered in the first salvage in patients with R/R B-ALL. In patients with financial constraints or prior allo-HCT (real-world practice) at first relapse, standard-intensive chemotherapy followed by allo-HCT may be considered. For subsequent relapses, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy or palliative care was suggested as the optimal choice of therapy. ConclusionThis expert consensus will offer guidance to oncologists/clinicians on the management of B-ALL in Indian settings.

AB  - For patients with celiac disease (CeD), a lifelong gluten-free diet is not a voluntary lifestyle choice-it is a necessity. The key end points in clinical follow-up are symptom resolution, the normalization of weight, prevention of overweight, seroconversion, and negation or minimization of increased long-term morbidity. For the latter, a surrogate endpoint is mucosal healing, which means the normalization of histology to Marsh 0-1. Ideally, celiac follow-up care includes a multidisciplinary approach, effective referral processes, improved access that leverages technological advances, and following guidelines with the identification of measurable quality indicators, ideally informed by evidence-based research. Face-to-face CeD care and telemedicine are considered the standards for this process, although published data are insufficient. Guidelines and statements on diagnosis are readily available. However, data are lacking on optimal clinic visit intervals and outcomes and quality indicators such as improvement of symptoms, function and quality of life, survival and disease control, and how to most effectively use healthcare resources. The results of future research should provide the basis for general recommendations for evidence-based standards of quality of care in CeD.

T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
KW  - TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY
KW  - MULTICENTER
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Traumatic acute subdural hematomas frequently warrant surgical evacuation by means of a craniotomy (bone flap replaced) or decompressive craniectomy (bone flap not replaced). Craniectomy may prevent intracranial hypertension, but whether it is associated with better outcomes is unclear.
   METHODS
   We conducted a trial in which patients undergoing surgery for traumatic acute subdural hematoma were randomly assigned to undergo craniotomy or decompressive craniectomy. An inclusion criterion was a bone flap with an anteroposterior diameter of 11 cm or more. The primary outcome was the rating on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) (an 8-point scale, ranging from death to "upper good recovery" [no injury-related problems]) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the GOSE rating at 6 months and quality of life as assessed by the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 5-Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).
   RESULTS
   A total of 228 patients were assigned to the craniotomy group and 222 to the decompressive craniectomy group. The median diameter of the bone flap was 13 cm (interquartile range, 12 to 14) in both groups. The common odds ratio for the differences across GOSE ratings at 12 months was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.18; P = 0.32). Results were similar at 6 months. At 12 months, death had occurred in 30.2% of the patients in the craniotomy group and in 32.2% of those in the craniectomy group; a vegetative state occurred in 2.3% and 2.8%, respectively, and a lower or upper good recovery occurred in 25.6% and 19.9%. EQ-5D-5L scores were similar in the two groups at 12 months. Additional cranial surgery within 2 weeks after randomization was performed in 14.6% of the craniotomy group and in 6.9% of the craniectomy group. Wound complications occurred in 3.9% of the craniotomy group and in 12.2% of the craniectomy group.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Among patients with traumatic acute subdural hematoma who underwent craniotomy or decompressive craniectomy, disability and quality-of-life outcomes were similar with the two approaches. Additional surgery was performed in a higher proportion of the craniotomy group, but more wound complications occurred in the craniectomy group.

AB  - The diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis (TB) remains a major challenge, hence the evaluation of new tools for improved diagnostics is urgently required. We investigated the serum metabolic profile of children with culture-confirmed intra-thoracic TB (ITTB) (n = 23) and compared it with those of non-TB controls (NTCs) (n = 13) using proton NMR spectroscopy-based targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches. In targeted metabolic profiling, five metabolites (histidine, glycerophosphocholine, creatine/phosphocreatine, acetate, and choline) differentiated TB children from NTCs. Additionally, seven discriminatory metabolites (N-alpha-acetyl-lysine, polyunsaturated fatty acids, phenylalanine, lysine, lipids, glutamate + glutamine, and dimethylglycine) were identified in untargeted metabolic profiling. The pathway analysis revealed alterations in six metabolic pathways. The altered metabolites were associated with impaired protein synthesis, hindered anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective mechanisms, abnormalities in energy generation processes and membrane metabolism, and deregulated fatty acid and lipid metabolisms in children with ITTB. The diagnostic significance of the classification models obtained from significantly distinguishing metabolites showed sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 78.2%, 84.6%, and 0.86, respectively, in the targeted profiling and 92.3%, 100%, and 0.99, respectively, in the untargeted profiling. Our findings highlight detectable metabolic changes in childhood ITTB; however, further validation is warranted in a large cohort of the pediatric population.

AB  - Objective. The recent trend favors the open reduction and internal fixation of condylar fractures to prevent long-term consequen-ces. Nonendoscopic intraoral approach is an option for management without a visible scar. The purpose of this systematic review was to explore the evidence, armamentarium, methods of reduction and fixation, challenges, and complications.Study Design. We have systematically reviewed published articles on the intraoral approach for condylar fracture management following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and Cochrane library database, to find relevant articles from January 1980 to March 2022. Descriptive statistics were applied to obtain the results.Results. Finally, 23 studies were included. The incision described for the intraoral approach was similar to sagittal split osteotomy in all studies. A wide array of specialized instruments, methods, and challenges has been outlined for visualization, reduction, and fixation. The incidence of complications in the entire review was 23% (72/306).Conclusion. The challenges encountered in the nonendoscopic intraoral approach for condylar fracture management can be negated with the use of specialized instruments and with experience. However, further research is warranted for a specialized set of miniature instruments to ease the procedure, make it time-efficient and optimize hardware selection.

AB  - Breast cancer-a heterogeneous disease marked with a high mortality rate, necessitates early diagnosis and treatment. The availability of multi-omic data has revolutionized our understanding of how molecular changes mark the variations in different breast cancer subtypes. Epigenomic changes in the form of DNA methylation differentially impact the expression level of the genes that play a vital role in the onset and spread of these subtypes. So, in this paper, we study the role of these variations in distinguishing between the various breast cancer subtypes. The cardinality of the existing biomarker sets is often too large to be interpreted clinically, and their relevance in classification remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a two-stage XAI-MethylMarker-an explainable AI-based biomarker discovery framework applied to DNA methylation data to arrive at a small set of biomarkers for breast cancer classification. In the first stage, we build a deep-learning network MethylNet that employs an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a feed-forward neural network to classify breast cancer subtypes. In the second stage, we propose a biomarker discovery algorithm, MethylBDA, which employs different explainable techniques for analyzing MethylNet model and discovers a small set of 52 biomarkers. Using 5-fold cross-validation, we achieved a classification accuracy of 0.8145 +/- 0.07 at a 95% confidence interval. To establish the clinical relevance of the discovered biomarkers, we performed a gene set analysis that revealed 14 druggable genes, nine genes linked to prognostic outcomes, and several enriched pathways are known to be significantly associated with distinct breast cancer subtypes.

AB  - Leprosy is a chronic bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy patients have been found to have defects in T cells activation, which is critical to the clearance of the bacilli. Treg cell suppression is mediated by inhibitory cytokines such as IL10, IL-35 and TGF-beta and its frequency is higher in leprosy patients. Activation and overexpression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is considered to one of the pathways to inhibit T-cell response in human leprosy. In the current study we address the effect of PD-1 on Tregs function and its immuno-suppressive function in leprosy patients. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the expression of PD-1 and its ligands on various immune cells T cells, B cells, Tregs and monocytes. We observed higher expression of PD-1 on Tregs is associated with lower production of IL-10 in leprosy patients. PD-1 ligands on T cells, B cells, Tregs and monocytes found to be higher in the leprosy patients as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, in vitro blocking of PD-1 restores the Tregs mediated suppression of Teff and increase secretion of immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. Moreover, overexpression of PD-1 positively correlates with disease severity as well as Bacteriological Index (BI) among leprosy patients. Collectively, our data suggested that PD-1 overexpression on various immune cells is associated with disease severity in human leprosy. Manipulation and inhibition of PD-1 signaling pathway on Tregs alter and restore the Treg cell suppression activity in leprosy patients.

AB  - Synthesis of a new class of heterocyclic hybrid embedding spirooxindole, pyrrolidine and chromanone structural moieties was achieved in excellent yield using an intermolecular [3+2]-cycloaddition cascade reaction protocol. The synthesized spiropyrrolidines were unambiguously determined by spectroscopic analysis and the stereo-and regiochemistry of the cycloadducts were undoubtably assigned by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Structural features of the compounds were examined by using X-ray crystallographic studies. The molecular packing was defined by Hirshfeld surface analysis. Furthermore, the structure and reactivity of the synthesized dispiropyrrolidines were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

AB  - BackgroundProton pump inhibitors (PPI) may impact the absorption of vitamin B12. We performed a systematic review to ascertain if PPI use increases risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.MethodsElectronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus) were searched on first of September 2022. We selected studies that compared the frequency of vitamin B12 deficiency in PPI users and non-users. Pooled Odds Ratio (OR) was calculated for the occurrence of vitamin B12 deficiency in PPI users compared to non-users. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale.ResultsTwenty-five studies were included. The pooled OR of vitamin B12 deficiency among PPI users (2852 participants) was higher than non-users (28070 participants) (OR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.16-1.73; I-2 = 54%). Overall risk of PPI use among vitamin B12 deficient individuals was higher than those without deficiency (OR 1.49, 1.20-1.85; I-2 = 68%). Most studies found no difference between serum vitamin B12 levels among PPI users compared to non-users.ConclusionAlthough the pooled OR of vitamin B12 deficiency was slightly increased in PPI users, but there was significant heterogeneity, and the pooled OR was too low to imply an association clearly. Better-designed prospective studies in long-term users may clarify the issue.RegistrationThis study was not registered on PROSPERO

KW  - RAM phenotype
AB  - Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RAM immunophenotype is a distinct subtype of AML, as described by the Children's Oncology Group (COG), with characteristic morphological and immunophenotypic properties. It is characterized by strong CD56 expression with dim to negative CD45, HLA-DR, and CD38 expression. It is an aggressive leukemia with a poor response to induction chemotherapy and/or frequent relapses.Methods: Seven cases with the characteristic RAM immunophenotype were identified in this retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed pediatric AML cases from January 2019 to December 2021. Herein, we have critically analyzed their clinical, morphological, cytochemical, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic, and molecular profiles. The patients were traced and followed for their current disease and treatment status.Results: Of 302 cases of pediatric AML (age <18 years), seven cases (2.3%) with the distinct RAM phenotype were observed, with age ranging from 9 months to 5 years. Two patients were misdiagnosed earlier as small round cell tumor because of the strong CD56 positivity and the absence of leukocyte common antigen (LCA), but they were later correctly identified as granulocytic sarcoma. The bone marrow aspirate showed blasts with unusual cohesiveness and clumping with nuclear moulding, mimicking non-hematologic malignancies. Flow cytometry revealed blasts with low side scatter, dim to negative CD45 and CD38, negative cMPO, CD36, and CD11b; moderate to bright CD33, CD117, and bright CD56. The Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD13 expression was significantly lower as compared to the internal controls. Cytogenetic and molecular studies did not show any recurrent abnormalities. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion was performed in 5/7 cases, with one positive result. On clinical follow-up, two patients were refractory to chemotherapy. Six of the seven cases had succumbed to death (duration of survival: 3-343 days after initial diagnosis).Conclusion: AML with RAM immunophenotype, a distinct form of pediatric AML with a poor prognosis, may pose a diagnostic challenge if presented as a soft tissue mass. A comprehensive immunophenotypic evaluation, including stem cell and myeloid markers, is critical for an accurate diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma with the RAM-immunophenotype. Our data demonstrated weak CD13 expression as an additional immunophenotypic finding.

AB  - Respiratory illnesses are common causes of morbidity and mortality in children. Postgraduates in Pediatrics spent significant time in learning to manage respiratory disorders. Improved survival of preterm neonates, improved diagnosis and survival of chronic respiratory problems, and advances in diagnosis and therapeutics have increased the need for specialists trained in managing these patients. Training programs in Pediatric Pulmonology are evolving over the past few decades. In India, super-specialty training in Pediatric Pulmonology has grown over the past few years. There is a need to modify the training structure used in industrialized countries due to differences in patient population, priorities, and limited available resources and expertise. Formal training courses have been started in a limited number of institutions. There is a large gap between the need for a trained workforce and the available specialists in the limited number of institutions. The Indian Academy of Pediatrics National Respiratory Chapter (IAPNRC) has initiated a fellowship program to bridge the gap. Comprehensive training involving academic and hands-on training may go a long way to improve the care of children with acute and chronic respiratory problems. For sustainable development of the super specialty, there is a need to work towards creating Pediatric Pulmonology service departments in various institutions that may be responsible for comprehensive training and research activities to answer common research questions.

AB  - Non-hypotensive hypovolemia simulated with oscillatory lower body negative pressure in the range of -10 to -20 mmHg is associated with vasoconstriction {increase in total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR)}. Due to the mechanical stiffening of vessels, there is a disjuncture of mechano-neural coupling at the level of arterial baroreceptors which has not been investigated. The study was designed to quantify both the cardiac and vascular arms of the baroreflex using an approach based on Wiener-Granger causality (WGC) - partial directed coherence (PDC). Thirty-three healthy human volunteers were recruited and continuous heart rate and blood pressure {systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP)} were recorded. The measurements were taken in resting state, at -10 mmHg (level 1) and -15 mmHg (level 2). Spectral causality - PDC was estimated from the MVAR model in the low-frequency band using the GMAC MatLab toolbox. PDC from SBP and MBP to RR interval and TPVR was calculated. The PDC from MBP to RR interval showed no significant change at -10 mmHg and -15 mmHg. No significant change in PDC from MBP to TPVR at -10 mmHg and -15 mmHg was observed. Similar results were obtained for PDC estimation using SBP as input. However, a significant increase in TPVR from baseline at both levels of oscillatory LBNP (p-value <0.001). No statistically significant change in PDC from blood pressure to RR interval and blood pressure to TPVR implies that vasoconstriction is not associated with activation of the arterial baroreflex in <=-15 mmHg LBNP. Thereby, indicating the role of cardiopulmonary reflexes during the low level of LBNP simulated non-hypotensive hypovolemia.

AB  - ObjectivesTo assess the outcome of leukocyte-platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) on the rate of maxillary canine retraction and its correlation with the levels of Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and RANKL:OPG in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) during comprehensive orthodontic treatment.Subjects and methodsEighteen females who required all 1st premolars extraction for the correction of their class I bimaxillary protrusion malocclusions were included. The L-PRF plugs were placed in the experimental side 1st premolar extraction sockets. Canine retraction was performed by sliding mechanics. Canine retraction was assessed from the maxillary study models prepared just before the extraction (T-0) and then at 1 week (T-1), 2 weeks (T-2), 4 weeks (T-3), and 8 weeks (T-4) after the 1st premolar extraction and placement of L-PRF plugs. The concentrations of RANKL and OPG in the GCF were evaluated at T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3, and T-4.ResultsIn experimental sides, the amount of canine retraction was statistically more during the T-0-T-1, T-1-T-2, and T-2-T-3 periods. The mean concentration of RANKL at T-1, T-2, and T-3 was significantly more in the experimental sides. The mean concentration of OPG was significantly less in the experimental sides at T-2, T-3, and T-4. The RANKL:OPG was significantly more in the experimental sides at T-1, T-2, T-3, and T-4. No significant correlation was found between amount of canine retraction and concentration of RANKL and OPG and RANKL to OPG ratio in GCF.ConclusionsThe L-PRF accelerated the rate of maxillary canine retraction by 0.28 mm over an 8-week period. The L-PRF favored the local osteoclastogenesis by enhancing the RANKL and suppressing the OPG concentrations. There was no significant correlation between the rate of maxillary canine retraction and expression of RANKL, OPG, and RANKL:OPG in GCF.

AB  - ContextLate-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) is a simple and reliable screening test for Cushing syndrome (CS). With improved analytical performance of the current second-generation electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Elecsys Cortisol-II; Roche Diagnostics), there is a need to revisit the LNSC cut-offs, especially in a South-Asian population. ObjectiveTo derive LNSC cut-offs for diagnosis of CS using second-generation ECLIA kits. DesignDiagnostic accuracy study. MethodsWe prospectively recruited 155 controls aged 18-60 years, including, normal-weight (body mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m(2) and no hypertension or diabetes [n = 53]) and overweight/obese (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2) and hypertension and/or diabetes [n = 52] or BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) with/without comorbidities [n = 50]) participants. All participants submitted LNSC samples collected at home; overweight/obese controls additionally underwent dexamethasone suppression test to exclude CS. We also reviewed records of adults with endogenous CS (cases, n = 92) and a valid LNSC result using the same method. ResultsThe 95th percentile for LNSC in controls was 6.76 nmol/L. The mean +/- SD LNSC levels were 40.47 +/- 49.63 nmol/L in cases and 3.37 +/- 1.18 nmol/L in controls (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed excellent diagnostic performance of LNSC for CS, with area under curves (AUCs) of 0.994 (cases vs. all controls) and 0.993 (cases vs. overweight/obese controls), respectively. The best diagnostic performance was achieved at cut-offs >= 6.73 nmol/L (sensitivity: 97.8%, specificity: 94.8%) and >= 7.26 nmol/L (sensitivity: 97.8%, specificity: 95.1%), respectively. ConclusionsLNSC measured using second-generation ECLIA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for CS. Based on this study, we propose a LNSC cutoff >= 6.73 nmol/L to diagnose CS.

AB  - Background: Presently, varied case reports demonstrated an increase or decrease in blood concentration of diverse conventional drugs, often co-administered with edible fruits, spices, or vegetables. The overarching aim of this research is to elucidate the fluctuations in tacrolimus (TAC) blood concentration on the consumption of pomegranate rind extract (PRE).
   Methods: A pharmacokinetic (PK) study was conducted with two groups, vis-a-vis PRE + TAC (3 mg/kg) and TAC (3 mg/kg) alone groups. An experimental study was conducted in three different manners: Single-dose (S) PRE (200 mg/kg), 7-day repetitive (7-R) PRE (200 mg/kg) dosing, and multiple (M) PRE doses (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg). All the blood samples (approximately 300 mu l) were drawn at different time intervals, i.e., 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after oral administration of TAC (3 mg/kg). The estimation of TAC in rat plasma was done using the hyphenated technique LC-MS/MS where the mass spectrometer used was a triple-stage quadrupole in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.
   Results: The findings depict that in comparison with the TAC (3 mg/kg) alone group with the 7-day repetitive (7-R) PRE (200 mg/kg) dosing, the Cmax was found to be 9.03 +/- 1.21 ng/ml; AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC0-infinity), 61.91 +/- 17.37 ngh/ml, while the TAC (3 mg/kg) + PRE group exhibited an increase in PK parameters of TAC (Cmax 22.48 +/- 3.07 ng/ml; AUC0-infinity 153.08 +/- 13.24 ng h/ml). The authors further investigated in what manner the PRE affects the PK of TAC in animals. For this, docking studies with major phytoconstituents present in the PRE with CYP3A4 isoenzyme were carried out. Ellagitannins (dock score, -11.64) and punicalagin (dock score, -10.68) were again used for molecular simulation studies with TAC. To validate our findings, a CYP3A4 inhibitory in vitro assay was conducted.
   Conclusion: Based on the integrated in vivo and in silico studies, we concluded that pomegranate rind extract interacts strongly with CYP isoenzyme and is therefore responsible for the altered PK profile of TAC.

AB  - Ipsilateral hemi facial spasm, trigeminal autonomic orofacial pain and occipital neuralgia may occur due to close proximity of V and VII nerves in pons and inter-neuronal interconnections of trigeminocervical complex. In this report, we describe management of a patient with long standing untreated left hemi facial spasm of ten years with contralateral trigeminal autonomic orofacial pain and occipital neuralgia present for last five years. Repeated intramuscular injections of Botulinum neurotoxin A were given for hemi facial spasm which completely resolved the twitches for 5-8 months with decreased baseline twitches noted before next cycle of injections. Addition of Botulinum neurotoxin A in nerve block injections for occipital neuralgia resulted in prolonged relief of five months and decreased baseline pain scores. Addition of Botulinum neurotoxin A to nerve block injections for trigeminal autonomic orofacial pain decreased autonomic features and baseline pain scores.

AB  - Introduction: Sympathetic Crashing Acute Pulmonary Edema (SCAPE) lies on the end of the acute heart failure syndrome spectrumwith pulmonary edema in all lung zones. NTG at lower doses (10-20 mu g/min) cause preload reduction, and at higher doses (> 100 mu g/min) causes after-load reduction by arterial dilatation. The main aim is to decrease the afterload at the earliest to cut the vicious cycle caused by sudden sympathetic upsurge. To our knowledge, this is the highest nitroglycerin dose usage in the literature. Case: A 60-year-old male with no known prior co-morbidities presented to our Emergency with complaints of acute onset severe shortness of breath, which was also associated with extreme diaphoresis, agitation, anxiety, and palpitations. On Examination, the patient was hypoxic and hypertensive with severe tachypnea and tachycardia. On Auscultation, diffuse bilateral crackles in all areas were heard. Point of care ultrasound showed bilateral B-profile in all lung zones, inferior vena cava was >50% collapsible. We managed the patient with non-invasive ventilation and ultrahigh dose nitroglycerin/ highest ever- 9 mg intravenous bolus with 76 mg infusion. The patient had improved within hours and did not require oxygen. The patient was discharged from the emergency after a few hours of observation. Discussion: SCAPE occurs due to a vicious spiral involving increasing sympathetic outflow, excessive afterload, and worsening heart failure. The central, defining pathophysiological feature of SCAPE is pathologically elevated afterload due to systemic vasoconstriction and hypertension. SCAPE patients may be euvolemic, hypovolemic or hypervolemic. The problem is shift of fluid into the lungs rather than hypervolemia. The emphasis on treating pulmonary edema has shifted from diuretics to vasodilators, especially high- dose nitrates, combined with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Conclusion: This is the first report describing the safe and effective administration of ultra-high dose bolus/ highest dose ever and prolonged high-dose infusion for SCAPE, along with Non-invasive ventilation, which has prevented mechanical ventilation and mortality. High doses of intravenous NTG are extremely effective and safe for SCAPE patients. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To observe the clinical and angiographic effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as induction and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV). In this open-label prospective study done at a tertiary care neurology centre, adult patients with PCNSV, diagnosed by Calabrese's criteria, were recruited from 2017 to 2021 and treated with glucocorticoids, MMF and standard of care. Patients were followed-up and clinical and angiographic changes were recorded. Total 26 patients were recruited with median age 39 years (34-49) with a slight female predilection (61.5%). Angiographic diagnoses were: small vessels disease 11.5%; large vessels disease 42.3% and both in 46.2%. Median duration of follow-up was 24.5 months (14.25-38). Proportion of patients with severe disability (modified Rankin Score (mRS) 4-6) at baseline was 73.08% (19/26) which reduced to 7.69% (2/26) (p < 0.001). At the last follow-up mRS = 0 was achieved in 38.5% (10/26) and mRS of <= 1 was achieved in 69.2% (18/26). Median time to achieve a mRS <= 1 was 12 months (95% CI: 6.8-17.2). Angiography was repeated in 16 patients after a median duration of 13 months (10.5-19.7), out of which 10 (62.5%) showed improvement and 5 (31.2%) showed non-progression of lesions. MMF may be an effective immunosuppressive therapy in adult PCNSV as both induction and maintenance. Serial DSA of brain may be useful to monitor the effect of treatment.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a haemodynamic manifestation of cardiorespiratory and non-cardiorespiratory pathologies. Cardiorespiratory pathologies account for nearly three-fourths of patients with PH. It is now increasingly being recognised due to routine requests for transthoracic echocardio-graphic examination in the perioperative setting in patients undergoing intermediate-to high-risk non -cardiac surgery. The increased risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality attributed to PH have been widely acknowledged in the literature. The importance of PH in perioperative decision-making and postoperative outcomes has had little mention in all the guidelines. Understanding the complexity of the pathophysiology of PH may help in anaesthetic and surgical decision-making. Preoperative evaluation and risk assessment are guided by the nature, extent, invasiveness, and duration of surgery. Surgical decision -making and anaesthetic management involve preoperative risk stratification, understanding the in-teractions between surgical procedures and PH, and understanding the interactions between anaesthetic procedures, PH, and cardiopulmonary interactions. Intraoperative and postoperative monitoring is crucial for maintaining the haemodynamic parameters and helps titrate anaesthetic agents and medication. This narrative review focusses on all issues related to anaesthetic and surgical challenges in patients with PH. This review aimed to suggest a preoperative evaluation plan, surgical decision-making, anaesthetic plan, and anaesthetic management based on the evidence available in the literature.

AB  - BackgroundOccupational exposure to toluene causes serious health problems ranging from drowsiness to lethal diseases such as cancer. Paint workers are exposed to toluene through inhalation or the dermal route, which can induce genetcic damage. The increased DNA damage could be linked to genetic polymorphism. Therefore, we evaluated the association of glutathione-S-transferase polymorphism with DNA damage in paint workers.MethodsFirst, we included skilled paint workers (n = 30) as exposed and healthy individuals (n = 30) as control belonging to the same socio-economic strata. The genotoxicity biomarkers, Cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN), and single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE)/Comet assay were used to assess genotoxicity while Multiplex-PCR and PCR-RFLP were used to assess polymorphism in glutathione-s-transferase (GST) genes. Using linear curve regression analysis, we assessed the association between genetic damage and polymorphism in the glutathione-s-transferase (GST) gene in the exposed and control subjects.ResultsA significantly higher frequency of CBMN (4.43 +/- 1.50) and tail moment (TM) (11.23 +/- 1.0) respectively in paint workers as compared to the control(1.50 +/- 0.86 and (0.54 +/- 0.37) underlined significantly high genetic damage in paint workers.Regression curve analysis reveals that polymorphism in the GST gene is significantly associated with higher MN and TM in paint workers.ConclusionOverall, our study provides a strong rationale for identifying a clear association between glutathione-S-transferase polymorphism and genetic damage in paint workers.

AB  - Cervical cancer has killed millions of women over the past decade. In 2019 the World Health Organization launched the Cervical Cancer Elimination Strategy, which included ambitious targets for vaccination, screening, and treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted progress on the strategy, but lessons learned during the pandemic - especially in vaccination, self-administered testing, and coordinated mobilization on a global scale - may help with efforts to achieve its targets. However, we must also learn from the failure of the COVID-19 response to include adequate representation of global voices. Efforts to eliminate cervical cancer will only succeed if those countries most affected are involved from the very start of planning. In this article we summarize innovations and highlight missed opportunities in the COVID response, and make recommendations to leverage the COVID experience to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer globally.

AB  - BackgroundUrinary tract infection (UTI) in children is a common bacterial infection. The emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) poses a major challenge against the treatment of uropathogens. We aimed to characterize the E. coli isolates recovered from children with UTI for their resistance profile and circulating sequence types (ST).MethodsChildren (> 1.5-18 years of age) from different community health centres of India with symptoms of UTI were enrolled. Isolates causing significant bacteriuria were identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by the automated system, VITEK-2 (Biomeriux, Durhum, US). Nineteen E. coli isolates (15 ESBL positive and 4 ESBL negative) were sequenced in Oxford Nanopore platform followed by core-genome phylogeny, accessory genome cluster analysis, identification of sequence types, mobile genetic elements, genetic antimicrobial resistance markers. The correlation between detection of antimicrobial resistance genes with phenotypic resistance profiles was also investigated.ResultsEleven percent of children had significant bacteriuria [male:female-1:1, > 50% were 11-18 years of age group]. E. coli was predominant (86%) followed by K. pneumoniae (11%). Susceptibility of E. coli was highest against fosfomycin (100%) followed by carbapenems (90.7%) and nitrofurantoin (88.8%). ST131 (15.8%) and ST167 (10.5%) found as high-risk clones with the presence of plasmid [IncFIB (63.1%), IncFIA (52.6%)], and composite transposon [Tn2680 (46.6%)] in many isolates. Few isolates coharboured multiple beta-lactamases including bla(NDM-5) (33.3%), bla(OXA-1) (53.3%), bla(CTX-M-15) (60%) and bla(TEM-4) (60%).ConclusionsThis study highlights horizontal transmission of resistance genes and plasmids in paediatric patients at community centers across the nation harbouring multidrug-resistant genes such as bla(NDM-5) and bla(CTX-M-15) associated with high-risk clones ST131 and ST167. The data is alarming and emphasizes the need for rapid identification of resistance markers to reduce the spread in community. To our knowledge, this is the first multicentric study targeting paediatric UTI patients from the community setting of India.

AB  - We draw the attention of readers and governments to the death rate from coronavirus disease 2019 in Japan, continuing as a fraction of that experienced by many other developed nations. We think this is due to the activity of the powerful, protective lactoperoxidase system (LPO) which prevents serious airborne infections. The LPO system requires iodine, which is liberally provided by the typical Japanese diet but lacking in many others. One might consider the Japanese experience an incredibly large, open-label study exhibiting the preventative power of a high-iodine diet. We predict this favourable trend will continue for Japan because deadly variants of the severe, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will be with us, forever.

AB  - Interleukin-12 (IL-12) demonstrates potent anti-tumor activity by enhancing Th1/Th2 response, facilitating cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) recruitment into tumors, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, and depleting immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite having encouraging preclinical and some clinical results, further development of IL-12 is limited because dose-limiting toxicity is observed in early clinical trials with systemic administration of recombinant human IL-12. Hence, strategies aiming to lower the toxicity and to improve response rates are unmet needs. In this study, IL-12 was encapsulated in extracellular vesicles derived from mature dendritic cells (DEVs) activated with tumor antigens. IL-12-encapsulated DEVs (DEV-IL) delayed the growth of murine glioblastoma by facilitating the recruitment of CD8 T-cells, NK-cells, and DCs and effectively depleting immunosuppressive cells in the TME. DEV-IL shifted the Th1/Th2 ratio toward dominating Th1 cytokines which further led to the inhibition of angiogenesis. In addition, DEV-IL also modulated systemic immunity by enhancing CTL activity and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the spleen. Interestingly, DEV-IL did not impart hepatic and immunotoxicity which was observed with free IL-12 administration. Hence, our study established DEV-IL as a potent platform for the sustained delivery of cytokines and could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.

AB  - IntroductionMohalla Clinics have been set up to provide curative care for minor ailments free of cost within walking distance in the urban slums, thus making primary care more accessible and affordable. Studies evaluating patient satisfaction with treatment of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, in these clinics are lacking. MethodsA survey of 400 type 2 diabetes patients was conducted, split equally between Mohalla clinics (MC) and Private clinics (PC) in Delhi. Responses were analyzed using STATA17, applying appropriate statistical tests for the data type (Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, or two-sample t test). ResultsSatisfaction level was high in both groups with no significant difference between mean satisfaction scores of MC patients and PC patients (Mean 3.79 vs. 3.85 respectively, p = 0.4). However, MC patients reported a significant improvement in their satisfaction score after switching to MC (Mean 3.79 vs. 3.3 for the previous facility, p < 0.05). Physician interaction with the patients was the most important factor in influencing the satisfaction score. Proximity to the clinic was the second most important factor for MC patients but was not as important for PC patients. Surprisingly, treatment success was considered an important factor for satisfaction level by < 10% MC and < 20% PC patients only, pointing to the need for patient education across both the groups. None of the MC patients mentioned free treatment as a contributory factor to high satisfaction, perhaps because most shifted from a government setup to MC. PC patients had more frequent follow-up visits and blood glucose monitoring, and longer consultation duration compared to MC patients, which were offset by access factors, thus not causing much difference to the satisfaction score between the two groups. ConclusionMohalla clinics are making diabetes treatment accessible and affordable for the marginalized population of Delhi, despite not being designed or fully equipped to care for chronic diseases such as diabetes that require multi-specialty care to monitor and manage multiple co-morbidities and long-term complications. Positive perception of physician interaction and convenient location of the clinics are the two major contributors to the high satisfaction patients expressed with diabetes care at these clinics.

AB  - We report clinical and molecular features of Indian patients with BCR:ABL1 negative MPNs. A relatively lower symptom burden at diagnosis, younger age of onset and low burden of thrombosis indicates a comparatively indolent presentation. Several novel mutations on 1 of the largest NGS datasets in Indian patients are also reported. A summary of recommended considerations for clinical practice is provided. Introduction: We report one of the largest single center data from a mixed referral setting in India describing baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with classical BCR::ABL1 negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed from June 2019 to 2022 were included. Workup and treatment was as per current guidelines. Results: Diagnosis comprised polycythemia vera (PV) in 51(49%), ET in 33(31.7%) and prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (MF) pre fibrotic myelofibrosis (prePMF) and myelofibrosis in 10(9.6%) patients each. Median age at diagnosis was 52 years for PV and ET, 65.5 for MF and 79 years for prePMF. Diagnosis was incidental in 63(56.7%) and after thrombosis in 8(7.2%) patients. Baseline next generation sequencing (NGS) was available for 63(60.5%) patients. Driver mutations in PV: JAK2 in 80.3%; in ET: JAK2 in 41%, CALR in 26%, MPL in 2.9%; in prePMF JAK2 in 70%, CALR in 20%, MPL in 10%, and in MF: JAK2 in 10%, MPL in 30% and CALR in 40%. Seven novel mutations were detected of which 5 were potentially pathogenic on computational analysis. After median follow up of 30 months, 2 patients had disease transformation and none had new episodes of thrombosis. Ten patients died, most commonly with cardiovascular events(n = 5,50%). Median overall survival was not reached. Mean OS time was 10.19 years(95%CI, 8.6 to 11.74) and mean time to transformation was 12.2 years(95% CI,11.8 to 12.6). Conclusion: Our data indicates comparatively indolent presentation of MPNs in India with younger age and lower risk of thrombosis. Further follow up will enable correlation with molecular data and guide modification of age based risk stratification models.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in European ancestry (EA) have identified hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with general cognitive function and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between these SNPs and cognitive function has not been fully evaluated in populations with complex genetic substructure such as South Asians. This study investigated whether SNPs identified in EA GWAS, either individually or as polygenic risk scores (PRSs), were associated with general cognitive function and 5 broad cognitive domains in 932 South Asians from the Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD). We found that SNPs identified from AD GWAS were more strongly associated with cognitive function in LASI-DAD than those from a GWAS of general cognitive function. PRSs for general cognitive function and AD explained up to 1.1% of the variability in LASI-DAD cognitive domain scores. Our study represents an important stepping stone toward better characterization of the genetic architecture of cognitive aging in the Indian/South Asian population and highlights the need for further research that may lead to the identification of new variants unique to this population.

AB  - Objective: To compare the perspective of healthcare providers (orthodontists), cleft patients and laypersons in judging nasolabial aesthetics in patients with complete unilateral cleft lip, with or without cleft palate (UCL +/- P) using 2 scoring systems.
   Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care government hospital.
   Patients: Photographic records of 100 patients with complete UCL +/- P from the age group of 5-18 years (mean age-12.2 +/- 3.93 years) were included in this study.
   Method: Photographic records of 100 patients with complete UCL +/- P from the age group of 5-18 years were included. A panel of 3 orthodontists, 3 laypersons and 3 cleft patients rated nasolabial aesthetics using 2 scoring systems i.e. Asher-McDade index (AMAI) and Cleft Aesthetic Rating Scale (CARS). Spearman's split-half reliability, Intra-class correlation coefficient and Cronbach's alpha were computed to measure internal consistency and reliability. Inter-panel agreement between pair of groups was determined by means of Spearman correlation coefficient.
   Results: Estimated reliability of CARS for 3 raters in each panel was in moderate agreement for orthodontists and cleft patients (0.849 and 0.810). Good repeatability and agreement were recorded with moderate to high intra-panel reliability for all parameters of both AMAI and CARS. Overall inter-panel agreement was moderate for both AMAI and CARS. Pair -wise inter-panel agreement showed a moderately positive correlation in both scales (AMAI and CARS) by cleft patients and professionals.
   Conclusion: CARS index can be reliably used for assessment of nasolabial aesthetics by cleft patients, professionals and lay persons on 2D facial photographs. Patients were more critical than clinicians and laypersons using both indices (CARS and AMAI) as they are more self-aware and conscious. Thus, a clear communication between clinician and patient regarding expectations, perception and satisfaction with surgical results is strongly recommended.

AB  - Background: Sorafenib is currently one of the recommended treatments for symptomatic patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF). In this study, we aim to assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib in DTF patients.Methodology: Patients aged > 18 years with a histological diagnosis of DTF and who have received sorafenib were enroled in this prospective observational study. Demographic data, clinical profile, the initial dose of sorafenib, treatment-related toxicities, dose modifications, and responses were recorded. The primary objective was to assess the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary objectives were to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), toler-ability, and adverse effects of sorafenib. Response assessment was based on response eva-luation criteria in solid tumours 1.1 criteria. Adverse effects were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 criteria. Time to event was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and survival was compared by log-rank test. Univariate and multivariable cox regression analysis were used to find in-dependent predictors of relapse.Results: A total of 104 patients were enroled in the study. The median age of the study population was 32 (range, 18-81) years, and 66.35% of patients were females. On response assessment, ORR was 46.1% and stable disease was observed in 31.7% patients. ORR was higher in the appendicular site (51.7%) compared to the abdominal site (27.2%). PFS at 1 and 2 years was 86.6% (79.6-92.7%) and 73.7% (62.4-82.8%), respectively. Two-thirds (66.6%) of patients had already received some form of treatment. At the time of analysis, 70 (67.3%) patients were continuing sorafenib. Only 4.8% stopped sorafenib due to progression, 10.5% due to intolerable adverse effects, and 17.3% due to other reasons. The common treatment-related toxicities were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) (89.4%), fatigue (79.8%), alopecia (70.1%), and diarrhoea (48.0%). In the patients with a starting dose of >= 400 mg (48.0% of patients), discontinuation was necessitated in 12% of patients, and further dose reduction was required in 58%, while only about 13% required dose reduction or discontinuation at a starting dose of 200 mg (51.9% of patients). Responses were not compromised due to lower starting doses.Conclusions: Sorafenib has good activity in DTF, but it is associated with significant toxicity. The adverse effect profile is distinct in Indian patients with higher HFSR and alopecia. Due to the high rate of dose reduction/discontinuation with a starting dose of 400 mg, a starting dose of 200 mg may be recommended in Indian patients.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Global Diabetes Compact is a WHO-driven initiative uniting stakeholders around goals of reducing diabetes risk and ensuring that people with diabetes have equitable access to comprehensive, affordable care and prevention. In this report we describe the development and scientific basis for key health metrics, coverage, and treatment targets accompanying the Compact. We considered metrics across four domains: factors at a structural, system, or policy level; processes of care; behaviours and biomarkers such as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c); and health events and outcomes; and three risk tiers (diagnosed diabetes, high risk, or whole population), and reviewed and prioritised them according to their health importance, modifiability, data availability, and global inequality. We reviewed the global distribution of each metric to set targets for future attainment. This process led to five core national metrics and target levels for UN member states: (1) of all people with diabetes, at least 80% have been clinically diagnosed; and, for people with diagnosed diabetes, (2) 80% have HbA1c concentrations below 8 center dot 0% (63 center dot 9 mmol/mol); (3) 80% have blood pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg; (4) at least 60% of people 40 years or older are receiving therapy with statins; and (5) each person with type 1 diabetes has continuous access to insulin, blood glucose meters, and test strips. We also propose several complementary metrics that currently have limited global coverage, but warrant scale-up in population-based surveillance systems. These include estimation of cause-specific mortality, and incidence of end-stage kidney disease, lower-extremity amputations, and incidence of diabetes. Primary prevention of diabetes and integrated care to prevent long-term complications remain important areas for the development of new metrics and targets. These metrics and targets are intended to drive multisectoral action applied to individuals, health systems, policies, and national health-care access to achieve the goals of the Global Diabetes Compact. Although ambitious, their achievement can result in broad health benefits for people with diabetes.

AB  - Background and aims: A limited number of safe and effective preventive options for oral mucositis (OM) are available. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zinc in preventing OM in children with cancer receiving intensified chemotherapy.Methods; Children aged 3-18 years were randomized to receive oral zinc at 1 mg/kg/dose daily for 14 days or a placebo at the same doses and schedule. The primary outcome of this study was to determine the effect of oral zinc in the prevention of OM, and secondary outcomes included any adverse effect of oral zinc, the severity and duration of OM, and the need for hospitalizations.Results: A total of 90 children were randomized to either the oral zinc (n = 44) or placebo group (n = 46). The incidence of OM in the zinc group was 20.5%, while that in the placebo group was 19.6% (p = .91; risk ratio: 1.04, 95% CI 0.45-2.30). There were no significant adverse events of the drug observed. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the severity (p = .79), the mean time of onset (p = .09), the mean duration of OM (p = .18), and the need for hospitalizations (p = 1.0).Conclusions: Among children on cancer chemotherapy, there was no decrease in the incidence of OM observed with oral zinc at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day. No significant adverse events were observed with administering oral zinc. Further research is warranted to test higher doses of oral zinc with longer duration for a clinically significant effect.

AB  - The world has witnessed of many pandemic waves of SARS-CoV-2. However, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has now declined but the novel variant and responsible cases has been observed globally. Most of the world population has received the vaccinations, but the immune response against COVID-19 is not long-lasting, which may cause new outbreaks. A highly efficient pharmaceutical molecule is desperately needed in these circumstances. In the present study, a potent natural compound that could inhibit the 3CL protease protein of SARS-CoV-2 was found with computationally intensive search. This research approach is based on physics-based principles and a machine-learning approach. Deep learning design was applied to the library of natural compounds to rank the potential candidates. This procedure screened 32,484 compounds, and the top five hits based on estimated pIC(50) were selected for molecular docking and modeling. This work identified two hit compounds, CMP4 and CMP2, which exhibited strong interaction with the 3CL protease using molecular docking and simulation. These two compounds demonstrated potential interaction with the catalytic residues His41 and Cys154 of the 3CL protease. Their calculated binding free energies to MMGBSA were compared to those of the native 3CL protease inhibitor. Using steered molecular dynamics, the dissociation strength of these complexes was sequentially determined. In conclusion, CMP4 demonstrated strong comparative performance with native inhibitors and was identified as a promising hit candidate. This compound can be applied in-vitro experiment for the validation of its inhibitory activity. Additionally, these methods can be used to identify new binding sites on the enzyme and to design new compounds that target these sites.

AB  - The journey into the field of stem cell biology has been an endeavor of paramount advancement in biomedicine, establishing new horizons in the avenue of materiobiology. The creative drive of the scientific community focuses on ameliorating the utilization of stem cells, which is currently untapped on a large scale. With similar motivation, we present a nascent strategy of maneuvering biogenic carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to eclipse the toxic hurdles of chemical synthesis of carbon allotropes to serve as a biocompatible trident in stem cell biology employing a three-prong action of stem cell differentiation, imaging, and migration. The derivation of CQDs from garlic peels as a biogenic precursor abets in realizing the optophysical features of CQDs to image mesenchymal stem cells without hampering the biological systems with cytotoxicity. We report the versatility of biogenic CQDs to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to robustly influence stem cell migration and concomitantly chondrocyte differentiation from human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs). This was orchestrated without the use of chondrogenic induction factors, which was confirmed from the expression of chondrogenic markers (Col II, Col X, ACAN). Even the collagen content of cells incubated with CQDs was quite comparable with that of chondrocyte-induced cells. Thus, we empirically propose garlic peel-derived CQDs as a tangible advancement in stem cell biology from a materiobiological frame of reference to hone significant development in this arena.

AB  - Background: It has been a matter of debate for long time about the existence of two distinct phenotypes of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) predisposed to either renal or skeletal manifestation.Objective: To differentiate characteristics of symptomatic PHPT patients based on the presence of skeletal or renal involvement.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of data from the Indian PHPT registry.Patients: PHPT patients were divided into four discrete groups: asymptomatic, presenting with renal manifestations alone, skeletal manifestations alone, and both skeletal and renal manifestations.
   Measurements: Clinical, biochemical, and tumour weight and histopathological characteristics of these groups were compared.
   Results: Of the 229 eligible patients, 45 were asymptomatic, 62 had renal manifestations, 55 had skeletal manifestations, and 67 had both skeletal and renal manifestations. Patients with both skeletal and renal manifestations had higher serum calcium levels than those with isolated skeletal involvement [12.5 (11.1-13.7) mg/dL, 11.2 (10.6-12.3) mg/dL, respectively; p < .05]. Serum alkaline phosphatase (AP), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and parathyroid tumour weight were significantly higher in patients with isolated skeletal, and both skeletal and renal manifestations, compared to the other two groups. A preoperative PTH and AP level of 300 pg/mL and 152 U/L, predicted the risk of developing skeletal involvement with sensitivity and specificity of 71%, 70%, and 69%, 67%, respectively.
   Conclusions: We observed distinct skeletal and renal phenotypic subgroups among PHPT patients with characteristic biochemical and hormonal patterns with higher parathyroid disease burden in patients with skeletal complications compared to those with isolated renal manifestation.

T2  - ORAL SURGERY ORAL MEDICINE ORAL PATHOLOGY ORAL RADIOLOGY
KW  - OSTEONECROSIS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and spread with new variants of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe, as well as bring to clinical attention several post-COVID conditions. We reporta post-COVID condition observed at our tertiary care center: sponta-neous de novo development of steroid induced avascular necrosis in patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19 fol-lowing high dose steroid usage in a short span of time. Pre-COVID published literature indicates that these lesions were seen very rarely in the jaws and were related to long-term usage of steroids and recent tooth extraction. They were considered under the broad spectrum of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws. Present authors believe that the post-COVID-19 steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the jaws isa distinct new entity. It is analogous to the avascular necrosis noticed in the femoral head of indi-viduals recuperating from COVID-19, a condition conventionally known to be strongly associated with steroid therapy. Rapid progression, associated morbidity and mortality, and its possible differential diagnosis require pathologists to be vigilant regarding the chance encounter of such cases in jaws. Further reporting of such cases is required to gain additional insight into its features. (Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol 2023;135:e89-e93)

AB  - BackgroundWell-defined quality metrics were studied at this high-volume tertiary care academic oncology centre to evaluate surgical quality and outcomes. MethodsA prospective cohort of 691 patients undergoing major surgeries for all cancers was observed between 1 September 2018 and 30 August 2019 and predefined quality indicators in three categories: namely, optimal hospital resource utilisation, quality of surgery and perioperative outcomes were recorded during their admission period. Surgical procedures were divided into group I versus group II involving simple/moderate complexity versus high complexity procedures for analysis done using appropriate tests in STATA v14.0. FindingsThere were 373 versus 318 patients in group I versus group II with a mean of 48 years of age and 459 (66.43%) being females. Mean BMI was 24.58 kg/m(2), haemoglobin 12.12 g/dL and mean serum albumin of 4.25 g (SD +/- 0.6). A total of 667(96.53%) patients had an Eastern Co-Operative Oncology Group performance score of 1 with 271 (39.22%) having comorbidities and 195 (28.22%) having tobacco/alcohol addictions. A total of 393 (56.87%) patients underwent prehabilitation. 83% of patients belonged to lower-middle socioeconomic status and 32% of patients had some prior surgical intervention. Neoadjuvant therapy was administered in 44.5% versus 37.42%, mean preoperative hospital stay was 3.65 versus 6.16 days whereas postoperative was 2.6 versus 6.09 days with total stay being 6.27 versus 12.21 days, mean surgical duration was 132 versus 268 min with mean blood loss of 100 versus 245 mL (group I vs. group II, respectively). Intraoperative events, namely, unexpected bleeding and hypotension occurred in 144 (20.84%) patients while packed red blood cells and/or fresh frozen plasma transfusion was required in 56 (8.1%) patients. 40% of patients needed intensive care unit care postoperatively with 45 (6.51%) patients having some event (hypotension, sepsis, acute kidney injury, etc.). A total of 29 (<4%) patients had >= grade 3 surgical complications while >= grade 2 medical complications occurred in 6.43% versus 12.58% of patients (group I vs. group II). A total of 90 (13.02%) patients were readmitted, 15 (2.17%) re-explored and 5 (0.72%) patients died. ConclusionOptimal surgical outcomes in this study compared to international standards underpin the need for well-defined multidisciplinary perioperative pathways to be followed for each organ system and this framework can be adopted by other cancer centres in LMIC to achieve good surgical outcomes.

AB  - In spite of the higher nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, emerging drug resistance is a leading cause of increased mortality and morbidity associated with the overuse of antimicrobials. It is an emergent need to find out new molecules to combat such infections. In the present study, we analyzed the antibacterial effect of pimozide (PMZ) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, including methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus. The growth of MSSA and MRSA was completely inhibited at concentrations of 12.5 and 100 mu g/mL, respectively, which is referred to as 1x minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The cell viability was completely eliminated within 90 min of PMZ treatment (2x MIC) through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated killing without affecting cell membrane permeability. It suppressed alpha-hemolysin production and biofilm formation of different S. aureus strains by almost 50% at 1x MIC concentration, and was found to detach matured biofilm. PMZ treatment effectively eliminates S. aureus infection in Caenorhabditis elegans and improves its survival by 90% and is found safe to use with no hemolytic effect on human and chicken blood tissues. Taken together, it is concluded that PMZ may turn out to be an effective antibacterial for treating bacterial infections including MSSA and MRSA.

AB  - The circulating cell-free nucleic acids (ccfNAs) consist of a heterogenous cocktail of both single (ssNA) and double-stranded (dsNA) nucleic acids. These ccfNAs are secreted into the blood circulation by both healthy and malignant cells via various mechanisms including apoptosis, necrosis, and active secretion. The major source of ccfNAs are the cells of hematopoietic system under healthy conditions. These ccfNAs include fragmented circulating cell free DNA (ccfDNA), coding or messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and mitochondrial DNA/RNA (mtDNA and mtRNA), that serve as prospective biomarkers in assessment of various clinical conditions. For, e.g., free fetal DNA and RNA migrate into the maternal plasma, whereas circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has clinical relevance in diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic targeting, and disease progression monitoring to improve precision medicine in cancer. The epigenetic modifications of ccfDNA as well as circulating cell-free RNA (ccfRNA) such as miRNA and lncRNA show disease-related variations and hold potential as epigenetic biomarkers. The messenger RNA present in the circulation or the circulating cell free mRNA (ccf-mRNA) and long non-coding RNA (ccf-lncRNA) have gradually become substantial in liquid biopsy by acting as effective biomarkers to assess various aspects of disease diagnosis and prognosis. Conversely, the simultaneous characterization of coding and non-coding RNAs in human biofluids still poses a significant hurdle. Moreover, a comprehensive assessment of ccfRNA that may reflect the tumor microenvironment is being explored. In this review, we focus on the novel approaches for exploring ccfDNA and ccfRNAs, specifically ccf-mRNA as biomarkers in clinical diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Integrating the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for cancer genotyping in conjunction with ccfRNA both quantitatively and qualitatively, may potentially hold immense promise towards precision medicine. The current challenges and future directions in deciphering the complexity of cancer networks based on the dynamic state of ccfNAs will be discussed.

AB  - Exosomal cargo secreted from cancer cells has been associated with the development and progression of the tumour. Enriching clinically relevant tissue-specific exosomes may assist in the focused analysis of RNA molecules packaged during cancer. Therefore, this study utilized a rapid immunomagnetic enrichment approach for targeted isolation of lung cancer cell-derived exosomes from human plasma, followed by analysing their cargo RNA using high throughput sequencing. The total RNA purified from these immunomagnetically enriched exosomes provided adequate RNA quality for characterization through the Illumina platform. Differential expression analysis was performed between patients and healthy controls to study the altered exosomal RNA profile during lung cancer. Further, functional enrichment analysis was performed with the list of identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 1383 mRNAs and 64 lncRNA were identified as differentially expressed between patient plasma exosomes than healthy controls (fold change > 2, P < 0.05). Kyoto encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly associated with cancer-related pathways, purine metabolism, calcium, and cGMP-PKG signalling pathways. In conclusion, the presented approach successfully demonstrated a novel strategy for focused disease-specific transcriptome analysis, which provides a feasible option for identifying disease-specific exosome biomarkers for detecting non-small lung cancer.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is effective in reducing CRC related mortality. Current screening methods include endoscopy based and biomarker based approaches. This guideline is a joint official statement of the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) and the Asian Pacific Society of Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE), developed in response to the increasing use of, and accumulating supportive evidence for the role of, non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC and its precursor lesions. A systematic review of 678 publications and a two stage Delphi consensus process involving 16 clinicians in various disciplines was undertaken to develop 32 evidence based and expert opinion based recommendations for the use of faecal immunochemical tests, faecal based tumour biomarkers or microbial biomarkers, and blood based tumour biomarkers for the detection of CRC and adenoma. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided on indications, patient selection and strengths and limitations of each screening tool. Future research to inform clinical applications are discussed alongside objective measurement of research priorities. This joint APAGE-APSDE practice guideline is intended to provide an up-to-date guide to assist clinicians worldwide in utilising non-invasive biomarkers for CRC screening; it has particular salience for clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region.

AB  - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with 3-weekly cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) has been the standard of care for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer (LA-HNC) with level I evidence. While the outcomes in terms of efficacy have been well established, the toxicity profile, compliance, and real-world applicability has been an area of ongoing concern for this regimen, leading the oncologists to explore weekly cisplatin chemoradiotherapy regimen to potentially address the issue. A review of literature was conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, and Medline to compare and evaluate the present role of weekly cisplatin chemotherapy along with radiotherapy versus 3-weekly cisplatin chemotherapy along with radiotherapy in both adjuvant and definitive settings for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers. Nasopharyngeal subsites were excluded from the literature review and 50 relevant articles were included in the analysis. Recently published evidences of noninferiority of weekly over 3-weekly cisplatin chemoradiotherapy regimen in definitive as well as adjuvant settings in locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers is highlighted and interpreted. Results supporting and against the above in different publications is elaborated in this article. Trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of the weekly cisplatin chemoradiotherapy regimen over 3-weekly regimen, especially in definitive setting may conclude the debate in future. A lacunae in the existing literature is noted in the form of lack of superiority trials on the above topic, which may impact future conclusions.

AB  - Wrist cut exsanguination is usually suicidal, but it can also be accidental. The lack of recognition of homicide wrist cut as a differential diagnosis is exemplified by its rarity. Authors present two cases of homicide wrist cut with strikingly similar attributes. Fatal head injuries were concomitantly present in both of them. There was usage of a characteristic bondage to incapacitate the victim in one of them. These wrists-cut murders imply the involvement of a specific criminal psyche that has yet to be discovered in literature. The presence of typical features of suicide wrist cut was another highlight of these murders. The personal and demographic details of the two victims also matched to some extent. The report outlines a method for distinguishing homicidal wrist cuts from suicidal and accidental wrist cuts. It will be of an exclusive help to deduce manner in isolated, fatal and nonfatal wrist cuts. Authors aim to initiate growth of literature on homicide wrist cut/s which is otherwise nonexistent for them being rare entity/s. Similar fatalities have not been reported to the best claim of the authors.

AB  - Objectives SLE is associated with significant mortality, and data from South Asia is limited. Thus, we analysed the causes and predictors of mortality and hierarchical cluster-based survival in the Indian SLE Inception cohort for Research (INSPIRE). Methods Data for patients with SLE was extracted from the INSPIRE database. Univariate analyses of associations between mortality and a number of disease variables were conducted. Agglomerative unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was undertaken using 25 variables defining the SLE phenotype. Survival rates across clusters were assessed using non-adjusted and adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models. Results Among 2072 patients (with a median follow-up of 18 months), there were 170 deaths (49.2 deaths per 1000 patient-years) of which cause could be determined in 155 patients. 47.1% occurred in the first 6 months. Most of the mortality (n = 87) were due to SLE disease activity followed by coexisting disease activity and infection (n = 24), infections (n = 23), and 21 to other causes. Among the deaths in which infection played a role, 24 had pneumonia. Clustering identified four clusters, and the mean survival estimates were 39.26, 39.78, 37.69 and 35.86 months in clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (P < 0.001). The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) were significant for cluster 4 [2.19 (1.44, 3.31)], low socio-economic-status [1.69 (1.22, 2.35)], number of BILAG-A [1.5 (1.29, 1.73)] and BILAG-B [1.15 (1.01, 1.3)], and need for haemodialysis [4.63 (1.87,11.48)]. Conclusion SLE in India has high early mortality, and the majority of deaths occur outside the health-care setting. Clustering using the clinically relevant variables at baseline may help identify individuals at high risk of mortality in SLE, even after adjusting for high disease activity.

AB  - PurposeSystemic absorbtion of topically applied mitomycin C (MMC) during trabeculectomy needs to be evaluated to look for any systemic toxicity, which might be a major concern in certain conditions like pregnancy.MethodsAfter obtaining ethical committee clearance, female patients in the reproductive age group undergoing trabeculectomy with MMC were included. Pregnant/lactating patients, patients with any systemic illness were excluded. During trabeculectomy, 0.02% MMC was applied subconjunctivally for 2 min and then washed. Blood samples were withdrawn at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hrs after the surgery and analyzed of MMC levels using Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS).ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 29 +/- 12 years. MMC was not detected in any of the plasma samples analyzed as it was less than the detection limit (<1.56 ng/mL) of the employed LC-MS/MS assay.ConclusionIt can be deduced that the systemic absorption of MMC is negligible or the plasma concentration is less than 1.56 ng/ml (1000 times less than the concentration where systemic toxicity was not observed).

KW  - INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - Background Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is abnormal placental adhesion beyond superficial myometrium, which may lead to severe life-threatening hemorrhage requiring massive blood transfusions in the peripartum period. Prophylactic balloon catheterization of bilateral internal iliac arteries with or without additional embolization with Cesarean hysterectomy in patients with PAS prevent excessive intraoperative hemorrhage and may also obviate the need for hysterectomy. Purpose To study the efficacy of intervention radiological procedures in controlling intraoperative hemorrhage in patients with PAS. Material and Methods This ethically approved prospective study was conducted between November 2017 and October 2019 and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Consecutive patients diagnosed with PAS during the antepartum period were evaluated. A total of 18 patients with PAS underwent prophylactic balloon catheterization of the bilateral internal iliac arteries followed by delivery of the infant. Interventional and intraoperative data of these patients were collected and compared with retrospectively collected data of patients (control group) who underwent hysterectomy without prophylactic balloon occlusion over the past four years (January 2016-November 2019). Results Significantly lower intraoperative blood loss (2.8 L vs. 4.7 L; P = 0.048) and pure red blood cell (PRBC) requirement (P = 0.026) between patients who had hysterectomy with and without interventional radiological management was observed. Significantly higher blood loss (P = 0.006) and fluid requirement (P = 0.007) was observed with a higher degree of placental invasion. Only 1 (6%) major procedure-related complication was observed. Conclusion Interventional radiological procedures are effective in significantly reducing intraoperative blood loss and blood product requirement in patients with PAS.

AB  - Mycobacterium spp. intimidated mankind since time immemorial. The triumph over this organism was anticipated with the introduction of potent antimicrobials in the mid-20th century. However, the emergence of drug resistance in mycobacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in particular, caused great concern for the treatment. With the enemy growing stronger, there is an immediate need to equip the therapeutic arsenal with novel and potent chemotherapeutic agents. The task seems intricating as our understanding of the dynamic nature of the mycobacteria requires intense experimentation and research. Targeting the mycobacterial cell envelope appears promising, but its versatility allows it to escape the lethal effect of the molecules acting on it. The unique ability of hiding (inactivity during latency) also assists the bacterium to survive in a drug-rich environment. The drug delivery systems also require upgradation to allow better bioavailability and tolerance in patients. Although the resistance to the novel drugs is inevitable, our commitment to the research in this area will ensure the discovery of effective weapons against this formidable opponent.

AB  - ObjectiveTo summarize the available evidence and to quantitatively evaluate the global results of different waterproofing layers in substantiating the UCF repair.Material and methodsAfter defining the study protocol, the review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines by a team comprising experts in hypospadiology, systematic reviews and meta-analysis, epidemiology, biostatistics and data science. Studies published from 2000 onwards, reporting on the results of UCF closure after hypospadias repair were searched for on PUBMED, Embase and Google Scholar. Study quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Checklist (JBI) critical appraisal tool. The results with different techniques were compared with the two samples independent proportions test with the help of Microsoft Excel, MedCalc software and an online calculator.ResultsSeventy-three studies were shortlisted for the synthesis; the final analysis included 2886 patients (71 studies) with UCF repair failure in 539. A summary of various dimensions involved with the UCF repair has been generated including time gap after last surgery, stent-vs-no stent, supra-pubic catheterization, suture material, suturing technique, associated anomalies, complications, etc. The success rates associated with different techniques were calculated and compared: simple catheterization (100%), simple primary closure (73.2%), dartos (78.8%), double dartos flaps (81%), scrotal flaps (94.6%), tunica vaginalis (94.3%), PATIO repair (93.5%), biomaterials or dermal substitutes (92%), biocompatible adhesives (56.5%) and skin-based flaps (54.5%). Several techniques were identified as solitary publications and discussed.ConclusionsTunica vaginalis and scrotal flaps offer the best results after UCF closure in the synthesis. However, it is not possible to label any technique as ideal or perfect. Almost all popular waterproofing layers have depicted absolute (100%) success sometimes. There are a vast number of other factors (patient's local anatomy, surgeon's expertise and technical perspectives) which influence the final outcome.

AB  - Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) based dosimeters are garnering attention in the field of radiation dosimetry due to a number of benefits like portable equipment, easy and efficient excitation and read out pro-cess, re-readability of the dose etc.. Though varieties of fluoroperovskites have been studied as OSL materials, no research on LiMgF3 (Lithium Magnesium Fluoride) as an OSL material has yet been conducted. In the current work, LiF-MgF2 system with a low effective atomic number was synthesized using the high temperature solid state reaction approach and its OSL dosimetry properties were investigated. The prepared sample was thoroughly characterized by employing a variety of techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Micro-scopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-Vis (ultraviolet-visible) spectrophotometry. The structure of the sample was found to be polycrystalline with size in the micrometre range. OSL properties of LMF have been investigated for different doses of gamma and beta along with related OSL kinetic parameters. It exhibits good dose linearity under blue stimulation for gamma (100 mGy -700 Gy) and beta (30 mGy -5Gy) radiation. We have also investigated the reusability (3%), reproducibility (2-3%), and fading (45% in 40 days) of the phosphor. To check the viability of the sample in radiation dosimetry under medical treatment in radiotherapy, various dosimetric properties were studied in Linear Accelerator (LINAC) x-rays in MV energy range and Cobalt-60 gamma radiation. These studies include the response of the phosphor to various energies (called energy dependence), field size effect, the effect of the dose rate of the ra-diation beam, and relative depth dose response. The overall response of the phosphor (comparable with ion chamber in RT experiments) makes the material a potential candidate to be used as an OSL phosphor in medical radiation dosimetry.

AB  - Stem cell treatment is emerging as an appealing alternative for stroke patients, but there still needs to be an agreement on the protocols in place, including the route of administration. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the administration routes of stem cell treatment for ischemic stroke. A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. A total of 21 publications on stem cell therapy for ischemic stroke were included. Efficacy outcomes were measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and the Barthel index (BI). Intracerebral administration showed a better outcome than other routes, but a greater number of adverse events followed due to its invasiveness. Adverse events were shown to be related to the natural history of stroke not to the treatment. However, further investigation is required, since studies have yet to compare the different administration methods directly.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi with that of [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT in detecting primary and metastatic lesions of breast cancer. [F-18]F-FDG and [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans of histologically proven breast cancer patients were compared according to patient-based and lesion-based analysis. Forty-seven patients with a mean age of 44.8 +/- 9.9 years (range: 31-66 years) were evaluated. A total of 85% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, and 15% had invasive lobular carcinoma. The tracer uptake [SULpeak, SULavg, and the median tumor-to-background ratio (TBR)] was significantly higher in [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi than with [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT for lymph nodes, pleural metastases, and liver lesions (p < 0.05). However, for brain metastasis, only the median TBR was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to [F-18]F-FDG. In patient-based analysis the sensitivity of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT was higher, but not significant than that of [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of both primary tumors and metastatic lesions. According to lesion-based analysis, on diagnostic CT, 47 patients had 44 primary tumors, 248 lymph nodes, 15 pleural, 88 liver, and 42 brain metastases. [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi scan identified more abnormal lesions than [F-18]F-FDG in all the primary and metastatic sites with a maximum marked difference in the primary site [88.6% vs. 81.8%; p-0.001], lymph nodes [89.1% vs. 83.8%; p-0.0001], pleural metastases [93.3% vs. 73%; p-0.096] and brain metastasis [100% vs. 59.5%; p-0.0001].

AB  - Upper extremity motor impairment is the most common sequelae in patients with stroke. Moreover, its continual nature limits the optimal functioning of patients in the activities of daily living. Because of the intrinsic limitations in the conventional form of rehabilitation, the rehabilitation applications have been expanded to technology-driven solutions, such as Virtual Reality and Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). The motor relearning processes are influenced by variables, such as task specificity, motivation, and feedback provision, and a VR environment in the form of interactive games could provide novel and motivating customized training solutions for better post-stroke upper limb motor improvement. rTMS being a precise non-invasive brain stimulation method with good control of stimulation parameters, has the potential to facilitate neuroplasticity and hence a good recovery. Although several studies have discussed these forms of approaches and their underlying mechanisms, only a few of them have specifically summarized the synergistic applications of these paradigms. To bridge the gaps, this mini review presents recent research and focuses precisely on the applications of VR and rTMS in distal upper limb rehabilitation. It is anticipated that this article will provide a better representation of the role of VR and rTMS in distal joint upper limb rehabilitation in patients with stroke.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acid supplements in relieving dry eye symptoms and signs in symptomatic visual display terminal users (VDT). Methods: A randomized controlled study was done; eyes of 470 VDT users were randomized to receive four capsules twice daily for 6 months (O3FAgroup), each containing 180 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid. The O3FA group was compared with another group (n = 480) who received four capsules of a placebo (olive oil) twice daily. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. The primary outcome was improvement in omega-3 index (a measure of EPA and DHA ratio in RBC membrane). Secondary outcomes were improvement dry eye symptoms, Nelson grade on conjunctival impression cytology, Schirmer test values, tear film breakup time (TBUT), and tear film osmolarity. Means of groups (pre-treatment, 1, 3, and 6-months) were compared with repeated measure analysis of variance. Results: At baseline, 81% patients had low omega-3 index. In the O3FA group, a significant increase in omega-3 index, improvement in symptoms, reduction in tear film osmolarity, and increase in Schirmer, TBUT, and goblet cell density was observed. These changes were not significant in the placebo group. Improvement in test parameters was significantly (P < 0.001) better in patients with low omega3 index (<4%) subgroup. Conclusion: Dietary omega-3 fatty acids are effective for dry eye in VDT users; omega-3 index appears to be the predictor to identify potential dry eye patients who are likely to benefit from oral omega-3 dietary intervention.

AB  - Background of the Study: Lupus is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple body systems and requires long-term treatment. The multisystem effect of this disease and long treatment may cause anxiety and depression in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) and ultimately deteriorate their quality of life and also affects the activity of the disease.
   Aim of the Study: This study aims to assess anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with LN and their relationship with disease activity.
   Material and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to assess anxiety, depression, and quality of life among patients with LN. A total enumerative technique was used for the recruitment of 100 patients and data collected using standardized tools were analyzed.
   Results: The results of the study showed that the majority of patients (60.0%) with LN had moderate anxiety and most of them (61.0%) had moderate depression that affected their quality of life and impacted the disease activity index in lupus.
   Conclusion: LN patients experience significant levels of anxiety and depression, which deteriorates their quality of life and negatively impacts disease activity. Active surveillance for these conditions and early diagnosis might help in the improvement of health-related outcomes in such patients.

AB  - Worldwide there is increased shift towards usage of traditional medicine in patients of chronic diseases like Cardio Vascular Disorders. In India, these medicines are used concurrently. Objective of the study was to ascertain prevalence and effect of concurrent traditional drug therapy with standard pharmacotherapy in patients with CVD. The present study used a cross sectional study design to assess the prevalence and a prospective cohort design to assess the effect of concurrent Ayurvedic medicines with standard pharmacotherapy in terms of quality of life. After screening 600 patients, 128 were found taking such medicines. Out of these, 100 were recruited as cases (Group-I), while 100 who were matched in terms of age, body mass index, ejection fraction, and receiving standard therapy only were recruited as controls (Group-II). Assessment parameters included demographic, biochemical, ejection fraction through echocardiography, distance covered in six Minute walk Test (6MWT), Quality of Life (QOL) through Kansas City Cardio-myopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) with follow up at 6 months. Prakriti as mentioned in Ayurveda was also assessed using a questionnaire. Both groups were comparable at base line. Total 87 in Group-I and 91 in Group-II completed the study. Further, 76% patients were diagnosed with heart failure (HF) and 24% with coronary artery disease (CAD). There was no change in distance covered in 6MWT in both HF or CAD groups. But there was improvement in all cases in domains of KCCQ and SAQ as compared to controls. To conclude, concurrent use of traditional medicine with standard conventional care in CVD may improve quality of life in cardiovascular disorders.

AB  - History A 10-year-old North Indian boy presented with swelling of multiple joints in his hands for the past 3 years. This swelling involved the small joints of his hands and some restriction of joint movement, without any associated tenderness or morning stiffness. No other joints were symptomatically involved. Prior to visiting our hospital, he had received disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs for suspected juvenile idiopathic arthritis, without any clinical benefit. On examination, the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints were nontender but had swelling and flexion deformities. He also had a short stature (below the third centile) for his age. Inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (7 mm per hour; normal range, 0-22 mm per hour) and C-reactive protein level (1.5 mg/L; normal level, <10 mg/L), were normal, and the rheumatoid factor test result was negative. A skeletal survey of the patient was performed and is shown in Figures 1-6.

TI  - Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis With Prolonged Primary Neurologic Presentation
T2  - PEDIATRICS
KW  - NERVOUS-SYSTEM VASCULITIS
AB  - Primary hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis (HLH) is a hyperinflammatory syndrome with devastating consequences. Multisystem involvement is a hallmark of HLH; however, HLH may rarely present with signs and symptoms isolated to the central nervous system (CNS). Within the brain, HLH can mimic demyelination, chronic infection, or vasculitis, leading to a diagnostic delay of months to years. We describe here a 7-year-old boy who presented with a history of prolonged fever and multiple focal neurologic deficits, which were being treated as CNS tuberculosis at the referring hospital. In view of the relapsing course with multiple areas of hemorrhagic tumefactive lesions on neuroimaging, the diagnosis was revised to acquired demyelination, and he received multiple cycles of immunotherapy. A brain biopsy was inconclusive. Subsequently, 13 months after disease onset, the child presented with features of systemic HLH in the form of fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, elevated ferritin, and triglycerides. Primary HLH was suspected, and genetic testing revealed a likely pathologic compound heterozygous variation in the PRF1 gene confirming the diagnosis. We planned a hematopoietic stem cell transplant as definitive therapy, but the child succumbed to an episode of sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. We infer from this case that primary HLH is a great mimicker. A high index of suspicion is required to establish a timely diagnosis. Primary HLH may stay isolated to CNS for months and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all refractory cases of demyelination.
   A 7-year-old boy was diagnosed with and treated for central nervous system tuberculosis and subsequently was thought to have a demyelination syndrome of unknown etiology. The enigma continued until a diagnosis of primary hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis was established.

AB  - Background: Subarachnoid block has been used for intracavitary radiotherapy (ICRT) for carcinoma cervix, but the literature on the appropriate dose of local anesthetic required to achieve the desired effect is lacking. We compared two different intrathecal doses of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (1.2 and 1.5 mL) for providing optimal surgical conditions and readiness to discharge in patients undergoing ICRT for carcinoma cervix.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective double-blind study was done in 80 patients undergoing ICRT. The patients were randomized into two groups (Groups I and II) to receive 1.2 and 1.5 mL of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine, respectively, for ICRT. The level of sensory achieved, the patient satisfaction score, radiation oncologist score, time to L5 regression, and time to motor recovery (walking unaided) were assessed. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were analyzed using SPSS 20 for Windows (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).
   Results: The time taken for the block to regress to L5 (Group I: 134.6 +/- 32.4 minutes vs. Group II: 143.2 +/- 43.0 minutes, P = 0.31) were comparable. However, the mean time for walking unaided (Group I: 220.87 +/- 47.12 minutes versus Group II: 247.00 +/- 49.83 minutes, P = 0.032) after the subarachnoid block was significantly less in Group I. The patient satisfaction with the procedure and overall satisfaction of the radiation oncologists regarding the operating condition were comparable in both the groups.
   Conclusions: Hence, a 1.2 mL dose of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine for ICRT provides optimal surgical conditions with hemodynamic stability and ensures the early discharge of the patient.

AB  - Herein, we report results of the studies relating to the development of an impedimetric, magnetic bead-assisted supersandwich DNA hybridization assay for ultrasensitive detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), gonorrhea. First, a conductive ink was formulated by homogenously dispersing carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) in a stable emulsion of terpineol and an aqueous suspension of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The ink, labeled C5, was coated onto paper substrates to fabricate C5@paper conductive electrodes. Thereafter, a magnetic bead (MB)-assisted supersandwich DNA hybridization assay was optimized against the porA pseudogene of N. gonorrhoeae. For this purpose, a pair of specific 5 ' aminated capture probes (SCP) and supersandwich detector probes (SDP) was designed, which allowed the enrichment of target gonorrheal DNA sequence from a milieu of substances. The SD probe was designed such that instead of 1:1 binding, it allowed the binding of more than one T strand, leading to a 'ladder-like' DNA supersandwich structure. The MB-assisted supersandwich assay was integrated into the C5@paper electrodes for electrochemical analysis. The C5@paper electrodes were found to be highly conductive by a four-probe conductivity method (maximum conductivity of 10.1 S center dot cm(-1)). Further, the biosensing assay displayed a wide linear range of 100 aM-100 nM (10(9) orders of magnitude) with an excellent sensitivity of 22.6 k omega center dot(log[concentration])(-1). The clinical applicability of the biosensing assay was assessed by detecting genomic DNA extracted from N. gonorrhoeae in the presence of DNA from different non-gonorrheal bacterial species. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a highly sensitive, cost-effective, and label-free paper-based device for STI diagnostics. The ink formulation prepared for the study was found to be highly thixotropic, which indicates that the paper electrodes can be screen-printed in a reproducible and scalable manner.

AB  - Purpose: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease that results in discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. A pilot study was undertaken to determine if there were any major substantial differences in the ocular microbiome in DED patients versus healthy controls. Methods: The bacterial communities residing in the conjunctiva of patients with DED (n = 4) and healthy controls (n = 4) were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of the V4-V5 region. Results: The phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were most dominant and accounted for 97% and 94.5% of all bacterial sequences in patients and controls, respectively. At the genus level, 27 bacterial genera were found with more than two-fold difference between patients and controls. Four of these - Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, and Pseudomonas spp. - dominated the ocular microbiome of all subjects, but were proportionately lower in DED (16.5%) compared to controls (37.7%). Several bacterial genera were found to be unique in DED (34) and controls (24). Conclusion: This pilot study is an attempt to profile the ocular microbiome in patients with DED that demonstrated a higher concentration of microbial DNA compared to controls, with Firmicutes phyla dominating the bacterial population in patients with DED.

AB  - Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of lower extremities comprises a clinical spectrum that extends from asymptomatic patients to critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients. 10% to 40% of the patients are at the risk of primary amputation. This study was planned in "no-option" patients of CLI due to atherosclerotic PAD to assess the efficacy and safety of pooled, allogeneic, adult human bone marrow- derived mesenchymal stromal cells which is already approved for marketing in India for CLI due to Buerger's disease.
   Methods This was a single-arm, multi-centric, phase III study where mesenchymal stromal cells was injected as 2 million cells/kg body weight in the calf muscle and around the ulcer. Twenty-four patients of lower extremity CLI due to PAD with Rutherford III-5 or III-6 and ankle-brachial pressure index <= 0.6 and having have at least one ulcer with area between 0.5 and 10 cm(2) were included in the study. These patients were evaluated over 12 months from drug administration.
   Results Over a period of 12 months, statistical significant reduction of rest pain and ulcer size along with improvement in ankle-brachial pressure index and ankle systolic was observed. The quality of life of patients improved together with increase in total walking distance and major amputation-free survival time.
   Conclusion Mesenchymal stromal cells may be a feasible option to treat "no-option" patients with atherosclerotic PAD.

AB  - Paratyphoid fever caused by S. Paratyphi A is endemic in parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The proportion of enteric fever cases caused by S. Paratyphi A has substantially increased, yet only limited data is available on the population structure and genetic diversity of this serovar. We examined the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary trajectory of S. Paratyphi A isolates collected as part of the Indian enteric fever surveillance study "Surveillance of Enteric Fever in India (SEFI)." In the study period (2017-2020), S. Paratyphi A comprised 17.6% (441/2503) of total enteric fever cases in India, with the isolates highly susceptible to all the major antibiotics used for treatment except fluoroquinolones. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the global S. Paratyphi A collection into seven lineages (A-G), and the present study isolates were distributed in lineages A, C and F. Our analysis highlights that the genome degradation events and gene acquisitions or losses are key molecular events in the evolution of new S. Paratyphi A lineages/sub-lineages. A total of 10 hypothetically disrupted coding sequences (HDCS) or pseudogenes-forming mutations possibly associated with the emergence of lineages were identified. The pan-genome analysis identified the insertion of P2/PSP3 phage and acquisition of IncX1 plasmid during the selection in 2.3.2/2.3.3 and 1.2.2 genotypes, respectively. We have identified six characteristic missense mutations associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis genes of S. Paratyphi A, however, these mutations confer only a low structural impact and possibly have minimal impact on vaccine effectiveness. Since S. Paratyphi A is human-restricted, high levels of genetic drift are not expected unless these bacteria transmit to naive hosts. However, public-health investigation and monitoring by means of genomic surveillance would be constantly needed to avoid S. Paratyphi A serovar becoming a public health threat similar to the S. Typhi of today.
   Author summarySalmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A remains one of the most common causes of enteric fever in the endemic regions of Asia. Within-host evolution of this human-restricted pathogen has led to the emergence of multiple lineages and sub-lineages through significant genomic rearrangement and pseudogene formation. Our study provides a snapshot overview of the gene flux and genome degradation events that shaped the evolution of S. Paratyphi A over the last 300 years. We leveraged the ongoing enteric fever surveillance program in India to collect 441 S. Paratyphi A clinical isolates, of which 152 were whole-genome sequenced. We carefully screened every internal node and cataloged mutations and gene flux at every stage of divergence/lineages throughout the phylogeny, revealing the role of key genetic changes in the evolutionary adaptation of S. Paratyphi A. Though several studies have previously reported the evolutionary trajectory of S. Paratyphi A, our study provides additional signatures with the most plausible evidence to date, backed by a molecular basis of adaptive mutations. The data from this study would merit further attention and interest in validating vaccines and developing novel diagnostics against S. Paratyphi A infections.

AB  - Aim:The aim of our study is to present our experience in the management and outcome of Wilms tumor with intracaval thrombus. Materials and Methods:All children with Wilms tumor with intracaval thrombus who presented to us from July 2000 to December 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. We evaluated the tumor stage, management, and outcomes in these patients. Results:Thirty-four patients were included in the study. The median age of presentation was 48 months (11 to 84 mo). Preoperative chemotherapy was given in 32 (94%), with a median duration of 8 weeks. Intracaval thrombus completely resolved in 9 (26%) children after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Surgical intervention for residual inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus was performed in 32 patients. The median follow-up was 30 months (5 to 150 mo). At the last follow-up, 24 patients (70%) were alive and disease free. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival were 67% (95% confidence interval, 50% to 84%) and 59% (95% confidence interval, 42% to 76%). The OS in children with nonmetastatic disease (94%) was significantly higher than those with metastases (29%; P<0.01). The OS in children with complete resolution of IVC thrombus (100%) was significantly higher than those with persistent thrombus (48%; P=0.025). Analysis of survival outcomes in children with nonmetastatic disease (stage III) revealed no significant difference on comparison with cohort with stage III disease with absence of IVC thrombus. The P-value was 0.224 and 0.53 for 5-year OS and event-free survival, respectively. Conclusion:The management of Wilms tumor can be complicated by the presence of caval thrombus. Patients with metastasis have a significantly poor outcome. Patients in whom, there is complete resolution of intracaval thrombus on neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a significantly higher OS.

AB  - Corneal perforations in eyes with dry eye disease (DED) are difficult to manage due to the interplay of several factors such as the unstable tear film, surface inflammation, and the underlying systemic disease affecting the wound healing process, and the eventual outcome. A careful preoperative examination is required to identify the underlying pathology, and status of ocular surface and adnexa, rule out microbial keratitis, and order appropriate systemic workup in addition to assessing the perforation itself. Several surgical options are available, which include tissue adhesives, multilayered amniotic membrane grafting (AMT), tenon patch graft (TPG), corneal patch graft (CPG), and penetrating keratoplasty (PK). The choice of procedure depends upon the size, location, and configuration of the perforation. In eyes with smaller perforations, tissue adhesives are effective treatment modalities, whereas AMT, TPG, and CPG are viable options in moderate-sized perforations. AMT and TPG are also preferable in cases where the placement of a bandage contact lens may be a challenge. Large perforations require a PK, with additional procedures such as tarsorrhaphy to protect the eyes from the associated epithelial healing issues. Conjunctival flaps are considered in eyes with poor visual potential. The management of the acute condition is carried out in conjunction with measures to improve the tear volume bearing in mind the chances of delayed epithelialization and re-perforation in these cases. Administration of topical and systemic immunosuppression, when indicated, helps improve the outcome. This review aims to facilitate clinicians in instituting a synchronized multifaceted therapy for the successful management of corneal perforations in the setting of DED.

TI  - Predictors of Mortality among Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 during the First Wave in India: A Multisite Case-Control Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
KW  - ILLNESS
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 6 million deaths globally. Understanding predictors of mortality will help in prioritizing patient care and preventive approaches. This was a multicentric, unmatched, hospital-based case-control study conducted in nine teaching hospitals in India. Cases were microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients who died in the hospital during the period of study and controls were microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients who were discharged from the same hospital after recovery. Cases were recruited sequentially from March 2020 until December-March 2021. All information regarding cases and controls was extracted retrospectively from the medical records of patients by trained physicians. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was done to assess the association between various predictor variables and deaths due to COVID-19. A total of 2,431 patients (1,137 cases and 1,294 controls) were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 52.8 years (SD: 16.5 years), and 32.1% were females. Breathlessness was the most common symptom at the time of admission (53.2%). Increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 46-59 years, 3.4 [95% CI: 1.5-7.7]; 60-74 years, 4.1 [95% CI: 1.7-9.5]; and $ 75 years, 11.0 [95% CI: 4.0-30.6]); preexisting diabetes mellitus (aOR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.2-2.9]); malignancy (aOR: 3.1 [95% CI: 1.3-7.8]); pulmonary tuberculosis (aOR: 3.3 [95% CI: 1.2-8.8]); breathlessness at the time of admission (aOR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.4-3.5]); high quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at the time of admission (aOR: 5.6 [95% CI: 2.7-11.4]); and oxygen saturation , 94% at the time of admission (aOR: 2.5 [95% CI: 1.6-3.9]) were associated with mortality due to COVID-19. These results can be used to prioritize patients who are at increased risk of death and to rationalize therapy to reduce mortality due to COVID-19.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis is often diagnosed in patients who are planning on having children. Although multiple sclerosis does not negatively influence most pregnancy outcomes, less is known regarding the effects of fetal exposure to novel disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The withdrawal of some DMTs during pregnancy can modify the natural history of multiple sclerosis, resulting in a substantial risk of pregnancy-related relapse and disability. Drug labels are typically restrictive and favour fetal safety over maternal safety. Emerging data reporting outcomes in neonates exposed to DMTs in utero and through breastfeeding will allow for more careful and individualised treatment decisions. This emerging research is particularly important to guide decision making in women with high disease activity or who are treated with DMTs associated with risk of discontinuation rebound. As increasing data are generated in this field, periodic updates will be required to provide the most up to date guidance on how best to achieve multiple sclerosis stability during pregnancy and post partum, balanced with fetal and newborn safety.

AB  - The synthesis of a novel carboxylate-type organic linker-based luminescent MOF (Zn(H2L) (L-1)) (named PUC2) (H2L = 2-aminoterephtalic acid, L-1 = 1-(3-aminopropyl) imidazole) is reported by the solvothermal method and comprehensively characterized using single-crystal XRD, PXRD, FTIR, TGA, XPS, FESEM, HRTEM, and BET. PUC2 selectively reacts with nitric oxide ((NO)-N-square) with a detection limit of 0.08 mu M, and a quenching constant (0.5 x 10(4) M-1) indicating a strong interaction with (NO)-N-square. PUC2 sensitivity remains unaffected by cellular proteins or biologically relevant metals (Cu2+/ Fe3+/Mg2+/ Na+/K+/Zn2+), RNS/ROS, or H2S to score (NO)-N-square in living cells. Lastly, we used PUC2 to demonstrate that H2S inhibition increases (NO)-N-square production by similar to 14-30% in various living cells while exogenous H2S suppresses (NO)-N-square production, indicating that the modulation of cellular (NO)-N-square production by H2S is rather generic and not restricted to a particular cell type. In conclusion, PUC2 can successfully detect (NO)-N-square production in living cells and environmental samples with considerable potential for its application in improving the understanding of the role of (NO)-N-square in biological samples and study the inter-relationship between (NO)-N-square and H2S.

AB  - Background & objectives: Gestational or preexisting diabetes is one of the risk factors of pre-eclampsia. Both are responsible for higher maternal and fetal complications. The objective was to study clinical risk factors of pre-eclampsia and biochemical markers in early pregnancy of women with diabetes mellitus (DM)/gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) for the development of pre-eclampsia.
   Methods: The study group comprised pregnant women diagnosed with GDM before the 20 wk of gestation and DM before pregnancy and the control group had age-, parity- and period of gestation-matched healthy women. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the polymorphism of these genes was evaluated at recruitment.
   Results: Out of 2050 pregnant women, 316 (15.41%) women (296 had GDM and 20 DM before pregnancy) were included in the study group. Of these, 96 women (30.38%) in the study group and 44 (13.92%) controls developed pre-eclampsia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated those who belonged to the upper middle and upper class of socio-economic status (SES) were likely to be at 4.50 and 6.10 times higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia. The risk of getting pre-eclampsia among those who had DM before pregnancy and pre-eclampsia in their previous pregnancy was about 2.34 and 4.56 times higher compared to those who had no such events, respectively. The serum biomarkers [SHBG, IGF-I and 25(OH)D] were not found to be useful in predicting pre-eclampsia in women with GDM. To predict risk of development of pre-eclampsia, the fitted risk model by backward elimination procedure was used to calculate a risk score for each patient. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for pre-eclampsia showed that area under the curve was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.73); P<0.001.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of this study suggested that pregnant women with diabetes were at a higher risk for pre-eclampsia. SES, history of pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancy and pre-GDM were found to be the risk factors.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Genomic analyses are widely applied to epidemiological, population genetic and experimental studies of pathogenic fungi. A wide range of methods are employed to carry out these analyses, typically without including controls that gauge the accuracy of variant prediction. The importance of tracking outbreaks at a global scale has raised the urgency of establishing high -accuracy pipelines that generate consistent results between research groups. To evaluate currently employed methods for whole-genome variant detection and elaborate best practices for fungal pathogens, we compared how 14 independent variant calling pipelines performed across 35 Candida auris isolates from 4 distinct clades and evaluated the performance of variant calling, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) counts and phylogenetic inference results. Although these pipelines used dif-ferent variant callers and filtering criteria, we found high overall agreement of SNPs from each pipeline. This concordance correlated with site quality, as SNPs discovered by a few pipelines tended to show lower mapping quality scores and depth of coverage than those recovered by all pipelines. We observed that the major differences between pipelines were due to variation in read trimming strategies, SNP calling methods and parameters, and downstream filtration criteria. We calculated specificity and sensitivity for each pipeline by aligning three isolates with chromosomal level assemblies and found that the GATK- based pipelines were well balanced between these metrics. Selection of trimming methods had a greater impact on SAMtools- based pipelines than those using GATK. Phylogenetic trees inferred by each pipeline showed high consistency at the clade level, but there was more variability between isolates from a single outbreak, with pipelines that used more stringent cutoffs having lower resolution. This project generated two truth datasets useful for routine benchmarking of C. auris variant calling, a consen-sus VCF of genotypes discovered by 10 or more pipelines across these 35 diverse isolates and variants for 2 samples identified from whole-genome alignments. This study provides a foundation for evaluating SNP calling pipelines and developing best practices for future fungal genomic studies.

AB  - Dry eye disease is the most common complication and a frequent cause of patient dissatisfaction after corneal laser refractive surgery, which includes laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). It has a complex, multifactorial etiology and is characterized by a highly variable clinical presentation. A detailed preoperative screening and optimization of the ocular surface prior to refractive surgery are the key to minimizing the incidence and severity of postoperative dry eye. Diagnosis of postrefractive surgery dry eye remains a challenge as no single symptom or clinical parameter is confirmative of the condition, and the symptoms and signs may not correlate well in many cases. A thorough understanding of the pathomechanism of the disease and its manifestations is essential to facilitate a treatment approach that is individualized for each patient. This article reviews various aspects of postrefractive surgery dry eye including its epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and management.

AB  - Background: The role of the sympathetic nervous system appears to be central in causing pain in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The stellate ganglion block (SGB) using additives with local anesthetics is an established treatment modality. However, literature is sparse in support of selective benefits of different additives for SGB. Hence, the authors aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of clonidine with methylprednisolone as additives to ropivacaine in the SGB for treatment of CRPS.Methods: A prospective randomized single blinded study (the investigator blinded to the study groups) was conducted among patients with CRPS-I of the upper limb, aged 18-70 years with American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I-III. Clonidine (15 mu g) and methylprednisolone (40 mg) were compared as additives to 0.25% ropivacaine (5 mL) for SGB. After medical treatment for two weeks, patients in each of the two groups were given seven ultrasound guided SGBs on alternate days.Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to visual analogue scale score, edema, or overall patient satisfaction. After 1.5 months follow-up, however, the group that received methylprednisolone had better improvement in range of motion. No significant side effects were seen with either drug. Conclusions: The use of additives, both methylprednisolone and clonidine, is safe and effective for the SGB in CRPS. The significantly better improvement in joint mobility with methylprednisolone suggests that it should be considered promising as an additive to local anaesthetics when joint mobility is the concern.

AB  - The current study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a novel nano-lipoidal eye drop formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for the topical treatment of uveitis. The triamcinolone acetonide-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (cTA-NLC) were developed by employing 'hot microemulsion method' using biocompatible lipids, which exhibited a sustained release nature and enhanced efficacy when evaluated in vitro. The in vivo efficacy of this developed formulation was tested on Wistar rats, and a single-dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in rabbits. The eyes of animals were examined for any signs of inflammation using the 'Slit-lamp microscopic' method. The aqueous humor collected from the sacrificed rats was tested for total protein count and cell count. The total protein count was determined using BSA assay method, while the total cell count was determined by Neubaur's hemocytometer method. The results showed that the cTA-NLC formulation had negligible signs of inflammation, with a clinical score of uveitis 0.82 +/- 0.166, which is much less than control/untreated (3.80 +/- 0.3) and free drug suspension (2.66 +/- 0.405). The total cell count was also found to be significantly low for cTA-NLC (8.73 +/- 1.79 x 10(5)) as compared to control (52.4 +/- 7.71 x 10(5)) and free drug suspension (30.13 +/- 3.021 x 10(5)). Conclusively, the animal studies conducted showed that our developed formulation holds the potential for effective management of uveitis.

AB  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a disorder of the mononuclear phagocytic system. Virtually any organ can be involved, the bone, skin, lungs, and pituitary gland being the most common. We describe the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with painless neck swelling. F-18-FDG PET/CT showed bilateral bulky parotid and submandibular glands with increased metabolic activity. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. To our knowledge, there has been no description of F-18-FDG PET/CT findings in Langerhans cell histiocytosis of salivary glands in literature. We aim to aid in the diagnosis and management of this rare presentation.

AB  - We present the case of a 60-year-old man who was being evaluated for 2 intra-abdominal masses. The masses were tracer avid on Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT and were suggestive of neuroendocrine tumor. Histopathology, however, confirmed the masses to be hemangiopericytoma. Hemangiopericytoma comes under the umbrella of solitary fibrous tumors, a rare tumor group arising from the mesenchymal cells. Solitary fibrous tumors commonly arise from the pleura but can occur anywhere in the body. Intra-abdominal hemangiopericytoma are extremely rare and should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses for Ga-68-DOTA peptide-avid tumors.

AB  - Cataract surgery, which is the most widely performed ophthalmic procedure, is usually done in the elderly population, who are also prone to ocular surface disorders. Ocular surface diseases are multifactorial in nature and associated with symptoms and signs such as foreign body sensation, burning, fatigue, photophobia, red or watery eyes, or reduced visual acuity. These include a spectrum of conditions that may be immune or non-immune in nature. Cataract surgery in itself is known to alter the normal ocular surface milieu and cause tear film disturbances which can last up to 6 months post-operatively. These symptoms can be exaggerated in patients with ocular surface diseases. The planning and execution of cataract surgery can also be difficult in patients with associated ocular surface diseases. In this review, we discuss the various aspects of planning and intraoperative modifications to optimize the outcomes of cataract surgery in patients with ocular surface diseases.

AB  - Immunogens mimicking the native-like structure of surface-exposed viral antigens are considered promising vaccine candidates. Influenza viruses are important zoonotic respiratory viruses with high pandemic potential. Recombinant soluble hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein-based protein subunit vaccines against Influenza have been shown to induce protective efficacy when administered intramuscularly. Here, we have expressed a recombinant soluble trimeric HA protein in Expi 293F cells and purified the protein derived from the Inf A/Guangdong-Maonan/ SWL1536/2019 virus which was found to be highly virulent in the mouse. The trimeric HA protein was found to be in the oligomeric state, highly stable, and the efficacy study in the BALB/c mouse challenge model through intradermal immunization with the prime-boost regimen conferred complete protection against a high lethal dose of homologous and mouse-adapted InfA/PR8 virus challenge. Furthermore, the immunogen induced high hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers and showed cross-protection against other Inf A and Inf B subtypes. The results are promising and warrant trimeric HA as a suitable vaccine candidate.

AB  - Background: High HIV prevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs) remains a cause of concern and are considered key drivers of concentrated epidemic in India. The present paper aims to assess the effectiveness of the targeted intervention (TI) program on the risk behaviors among IDUs across regions of India. Materials and Methods: This paper used the data from the integrated biological and behavioral surveillance 2014-2015 among the IDUs in India. Descriptive statistics and propensity score matching analysis was carried out to understand the effectiveness of the TI program on the new needle/syringe used and needle/syringe shared in the last injecting episode by accounting for the covariates. Results: The matched samples estimate, i.e., average treatment effect on treated of new needles/syringe used and shared in the last injecting episode by those who received needles/syringes from peer educator or outreach workers (PE/ORWs) and those who did not receive was 2.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 0.05-5.6) increase in the use of new needles/syringes and 6.5% (CI: -9.7--3.3) decrease in the needles/syringes shared in last injecting episode indicating that IDUs who received new needles/syringes from PE/ORWs are more likely to use new needle/syringe and less likely to share needle/syringes to those who did not receive needles/syringes. The results vary across the different regions of India. Conclusion: TI program proves to be an effective initiative in the behavior change among IDUs as substantiated by use of new needles/syringes and decreased sharing of needles/syringes. TI program coverage varies from region to region and may further be expanded to accelerate the program services to prevent HIV/AIDS.

AB  - Contact lens wear is useful in ocular conditions such as high refractive errors, irregular astigmatism, corneal ectasias, corneal dystrophies, post-keratoplasty, post-refractive surgeries, trauma, and ocular surface diseases. The new innovations of highly oxygen-permeable contact lens materials have broadened the applications of contact lens suitability. Therapeutic contact lenses are medically used in the management of a wide variety of corneal conditions and ocular surface diseases. These lenses aid in pain relief, enhance corneal healing, maintain ocular homeostasis, and act as a drug delivery system. Drug delivery applications of contact lenses hold promise for improving topical therapy. The modern rigid gas permeable scleral contact lens provides symptomatic relief in painful corneal diseases such as bullous keratopathy, corneal epithelial abrasions, and erosions. It has been useful in therapeutic management as well as visual rehabilitation by enhancing the ocular surface and protecting the cornea from adverse environmental conditions. This review provides a summary of contact lenses used for the treatment of ocular surface diseases based on the current evidence available in the literature. This can help enhance the understanding and management of ocular surface diseases with respect to contact lens use in our day-to-day ophthalmology practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic in India included a ban on the sale and use of tobacco products during 2020 when stay at home guidance (lockdown) was in place. In this study we examined the extent of reduction in frequency of tobacco consumption across all products.METHODS Telephone survey was conducted between July and August 2020 across an existing cohort of tobacco users (n=801) residing in Delhi (55.4%) and Chennai (44.6%), India. The participants were recruited irrespective of their gender and use of any kind of tobacco product(s). The survey questionnaire was based on the STOP (Studying Tobacco users Of Pakistan) survey and adapted to the context of smoking and smokeless tobacco use in India.RESULTS Cigarette consumption declined from a median value of 5.0 (IQR: 2-10) sticks in the pre-lockdown period to 2.0 (IQR: 0.4-5) sticks during the lockdown period. Reductions were reported in the daily use of bidis, from 8 (IQR: 4-12) sticks to 5 (IQR: 2-10) sticks and for smokeless tobacco users from 3.5 (IQR: 2-5) packs to 2 (IQR: 1-4) packs during the lockdown. Furthermore, the number of daily cigarette smokers in our cohort decreased from 32.6% (n=261) in the pre-lockdown period to 27.5% (n=220) during lockdown and smokeless tobacco users decreased from 35.8% (n=287) in pre-lockdown period to 30.3% (n=243) during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS The decrease in tobacco use can be attributed to various societal and environmental factors. However, the pandemic-linked lockdown provided an opportune condition to reduce the use of tobacco products, which could be due to restricted access and increase in health awareness during the COVID-19 lockdown.

AB  - Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, has been proposed as an antimanic agent that acts by reducing noradrenergic transmission. We conducted a systematic review to examine the efficacy and safety of clonidine for acute mania/hypomania. A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) and non-randomized studies investigating the efficacy and safety of monotherapy/adjuvant treatment with clonidine for acute mania/hypomania in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Nine studies (n = 222) met our inclusion criteria, including five RCTs (n = 159) and four non-randomized studies (n = 63). Non-randomized studies showed clonidine to help reduce symptoms of mania. However, data from placebo controlled RCTs were inconsistent. One RCT showed adjuvant clonidine as superior to placebo, whereas another RCT reported that clonidine was not better than placebo. In individual RCTs, lithium and valproate offered better antimanic effects compared to clonidine. Studies reported hypotension, depression, and somnolence as common adverse effects. Significant differences in study design and sample size contributed to high heterogeneity. This systematic review suggests low-grade evidence for clonidine as an adjuvant treatment for acute mania with mood stabilizers and inconclusive efficacy as monotherapy, warranting further well-designed RCTs.

AB  - Craniotomy is a fundamental component of neurosurgery that involves the removal of the skull bone flap. Simulation-based training of craniotomy is an efficient method to develop competent skills outside the operating room. Traditionally, an expert surgeon evaluates the surgical skills using rating scales, but this method is subjective, time-consuming, and tedious. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to develop an anatomically accurate craniotomy simulator with realistic haptic feedback and objective evaluation of surgical skills. A CT scan segmentation-based craniotomy simulator with two bone flaps for drilling task was developed using 3D printed bone matrix material. Force myography (FMG) and machine learning were used to automatically evaluate the surgical skills. Twenty-two neurosurgeons participated in this study, including novices (n = 8), intermediates (n = 8), and experts (n = 6), and they performed the defined drilling experiments. They provided feedback on the effectiveness of the simulator using a Likert scale questionnaire on a scale ranging from 1 to 10. The data acquired from the FMG band was used to classify the surgical expertise into novice, intermediate and expert categories. The study employed naive Bayes, linear discriminant (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT) classifiers with leave one out cross-validation. The neurosurgeons' feedback indicates that the developed simulator was found to be an effective tool to hone drilling skills. In addition, the bone matrix material provided good value in terms of haptic feedback (average score 7.1). For FMG-data-based skills evaluation, we achieved maximum accuracy using the naive Bayes classifier (90.0 +/- 14.8%). DT had a classification accuracy of 86.22 +/- 20.8%, LDA had an accuracy of 81.9 +/- 23.6%, and SVM had an accuracy of 76.7 +/- 32.9%. The findings of this study indicate that materials with comparable biomechanical properties to those of real tissues are more effective for surgical simulation. In addition, force myography and machine learning provide objective and automated assessment of surgical drilling skills.

AB  - With the availability of free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for children at government ART centres in India, it is the need of the hour to assess the outcome of children who have good adherence to ART. This study was aimed at assessing their survival and outcomes. This was an ambispective multicentric cohort study involving three sites in India-Delhi, Pune and Kolkata. Children (less than 18 years of age) who were already enrolled on ART were recruited and followed up for a total duration of 36 months. Their baseline demographic data were collected, and blood investigations were done at baseline and at 6-monthly follow-up. A composite outcome which implied either mortality or CD4 counts less than 350 cells/mm(3) at the end of follow-up was used for analysis by logistic regression. A total of 343 children were enrolled. Among the 343 patients, 5 patients were lost to follow-up, 1 opted out, and 337 patients remained in follow-up till the end of the study period. Three deaths occurred during follow-up. CD4 counts less than 350/mm(3) at baseline and at multiple follow-up visits were associated with the composite outcome (P < 0.05). Among the demographic variables, a history of blood transfusion as a risk factor for HIV acquisition was associated with the composite outcome (uOR - 9.66 [2.71-34.42], P < 0.001). No other variable was significantly and consistently associated with the outcome. Low CD4 counts at baseline and during follow-up are associated with poor outcomes in children living with HIV/AIDS.

AB  - Lung cancer is one of the common malignancies with high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. Most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage either due to limited resources of infrastructure, trained human resources, or delay in clinical suspicion. Low-dose computed tomography has emerged as a screening tool for lung cancer detection but this may not be a feasible option for most developing countries. Electronic nose is a unique non-invasive device that has been developed for lung cancer diagnosis and monitoring response by exhaled breath analysis of volatile organic compounds. The breath-print have been shown to differ not only among lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, but also between various types of lung cancer. Hence, we postulate that the breath-print analysis by electronic nose could be a potential biomarker for the early detection of lung cancer along with monitoring treatment response in a resource-limited setting. In this review, we have consolidated the current published literature suggesting the use of an electronic nose in the diagnosis and monitoring treatment response of lung cancer.

AB  - IntroductionMany Indians are at high risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The blood glucose level can be improved through a healthy lifestyle (such as physical activity and a healthy diet). Yoga can help in T2DM prevention, being a culturally appropriate approach to improving lifestyle. We developed the Yoga Programme for T2DM Prevention (YOGA-DP), a 24-week structured lifestyle education and exercise (Yoga) program that included 27 group Yoga sessions and self-practice of Yoga at home. In this study, the feasibility of undertaking a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) was explored that will evaluate the intervention's effectiveness among high-risk individuals in India.MethodsA multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group, feasibility RCT was conducted in India. The outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded. Adults with a fasting blood glucose level of 100-125 mg/dL (i.e., at high risk of T2DM) were eligible. Participants were randomized centrally using a computer-generated randomization schedule. In the intervention group, participants received YOGA-DP. In the control group, participants received enhanced standard care.ResultsIn this feasibility trial, the recruitment of participants took 4 months (from May to September 2019). We screened 711 people and assessed 160 for eligibility. Sixty-five participants (33 in the intervention group and 32 in the control group) were randomized, and 57 (88%) participants were followed up for 6 months (32 in the intervention group and 25 in the control group). In the intervention group, the group Yoga sessions were continuously attended by 32 (97%) participants (median (interquartile range, IQR) number of sessions attended = 27 (3)). In the intervention group, Yoga was self-practiced at home by 30 (91%) participants (median (IQR) number of days per week and minutes per day self-practiced = 2 (2) and 35 (15), respectively). In the control group, one (3%) participant attended external Yoga sessions (on Pranayama) for 1 week during the feasibility trial period. There was no serious adverse event.ConclusionsThe participant recruitment and follow-up and adherence to the intervention were promising in this feasibility study. In the control group, the potential contamination was low. Therefore, it should be feasible to undertake a definitive RCT in the future that will evaluate YOGA-DP's effectiveness among high-risk people in India.

AB  - Background: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) caused by hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is often severe and difficult to treat. The content of Cr(VI) in cement can be reduced by, for example, addition of iron(II) sulfate. Since 2005 the content of Cr(VI) in cement is regulated in the EU Directive 2003/53/EC and must not exceed 2 ppm. Since this regulation came into force, ACD caused by cement has markedly been reduced. Objective: To investigate Cr(VI) and total chromium content in samples of cement from countries within and outside the EU. Methods: The members of the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG) were invited to participate in the study with the aim to collect cement samples from geographically different areas. The content of Cr(VI) in the samples was estimated by the diphenyl carbazide spot test, atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to assess the total chromium content. Results: Forty-five cement samples were analyzed, containing amounts of Cr(VI) from 70 ppm. Twenty-one samples contained >2 ppm Cr(VI), 24 contained less. Four of 17 samples from within the EU contained >2 ppm Cr(VI), that is, higher amounts than stipulated in the EU directive, as compared with 17 samples from countries outside the EU. Conclusion: In countries outside the EU, significantly more cement samples contained >2 ppm Cr(VI).

AB  - The intricate molecular interactions leading to the oncogenic pathway are the consequence of cell cycle modification controlled by a bunch of cell cycle regulatory proteins. The tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulatory proteins work in coordination to maintain a healthy cellular environment. The integrity of this cellular protein pool is perpetuated by heat shock proteins/chaperones, which assist in proper protein folding during normal and cellular stress conditions. Among these versatile groups of chaperone proteins, Hsp90 is one of the significant ATP-dependent chaperones that aid in stabilizing many tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulator protein targets. Recently, studies have revealed that in cancerous cell lines, Hsp90 stabilizes mutant p53, 'the guardian of the genome.' Hsp90 also has a significant impact on Fzr, an essential regulator of the cell cycle having an important role in the developmental process of various organisms, including Drosophila, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and plants. During cell cycle progression, p53 and Fzr coordinately regulate the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) from metaphase to anaphase transition up to cell cycle exit. APC/C mediates proper centrosome function in the dividing cell. The centrosome acts as the microtubule organizing center for the correct segregation of the sister chromatids to ensure perfect cell division. This review examines the structure of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones, which work in synergy to stabilize proteins such as p53 and Fizzy-related homolog (Fzr) to synchronize the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C). Dysfunction of this process activates the oncogenic pathway leading to the development of cancer. Additionally, an overview of current drugs targeting Hsp90 at various phases of clinical trials has been included.

AB  - Optimal growth and development in childhood and adolescence is crucial for lifelong health and well-being(1-6). Here we used data from 2,325 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight from 71million participants, to report the height and body-mass index (BMI) of children and adolescents aged 5-19years on the basis of rural and urban place of residence in 200 countries and territories from 1990 to 2020. In 1990, children and adolescents residing in cities were taller than their rural counterparts in all but a few high-income countries. By 2020, the urban height advantage became smaller in most countries, and in many high-income western countries it reversed into a small urban-based disadvantage. The exception was for boys in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in some countries in Oceania, south Asia and the region of central Asia, Middle East and north Africa. In these countries, successive cohorts of boys from rural places either did not gain height or possibly became shorter, and hence fell further behind their urban peers. The difference between the age-standardized mean BMI of children in urban and rural areas was < 1.1kgm(-2) in the vast majority of countries. Within this small range, BMI increased slightly more in cities than in rural areas, except in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in central and eastern Europe. Our results show that in much of the world, the growth and developmental advantages of living in cities have diminished in the twenty-first century, whereas in much of sub-Saharan Africa they have amplified.

AB  - BackgroundPrimary mediastinal GCT (PMGCT) is a rare entity and comprises 10-15% of all mediastinal tumors. We present our institutional experience of MGCT treated with multimodality management.Materials and MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis between 2010 to 2020 of all mediastinal germ cell tumors registered at our center. Data on patient demographics, treatments received, treatment toxicities and response were recorded. Overall survival and relapse free survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.ResultsA total of 30 patients were identified. The median age was 25.5 (range, 18-45) years. Common presenting features included cough (70%) and shortness of breath (70%). Histology wise, 60% patients were non seminomatous histology, whereas 33.3% patients were Seminoma. Twenty-seven (90%) patients received chemotherapy as the first-line treatment, of whom five patients (16.6%) underwent surgery and radiation therapy subsequently. Median follow-up was 26.9 months. Thirteen patients (43.3%) had complete response (43.3%) and eight patients had partial response (26.7%), while three patients (5.5%) had progressive disease. Three-year relapse-free survival rate was 69.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.8-85.6%). Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 73.4% (95% CI, 49.4-87.3%). Patients with seminoma had a 3 year OS of 90.0% (95% CI, 47.3-98.5%) compared to those with non-seminoma (63.53% [95% CI, 32.3-83.3%]).ConclusionsMultiagent chemotherapy is the backbone of treatment in PMGCT. Seminomatous PMGCT have excellent prognosis, while further improvement is needed in those with nonseminomatous tumor.

TI  - Prevention of relapse in drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis patients with and without vitamin D3 supplementation: A double blinded randomized control clinical trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - D DEFICIENCY
KW  - ADULTS
KW  - INDIA
AB  - Background
   The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D are widely recognized and a few studies have been conducted to determine its utility in the treatment of tuberculosis, with mixed results. This study was conducted to see if vitamin D supplementation in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in the Indian population contributed to sputum smear and culture conversion as well as the prevention of relapse.
   Methods
   This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in three sites in India. HIV negative participants aged 15-60 years with sputum smear positive PTB were recruited according to the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program guidelines and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) with either supplemental dose of oral vitamin D3 (60,000 IU/sachet weekly for first two months, fortnightly for next four months followed by monthly for the next 18 months) or placebo with same schedule. The primary outcome was relapse of PTB and secondary outcomes were time to conversion of sputum smear and sputum culture.

   A total of 846 participants were enrolled between February 1, 2017 to February 27, 2021, and randomly assigned to receive either 60,000 IU vitamin D3 (n = 424) or placebo (n = 422) along with standard ATT. Among the 697 who were cured of PTB, relapse occurred in 14 participants from the vitamin D group and 19 participants from the placebo group (hazard risk ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.34 to 1.37, log rank p value 0.29). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was seen in time to sputum smear and sputum culture conversion between both groups. Five patients died each in vitamin D and placebo groups, but none of the deaths were attributable to the study intervention. Serum levels of vitamin D were significantly raised in the vitamin D group as compared to the placebo group, with other blood parameters not showing any significant difference between groups.
   Conclusions
   The study reveals that vitamin D supplementation does not seem to have any beneficial effect in the treatment of PTB in terms to the prevention of relapse and time to sputum smear and culture conversion.

AB  - Background Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is usually caused due to dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Rarely, thrombotic microangiopathy is caused by non-complement mediated mutations in diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGKE); information about therapy and outcome of these patients is limited.
   Methods Medical records of patients, younger than 18 years, diagnosed with TMA and variants in DGKE were reviewed to include 12 patients from seven centers. Genetic studies included targeted exome sequencing and multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification of CFH-CFHR5.
   Results Patients presented at a median age of 11 (7.5, 12.3) months; all were younger than 2 years. All patients had an infectious prodrome; enteroinvasive, enteropathogenic, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were detected in two patients with diarrhea. Chief features included those of microangiopathic hemolysis (n = 11), microscopic hematuria (n = 10), nephrotic range proteinuria (n = 10), hypoalbuminemia (n = 6), elevated total cholesterol (n = 6), and hypocomplementemia ( n = 4). Histopathology showed thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 4), overlapping with membranoproliferative pattern of injury (n = 1). At median 3.3 years of follow-up, significant hypertension and/or proteinuria (40%), relapses (66.7%), and death or progression to CKD (60%) were common. Genetic sequencing showed 13 homozygous and compound heterozygous variants (7 pathogenic, 3 likely pathogenic) located throughout DGKE; 11 variants were novel.
   Conclusions This case series highlights the need to suspect DGKE nephropathy in young patients with TMA, especially those with severe proteinuria. Medium-term outcomes are unsatisfactory with risk of relapses, progressive kidney failure, and death.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) is the major cause of inflammation in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It's mechanisms of signal transduction through nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) pathway via small molecules such as metabolite crosstalk are still elusive. In this study, we have targeted TNF-alpha and NF-kB through metabolites of RA, to inhibit TNF-alpha activity and deter NF-kB signaling pathways, thereby mitigating the disease severity of RA. TNF-alpha and NF-kB structure was obtained from PDB database and metabolites of RA were selected from literature survey. In-silico studies were carried out by molecular docking using AutoDock Vina software and further, known TNF-alpha and NF-kB inhibitors were compared and revealed metabolite's capacity to targets the respective proteins. Most suitable metabolite was then validated by MD simulation to verify its efficiency against TNF-alpha. Total 56 known differential metabolites of RA were docked with TNF-alpha and NF-kB compared to their corresponding inhibitor compounds. Four metabolites such as Chenodeoxycholic acid, 2-Hydroxyestrone, 2-Hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2), and 16-Hydroxyestradiol were identified as a common TNF-a inhibitor's having binding energies ranging from -8.3 to -8.6 kcal/mol, followed by docking with NF-kB. Further, 2-OHE2 was selected because of having binding energy -8.5 kcal/mol, found to inhibit inflammation and the effectiveness was validated by root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration and molecular mechanics with generalized born and surface area solvation against TNF-alpha. Thus 2-OHE2, an estrogen metabolite was identified as the potential inhibitor, attenuated inflammatory activation and can be utilized as a therapeutic target to disseminate severity of RA.

AB  - Blunt traumatic aortic injury is a rare life-threatening injury. Last few decades had witnessed a paradigm shift in the management of blunt traumatic aortic injury. This study was conducted to review the clinical spectrum of thoracic aortic injuries, the different management strategies and their associated outcomes at a level 1 trauma centre. Case series analysis of all the patients admitted with blunt thoracic aortic injuries between January 2010 and December 2020 was done. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality and early morbidity between the different grades of aortic injury. The overall incidence of blunt thoracic aortic injury was 0.9% (n = 55). The median age of the cohort was 30 years (IQR, 23-40 years). The predominant mode of injury was road traffic injury involving the vulnerable road users (42.3%). One-third of the patients were hemodynamically unstable on arrival with odds of mortality of 4.5 (Odds ratio 16, 95%CI 2.91-87.7). Grade III aortic injury was predominant (63.5%). Of all, 31 (59.6%) patients underwent endovascular stenting, 19 (36.5%) had NOM and 2 (3.9%) had surgical repair. In-hospital mortality was 21.1%; however, aortic injury-specific mortality was 1.92%. Mortality was highest in operative followed by NOM and endovascular stenting cohorts with 50%, 26.3% and 16.1% respectively. Endovascular stent repair is the preferred mode of treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with blunt thoracic aortic injuries with reduced risk of complications. The final outcome in patients with blunt thoracic aortic injury correlates with the hemodynamic status on arrival, severity of the concomitant injuries and the grade of the aortic injury.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesModified Atkins diet (MAD) has emerged as an adjuvant therapy in drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Most studies are in children; there is limited evidence for DRE in adults. This study aimed to investigate whether MAD along with standard drug therapy (SDT) was indeed more effective than SDT alone in reducing seizure frequency and improving psychological outcomes at 6 months in adolescents and adults with DRE (nonsurgical).MethodsA prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at tertiary care referral center in India. Persons with DRE aged 10-55 years attending outpatient epilepsy clinics between August 2015 and April 2019, who had more than 2 seizures per month despite using at least 3 appropriate antiseizure medications (ASMs) at their maximum tolerated doses and had not been on any form of diet therapy for the past 1 year, were enrolled. Patients were assessed for the eligibility and randomly assigned to receive SDT plus MAD (intervention arm) or SDT alone (control arm). The primary outcome was >50% reduction in seizure frequency, and the secondary outcomes were quality of life (QOL), behavior, adverse events, and rate of withdrawal at 6 months. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 243 patients were screened for eligibility; 160 patients (80 adults and 80 adolescents) were randomized to either the intervention or control arm. Demographic and clinical characteristics in both groups were comparable at baseline. At 6 months, >50% seizure reduction was seen in 26.2% in the intervention group vs 2.5% in the control group (95% CI 13.5-33.9; p < 0.001). Improvement in QOL was 52.1 +/- 17.6 in the intervention group vs 42.5 +/- 16.4 in the control group (mean difference, 9.6; 95% CI 4.3 to 14.9, p < 0.001). However, behavior scores could be performed in 49 patients, and improvement was seen in the intervention vs control group (65.6 +/- 7.9 vs 71.4 +/- 8.1, p = 0.015) at the end of the study. One patient had weight loss; 2 patients had diarrhea.DiscussionThe MAD group demonstrated improvement in all aspects (reduction in seizure frequency and behavioral problems) compared with the control group at the end of the study. MAD is an effective modality in controlling seizures; further research is required to assess its efficacy in terms of biomarkers along with descriptive metabolomics studies.Classification of EvidenceThis study provides Class III evidence that the MAD increases the probability of seizure reduction in adolescents and adults with DRE.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic that has affected nearly 600 million people to date across the world. While COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, cardiac injury is also known to occur. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is uniquely capable of characterizing myocardial tissue properties in-vivo, enabling insights into the pattern and degree of cardiac injury. The reported prevalence of myocardial involvement identified by CMR in the context of COVID-19 infection among previously hospitalized patients ranges from 26 to 60%. Variations in the reported prevalence of myocardial involvement may result from differing patient populations (e.g. differences in severity of illness) and the varying intervals between acute infection and CMR evaluation. Standardized methodologies in image acquisition, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of CMR abnormalities across would likely improve concordance between studies. This consensus document by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) provides recommendations on CMR imaging and reporting metrics towards the goal of improved standardization and uniform data acquisition and analytic approaches when performing CMR in patients with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BackgroundStudies have highlighted a possible influence of gingival and periodontal disease (PD) on COVID-19 risk and severity. However, the evidence is based on hospital-based studies and community-level data are sparse. ObjectivesWe described the epidemiological pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Delhi and evaluated the associations of gingival and PD with incident COVID-19 disease in a regionally representative urban Indian population. MethodsIn a prospective study nested within the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South-Asia (CARRS) study, participants with clinical gingival and periodontal status available at baseline (2014-16) (n = 1,727) were approached between October 2021 to March 2022. Information on COVID-19 incidence, testing, management, severity was collected as per the WHO case criteria along with COVID-19 vaccination status. Absolute incidence of COVID-19 disease was computed by age, sex, and oral health. Differences in rates were tested using log-rank test. Poisson regression models were used to evaluate independent associations between gingival and PD and incidence of COVID-19, adjusted for socio-demographic and behavioral factors, presence of comorbidity, and medication use. ResultsAmong 1,727 participants, the mean age was 44.0 years, 45.7% were men, 84.5% participants had baseline gingival or PD and 89.4% participants had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Overall, 35% (n = 606) participants were tested for COVID-19 and 24% (n = 146/606) tested positive. As per the WHO criteria total number of cases was 210, constituting 12% of the total population. The age and sex-specific rates of COVID-19 were higher among men and older participants, but women aged >60 years had higher rates than men of same age. The incidence rate did not differ significantly between those having gingival or PD and healthy periodontium (19.1 vs. 16.5/1,000 person-years) and there was no difference in risk of COVID-19 by baseline oral disease status. ConclusionGingival and PD were not associated with increased risk of COVID-19.

AB  - BackgroundFine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the first-line diagnostic procedure for salivary gland masses. Secretory carcinoma (SC) is characterized by ETV6 and RET rearrangements detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction optimized for paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tissue, respectively. The authors performed FISH on cytological material to assess its role in the diagnosis of SC. MethodsFNACs with SC as a diagnostic consideration and cases diagnosed as SC on histology with a corresponding FNAC with any diagnosis were evaluated for ETV6 rearrangement by FISH. If acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) was a differential diagnosis and ETV6 rearrangement was absent, NR4A3 FISH was performed. FISH results were compared with those on histological specimens, where available. ResultsFifteen cases were included. FISH initially performed on three cell blocks did not yield good results, was then performed on direct smears, and was interpretable in 14 cases (93.3%). An ETV6 rearrangement was identified in seven cases (50%), and an NR4A3 rearrangement was identified in three cases (21.4%), providing a confirmatory diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases (66.7%). The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology category was altered in two cases (6.7%). Complete correlation (100%) was seen with FISH on corresponding histological specimens. ConclusionsWith minor modifications, the FISH procedure can be optimized for FNAC smears with results comparable to those on histological specimens. ETV6 FISH testing on cytological smears in cases suspected as SC improves the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC and can help lower the proportion of the Milan categories salivary gland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential and suspicious for malignancy, maximizing diagnostic information from less invasive samples and aiding in patient management.

AB  - BackgroundKeratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disorder underpinned by a complex inflammatory cycle. Introduction of topical cyclosporine has been a significant advance in the management of DED. In recent years advancements in formulation technology have led to development of micellar nano-particulate (MNP) cyclosporine formulations that promise better penetration into ocular target tissues and potential for reduced ocular surface irritation.MethodsWe compared two dosing regimes of a proprietary MNP cyclosporine emulsion with the widely marketed topical cyclosporine formulation Restasis (TM) in a multicenter parallel-group randomised trial in patients with DED. Patients were randomised to one of 3 treatment groups with 90 patients eligible for the per protocol analysis: 30 in the higher dose test arm A; 32 in the lower dose test arm B; and 28 in the Restasis (TM) control arm C. All scored efficacy endpoints were tested for significance by comparing the mean change in scores from baseline in the test groups with that in the control group at 12 weeks, using the Student's t test. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used to test individual symptom scores and clinician's global evaluation of treatment grades.ResultsCorneal fluorescein staining score, the primary efficacy endpoint, decreased by 6.8 +/- 4.0, 5.7 +/- 3.9, and 4.6 +/- 3.6 points in the 3 groups respectively, indicating superior efficacy in test arm A in comparison to control arm C (p = 0.0026). Schirmer's tear test, conjunctival lissamine staining score, ocular surface disease index, and individual dry eye symptom scores also favoured higher dose MNP cyclosporine over Restasis (TM). The study failed to differentiate the treatment arms in terms of clinician's global evaluation of treatment, use of tear substitutes, best corrected visual acuity or safety and toleration.ConclusionThe results indicate that the dose of 1 drop of a 0.05% w/v ophthalmic emulsion of MNP cyclosporine administered topically twice daily yields better outcomes at 12 weeks than the lower dose tested in the study, and is more efficacious than an equivalent dose of Restasis (TM), the active control used in the study.

AB  - Introduction: Since the eight edition of the Union for In-ternational Cancer Control and American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classification system, the primary tumor pT stage is determined on the basis of presence and size of the invasive components. The aim of this study was to identify histologic features in tumors with lepidic growth pattern which may be used to establish criteria for distinguishing invasive from noninvasive areas.Methods: A Delphi approach was used with two rounds of blinded anonymized analysis of resected nonmucinous lung adenocarcinoma cases with presumed invasive and nonin-vasive components, followed by one round of reviewer de-anonymized and unblinded review of cases with known outcomes. A digital pathology platform was used for measuring total tumor size and invasive tumor size. Results: The mean coefficient of variation for measuring total tumor size and tumor invasive size was 6.9% (range: 1.7%-22.3%) and 54% (range: 14.7%-155%), respectively, with substantial variations in interpretation of the size and location of invasion among pathologists. Following the presentation of the results and further discussion among members at large of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Pathology Committee, extensive epithelial proliferation (EEP) in areas of collapsed lepidic growth pattern is recognized as a feature likely to be associated with invasive growth. The EEP is characterized by multilayered luminal epithelial cell growth, usually with high-grade cytologic features in several alveolar spaces.Conclusions: Collapsed alveoli and transition zones with EEP were identified by the Delphi process as morphologic features that were a source of interobserver variability. Definition criteria for collapse and EEP are proposed to improve reproducibility of invasion measurement.(c) 2022 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The development of diagnostic tools remains at the center of the health care system. In recent times optical biosensors have been widely applied in the scientific community, especially for monitoring protein-protein or nucleic acid hybridization interactions. Optical biosensors-derived surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology has appeared as a revolutionary technology at the current times. This review focuses on the research work in molecular biomarker evaluation using the technique based on SPR for translational clinical diagnosis. The review has covered both communicable and noncommunicable diseases by using different bio-fluids of the patient's sample for diagnosis of the diseases. An increasing number of SPR approaches have been developed in healthcare research and fundamental biological studies. The utility of SPR in the area of biosensing basically lies in its noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic feature due to its label-free high sensitivity and specificity properties. This makes SPR an invaluable tool with precise application in the recognition of different stages of the disease.

AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. Gonorrhoea is a very serious infection because if untreated, it can lead to significant ramifications to reproductive, maternal, & newborn health and increase transmission of HIV. Infections are very often asymptomatic and symptoms when present manifest differently in men and women. The cornerstone of gonorrhoea control is to assure rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment of patients to prevent the onward spread of infection. The resource-rich settings are utilizing nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for diagnosis, whereas resource-limited settings like ours where laboratory infrastructure is lacking, reliance is placed on syndromic approach. In view of the limitations of each, there is a compelling need for development of a point of care test (POCT). Aptamers offer such potential. These are short oligonucleotides that bind to its target with high affinity and specificity and therefore can be maneuvred for use in diagnostics. In this study, we performed live cell-SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) to select 12 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers that bind strongly to a cocktail of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, with Kd values ranging from 8.58 to 596 nM. Gold nanoparticle (GNP) assay revealed that one of the aptamers, E8 19 was highly specific for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Kd = 24.5 nM). More importantly, it did not demonstrate any binding to Neisseria meningitidis and commensal Neisseria sp. The identified aptamer holds much promise for the development of a rapid test for diagnosis of gonorrhoea.

AB  - IntroductionLateral condyle fractures in children have been typically been treated operatively using Kirschner wires (K wire) or cannulated screws (CCS); however, a definitive choice of implant remains a matter of debate. This systematic review aims to determine if union and functional outcomes of these fractures are better with screw fixation.MethodologyA search of PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, and Google scholar was performed in March 2021. The results were screened by title and abstract, and relevance and a quality assessment of the data were performed for the articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Articles comparing radiological and functional outcomes of lateral condyle fractures treated with K wires or screws were included for examination. Articles were excluded if they did not compare outcomes of K wires and CCS together, or were in a language other than English, technical notes, case reports, and articles, which describe the use of fixation methods other than K wire or CCS as well as biomechanical studies were also excluded. Risk of bias and quality assessment of included articles were also done.ResultsSeven clinical studies were included. 44.4% (n = 4) were retrospective review of records with level III evidence (77.7%, n = 7). Only two included articles had good-quality assessment scores. Union was reported in 85.7% % in K wire group and 99.6% in CCS group. Functional outcomes were not statistically significant between the two groups.ConclusionUsing screws to fix lateral condyle provides better union; however, there is no difference in the functional outcomes and complication rate between the two. Using screws or buried K wires adds the burden of an additional procedure for removal.

AB  - To determine the cardiopulmonary changes in the survivors of acute COVID-19 infection at 3-6 month and 6-12 month. We followed up 53 patients out of which 28 (52%) had mild COVID-19 and 25 (48%) had severe COVID-19. The first follow-up was between 3 month after diagnosis up to 6 month and second follow-up between 6 and 12 month from the date of diagnosis of acute COVID-19. They were monitored using vital parameters, pulmonary function tests, echocardiography and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. We found improvement in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with a median of 52% of predicted and 80% of predicted at the first and second follow-up, respectively. There was improvement in the CTSS in severe group from 22 (18-24) to 12 (10-18; p-0.001). Multivariable logistic regression revealed increased odds of past severe disease with higher CTSS at follow-up (OR-1.7 [CI 1.14-2.77]; P = 0.01). Correlation was found between CTSS and DLCO at second follow-up (r(2) = 0.36; p < 0.01). Most of patients recovered from COVID-19 but a subgroup of patients continued to have persistent radiological and pulmonary function abnormalities necessitating a structured follow-up.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major health concern in the ageing human population. Though existing therapeutics have shown some efficacy, low retinal bioavailability of drugs continues to be a hindrance in ocular drug delivery system. Sirolimus (SIR) is one such drug. In this study, we developed chitosan func-tionalized PLGA nanoparticles (NP), (<300 nm), for effective and sustained SIR delivery to retina via single subconjunctival injection. Confocal laser microscopy demonstrated superiority of NP for delivering the model cargo, Rhodamine-B, to the posterior segment of eye as opposed to plain dye owing to bioadhesive and permeation enhancer property of chitosan coat. Further, we investigated the protective effect of sirolimus loaded chitosan functionalized PLGA nanoparticles (SIR-NP) vs plain sirolimus suspension (SIR) against sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration model. Results revealed that SIR-NP enhanced the delivery of SIR in retina and significantly attenuated inflammatory and structural changes in comparison to plain SIR. SIR-NP more efficiently prevented outer nuclear layer thinning and photoreceptor degeneration post sodium iodate-induced toxicity. Moreover, SIR-NP upregulated the levels of anti-oxidants, induced autophagy and inhibited apoptosis in the damaged retina over a period of 21 days which was not seen with plain SIR. Also, no toxic effects on blood, liver or kidney were observed with SIR-NP treatment. Thus, SIR-NP could be a potential strategy to target AMD.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is the world's fourth largest causative factor of mortality with a five year of survival rate. Poor definitive diagnosis can be ascribed to both problematic early detections, which render the significant number of therapies approaches mostly ineffective and cause widespread metastasis, in addition to its unique physiological and pathological traits. There have been ongoing efforts to employ novel approaches to combat pancreatic cancer in an effort to improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatments and reduce their cytotoxic effect. Combining nanotechnology approach with cancer targeting has demonstrated enhanced survival of patients and life quality outcomes, providing a potential remedy for treatment problems. The self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system is one of the most successful nanotechnology approaches for increasing the oral bioavailability of a medicinal agent, particularly one that is poorly water soluble and hydrophobic drug. The self-nanoemulsifying drug de-livery system SNEDDS technique has addressed the various problems like inadequate bioavailability, undesired toxicity, poor absorption, and solubility issues at the site of action in case of chemotherapeutic drugs. This review discusses the conventional therapies of pancreatic cancer as well as current advancements in self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system in order to address the main issue facing the area of oncology.

AB  - BackgroundMitochondrial abnormalities exist in gastrocnemius muscle of people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Whether abnormalities in mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy are associated with greater ischemia or walking impairment in PAD is unknown. Methods and ResultsProtein markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy and the abundance of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes were quantified in gastrocnemius muscle biopsies from people with and without PAD. Their 6-minute walk distance and 4-m gait speed were measured. Sixty-seven participants (mean age 65.0 years [+/- 6.8], 16 [23.9%] women, 48 [71.6%] Black) were enrolled, including 15 with moderate to severe PAD (ankle brachial index [ABI] <0.60), 29 with mild PAD (ABI 0.60-0.90), and 23 without PAD (ABI 1.00-1.40). Abundance of all electron transport chain complexes was significantly higher in participants with lower ABI (eg, complex I: 0.66, 0.45, 0.48 arbitrary units [AU], respectively, P trend=0.043). Lower ABI values were associated with a higher LC3A/B II-to-LC3A/B I (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) ratio (2.54, 2.31, 2.15 AU, respectively, P trend=0.017) and reduced abundance of the autophagy receptor p62 (0.71, 0.69, 0.80 AU, respectively, P trend=0.033). The abundance of each electron transport chain complex was positively and significantly associated with 6-minute walk distance and 4-m gait speed at usual and fast pace only among participants without PAD (eg, complex I: r=0.541, P=0.008; r=0.477, P=0.021; r=0.628, P=0.001, respectively). ConclusionsThese results suggest that accumulation of electron transport chain complexes in gastrocnemius muscle of people with PAD may be because of impaired mitophagy in the setting of ischemia. Findings are descriptive, and further study in larger sample sizes is needed.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the utility of dual energy CT angiography (DECTA) in acute non-variceal gastrointestinal hemorrhage (ANVGIH) compared to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as gold standard.
   Materials and methods 111 Patients (mean age: 39.2 years; 94 males) of ANVGIH who underwent both DECTA and DSA between January 2016 and September 2021 were included. Virtual monochromatic (VM) images at 10 keV increments from 40 to 70 keV and blended (120kVp equivalent) images of arterial phase of DECTA were evaluated independently by two readers blinded to DSA information. Quantitative analysis included measurement of attenuation in the major arteries (abdominal aorta, celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery), suspected vascular lesion, and lesion feeding artery to calculate contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Qualitative analysis assessed the image quality of each data set using a 3-point Likert scale. Findings on DSA were evaluated by a third reader and both DECTA and DSA were compared.
   Results On linear blended images, vascular lesion was identified by reader 1 in 88 (79.3%) and by reader 2 in 87 (78.4%) patients and DSA showed lesion in 92 (82.9%) patients. The sensitivity and specificity of blended images and VM images of DECTA for lesion detection were not significantly different from each other. The CNR and SNR of arteries, vascular lesion and feeding artery were significantly higher at 70 keV (p < 0.005) compared to blended and other VM images. Although subjective scores for image quality were higher for 60 keV images by both readers, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.3). The interobserver agreement was mostly good.
   Conclusion In the assessment of ANVGIH, the 60 keV and 70 keV VM images improved the image quality and contrast, respectively, but there was no increase in diagnostic accuracy of VM image datasets compared to linearly blended images. Hence, the diagnostic utility of DECTA in ANVGIH is still uncertain.

AB  - Background and Objectives: A critical appraisal of the literature helps to assess the strength and weakness of the research and suggests ways to improve future research. Our aim was to critically appraise the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) studies conducted in India for blood donation.Materials and Methods: Of 70 articles identified in our search on PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar, 32 were assessed for quality using an appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies (AXIS) and questionnaire items.Results: Quality assessment revealed that only 6 of 32 studies had acceptable reporting (=80% score on the AXIS tool). The most frequently identified shortcomings were failure to address the non-responders, lack of justification for sample size, assessment of outcome variables and demographic results for the survey. Our evaluation of questionnaires revealed that knowledge for need for blood donation, its benefits and site/place for blood donation were assessed by very few studies. With this, issues such as parental/family consent, religious beliefs, and indifference to blood donation process were amongst the common reasons for non-donation. Many studies also failed to ask questions related to procedural information/instructions, which are necessary for promoting voluntary blood donations.Conclusion: Most published KAP studies for blood donation in India were not appropriately described, especially the methodology and result section. These deficiencies could have led to suboptimal interpretation of the prevalent issues. Use of an open-ended and validated KAP questionnaire with a problem-based approach and inclusion of participants from various socio-cultural backgrounds is required for good quality of evidence.

AB  - One of the most well-known anti-targets defining medication cardiotoxicity is the voltage-dependent hERG K + channel, which is well-known for its crucial involvement in cardiac action potential repolarization. Torsades de Pointes, QT prolongation, and sudden death are all caused by hERG (the human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene) inhibition. There is great interest in creating predictive computational (in silico) tools to identify and weed out potential hERG blockers early in the drug discovery process because testing for hERG liability and the traditional experimental screening are complicated, expensive and time-consuming. This study used 2D descriptors of a large curated dataset of 6766 compounds and machine learning approaches to build robust descriptor-based QSAR and predictive classification models for KCNH2 liability. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Ada Boosting, kNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, neural network and stochastic gradient classification classifier algorithms were used to build classification models. If a compound's IC50 value was between 10 mu M and less, it was classified as a blocker (hERG-positive), and if it was more, it was classified as a non-blocker (hERG-negative). Matthew's correlation coefficient formula and F1score were applied to compare and track the developed models' performance. Molecular docking and dynamics studies were performed to understand the cardiotoxicity relating to the hERG-gene. The hERG residues interacting after 100 ns are LEU:697, THR:708, PHE:656, HIS:674, HIS:703, TRP:705 and ASN:709 and the hERG-ligand-16 complex trajectory showed stable behaviour with lesser fluctuations in the entire simulation of 200 ns.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - BackgroundHepatocellular cancer (HCC) typically arises in the background of cirrhosis. The epidemiology of HCC has changed in recent years due to availability of newer antivirals, changing life-styles and greater possibility for early detection. We undertook a multicentric national sentinel surveillance for liver cirrhosis and HCC to assess the attributable risk factors for the development of HCC, both with and without a background of cirrhosis.MethodsData from January 2017 till August 2022 from hospital-based records of eleven participating centers were included. Diagnosed cases of cirrhosis [radiological (multiphase and/or histopathological] and HCC [as per AASLD 2018] were included. History of significant alcohol intake was elicited by AUDIT-C questionnaire.ResultsAltogether 5798 enrolled patients were assessed, of which 2664 patients had HCC. The mean age was 58.2 +/- 11.7 years and 84.3% (n = 2247) were males. Diabetes was found in over a third of those with HCC (n = 1032;39.5%). The most common etiology of HCC was NAFLD (n = 927;35.5%) followed by viral hepatitis B and C and harmful levels of alcohol. Among those with HCC, 27.9% (n = 744) had no cirrhosis. Higher proportion of cirrhotic HCC patients had alcohol as an etiological factor as compared to non-cirrhotic (17.5 vs. 4.7%, p <= 0.001). NAFLD was an etiological factor for a higher proportion of non-cirrhotic HCC patients as compared to cirrhotic HCC (48.2 vs. 30.6%, p <= 0.001). Diabetics more commonly had non-cirrhotic HCC (50.5 vs. 35.2%). The following factors were associated with an occurrence of cirrhotic HCC: male gender (OR 1.372 and 95% CI 1.070-1.759), age above 60 years (OR 1.409 and 95% CI 1.176-1.689), HBV (OR 1.164 and 95% CI 0.928-1.460), HCV (OR 1.228 and 95 CI 0.964-1.565) and harmful consumption of alcohol (OR 3.472 and 95% CI 2.388-5.047). The adjusted odds of non-cirrhotic patients having NAFLD was 1.553 (95% CI 1.290-1.869).ConclusionThis large multi-centric study demonstrates that NAFLD is the most important risk factor for development of both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCC in India and has overtaken viral hepatitis. Awareness campaigns and large-scale screening are required to reduce the high burden of NAFLD-related HCC in India.

AB  - IntroductionThe study evaluates the levels of matrix metalloprotease-8 (MMP-8), and Cathepsin-K (CatK) in peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) among patients with immediate loaded (IL) and delayed-loaded (DL) implants at different time points to know the inflammation and osteogenic status. MethodsThe study population consisted of two groups (n = 25, each group) with a mean age of 28.7 +/- 3.5 years, and PICF was collected. MMP-8 and CatK levels were quantified through ELISA. ResultsWe observed the concentrations of inflammatory markers (MMP-8 and CatK) at three time points in the IL and DL groups. The mean concentration of MMP-8 in the IL group was 9468 +/- 1230 pg/mL, 5547 +/- 1088 pg/mL, and 7248 +/- 1396 pg/mL at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months, respectively; while in the DL group was 10 816 +/- 779.7 pg/mL, 9531 +/- 1245 pg/mL, and 9132 +/- 1265 pg/mL at 2 weeks, 3 and 12 months, respectively. The mean concentration of Cat-K in the IL group was observed at 422.1 +/- 36.46 pg/mL, 242.9 +/- 25.87 pg/mL, and 469 +/- 75.38 pg/mL at 2 weeks, 3, and 12 months, whereas in the DL group was 654.6 +/- 152.9 pg/mL, 314.7 +/- 28.29 pg/mL, and 539.8 +/- 115.1 pg/mL at 2 weeks, 3 months and 12 months, respectively. ConclusionIn this study, the levels of CatK and MMP-8 levels decline at 12 months in both groups, and the IL group shows lower values compared to the DL group; however, no significant changes were observed after analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons (p > 0.025). Therefore, there is not much difference observed in the inflammation process between immediate and delayed loading. (Clinical trial identifier: CTRI/2017/09/009668).

AB  - Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive treatment that can provide highly localized and precise cancer therapy. Despite these advantages, its application in clinical practice remains limited. This is primarily due to the insufficient ablation volume, where blood perfusion plays a significant role. In this study, computa-tional modeling is applied to examine the effects of heterogeneous blood perfusion on the tissue temperature, resultant thermal damage, and ablation volume in the RFA treatment. Two patients' heterogeneous blood perfusion and 3D brain tumor geometry are extracted from their dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data. This patient-specific information is imported into the bioheat transfer model developed in OpenFOAM to predict thermal effects. Results show that the heterogeneous blood perfusion leads to deeper heat penetration in the tumor tissue compared to the simulation in which blood perfusion is assumed to be uniform across the entire tumor. On average, the predicted tissue temperature and ablation volume are 10-11% and 30-38% higher for both patients, respectively, when the heterogeneous blood perfusion is adopted. In addition, the ablation volume is highly susceptible to the applied RF voltage and coolant temperature. These two factors can be optimized to maximize the treatment. However, the optimal settings vary for each patient, highlighting the demand for patient-specific design. Results obtained from this study can assist clinicians and surgeons in optimizing RFA parameters for a specific patient that can improve the treatment efficacy.

AB  - Purpose PACG is one of the leading causes of blindness where lens thickness is a major risk factor for narrow-angle individuals. To our knowledge, no literature has been reported on candidate gene for lens thickness as a quantitative trait (QT). Here, we performed a genome-wide association analysis on lens thickness in the narrow-angle individuals. Materials and Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the narrow angle individuals to investigate comprehensive genetic insights on lens thickness. Results In QT-GWAS, we identified 145 genome-wide suggestive significant loci in the discovery cohort. Subsequently, we observed 13 SNPs that showed statistical significance around the region of PTRRM. Regional association analysis for top significant genotyped variants identified PTPRM as the most likely candidate for increased LT. Integrative bioinformatic analyses confirmed that the associated genomic region has potential regulatory roles for modulating transcription as enhancers. In the replication cohort, the sentinel genotype SNP was further associated significantly (P-value =0.000448) with high LT individuals. In both cohorts, the T allele of rs1941137 in the PTPRM gene indicates as a risk allele for the increased LT. Conclusion In this study, we discovered evidence of a genomic association between chromosomal areas around the PTPRM and increased lens thickness, resulting in a narrow angle. The regulatory components corresponding to PTPRM variations might have a role in the thicker lens. We report that the genomic region near PTPRM, a gene of potential interest, is associated with increased lens thickness.

AB  - Background Ambu AuraGain has proven to be better compared with other supraglottic airway devices in terms of higher first-attempt insertion success rate, time and ease of insertion, high oropharyngeal leak pressure, and fewer complications in children. The performance of the BlockBuster laryngeal mask has not been evaluated in children.Aims The primary objective of this study was to compare the oropharyngeal leak pressure of the BlockBuster laryngeal mask with those of the Ambu AuraGain during controlled ventilation in children.Methods Fifty children aged 6 months to 12 years with normal airways were randomized into group A (Ambu AuraGain) and group B (BlockBuster laryngeal mask). After administration of general anesthesia, an appropriate size supraglottic airway (size 1.5/2.0/2.5) was inserted according to the groups. Oropharyngeal leak pressure, success and ease of supraglottic airway insertion, gastric tube insertion, and ventilatory parameters were noted. The glottic view was graded by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Results Demographic parameters were comparable. The mean oropharyngeal leak pressure in the BlockBuster group (24.72 +/- 6.81 cm H2O) was significantly higher than Ambu AuraGain group (17.20 +/- 4.28 cm H2O) by 7.52 cm H2O (95% CI 4.27 to 10.76; p = 0.001). The mean time for supraglottic airway insertion in the BlockBuster and Ambu AuraGain group was 12.04 +/- 2.55 s and 13.64 +/- 2.76 s, respectively (mean difference- 1.6 s, 95% CI 0.09-3.12; p = 0.04). Ventilatory parameters, first-attempt supraglottic airway insertion success rate, and ease of gastric tube insertion were comparable between the groups. The BlockBuster group showed easy supraglottic airway insertion compared with the Ambu AuraGain group. The BlockBuster group had better glottic views with only the larynx seen in 23 out of 25 children compared to the Ambu AuraGain with only the larynx seen in 19 out of 25 children. No complication was noted in either group. Conclusions We found that the BlockBuster laryngeal mask has higher oropharyngeal leak pressure compared with Ambu AuraGain in a pediatric population.

AB  - ObjectivesDexamethasone sparing strategies have shown success. The feasibility of a dexamethasone-free antiemetic strategy remains undetermined. A prospective, single-arm, pilot study was planned to determine the efficacy of an olanzapine-based, dexamethasone-free, three-drug antiemetic regimen. MethodsChemotherapy naive, adult patients (>= 18 years) who received ondansetron, aprepitant and olanzapine during the first cycle of highly emetogenic chemotherapy were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete response (CR: no vomiting and no use of rescue medications) during the overall period (0-120 hours). ResultsOut of the total of 101 patients enrolled, most were women (82%) and received anthracycline cyclophosphamide (73%) combination therapy. The rate of CR for the overall period was 65% (95% CI 55.2% to 74.5%). The rate of CR for the acute and delayed period was 79% (95% CI 70% to 86.7%) and 76% (95% CI 66.7% to 84.1%). The rate of nausea control rates for the acute, delayed and overall periods were 34%, 29% and 24%, respectively. The grade I, II and III sedation rates over the 5 days were 8%, 5% and 1%, respectively. ConclusionsThe dexamethasone-free antiemetic strategy showed modest efficacy with low incidence of clinically significant somnolence. There is a need to prospectively investigate the role of dexamethasone in the era of newer potent antiemetics in a randomised fashion.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a multicomponent strategy versus usual care in people with type 2 diabetes in South Asia.Design: Economic evaluation from healthcare system and societal perspectives.Setting: Ten diverse urban clinics in India and Pakistan.Participants: 1146 people with type 2 diabetes (575 in the intervention group and 571 in the usual care group) with mean age of 54.2 years, median diabetes duration: 7 years and mean HbA1c: 9.9% (85 mmol/mol) at baseline.Intervention: Multicomponent strategy comprising decision-supported electronic health records and non-physician care coordinator. Control group received usual care.Outcome Measures: Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) per unit achievement in multiple risk factor control (HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol) and SBP < 130/80 mmHg or LDLc < 2.58 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)), ICERs per unit reduction in HbA1c, 5 mmHg unit reductions in systolic BP, 10 unit reductions in LDLc (mg/ dl) (considered as clinically relevant) and ICER per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. ICERs were reported in 2020 purchasing power parity- adjusted international dollars (INT$). The probability of ICERs being costeffective was considered depending on the willingness to pay (WTP) values as a share of GDP per capita for India (Int$ 7041.4) and Pakistan (Int$ 4847.6). Results: Compared to usual care, the annual incremental costs per person for intervention group were Int$ 1061.9 from a health system perspective and Int$ 1093.6 from a societal perspective. The ICER was Int$ 10,874.6 per increase in multiple risk factor control, $2588.1 per one percentage point reduction in the HbA1c, and $1744.6 per 5 unit reduction in SBP (mmHg), and $1271 per 10 unit reduction in LDLc (mg/ dl). The ICER per QALY gained was $33,399.6 from a societal perspective.Conclusions: In a trial setting in South Asia, a multicomponent strategy for diabetes care resulted in better multiple risk factor control at higher costs and may be costeffective depending on the willingness to pay threshold with substantial uncertainty around costeffectiveness for QALYs gained in the short term (2.5 years). Future research needs to confirm the long term costeffectiveness of intensive multifactorial intervention for diabetes care in diverse healthcare settings in LMICs.

AB  - Tumor cells are dynamic in nature; these cells first acquire immune surveillance and then escape from the immune system. Hence, progressed cancer cells distribute and metastasize to other organs via blood vessels as well as from the lymphatic system. Prognosis and treatment of metastatic cancer patients remain a major challenge nowadays. Till now, lots of target -based and immune checkpoint blocker therapies are used to treat disease patients. But these therapies fail to control the dissemination and metastasis of cancer. Before designing a treatment regimen for metastatic patients, understanding the mechanism of tumor cells spreading within lymph vessels remain undetermined. Construction of lymphoid structures since embryonic to adult stage are depend upon LTi. Foundation of lymph node, payer patches and TLO is initiated and regulated through these cells in any part of the body. During tumor growth, newly developed lymph node contained MDSCs and Treg cells which inhibit the immune response and promote tumor invasion and metastasis. LTi reconstituted lymph node can be used for both early and high risk detection of cancers. High and low risk of tumor growth and invasion depend upon the location and composition of immune cells within lymph nodes. However, LTi are not reported as predictive marker in cancer till date. Recent reports in cancer indicate that LTi cells are engaged in the spreading of tumor cells into a lymphatic vessel. Through this review we are trying to brief the development and role of the LTi in immune system during homeostasis and cancer.

AB  - In recent times Gallbladder cancer (GBC) incidences increased many folds in India and are being reported from arsenic hotspots identified in Bihar. The study aims to establish association between arsenic exposure and gallbladder carcinogenesis. In the present study, n = 200 were control volunteers and n = 152 confirmed gallbladder cancer cases. The studied GBC patient's biological samples-gallbladder tissue, gallbladder stone, bile, blood and hair samples were collected for arsenic estimation. Moreover, n = 512 gallbladder cancer patients blood samples were also evaluated for the presence of arsenic to understand exposure level in the population. A significantly high arsenic concentration (p < 0.05) was detected in the blood samples with maximum concentration 389 mu g/L in GBC cases in comparison to control. Similarly, in the gallbladder cancer patients, there was significantly high arsenic concentration observed in gallbladder tissue with highest concentration of 2166 mu g/kg, in gallbladder stones 635 mu g/kg, in bile samples 483 mu g/L and in hair samples 6980 mu g/kg respectively. Moreover, the n = 512 gallbladder cancer patient's blood samples study revealed very significant arsenic concentration in the population of Bihar with maximum arsenic concentration as 746 mu g/L. The raised arsenic concentration in the gallbladder cancer patients' biological samples-gallbladder tissue, gallbladder stone, bile, blood, and hair samples was significantly very high in the arsenic exposed area. The study denotes that the gallbladder disease burden is very high in the arsenic exposed area of Bihar. The findings do provide a strong link between arsenic contamination and increased gallbladder carcinogenesis.

AB  - BackgroundConcordance in chronic disease status has been observed within couples. In urban India and Pakistan, little is known about couple concordance in diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia and associated socioeconomic characteristics and modifiable risk factors. MethodsWe analysed cross-sectional data from 2548 couples from the Centre for cArdio-metabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia cohort in Chennai, Delhi and Karachi. We estimated couple concordance in presence of >= 1 of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia (positive concordance: both spouses (W+H+); negative concordance: neither spouse (W-H-); discordant wife: only wife (W+H-); or discordant husband: only husband (W-H+)). We assessed associations of five socioeconomic and household characteristics, and six modifiable risk factors with couple concordance using multinomial logistic regression models with couples as the unit of analysis (reference: W-H-). ResultsOf the couples, 59.4% (95% CI 57.4% to 61.3%) were concordant in chronic conditions (W+H+: 29.2% (95% CI 27.4% to 31.0%); W-H-: 30.2% (95% CI 28.4%- to 32.0%)); and 40.6% (95% CI 38.7% to 42.6%) discordant (W+H-: 13.1% (95% CI 11.8% to 14.4%); W-H+: 27.6% (95% CI 25.9% to 29.4%)). Compared with couples with no conditions (W-H-), couples had higher relative odds of both having at least one condition if they had higher versus lower levels of: income (OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.47 to 2.80)), wealth (OR 2.66 (95% CI 1.98 to 3.58)) and education (wives' education: OR 1.92 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.86); husbands' education: OR 2.98 (95% CI 1.92 to 4.66)) or weight status (overweight or obesity in both spouses ORs 7.17 (95% CI 4.99 to 10.30)). ConclusionsPositive couple concordance in major chronic conditions is high in urban India and Pakistan, especially among couples with relatively higher socioeconomic position. This suggests that prevention and management focusing on couples at high risk for concordant chronic conditions may be effective and more so in higher socioeconomic groups.

AB  - Background Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs). Localization of the causative tumor in these cases is an arduous task since the culprit lesions are usually small, slow-growing, and can be located almost anywhere from head to toe. Purpose To describe the morphological characteristics of histologically proven PMTs on various radiological modalities. Material and Methods After institutional ethical approval, this retrospective study analyzed 20 cases with a histopathological evidence of PMT. Various imaging characteristics of the tumors on available computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Results The tumors were located in diverse locations: lower extremities (n = 10); head and neck (n = 5); vertebral column (n = 3); pelvis (n = 1); and upper extremities (n = 1). Bone lesions seen on CT had variable morphology: sclerotic (n = 3/8, 37.5%); lytic (n = 3/8, 37.5%), and both lytic and sclerotic (n = 2/8, 25%) with presence of narrow zone of transition in all cases (n = 8/8) and amorphous internal matrix calcifications in 25% of cases (n = 2/8). Of the tumors, 68.4% (n = 13/19) were hypointense on T1 and all of them showed hyperintense signal on T2-weighted and STIR images (n = 19/19) and contrast enhancement (n = 16/16). Of the tumors, 66.7% (n = 6/9) showed restricted diffusion. DOTANOC PET/CT showed tumor uptake in all cases (n = 8/8). Conclusion PMTs may have variable and non-specific tumor appearances on various imaging modalities. However, in an appropriate clinical scenario and a background of suggestive biochemical work-up, the radiologist should keep a high index of suspicion.

AB  - Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a C-cell-derived epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasm. With the exception of rare examples, most are well-differentiated epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasms (also known as neuroendocrine tumors in the taxonomy of the International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] of the World Health Organization [WHO]). This review provides an overview and recent evidence-based data on the molecular genetics, disease risk stratification based on clinicopathologic variables including molecular profiling and histopathologic variables, and targeted molecular therapies in patients with advanced MTC. While MTC is not the only neuroendocrine neoplasm in the thyroid gland, other neuroendocrine neoplasms in the thyroid include intrathyroidal thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms, intrathyroidal parathyroid neoplasms, and primary thyroid paragangliomas as well as metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. Therefore, the first responsibility of a pathologist is to distinguish MTC from other mimics using appropriate biomarkers. The second responsibility includes meticulous assessment of the status of angioinvasion (defined as tumor cells invading through a vessel wall and forming tumor-fibrin complexes, or intravascular tumor cells admixed with fibrin/thrombus), tumor necrosis, proliferative rate (mitotic count and Ki67 labeling index), and tumor grade (low- or high-grade) along with the tumor stage and the resection margins. Given the morphologic and proliferative heterogeneity in these neoplasms, an exhaustive sampling is strongly recommended. Routine molecular testing for pathogenic germline RET variants is typically performed in all patients with a diagnosis of MTC; however, multifocal C-cell hyperplasia in association with at least a single focus of MTC and/or multifocal C-cell neoplasia are morphological harbingers of germline RET alterations. It is of interest to assess the status of pathogenic molecular alterations involving genes other than RET like the MET variants in MTC families with no pathogenic germline RET variants. Furthermore, the status of somatic RET alterations should be determined in all advanced/progressive or metastatic diseases, especially when selective RET inhibitor therapy (e.g., selpercatinib or pralsetinib) is considered. While the role of routine SSTR2/5 immunohistochemistry remains to be further clarified, evidence suggests that patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-avid metastatic disease may also benefit from the option of Lu-177-DOTATATE peptide radionuclide receptor therapy. Finally, the authors of this review make a call to support the nomenclature change of MTC to C-cell neuroendocrine neoplasm to align this entity with the IARC/WHO taxonomy since MTCs represent epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasms of endoderm-derived C-cells.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been implicated in having post-COVID-19 sequelae in both adults and children. There is a lack of good data on the prevalence and risk factors for post-COVID-19 sequelae in children. The authors aimed to review the current literature on post-COVID sequelae. The prevalence of post-COVID sequelae in children is highly variable among studies, with an average of 25%. The sequelae may affect many organ systems, though mood symptoms, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, and sleep problems are common. In many studies, it is difficult to establish a causal association due to the lack of a control group. Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate whether the neuropsychiatric symptoms in children after COVID-19 are due to infection or a result of lockdowns and social restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Children with COVID-19 should be followed by a multidisciplinary team and screened for symptoms, followed by focused laboratory evaluations as needed. There is no specific treatment for the sequelae. Only symptomatic and supportive treatment is required in most cases. More research is necessary to standardize the definitions of sequelae, establish a causal association, assess various treatment options, and the effects of different virus variants, and finally, see the impact of vaccination on the sequelae.

AB  - Linezolid-induced lactic acidosis is a rare, but life-threatening complication of a commonly used drug. Patients present with persistent lactic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, high central venous oxygen saturation and shock. Linezolid causes mitochondrial toxicity due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. This is evidenced by cytoplasmic vacuolations in the myeloid and erythroid precursors of bone marrow smear as illustrated in our case. Discontinuation of the drug, administration of thiamine and haemodialysis reduces lactic acid levels.

AB  - ObjectiveFluorescence-based methods are highly specific and sensitive and have potential in breast cancer detection. Simultaneous fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy during intraoperative procedures of breast cancer have great advantages in detection of tumor margin as well as in classification of tumor to healthy tissues. Intra-operative real-time confirmation of breast cancer tumor margin is the aim of surgeons, and therefore, there is an urgent need for such techniques and devices which fulfill the surgeon's priorities. MethodsIn this article, we propose the development of fluorescence-based smartphone imaging and spectroscopic point-of-care multi-modal devices for detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in tumor margin during removal of tumor. These multimodal devices are portable, cost-effective, noninvasive, and user-friendly. Molecular level sensitivity of fluorescence process shows different behavior in normal, cancerous and marginal tissues. We observed significant spectral changes, such as, red-shift, full-width half maximum (FWHM), and increased intensity as we go towards tumor center from normal tissue. High contrast in fluorescence images and spectra are also recorded for cancer tissues compared to healthy tissues. Preliminary results for the initial trial of the devices are reported in this article. ResultsA total 44 spectra from 11 patients of invasive ductal carcinoma (11 spectra for invasive ductal carcinoma and rest are normal and negative margins) are used. Principle component analysis is used for the classification of invasive ductal carcinoma with an accuracy of 93%, specificity of 75% and sensitivity of 92.8%. We obtained an average 6.17 +/- 1.66 nm red shift for IDC with respect to normal tissue. The red shift and maximum fluorescence intensity indicates p < 0.01. These results described here are supported by histopathological examination of the same sample. ConclusionIn the present manuscript, simultaneous fluorescence-based imaging and spectroscopy is accomplished for the classification of IDC tissues and breast cancer margin detection.

AB  - Sildenafil is the first internationally approved drug for erectile dysfunction. Unsupervised and non-prescribed use of sildenafil among young Indian population has increased in last few years. Sildenafil helps in erection of penis by inhibiting the action of Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) enzyme, present in the vasculature of corpus cavernosum muscle and lengthens the duration of erection. Documented adverse effects of sildenafil are headache, flushing, nasal congestion, dyspepsia, and slight decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.We present a rare case of sudden death due to cerebrovascular hemorrhage after sildenafil use and concom-itant alcohol intake. The history is that a 41-year-old male with no significant past medical and surgical history was staying at a hotel room with a female friend; he had consumed 2 tablets of sildenafil (50 mg each) and alcohol at night. Next morning, he developed uneasiness following which he was taken to the Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The important autopsy findings include edematous brain with about 300 g of clotted blood in the right basal ganglia extending to bilateral ventricles, and in pons region. Other significant findings on microscopic examination were hypertrophic ventricular wall of heart, fatty changes in liver and acute tubular necrosis and hypertensive changes in the kidney.The findings are discussed in the light of the literature about the lethal complications of combined use of sildenafil and alcohol including cerebrovascular accidents. As a forensic pathologist it is the duty of the doctor to execute meticulous autopsy along with ancillary investigations including toxicological analysis and to correlate all these findings to determine the possible effects of drugs when present, so as to gather knowledge about potentially fatal drugs and further create public awareness regarding the same.

TI  - Mapping the immune landscape in small cell lung cancer by analysing expression of immuno-modulators in tissue biopsies and paired blood samples
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) are aggressive tumors with high propensity to metastasize. Recent NCCN guidelines have incorporated immunotherapy in extensive stage SCLC. Limited benefit in few patients compounded by side effects of unwonted immune-checkpoint-inhibitor (ICPI) usage necessitates identification of potential biomarkers predicting response to ICPIs. Attempting this, we analysed expression of various immunoregulatory molecules in tissue biopsies and paired blood samples of SCLC patients. In 40 cases, immunohistochemistry for expression of immune inhibitory receptors CTLA-4, PD-L1 and IDO1 was performed. Matched blood samples were quantified for IFN-gamma, IL-2, TNF-alpha and sCTLA-4 levels using immunoassay and additionally for IDO1 activity (Kynurenine/Tryptophan ratio) using LC-MS. Immunopositivity for PD-L1, IDO1 and CTLA-4 was identified in 9.3%, 6.2% and 71.8% cases, respectively. Concentration of serum IFN-gamma (p-value < 0.001), TNF-alpha (p-value = 0.025) and s-CTLA4 (p-value = 0.08) were higher in SCLC patients while IL-2 was lower (p-value = 0.003) as compared to healthy controls. IDO1 activity was significantly elevated in SCLC cohort (p-value = 0.007). We proffer that SCLC patients show immune suppressive milieu in their peripheral circulation. Analysis of CTLA4 immunohistochemical expression along with s-CTLA4 levels appears prospective as biomarkers for predicting responsiveness to ICPIs. Additionally, evaluation of IDO1 appears cogent both as prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target as well.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of surgical intervention on serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. MethodsA prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnoea for whom continuous positive airway pressure therapy failed or was refused. All patients underwent polysomnography and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 evaluation pre-operatively and at three months post-operatively. The site of surgery was determined using Muller's manoeuvre and ApneaGraph AG 200. ResultsFifteen patients were included with a mean age of 38 years: 11 males and 4 females. The mean pre-operative Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index using polysomnography was 53.7 events per hour, and the mean post-operative Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index at three months was 15.3 events per hour (p = 0.0001). The mean pre-operative serum insulin-like growth factor 1 was 160.2 & mu;g/l, while the mean post-operative value was 236.98 & mu;g/l (p = 0.005). ConclusionIn adult patients with obstructive sleep apnoea for whom continuous positive airway pressure therapy fails, site-specific surgical intervention to treat the obstruction leads to an increase in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels.

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the clinical manifestations, risk factors, treatment modalities and maternal outcomes in pregnant women with lab-confirmed COVID-19 and compare it with COVID-19 negative pregnant women in same age group. DesignMulticentric case-control study. Data sourcesAmbispective primary data collection through paper-based forms from 20 tertiary care centres across India between April and November 2020. Study populationAll pregnant women reporting to the centres with a lab-confirmed COVID-19 positive result matched with controls. Data qualityDedicated research officers extracted hospital records, using modified WHO Case Record Forms (CRF) and verified for completeness and accuracy. Statistical analysisData converted to excel files and statistical analyses done using STATA 16 (StataCorp, TX, USA). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated using unconditional logistic regression. ResultsA total of 76,264 women delivered across 20 centres during the study period. Data of 3723 COVID positive pregnant women and 3744 age-matched controls was analyzed. Of the positive cases 56 center dot 9% were asymptomatic. Antenatal complications like preeclampsia and abruptio placentae were seen more among the cases. Induction and caesarean delivery rates were also higher among Covid positive women. Pre-existing maternal co-morbidities increased need for supportive care. There were 34 maternal deaths out of the 3723(0.9%) positive mothers, while covid negative deaths reported from all the centres were 449 of 72,541 (0 center dot 6%). ConclusionCovid-19 infection predisposed to adverse maternal outcomes in a large cohort of Covid positive pregnant women as compared to the negative controls.

AB  - Hemolysis, a crucial feature of Sickle cell disease (SCD), is a key player for cellular activation leading to various complications including thrombosis. In response to hemolysis, platelets get activated and release components that are necessary for further platelet activation and aggregation. Thus, it is believed that platelets contribute to the development of thrombotic complications. Platelets in SCD are expected to be affected due to common cause of hemolysis. To measure the surface markers of platelets including P-Selectin, Phosphatidyl Serine and integrin alpha IIb beta 3 in SCD patients and healthy controls in order to understand the status of the platelets in SCD. To measure the surface markers of activated platelets using flow cytometry. Since mitochondria and calcium play an important role in cellular functions, the mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium content of platelets in SCD were also evaluated using flow cytometry. In the present study, we have observed significant increase of calcium level in SCD platelets. Further, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in SCD platelets was found to be significantly higher when compared to platelets of healthy controls. Though the surface markers of activated platelets in SCD remain unchanged, increased level of calcium and mitochondrial membrane potential loss suggest that the platelets in SCD are more prone to become activated. In order to understand the status of the platelets in SCD, apart from the surface markers, it is also important to assess the calcium levels and mitochondrial membrane potential of platelets.

AB  - Objectives: We determined the pulse oximetry benefit in pediatric pneumonia mortality risk stratification and chest-indrawing pneumonia in-hospital mortality risk factors.Methods: We report the characteristics and in-hospital pneumonia-related mortality of children aged 2-59 months who were included in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations dataset. We developed multivariable logistic regression models of chest-indrawing pneumonia to identify mortality risk factors.Results: Among 285,839 children, 164,244 (57.5%) from hospital-based studies were included. Pneumonia case fatality risk (CFR) without pulse oximetry measurement was higher than with measurement (5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6-5.9% vs 2.1%, 95% CI 1.9-2.4%). One in five children with chest-indrawing pneumonia was hypoxemic (19.7%, 95% CI 19.0-20.4%), and the hypoxemic CFR was 10.3% (95% CI 9.1-11.5%). Other mortality risk factors were younger age (either 2-5 months [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 9.94, 95% CI 6.67-14.84] or 6-11 months [aOR 2.67, 95% CI 1.71-4.16]), moderate malnutrition (aOR 2.41, 95% CI 1.87-3.09), and female sex (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.32).Conclusion: Children with a pulse oximetry measurement had a lower CFR. Many children hospitalized with chest-indrawing pneumonia were hypoxemic and one in 10 died. Young age and moderate malnutri-tion were risk factors for in-hospital chest-indrawing pneumonia-related mortality. Pulse oximetry should be integrated in pneumonia hospital care for children under 5 years.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

AB  - Tracheal tissue engineering has been an alternative treatment for long-term tracheal stenosis due to the lack of donors and suitable tracheal implants. This work is meant to construct a novel hybrid tracheal support of synthetic and natural polymers using direct ink writing. A blend of polycaprolactone (PCL) and medical-grade polyurethane (PU) as synthetic material was used to fabricate tubular grafts. The synthetic graft was coated with various combinations of alginate (A) and gelatin (G) solutions using 3D printing to prepare hybrid tracheal scaffolds. The novelty in this method was the coating of the natural polymeric solution by extruding the solution over a rotating tubular graft by exploiting the advantages of 3D printing. The synthetic part has mechanical support, and the coated natural material has enhanced biological activities. Key assessments such as rheological investigations and printability studies were performed to characterize the flow behavior and fidelity of the printed constructs. Based on the above investigations, suitable combinations of alginate and gelatin (A/G) were chosen and used for further investigations. The effect of natural polymer coating using 3D printing over PCL/PU scaffold was carefully investigated using various physicochemical, morphological and mechanical investigations. Further, the hybrid tracheal scaffolds were evaluated for biological assessments such as proliferation, cytotoxicity and cell adhesion assay using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The biological investigations showed that the coated scaffolds yielded improved biocompatibility compared to synthetic scaffolds and could be a potential tissue-engineered solution to tracheal regeneration.

AB  - Since the birth of civilization, people have recognized that infectious microbes cause serious and often fatal diseases in humans. One of the most dangerous characteristics of microorganisms is their propensity to form biofilms. It is linked to the development of long-lasting infections and more severe illness. An obstacle to eliminating such intricate structures is their resistance to the drugs now utilized in clinical practice (biofilms). Finding new compounds with anti-biofilm effect is, thus, essential. Infections caused by bacterial biofilms are something that nanotechnology has lately shown promise in treating. More and more studies are being conducted to determine whether nanoparticles (NPs) are useful in the fight against bacterial infections. While there have been a small number of clinical trials, there have been several in vitro outcomes examining the effects of antimicrobial NPs. Nanotechnology provides secure delivery platforms for targeted treatments to combat the wide range of microbial infections caused by biofilms. The increase in pharmaceuticals' bioactive potential is one of the many ways in which nanotechnology has been applied to drug delivery. The current research details the utilization of several nanoparticles in the targeted medication delivery strategy for managing microbial biofilms, including metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, liposomes, micro-, and nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, and polymeric nanoparticles. Our understanding of how these nanosystems aid in the fight against biofilms has been expanded through their use.

AB  - BackgroundAdalimumab in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) such as methotrexate has a proven efficacy in the management of paediatric non-infectious uveitis. However, many children experience significant intolerance to methotrexate while on this combination, leaving a dilemma for clinicians for choosing the subsequent therapeutic roadmap. Continuation of adalimumab monotherapy might be an alternative feasible option under such settings. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of adalimumab monotherapy in paediatric non-infectious uveitis.MethodsChildren with non-infectious uveitis on adalimumab monotherapy (from August 2015 to June 2022) following intolerance to accompanying methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil were included in this retrospective study. Data were collected at the initiation of adalimumab monotherapy and at three monthly intervals until the last visit. The primary outcome was to evaluate disease control on adalimumab monotherapy as determined by the proportion of patients who had less than a 2-step worsening in uveitis (as per SUN score) and no additional systemic immunosuppression during follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were visual outcome, complications and side-effect profile of adalimumab monotherapy.ResultsData was collected for 28 patients (56 eyes). The most common uveitis type and course were anterior and chronic uveitis respectively. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis was the most common underlying diagnosis. During the study period, 23 (82.14%) of the study subjects met the primary outcome. On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 81.25% (95% CI; 60.6-91.7%) children maintained remission at 12 months on adalimumab monotherapy.ConclusionContinuation of adalimumab monotherapy is an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis in children who are intolerant to the combination of adalimumab and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients, affecting almost one in four critically ill children and one in three neonates. Higher stages of AKI portend worse outcomes. Identifying AKI timely and instituting appropriate measures to prevent and manage severe AKI is important, since it is independently associated with mortality. Methods to predict severe AKI should be applied to all critically ill patients. Assessment of volume status to prevent the development of fluid overload is useful to prevent adverse outcomes. Patients with metabolic or clinical complications of AKI need prompt kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Various modes of KRT are available, and the choice of modality depends most on the technical competence of the center, patient size, and hemodynamic stability. Given the significant risk of chronic kidney disease, patients with AKI require long-term follow-up. It is important to focus on improving awareness about AKI, incorporate AKI prevention as a quality initiative, and improve detection, prevention, and management of AKI with the aim of reducing acute and long-term morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is one of the direct indicators of follicular pool but no standard cutoff has been defined for diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The present study evaluated the serum AMH levels among different PCOS phenotypes and correlated the AMH levels with clinical, hormonal, and metabolic parameters among Indian PCOS women. Mean serum AMH was 12.39 +/- 5.3ng/mL in PCOS cohort and 3.83 +/- 1.5 ng/mL in non-PCOS cohort (P < 0.01). Out of 608 PCOS women, 273 (44.9%) women belonged to phenotype A, 230 (37.8%) women were phenotype D. Phenotypes C and B were 12.17% and 5.10% respectively. Among those with the highest AMH group (AMH>20ng/ml; 8.05%), majority belonged to phenotype A. Menstrual cycle length, serum testosterone, fasting total cholesterol levels, and follicle number per ovary had positive correlation with serum anti-Mullerian levels (P < 0.05). AMH cutoff for the diagnosis of PCOS was calculated as >= 6.06 ng/mL on ROC analysis with sensitivity and specificity of 91.45% and 90.71% respectively. The study shows high serum AMH levels in PCOS are associated with worse clinical, endocrinological, and metabolic parameters. These levels may be used to counsel patients regarding treatment response, help in individualized management and prediction of reproductive and long-term metabolic outcomes.

AB  - Background Severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) confers higher odds of mortality. Timely recognition and early initiation of preventive measures may help mitigate the injury further. Novel biomarkers may aid in the early detection of AKI. The utility of these biomarkers across various clinical settings in children has not been evaluated systematically.Objective To synthesize the currently available evidence on different novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AKI in pediatric patients.Data sources We searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) for studies published between 2004 and May 2022.Study eligibility criteria Cohort and cross-sectional studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of biomarkers in predicting AKI in children were included.Participants and interventions Participants in the study included children (aged less than 18 years) at risk of AKI.Study appraisal and synthesis methods We used the QUADAS-2 tool for the quality assessment of the included studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) was meta-analyzed using the random-effect inverse-variance method. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were generated using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model.Results We included 92 studies evaluating 13,097 participants. Urinary NGAL and serum cystatin C were the two most studied biomarkers, with summary AUROC of 0.82 (0.77-0.86) and 0.80 (0.76-0.85), respectively. Among others, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, L-FABP, and IL-18 showed fair to good predicting ability for AKI. We observed good diagnostic performance for predicting severe AKI by urine L-FABP, NGAL, and serum cystatin C.Limitations Limitations were significant heterogeneity and lack of well-defined cutoff value for various biomarkers.Conclusions and implications of key findings Urine NGAL, L-FABP, TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and cystatin C showed satisfactory diagnostic accuracy in the early prediction of AKI. To further improve the performance of biomarkers, they need to be integrated with other risk stratification models.

AB  - Background and purposeStudies on the relationship between Phosphodiesterase 4 D (PDE4D) gene polymorphism with the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) have shown discordant results. The present meta-analysis was aimed to clarify the relationship between PDE4D gene polymorphism with the risk of IS by estimating pooled analysis of published epidemiological studies.MethodsA comprehensive literature search for all the published articles was performed in various electronic databases, including PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Trip Database, Worldwide Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar up to 22(nd) December 2021. Pooled Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) under dominant, recessive, and allelic models were calculated. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity (Caucasian vs. Asian) was performed to examine the reliability of these findings. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to detect the heterogeneity between studies. Finally, Begg's funnel plot was used to assess the potential for publication bias.ResultsIn our meta-analysis, we identified a total of 47 case-control studies with 20,644 ischemic stroke (IS) cases and 23,201 control subjects, including 17 studies of Caucasian descent and 30 studies of Asian descent. Our findings suggest that there was a significant relationship between SNP45 gene polymorphism and risk of IS (Recessive model: OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.31-3.23), SNP83 overall (allelic model: OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.42), Asian (allelic model: OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.37), and SNP89 Asian (Dominant model: OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.29-1.59, recessive model: OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.28-1.58) respectively. However, no significant relationship was found between SNP32, SNP41, SNP26, SNP56, and SNP87 gene polymorphisms and risk of IS.ConclusionFindings of this meta-analysis conclude that SNP45, SNP83, and SNP89 polymorphism could be capable of increasing stroke susceptibility in Asians but not in the Caucasian population. Genotyping of SNP 45, 83, 89 polymorphisms may be used as a predictor for the occurrence of IS.

AB  - PurposeTo compare effect of topical cyclosporine-A 0.05% (CsA) and chloroquine phosphate 0.03% (CHQ) as an adjunct to standard therapy in maintaining post-laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) ocular surface stability.MethodsRandomized controlled trial on 100 eyes undergoing femtosecond-LASIK randomized into three groups: 33 eyes in Group I (Standard Treatment group), 34 eyes in Group II (CsA group) and 33 eyes in Group III (CHQ group). Standard treatment included topical moxifloxacin, topical prednisolone and carboxymethyl cellulose. Group II received topical CsA 0.05% twice daily for three months and group III received topical CHQ 0.03% twice daily for three months in addition to standard treatment. Primary outcome measure was change in ocular surface disease index (OSDI) at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures were tear break up time (TBUT), Schirmer-I score, tear film osmolarity, tear film MMP-9 and visual acuity. Follow-up was performed at postoperative 1, 3 and 6 months.ResultsAt 6 months, OSDI score, MMP-9, tear osmolarity, TBUT and Schirmer score were significantly better in both CsA and CHQ groups as compared with controls (p < 0.001). OSDI, Tear osmolarity, TBUT, MMP-9 levels were comparable in CsA and CHQ group (p > 0.05). In CsA group, tear film MMP-9 levels at 6 months were comparable to preoperative baseline (p = 0.09). There was no significant change in the Schirmer score from baseline in the CsA group; in addition, the Schirmer score was significantly better than the CHQ group at 6 months (p = 0.02). Visual acuity was comparable in all three groups. Adverse effects including burning sensation, stinging, pain and redness were reported by ten patients (CsA group- 3, CHQ group-7; p = 0.28).ConclusionBoth CsA and CHQ are useful adjuncts to standard therapy in maintaining ocular surface stability after refractive surgery. Cyclosporine A has more potent and sustained anti-inflammatory effect with less ocular irritative effects.

AB  - BackgroundBacopa monnieri (BM), a commonly used herb, has shown neuroprotective effects in animal and in vitro studies; but human studies on patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have been inconclusive. Further high-quality trials are required to conclusively state the utility of BM in AD and other neurodegenerative dementias. MethodsIn the present study, we did a narrative review of the current challenges in designing clinical trials of BM in dementia and their evidence-based recommendations. ResultsMany facets of the BM trials need improvement, especially effect size and sample size estimation. Current assessment and outcomes measures need a more holistic approach and newer scales for diagnosing and monitoring prodromal AD. The stringent guidelines in CONSORT and STROBE are often considered difficult to implement for clinical trials in ayurvedic medications like BM. However, adherence to these guidelines will undoubtedly improve the quality of evidence and go a long way in assessing whether BM is efficacious in treating AD/prodromal AD patients and other neurodegenerative dementias. ConclusionFuture studies on BM should implement more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate sample size of accurately diagnosed AD/prodromal AD patients, administering a recommended dosage of BM and for a pre-specified time calculated to achieve adequate power for the study. Researchers should also develop and validate more sensitive cognitive scales, especially for prodromal AD. BM should be evaluated in accordance with the same rigorous standards as conventional drugs to generate the best quality evidence.

AB  - There is a plethora of papers on the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in various benign and malignant intracranial tumors, and it is possible to overlook the most important and landmark studies. Thus, the necessity of citation analysis arises, which reviews the most cited articles and recognizes the impact made by these articles. Utilizing the 100 most cited articles describing the use of SRS for intracranial and spinal pathologies, this article aims to provide meaningful information regarding the historical trends and recent directions in which this field is headed. We performed a search of the Web of Science database using the keywords "stereotactic radiosurgery," "gamma knife," "GKRS," "gamma knife radiosurgery," "LINAC," and "Cyberknife" on May 14, 2022. Our search retrieved a total of 30,652 articles published between the years 1968 and 2017. The top 100 cited articles were arranged in descending order based on citation count (CC) and citation per year (CY). The journal with the largest number of publications as well as citation count was the International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics (n = 33), followed by Journal of Neurosurgery (n = 25). The most cited article was authored by Andrews, which was published in 2004 in The Lancet (1699 CC, 89.42 CY). Flickinger, with 25 papers and 7635 total citations, was the author with the highest impact. Lunsford, with 25 publications and total citations of 7615, was a close second. The USA was the leading country with the maximum number of total citations (n = 23,054). Ninety-two articles described the use of SRS for intracranial pathologies (metastases, n = 38; AVM, n = 16; vestibular schwannoma, n = 9; meningioma, n = 8; trigeminal neuralgia, n = 6; sellar lesion, n = 2; glioma, n = 2; functional, n = 1; and procedure related, n = 10). Eight studies describing spinal radiosurgery were included, out of which four were on spinal metastases. Citation analyses of the top 100 articles revealed that the focus of research in the field of SRS started with functional neurosurgery and progressed to benign intracranial tumors and AVMs. More recently, central nervous system (CNS) metastases have received the maximum attention with 38 articles, including 14 randomized controlled trials finding a place in the top 100 cited articles. Presently, the use of SRS is concentrated in developed countries. Efforts need to be made for more widespread use in developing nations to bring the maximum possible benefits of this focused noninvasive treatment to a wider population.

AB  - Human skin is continually exposed to internal and external forces, dynamic as well as static. The skin is normally flexible and can resist mechanical trauma due to friction, pressure, vibration, suction and laceration to a considerable degree. However, an excess of these forces can abnormally affect the structure and function of the skin, setting the stage for the development of a skin disorder. Repetitive trauma can cause lichenification, hyperpigmentation, erythema, scaling, fissuring, blisters, ulceration and chronic alterations. Frictional dermatoses is an under-recognised entity with no clear-cut definition and encompasses a variety of terms such as frictional dermatitis, frictional melanosis, frictional pigmentary dermatoses and certain other named entities, many of which are confusing. The authors propose to define frictional dermatoses as 'a group of disorders caused by repetitive trauma to the skin as a result of friction of varied aetiology which can have a wide range of cutaneous manifestations depending on the type of insult.' The exact prevalence of frictional dermatoses as a separate entity is unknown. Authors who conducted this review include a group of dermatologists and post graduate students from various institutions. Literature was reviewed through PubMed, Medscape, Medline, ResearchGate and Google Scholar using the terms 'frictional dermatitis,' 'friction and skin,' 'dermatoses and culture,' 'clothing dermatitis,' 'friction melanosis,' 'PPE induced dermatoses in COVID-19 era,' etc. A total of 122 articles were reviewed and 100 articles among them were shortlisted and included in the study, after removing duplications. The review was followed up with further deliberation which resulted in the formulation of a new definition and classification of frictional dermatoses taking into account the morphology, histopathological characteristics, anatomical region affected and the major predisposing factors. The rising incidence of mechanical dermatoses in the COVID-19 era was also emphasised.

AB  - The GNE-associated V727M mutation is one of the most prevalent ethnic founder mutations in the Asian HIBM cohort; however, its role in inducing disease phenotype remains largely elusive. In this study, the function of this hotspot mutation was profoundly investigated. For this, V727M mutation-specific altered expression profile and potential networks were explored. The relevant muscular disorder-specific in vivo studies and patient data were further analyzed, and the key altered molecular pathways were identified. Our study found that the GNEV727M mutation resulted in a deregulated lincRNA profile, the majority of which (91%) were associated with a down-regulation trend. Further, in silico analysis of associated targets showed their active role in regulating Wnt, TGF-beta, and apoptotic signaling. Interestingly, COL6a3 was found as a key target of these lincRNAs. Further, GSEA analysis showed HIBM patients with variable COL6A3 transcript levels have significant alteration in many critical pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, myogenesis, and apoptotic signaling. Interestingly, 12 of the COL6A3 coexpressed genes also showed a similar altered expression profile in HIBM. A similar altered trend in COL6A3 and coexpressed genes were found in in vivo HIBM disease models as well as in multiple other skeletal disorders. Thus, the COL6A3-specific 13 gene signature seems to be altered in multiple muscular disorders. Such deregulation could play a pivotal role in regulating many critical processes such as extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, and skeletal muscle development. Thus, investigating this novel COL6A3-specific 13 gene signature provides valuable information for understanding the molecular cause of HIBM and may also pave the way for better diagnosis and effective therapeutic strategies for many muscular disorders.

AB  - Background. This paper reports the baseline characteristics and outcomes of 266 Namibian patients in the Global Registry of Rheumatic Heart Disease.
   Objective. To describe clinical findings and outcomes in a cohort of children and adults with rheumatic heart disease in Namibia.
   Methods. Prospective study of all patients with rheumatic heart disease at Windhoek Central Hospital between January 2010 and November 2012.
   Results. A total of 266 patients were enrolled; median age was 22 years, 72.6% were <30 years old and 60.5% female. The majority (62.8%) had moderate-severe disease; 48.9% were in congestive cardiac failure. Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis was used by 34.2%. Warfarin was used by 75.3% (n=64/85) with clinical indications. Forty-seven (17.6%) had previous valve interventions, of whom 40 (15.0%) had mechanical valve replacements. Over a 2-year follow-up period 19.1% of patients died. Severe valve involvement at enrolment was independently associated with mortality (24.6% v. 5.1% in those without severe disease; hazard ratio 4.9; 95% confidence interval 1.50 - 15.98). Sixty-five (29.8%) of the 218 without previous intervention had valvular intervention after enrolment.
   Conclusions. In Namibia rheumatic heart disease affects young people who present with severe disease and have a high case fatality rate. Rates of secondary prevention were low. These findings have informed the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Rheumatic Heart Disease in Namibia.

AB  - Small perforations are often managed with cyanoacrylate glue - bandage contact lens (BCL). An additional layer with substances like sterile drape often enhances the strength of the glue. Herein, we describe a novel method of using anterior lens capsule as biological drape to secure perforation. The anterior capsule was secured from femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and placed over the perforation after folding it twice. The area was dried and a small aliquot of cyanoacrylate glue was applied over it. The BCL was applied over it after the glue was dry. In our series of five patients, none of them needed repeat surgery and all cases healed by three months without vascularization. It is a unique technique to secure small corneal perforations.

AB  - Viral infections are among the major causes of acute liver failure (ALF) worldwide. While the role of agents such as hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses in precipitating ALF are well known, improvements in serological assays have led to the detection of viral agents such as Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus etc. as atypical causes of ALF. Despite the plethora of literature available on viral hepatitis and ALF, there is very limited large-scale epidemiologic data on the prevalence, risk factors of progression and outcomes in ALF of viral causes. This is important as viral infections remain the leading cause of ALF in the East and in developing countries, while the impact of viral ALF in the West has largely been ameliorated by effective vaccination and sanitization programs. This review focuses specifically on the available prognostic scores that aid in the management of ALF of viral etiologies while also briefly reviewing the current literature on newer viral agents known to cause ALF, risk factors of progression, outcomes and how management algorithms can be developed by incorporation of prognostic scoring systems for referral and transplant listing.

AB  - Objective: Chronic 'displaced' displaced type II fractures, though uncommon, are difficult to manage. They usually require a transoral procedure followed by a posterior instrumented fusion. We describe here, a new method to reduce the fractured displaced odontoid using a posterior cervical approach only.
   Methods: Prospective and observational, n= 14 had a 'displaced and irreducible' old fracture dens causing cord compression (type I, 1; type II, 13). They underwent a novel technique to reduce the fracture. The C1 arch was first drilled and removed. The C1 lateral masses on both sides were then drilled completely and a spacer was placed between the occiput and C2 facet. Following this, an intraoperative reducing maneuver was performed, utilizing the spacer as a fulcrum, and then achieving complete reduction and realignment.
   Results: All patients improved clinically (mean Nurick preoperative score: 4.07 +/- 0.8; the postoperative score was 1.3 +/- 0.4). The mean correction in effective canal diameter was 74.3%+/- 9.5% and the mean correction in actual canal diameter was 77%+/- 8.7%. Solid bone fusion was demonstrated in 12 patients with at least 1-year follow-up (follow-up range, 12-35 months; mean, 21.8 +/- 9.8 months).
   Conclusion: The new described modification of distraction, compression extension, and reduction seems to be effective for 'displaced' chronic fracture dens with cord compression. It avoids additional transoral surgery in these patients.

KW  - Pretemporal transcavernous approach
AB  - The management of basilar apex aneurysms, in present days, largely falls in the domain of endovascular treatment.(1) Surgical clipping of basilar apex aneurysm is technically demanding because of the anatomic complexity of the location and close relation to the perforators.(2) However, there are selected cases where microsurgery still has a role to play especially when the anatomic configuration of aneurysm makes endovascular treatment less feasible and long-term aneurysm occlusion questionable.In2-4 this operative video, we present a case of basilar apex aneurysm in a 27-year-old woman who presented with a history of ictus 2 months ago with left hemiparesis. DSA showed a high riding basilar apex aneurysm. Because it was a wide neck aneurysm, traditional endovascular coiling was not suitable and advanced or newer endovascular devices were not feasible because of the financial constraints of the patient. Hence, plan for surgical clipping using right side single piece FTOZ craniotomy and pretemporal transcavernous approach was made. The patient consented to the procedure and publication of her image. The pretemporal transcavernous approach allows the temporal lobe to fall back, minimizes brain retraction, and provides a wide operative corridor to the basilar apex region.(4-6) The patient made a good postoperative recovery with no new-onset neurological deficit and with complete resolution of hemiparesis on the 3-month follow-up. This video attempts to highlight that the pretemporal transcavernous approach remains a useful technique for wide neck and complex basilar apex aneurysms and in experienced hands can be safely performed with minimal complications.

AB  - Simple Summary Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations are at increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer and often undergo operations to remove both their ovaries in order to prevent ovarian cancer. The impact of this operation on breast cancer risk is uncertain; thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine it. We found that this operation was not linked with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer when considering both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers together but was linked with a reduced risk of breast cancer when considering BRCA2 carriers alone. If a woman had this operation after developing breast cancer, it was not related to a reduced chance of developing cancer in the other breast. However, it was associated with increased survival following breast cancer when considering BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers together and BRCA1 carriers alone. These findings may have important implications for counselling for women in the clinic. Background: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is the gold standard method of ovarian cancer risk reduction, but the data are conflicting regarding the impact on breast cancer (BC) outcomes. This study aimed to quantify BC risk/mortality in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers after RRSO. Methods: We conducted a systematic review (CRD42018077613) of BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers undergoing RRSO, with the outcomes including primary BC (PBC), contralateral BC (CBC) and BC-specific mortality (BCSM) using a fixed-effects meta-analysis, with subgroup analyses stratified by mutation and menopause status. Results: RRSO was not associated with a significant reduction in the PBC risk (RR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.59-1.21) or CBC risk (RR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.65-1.39) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers combined but was associated with reduced BC-specific mortality in BC-affected BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers combined (RR = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.18-0.39). Subgroup analyses showed that RRSO was not associated with a reduction in the PBC risk (RR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.68-1.17) or CBC risk (RR = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.59-1.24) in BRCA1 carriers nor a reduction in the CBC risk in BRCA2 carriers (RR = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.07-1.74) but was associated with a reduction in the PBC risk in BRCA2 carriers (RR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.41-0.97) and BCSM in BC-affected BRCA1 carriers (RR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.30-0.70). The mean NNT = 20.6 RRSOs to prevent one PBC death in BRCA2 carriers, while 5.6 and 14.2 RRSOs may prevent one BC death in BC-affected BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers combined and BRCA1 carriers, respectively. Conclusions: RRSO was not associated with PBC or CBC risk reduction in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers combined but was associated with improved BC survival in BC-affected BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers combined and BRCA1 carriers and a reduced PBC risk in BRCA2 carriers.

AB  - Background Suboptimal exposure to antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs has been associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes. We aimed to investigate estimates and determinants of first-line anti-TB drug pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents at a global level.
   Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science (1990-2021) for pharmacokinetic studies of first-line anti-TB drugs in children and adolescents. Individual patient data were obtained from authors of eligible studies. Summary estimates of total/extrapolated area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h post-dose (AUC(0-24)) and peak plasma concentration (C-max) were assessed with random-effects models, normalised with current World Health Organization-recommended paediatric doses. Determinants of AUC(0-24) and C-max were assessed with linear mixed-effects models.
   Results Of 55 eligible studies, individual patient data were available for 39 (71%), including 1628 participants from 12 countries. Geometric means of steady-state AUC0-24 were summarised for isoniazid (18.7 (95% CI 15.5-22.6) h.mg.L-1), rifampicin (34.4 (95% CI 29.4-40.3) h.mg.L-1), pyrazinamide (375.0 (95% CI 339.9-413.7) h.mg.L-1) and ethambutol (8.0 (95% CI 6.4-10.0) h.mg.L-1). Our multivariate models indicated that younger age (especially <2 years) and HIV-positive status were associated with lower AUC(0-24) for all first-line anti-TB drugs, while severe malnutrition was associated with lower AUC(0-24) for isoniazid and pyrazinamide. N-acetyltransferase 2 rapid acetylators had lower isoniazid AUC(0-24) and slow acetylators had higher isoniazid AUC(0-24) than intermediate acetylators. Determinants of Cmax were generally similar to those for AUC(0-24).
   Conclusions This study provides the most comprehensive estimates of plasma exposures to first-line anti-TB drugs in children and adolescents. Key determinants of drug exposures were identified. These may be relevant for population-specific dose adjustment or individualised therapeutic drug monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical biochemistry reference intervals (RIs) play a crucial role in interpreting patient test results and making informed clinical decisions. Using data from an ongoing Indian Council of Medical Research-National task force study on healthy women, normative ranges for commonly analyzed biochemical analytes were established.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 13,181 women of reproductive age (18-40 years) were recruited from different urban and rural regions of the country, of which 9898 women signed an informed consent were included. Among these, women having features of hyperandrogenism, menstrual cycle irregularities, and comorbidities were excluded. RIs of 22 analytes were computed in the remaining 938 women controls. To estimate the 95% range of the reference distribution, the limits of the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile were used in the study.
   RESULTS: Mean +/- standard deviation of age and body mass index of participants was 30.12 +/- 6.32 years and 22.8 +/- 3.36 kg/m2 respectively. Centiles (2.5th- 97.5th) of liver function parameters, lipid parameters, glycaemic parameters, and renal parameters are presented. No significant difference in analytes was observed in relation to the area of residence, and age groups except in albumin (P = 0.03). The distribution of most of the parameters was consistent with the various RI studies conducted in India as well as other countries.
   CONCLUSION: This is the first study generating biochemical RIs data among a large representative sample of healthy reproductive-age women recruited using a robust design across the country. The resource may serve as a reference range for common biochemical analytes for future in this age group.

AB  - Tuberculosis involving the spinal cord is associated with high mortality and disabling long-term sequelae. Although tuberculous radiculomyelitis is the most frequent complication, pleomorphic clinical manifestations exist. Diagnosis can be challenging among patients with isolated spinal cord tuberculosis due to diverse clinical and radiological presentations. The principles of management of tuberculosis of the spinal cord are primarily derived from, and dependent upon, trials on tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Although facilitating mycobacterial killing and controlling host inflammatory response within the nervous system remain the primary objectives, several unique features require attention. The paradoxical worsening is more frequent, often with devastating outcomes. The role of anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids in adhesive tuberculous radiculomyelitis remains unclear. Surgical interventions may benefit a small proportion of patients with spinal cord tuberculosis. Currently, the evidence base in the management of spinal cord tuberculosis is limited to uncontrolled small-scale data. Despite the gargantuan burden of tuberculosis, particularly in lower and middle-income countries, large-scale cohesive data are surprisingly sparse. In this review, we highlight the varied clinical and radiological presentations, performance of various diagnostic modalities, summarize data on the efficacy of treatment options, and propose a way forward to improve outcomes in these patients.

AB  - Glial tumors are a relatively new indication for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Traditionally, SRS has been considered to be an inadequate treatment for glial tumors as these are diffuse tumors, but SRS is a highly focused treatment. Tumor delineation can be challenging given the diffuse nature of the gliomas. It has been recommended to include the T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) altered signal intensity areas in addition to the contrast enhancing part in the treatment plan of glioblastoma in order to increase the coverage. Some have recommended to include 5 mm margins to cover up for the diffusely infiltrative nature of the glioblastoma. The most common indication of SRS in patients with glioblastoma multiforme is tumor recurrence. SRS has also been used as a boost to the residual tumor or tumor bed after surgical excision before conventional radiotherapy. The addition of bevacizumab has been recently tried along with SRS in patients with recurrent glioblastoma to decrease radiation toxicity. Besides, SRS has also been used in patients with low-grade gliomas following recurrence. Brainstem gliomas, which are usually low-grade gliomas, are another indication for SRS. Outcomes following the use of SRS are comparable with external beam radiotherapy in brainstem gliomas, whereas the risks of radiation-induced complications is less. SRS has also been used in other glial tumors such as gangliogliomas and ependymomas.

AB  - Skull base paragangliomas, also known as glomus tumors, are grouped as glomus jugulare or glomus tympanicum. Paragangliomas are rare tumors, with an estimated incidence of 1 case per million persons. They occur more commonly in females and are more common in the fifth or sixth decade of life. Management of these tumors traditionally involved surgical excision. However, surgical excision can result in high complication rates, particularly cranial nerve palsies. Stereotactic radiosurgery has been shown to yield tumor control rates of more than 90%. A recent meta-analysis reported improvement in neurological status in 48.7% of cases, while it stabilized in 39.3% of patients. Transient deficits such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and hemifacial spasm developed following SRS in 5.8% of patients, while 2.1% of patients developed permanent deficits. There is no difference in the rate of tumor control between different radiosurgery techniques. Dose-fractionated SRS can be used for large tumors to decrease the risk of radiation-induced complications.

AB  - Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are a relatively rare intracranial vascular malformation. The various treatment options for DAVFs include observation, compression therapy, endovascular therapy, radiosurgery, or surgery. A combination of these therapies may also be used. The treatment choice for DAVFs depends on the type of fistula, the severity of symptoms, DAVF angioarchitecture, and the efficacy and safety of treatments. The use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in DAVFs started in the late 1970s. There is a delay before the fistula gets obliterated after SRS and there is a risk of hemorrhage from the fistula till the fistula gets obliterated. Initial reports described the role of SRS in small DAVFs without severe symptoms, which were inaccessible by endovascular or surgical measures or in combination with embolization in larger DAVFs. SRS can be appropriate for indirect cavernous sinus DAVF fistulas (Barrow type B, C, and D). Borden types II and III and Cognard types IIb-V DAVFs have a high risk of hemorrhage and are traditionally considered less favorable to be treated with SRS as immediate treatment is required to decrease the risk of hemorrhage. However, recently SRS has been tried in these high-grade DAVF as a monotherapy. Factors that have a positive impact on the obliteration rates of DAVF following SRS are the location of DAVF with the cavernous sinus DAVF having much better obliteration rates than DAVF located at other locations, Borden Type I or Cognard Types III or IV DAVFs, absence of CVD, hemorrhage at the time of initial presentation, and target volume lesser than 1.5 mL.

AB  - Arteriovenous malformations ( AVMs) are common intracranial vascular anomalies. Common treatment modalities used to manage AVMs are surgical excision, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Large AVMs are defined as AVMs larger than 10 cm(3) and pose a therapeutic challenge with high rates of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Single-stage SRS is a good option for small AVMs but carries high risks of radiation-induced complications in large AVMs. Volume-staged SRS (VS-SRS) is a newer strategy used in large AVMs that allows one to deliver an optimal radiation dose to the AVMs while reducing the risk of radiation damage to the normal brain. It involves the division of AVM into multiple small sectors which are irradiated at different time intervals with high radiation doses. Good obliteration rates with less risk of radiation-induced complications have been described in the literature with VS-SRS.

KW  - Neurointensive care units
AB  - BackgroundPatients in the neurointensive care unit (NICU) fail extubation despite successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Parameters currently used in the general intensive care unit do not accurately predict extubation success in the NICU. In this study, peak cough expiratory flow rate, ultrasound-based diaphragm function assessment, and comprehensive clinical scoring systems were measured to determine whether these new variables, in isolation or combination, could predict extubation failure successfully in the NICU.MethodsAll adult patients extubated after 48 h of mechanical ventilation in the NICU of a single tertiary care center were recruited into the prospective cohort. The patient's cough peak expiratory flow rate (C-PEFR), diaphragm function, and clinical scores were measured before extubation. C-PEFR was measured using a hand-held spirometer, diaphragm function (excursion, thickness fraction, and diaphragm contraction velocity on coughing) was assessed using ultrasound, and the clinical scores included the visual pursuit, swallowing, age, Glasgow Coma Scale for extubation (VISAGE) and respiratory insufficiency scale-intubated (RIS-i) scores. The patients requiring reintubation within 48 h were considered as extubation failure. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to identify predictors of extubation failure.ResultsOf the 193 patients screened, 43 were recruited, and 15 had extubation failure (20.9%). Patients with extubation failure had higher RIS-i scores (p < 0.001) and lower VISAGE scores (p = 0.043). The C-PEFR and diaphragm function (excursions and contraction velocity on coughing) were lower in patients with extubation failure but not statistically significant. The variables with p < 0.2 in univariate analysis (RIS-i, VISAGE, and diaphragm cough velocity) were subjected to multivariate regression analysis. RIS-I score remained an independent predictor (odds ratio 3.691, 95% confidence interval 1.5-8.67, p = 0.004). In a receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve for RIS-i was 0.963. An RIS-i score of 2 or more had 94% specificity and 89% sensitivity for predicting extubation failure.ConclusionsThe RIS-i score predicts extubation failure in NICU patients. The addition of ultrasound-based diaphragm measurements to the RIS-i score to improve prediction accuracy needs further study.Clinical trial registration Clinical Trials Registry of India identifier CTRI/2021/03/031923.

AB  - The study was designed to review the demographic, clinical, and pathologic characteristics of follicular helper T cells (TFH)-derived nodal PTCL in India including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with follicular helper T cell phenotype (P-TFH), and follicular T-cell lymphoma with additional immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RHOAG17V mutational analysis, as well as their impact on survival. This retrospective study included 88 cases of PTCL that were reclassified using IHC for TFH markers (PD1, ICOS, BCL6, and CD10) and dendritic-meshwork markers (CD21, CD23). Cases of TFH cell origin were evaluated for RHOAG17V mutation using Sanger sequencing and amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (validated using cloning and quantitative PCR) with detailed clinicopathologic correlation. Extensive re-evaluation with added IHC panel resulted in a total of 19 cases being reclassified, and the final subtypes were AITL (37 cases, 42%), PTCL-not otherwise specified (44, 50%), P-TFH (6, 7%), and follicular T-cell lymphoma (1, 1%). The presence of at least 2 TFH markers (>20% immunopositivity) determined the TFH origin. AITL patients tended to be male and showed increased presence of B-symptoms and hepatosplenomegaly. Histomorphology revealed that 92% of AITL cases had pattern 3 involvement. Sanger sequencing with conventional PCR did not yield any mutation, while RHOAG17V was detected by amplification-refractory mutation system-PCR in AITL (51%, P=0.027) and P-TFH (17%), which was validated with cloning followed by sequencing. Cases of RHOAG17V-mutant AITL had a worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status initially but fared better in terms of overall outcome (P=0.029). Although not specific for AITL, RHOAG17V mutation shows an association with diagnosis and requires sensitive methods for detection due to low-tumor burden. The mutant status of AITL could have prognostic implications and translational relevance.

AB  - To date, there were limited studies available on myocardial infarction (MI), and consequently, the outcomes of patients with type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI) compared to type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) remained inconclusive. We aimed to compare the outcomes of T1MI and T2MI patients in terms of mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for relevant articles from inception until March 20, 2022. 341,049 patients had T1MI, while the remaining 67,537 patients had T2MI. Mean age was similar between both groups (T1MI: 67.3 years, T2MI: 71.03 years), while the proportion of females was lower in T1MI (37.81% vs 47.15%). Our analysis revealed that patients with T1MI had significantly lower odds of all-cause mortality (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36-0.56, p < 0.001), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.86, p < 0.001), 1-year mortality (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25-0.47, p < 0.001), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.91, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in terms of 30-day mortality (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25-1.36, p = 0.21), cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68-1.32, p = 0.74), all-cause readmission (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62-1.14, p = 0.26), and readmission due to MI (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.66-2.27, p = 0.53) between both groups. Patients with T1MI had favorable outcomes in terms of mortality and MACE compared to that of T2MI patients. Further studies should aim at determining the optimal management strategy for these high-risk patients for better patient outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a viable in vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to study the growth and invasion of patient-derived retinoblastoma (RB) and choroidal melanoma (CM) xenografts (PDXs). The study utilizes primary tumor samples instead of cancer cell lines, which provides a more authentic representation of tumors due to conserved morphology and heterogeneity. Methods: Fertilized chicken eggs were procured, windowed, and their CAM layers were dropped. On embryonic development day (EDD) 10, freshly cut patient-derived CM and RB tumors were implanted on the CAM layer and the setup was incubated for 7 days. The tumor-embedded CAM layer was harvested on EDD 17, and the extracted tumor samples were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the extent of tumor invasion. Results: Significant changes in the vascularity around the RB and CM PDXs were observed, indicating an angiogenic environment. The cross-sectional histological view of the tumor implant site revealed the invasion of both the tumors into the CAM mesoderm. Invasion of CM into CAM mesoderm was visualized in the form of pigmented nodules, and that of RB was indicated by synaptophysin and Ki-67 positivity in Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Conclusion: The CAM xenograft model was successfully able to support the growth of CM and RB PDXs and their invasion in CAM, thus presenting as a feasible alternative to mammalian models for studying tumorigenicity and invasiveness of ocular tumors. Moreover, this model can further be utilized to develop personalized medicine by inoculating patient-specific tumors for preclinical drug screening.

AB  - Objectives: To analyze macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), a bone remodeling biomarker in the peri-miniscrew implant crevicular fluid (PMICF) after insertion and orthodontic loading. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 40 miniscrew implant (MSI) sites in 10 subjects undergoing fixed orthodontic mechanotherapy utilizing miniscrew anchorage. After dental alignment, miniscrews were inserted between the second premolar and first molar roots. After 21 days of insertion, MSIs were direct loaded with closed-coil springs (200 g force) for en masse retraction of anterior teeth. PMICF was collected with Periopapere strips from the gingival crevice around MSIs at six time points (T1-T6: 1 hour, 1 day, 21 days postinsertion, and 7, 21, and 42 days postloading). PMICF was quantified for M-CSF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Paired comparison of mean M-CSF concentrations before and after loading stages (T1-T6) was made using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: The mean M-CSF concentration showed a significant peak at T3 (21 days postinsertion; 12.646 pg/mL; T1 vs T3: P < .0001). After orthodontic loading of miniscrews, M-CSF levels increased to 13.570 pg/mL at T4 (7 days after loading; T1 vs T4: P < .001) and maintained at a plateau to T5 (21 days postloading; 11.994 pg/mL). However, the difference between preloading and postloading was not statistically significant (T3 vs T4). Conclusions: The maximum M-CSF activity around MSIs was observed at around 3 weeks of miniscrew insertion, suggesting underlying bone remodeling after surgical injury. However, orthodontic force on MSIs did not cause any significant surge in M-CSF levels postloading. (Angle Orthod. 2023;93:222-227.)

AB  - Gamma Knife Radiosurgery ( GKRS) is now an established standard of treatment for the small-sized arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), meningiomas, schwannomas, metastasis, and other benign diseases. With an exponential rise in the indications for GKRS, we have witnessed an increase in the adverse radiation effects (ARE) following GKRS. The common AREs and associated risk factors following GKRS have been described for pathologies including vestibular schwannomas, arteriovenous malformations, meningiomas, and metastases based on the authors' experience, and a simplified management protocol has been provided for radiation-induced changes based on clinical and radiologic parameters. The dose, volume, location, and repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are implied as the risk factors for ARE. Clinically symptomatic AREs require oral steroids for weeks to alleviate symptoms. In refractory cases, bevacizumab and surgical resection can be offered as a treatment modality. Appropriate dose planning strategy and hypofractionation for larger lesions help in mitigating the AREs.

AB  - Objective: This article aims to discuss the surgical nuances and major adjustments necessary in unlocking the frontotemporal dural fold (FTDF) and extradural anterior clinoidectomy (EDAC) in actual cases, allowing translation from the cadaveric to a clinical scenario.
   Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the technical details of 17 procedures over 8 years, where both the initial steps (FTDF unlocking and EDAC) were performed. Lesions involving or extending to the anterolateral skull base, like the suprasellar cistern, optico-carotid cistern, interpeduncular cistern, petrous apex, and cavernous sinus, were included. The clinical data of the patients were retrieved retrospectively from the hospital information system (HIS) and in-patient records. This study was approved as a multicenter individual project with IEC No: 2020-342-IP-EXP-34.
   Results: An illustrated note of the common steps and outcome of the 17 procedures of unlocking the FTDF and EDAC done is presented. The technique provided adequate exposure in performing aneurysmal clipping (posterior communicating artery [ P. com], basilar top, and superior hypophyseal artery [SHA] aneurysm), giant pituitary adenoma (Wilson Hardy grade 4E, n = 2), fifth nerve schwannoma (n = 4), right Meckel's cave melanoma, cavernous hemangioma (n = 4), petroclival meningioma (n = 2), and clival chordoma. Temporary and permanent cranial nerve palsy as a procedure-related complication was seen in 11.8% (n = 2) each. Complete excision was achieved in 13 (n = 13/14) patients with tumors.
   Conclusion: FTDF unlocking and EDAC are elegant procedures providing reasonable access to the anterolateral skull base for myriad pathologies. Brain bulge, cavernous sinus bleeding, and losing the plane of dural duplication were significant challenges in switching from cadaveric to a clinical scenario.

AB  - PURPOSE To identify the optimum strength of advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) to achieve the best subjective and objective image quality when combining three-dose reduction strategies, ultra-high-pitch computed tomography coronary angiography (FLASH CTCA; with sin-gle-dose ivabradine to lower heart rate), low tube voltage, and ADMIRE. METHODS Sixty consecutive patients underwent FLASH CTCA at 100 kVp in this single-center prospective study. Single-dose ivabradine was administered to patients whose heart rate was above 75 bpm. Images were reconstructed using the three highest strengths of ADMIRE (A3, A4, and A5). Objective and subjective image quality (using a Likert scale) were evaluated in the three datasets. RESULTS The signal strength remained unchanged but mean noise significantly reduced across the increas-ing strengths of ADMIRE [signal: 513.78 & PLUSMN; 101.7 Hounsfield units (HU) at A3, 515.6 & PLUSMN; 100.5 HU at A4, and 519.7 & PLUSMN; 107.9 HU at A5; noise: 23.4 & PLUSMN; 4.5 HU at A3, 20.2 & PLUSMN; 3.6 HU at A4, and 17.2 & PLUSMN; 3.3 HU at A5]. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were the highest at A5, and A5 offered significantly higher Likert scores in image noise, vessel sharpness, and overall image quality than A3 or A4. Ad-ditionally, A5 did not interfere with image interpretation in any patient. CONCLUSION Using all three dose reduction strategies during FLASH CTCA along with single-dose ivabradine ad-ministration ensures minimal radiation exposure in daily practice. In this study, A5 datasets had the best overall subjective and objective image quality despite their "plastic appearance". In the future, enhanced dose reduction can be obtained by further lowering tube voltages.

AB  - Simple Summary Radiopharmaceuticals targeting the fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) can be used in many different cancer types since FAP is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment of almost all epithelial cancers. Monomeric radiotracers have shown great potential in molecular imaging (diagnosis), but the tumor retention time is relatively short (few hours). For effective radioligand therapy (RLT), the biological half-life of the radiotracer should ideally match the physical half-life of the important therapeutic radionuclides Lu-177 and Ac-225 (6.7 and 9.9 days). The tumor retention was improved with the FAPi homodimer DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). In terms of optimizing, the new FAPi homodimers DO3A.Glu.(FAPi)(2) and DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2).were synthesized. DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) showed superior radiolabeling properties (including successful Ac-225-labeling, higher hydrophilicity), in vitro affinity and selectivity compared to DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). In addition, significantly reduced uptake in the critical organs (liver, colon) compared to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) was observed with [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) in a first patient study (medullary thyroid cancer) while maintaining high and prolonged tumor uptake. Radiopharmaceuticals based on the highly potent FAP inhibitor (FAPi) UAMC-1110 have shown great potential in molecular imaging, but the short tumor retention time of the monomers do not match the physical half-lives of the important therapeutic radionuclides Lu-177 and Ac-225. This was improved with the dimer DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2), but pharmacological and radiolabeling properties still need optimization. Therefore, the novel FAPi homodimers DO3A.Glu.(FAPi)(2) and DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2). were synthesized and quantitatively radiolabeled with Ga-68, Y-90, Lu-177 and Ac-225. The radiolabeled complexes showed high hydrophilicity and were generally stable in human serum (HS) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 degrees C over two half-lives, except for [Ac-225]Ac-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) in PBS. In vitro affinity studies resulted in subnanomolar IC50 values for FAP and high selectivity for FAP over the related proteases PREP and DPP4 for both compounds as well as for [Lu-nat]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2). In a first proof-of-principle patient study (medullary thyroid cancer), [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) was compared to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). High uptake and long tumor retention was observed in both cases, but [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) significantly reduces uptake in non-target and critical organs (liver, colon). Overall, the novel FAPi homodimer DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) showed improved radiolabeling in vitro and pharmacological properties in vivo compared to DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) and [Ac-225]Ac-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) appear promising for translational application in patients.

AB  - Context: Cavernous sinus haemangiomas (CSHs) are rare vascular malformations arising from the micro-circulation of the cavernous sinus. The current treatment options are micro-surgical excision of CSH, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and fractionated radiation therapy (FRT).
   Aims: We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the effect and complications of SRS in CSH and compared the pooled results after surgical excision of CSH. The aim of the study is to provide valuable insight into the role of SRS in the treatment of CSHs.
   Materials and Methods: The literature search revealed a total of 21 articles with 199 patients who met our inclusion criteria, and these were analyzed for this study.
   Results: There were 138 (69.3%) female and 61 (30.7%) male patients. The mean age at the time of radiosurgery was 48.4 +/- 14.9 years. The mean tumor volume at the time of SRS was 17.4 cm(3) (range 0.3-138 cm(3)). Fifty (25%) patients had undergone surgery before SRS, whereas 149 (75%) patients received standalone SRS. A total of 186 (93.5%) patients were treated by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS), whereas 13 got treated by Cyberknife. The mean tumor volume in CK-F, GKRS, and GKRS-F groups was 36.6 +/- 26.3, 15.4 +/- 18.4, and 86.0 +/- 19.5 cm(3), respectively. The mean marginal dose was 21.8 +/- 2.9 Gy, 14.0 +/- 1.9 Gy, and 25 +/- 0.0 Gy in CK-F, GKRS, and GKRS-F groups, respectively. The mean marginal dose of SRS was 14.6 +/- 2.9 Gy. The mean follow-up period after SRS was 35.8 +/- 31.6 months. Significant clinical improvement was seen in 106 patients out of 116 (91.4%) after SRS with remarkable shrinkage, 22 patients out of 27 (81.5%) with minimal shrinkage, and nine patients out of 13 (69.2%) with stationary tumor shrinkage. The sixth cranial nerve (CN6) was the most commonly involved nerve in 73 patients (36.7%). 30/65 (89%) experienced an improvement in the abducent nerve function following SRS. 115/120 (95.8%) patients primary treated with SRS experienced clinical improvement, whereas the rest of the five patients remained clinically stable.
   Conclusion: Radiosurgery SRS is a safe and effective option in patients with CSHs and resulted in more than 50% decrease in tumor volume in 72.4% of the patients.

AB  - The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been associated with various human diseases. ROS exert a multitude of biological effects with both physiological and pathological consequences. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a sodium salt of the natural amino acid glutamate, is a flavor-enhancing food additive, which is widely used in Asian cuisine and is an ingredient that brings out the "umami" meat flavor. MSG consumption in rats is associated with ROS generation. Owing to its consumption as part of the fast-food culture and concerns about its possible effects on pregnancy, we aimed to study the impact of MSG on placental trophoblast cells. MSG exposure influenced trophoblast invasion and differentiation, two of the most critical functions during placentation through enhanced production of ROS. Similar findings were also observed on MSG-treated placental explants, as confirmed by elevated Nrf2 levels. Ultrastructural studies revealed signs of subcellular injury by MSG exposure. Mechanistically, MSG-induced oxidative stress with endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways involving Xbp1s and IRE1 alpha was observed. The effect of MSG through an increased ROS production indicates that its long-term exposure might have adverse health effect by compromising key trophoblast functions.

AB  - Background and Aim: The aim of this study was to study the effect of Gamma Knife (GK) on meningiomas based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) grading system in terms of tumor control and final clinical outcome.
   Methodology: This retrospective study included clinicoradiological and GK characteristics of patients who had undergone GK for meningiomas at our institute from April 1997 until December 2009.
   Results: Of 440 patients, 235 underwent secondary GK for residual/recurrent lesion and 205 received primary GK. Of the 137 patients whose biopsy slide could be reviewed, 111 patients had grade I, 16 had grade II, and 10 had grade III meningiomas. Good tumor control rates were seen in 96.3% of grade I meningioma patients, 62.5% of 16 grade II, and 10% of grade III meningioma patients at median follow-up of 40 months. Age, sex, Simpson's grade of excision, and increasing peripheral dose of GK did not affect the response to radiosurgery (P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that high-grade tumor and radiotherapy prior to GK were important negative predictors for progression of tumor size after GK radiosurgery (GKRS) (P < 0.05). In patients with WHO grade I meningioma, radiation therapy prior to GKRS and repeat surgery were predictors for poorer outcome.
   Conclusion: In WHO grades II and III meningiomas, no factors affected tumor control except the histology itself.
