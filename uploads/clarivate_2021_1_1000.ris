AB  - The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) association with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is well known but there are limited studies investigating the association between beta-cell autoantibodies and HLA genes. We evaluated the prevalence of GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies (GADA and IA2A) in 252 T1D patients from North India and investigated the genetic association of GADA and IA2A with HLA class I and class II genes/haplotypes. GADA and IA2A were detected in 50.79% and 15.87% of T1D patients, respectively, while only 8.73% had both GADA and IA2A. HLA-DRB1*03 was observed to be significantly higher in GADA+ T1D patients as compared to GADA- (91.41% vs. 66.13%, Bonferroni-corrected P(P-c) = 1.11 x 10(-5); OR = 5.45; 95% CI: 2.67-11.08). Similarly, HLA-DQB1*02 was found to be significantly increased in GADA+ patients (94.53%, P-c = 2.19 x 10(-5); OR = 6.27; 95% CI: 2.7-14.49) as compared to GADA- (73.39%). The frequencies of HLA-DRB1*04 and DQB1*03 were increased in IA2A+ patients (45.0% and 52.5%, respectively) as compared to that in IA2A- (25.94% and 33.96%, respectively). Further, the frequency of DRB1* 03-DQB1* 02 haplotype was found to be significantly increased in GADA+ T1D patients as compared to GADA- (60.55% vs. 41.94%, P = 3.94 x 10(-5); OR = 2:13; 95%CI = 1.49-3.03). Similarly, HLA-DRB1* 04-DQB1*03 haplotype was found to be significantly increased in IA2A+ T1D patients compared to IA2A- patients (22.5% vs. 12.97%; P = 0.041; OR = 1.95; 95%CI = 1.08-3.52). None of the HLA class I genes (HLA-A, B, and Cw) was found to be associated with GADA or IA2A in people with T1D. Our findings suggest that HLA-DRB1* 03/DQB1*02 and HLA-DRB1* 04/DQB1*03 might play an important role in the development of GADA and IA2A, respectively.

AB  - Smokeless tobacco products (STPs) carry assorted microbial population that contributes to carcinogens synthesis like tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). Extensive exploration of microbiota-harboring STPs is required to understand their full carcinogenic potential. Here, we applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate bacteriome present in moist STPs immensely consumed in India (Khaini, Moist-snuff, Qiwam, and Snus). Further, the functional metagenome was speculated by PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) to assign the abundance of genes related to nitrogen metabolism, bacterial toxins, antibiotic drug resistance and other pro-inflammatory molecules. Highly diverse bacterial communities were observed in all moist STPs. Taxonomic analysis revealed a total of 549 genera belonging to four major phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Overall, the core bacterial genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Prevotella, Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, Paracoccus, Flavobacterium, and Bacteroides were significantly abundant in moist STPs. Elevated moisture-holding products like Moist-snuff and Qiwam harbor rich bacterial species diversity and showed similar bacteriome composition. Furthermore, Qiwam products showed the highest level of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism, antibiotic resistance, toxins, and pro-inflammation (predicted by PICRUSt) which can contribute to the synthesis of TSNAs and induction of oral cancer. The present broad investigation of moist STPs-associated bacteriome prevalence and their detailed metabolic potential will provide novel insight into the oral carcinogenesis induced by STPs.

AB  - Introduction: Health-care personnel (HCPs) are predisposed to infection during direct or indirect patient care as well as due to the community spread of the disease. Methods: We observed the clinical presentation and course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in HCPs working in a dedicated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) care hospital during the first and the second wave. Results: A total of 100 and 223 HCPs were enrolled for the first wave and the second wave, respectively. Cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, and headache was seen in 40 (40%) and 152 (68%) (P < 0.01), 15 (15%) and 64 (29%) (P = 0.006), 40 (40%) and 119 (53.3%) (P = 0.03), 9 (9%) and 66 (30%) (P < 0.01), 20 (20%) and 125 (56%) (P < 0.01), respectively. Persistent symptoms at the time of joining back to work were seen in 31 (31%) HCPs and 152 (68%) HCPs, respectively (P <= 0.01). Reinfection was reported in 10 HCPs. Conclusions: Most of the HCPs had mild to moderate infections. Symptoms persist after joining back to work. Upgradation of home-based care and teleconsultation facilities for active disease and redressal of residual symptoms will be helpful.

AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is diagnosed by the microbiological Nugent scoring method or clinical Amsel's criteria. Assessment of 404 vaginal samples (293 women) identified 110 (27.2%), 108 (26.7%) and 161 (39.9%) samples to be BV-positive using Nugent's method, standard Amsel's criteria and simplified Amsel's criteria respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and kappa statistic (kappa) for standard and simplified Amsel's criteria were 71.8% (95% CI = 62.4-80.0), 90.1% (95% CI = 62.4-86.1), 0.62 (95% CI = 0.53-0.72) and 88.2% (95% CI = 80.6-93.6), 78.2% (95% CI = 73.1-82.8), 0.58 (95% CI = 0.49-0.67), respectively. A combination of vaginal pH and clue cells exhibited the highest concordance (kappa = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.54-0.74) with Nugent's method and may be used for simplified BV diagnosis.

AB  - TB continues to be one of the major public health threats. BCG is the only available vaccine against TB and confers significant protection against the childhood disease. However, the protective efficacy of BCG against adult pulmonary TB, which represents a larger burden of disease, is highly variable. It has been suggested that prior exposure to environmental mycobacteria (EMb) mitigates the anti-TB efficacy of BCG by blocking its duplication or masking its immunogenicity. However, its effectiveness against childhood TB and failure of repeated administration to provide additional benefit against pulmonary TB, suggest of some other mechanisms for the variable efficacy of BCG against the pulmonary disease. Importantly, TB is a heterogeneous disease occurring in different forms and having distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis. While inability of the immune system to contain the bacilli is responsible for TB pathogenesis in infants, an aggravated immune response to Mtb has been blamed for the development of adult pulmonary TB. Available data suggest that EMb play a key role in heightening the immune response against Mtb. In this article, differential efficacy of BCG against childhood and adult TB is explained by taking into account the heterogeneity of TB, mechanisms of TB pathogenesis, and the effect of EMb on anti-Mtb immunity. It is believed that a refined understanding of the success and failure of BCG will help in the development of effective anti-TB vaccines.

AB  - Introduction: Optimizing patient safety and quality improvement is increasingly important in surgery. Benchmarks and clinical quality registries are being developed to assess the best achievable results for several surgical procedures and reduce unwarranted variation between different centers. However, there is no clinical database from international centers for establishing standardized reference values of patients undergoing surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.<br>Design: The Enhancing Safety in Epilepsy Surgery (EASINESS) study is a retrospectively conducted, multicenter, open registry. All patients undergoing mesial temporal lobe epilepsy surgery in participating centers between January 2015 and December 2019 are included in this study. The patient characteristics, preoperative diagnostic tools, surgical data, postoperative complications, and long-term seizure outcomes are recorded.<br>Outcomes: The collected data will be used for establishing standardized reference values ("benchmarks") for this type of surgical procedure. The primary endpoints include seizure outcomes according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification and defined postoperative complications.<br>Discussion: The EASINESS will define robust and standardized outcome references after amygdalohippocampectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy. After the successful definition of benchmarks from an international cohort of renowned centers, these data will serve as reference values for the evaluation of novel surgical techniques and comparisons among centers for future clinical trials.<br>Clinical Trial Registration:This study is indexed at clinicaltrials.gov (NT 04952298).<br><br>

AB  - Background
   A significant proportion of children require multiple surgeries for successful repair of hypospadias. This is not only a source of a financial burden to the family but also causes long-term social and psychosexual issues. Tissue sealant application can provide additional coverage to the suture line and subsequently prevents operative failure. However, a consensus statement regarding its usage during urethroplasty is lacking. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the outcomes of hypospadias surgery, in terms of its complications, in children with and without tissue sealant application.
   Method
   The authors systematically searched the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus through September 2020. The occurrence of overall complications, and specific complications (including urethrocutaneous fistula, wound-related complications, flap-related complications, complications involving the neo-urethral tube and meatal stenosis) were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model, and pooled risk ratio (RR) and heterogeneity (I-2) were calculated. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed utilizing the Downs and Black scale.
   Result
   Four comparative studies were included in the meta-analysis. The different types of tissue sealants such as fibrin glue, cyanoacrylate glue, BioGlue and cryocalcium glue were used in these studies. As compared to without sealant application, hypospadias repair performed with sealant application showed no significant difference in the incidence of overall postoperative complications (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.34-1.14, p = 0.13). However, a significant reduction in some specific complications including urethrocutaneous fistula (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19-0.72, p = 0.003), wound-related complications (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.38-0.86, p = 0.008) and complications involving the neo-urethra (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04-0.54, p = 0.004) was observed with sealant usage. The average Downs and Black scale scores ranged from 16 to 18, with all studies having a moderate risk of bias. Kappa statistics showed a value of 0.962 (p < 0.001), highlighting an almost perfect agreement among the two observers.
   Conclusion
   The present meta-analysis revealed no additional benefit of the repair of hypospadias performed with tissue sealants as compared to without sealants in terms of reducing the overall postoperative complications. However, a significant reduction in the occurrence of some specific complications, including UCF, wound-related complications and complications involving the neourethra was observed with sealant application. The level of evidence of the published comparative studies is limited. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted for optimal comparison between the sealant and no sealant (or placebo), and different types of sealants.

AB  - p16(ink4a) status is an independent predictor of survival in PC. There is a strong concordance between p16(ink4a) and HPV ISH results. Also, there is a significant association between HPV positivity and the histology with 100% of the warty, basaloid, and mixed warty-basaloid subtypes being positive for HPV. p53 is a predictor of nodal metastasis irrespective of p16(ink4a) status. Dual positive tumors (p16(ink4a) and p53 positive) have a significantly better outcome in comparison to dual negative tumors (both markers negative). Thus, p53 and p16(ink4a) immunohistochemistry should be performed at the baseline in all patients of PC.
   Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is implicated in a proportion of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (PC). A subset of PC involves dysregulation of the p53 pathway. HPV in situ hybridization (ISH) and p(16ink4a) positivity are surrogate markers for HPV infection, and p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) denotes abnormality in the p53 pathway. There remains an ambiguity with regard to the contribution of both the pathways in the prognosis of PC. We sought to analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics of a cohort of Indian PC patients with respect to p16(ink4a) and p53 expression. Patients and Methods: A cohort of 123 PC patients was studied for p16(ink4a) and p53IHC and HPVISH. The results of these biomarkers were correlated with various clinicopathologic parameters. Results: p16(ink4a) and HPV ISH were positive in 47% and 53% of the tumors, respectively. The proportion of war ty, basaloid, or mixed war ty-basaloid tumor subtypes showed significant p16(ink4a) positivity (P <.0001) compared to other subtypes. Twent y-eight patients were dual negative (p53- /p16(ink4a) -), 32 were dual positive (p53+/p16(ink4a)+), 38 were p53+/p16(ink4)a -, and 25 were p53/p16(ink4a) +. In patients where p16(ink4a) was negative, a p53-positive phenotype had a higher propensity for lymph node metastases (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 1.75-16.80; P =.003). Similarly, p53 positivity dictates nodal involvement in the p16(ink4a) positive subset of tumors (OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.23-20.17; P =.024). On multivariate analyses, pathologic subtypes (warty, warty-basaloid, and basaloid) (P <.0001), p16(ink4a) expression (P <.0001), and absence of nodal metastasis (P <.0001) were significant predictors of improved overall (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the OS was significantly longer in patients with p16(ink4a) + tumors (P <.0001), as was the CSS (P <.0001). Patients with dual positive tumors had a significantly higher OS (P <.001) and CSS (P =.012), in the entire cohort. In the node positive patients, dual positivity was associated with significantly higher OS (P <.0001); however, the median CSS for p53+/p16(ink4a) +tumors were not significantly different compared to p53- /p16(ink4a) - tumors (P =.064), although there was a trend towards improved CSS. Conclusions: There is a strong concordance between p16(ink4a)IHC and HPV ISH results. p16(ink4a) status is an independent predictor of survival (OS and CSS) in our cohort of PCs. p53 is a predictor of nodal metastasis irrespective of p16 status. Dual positive tumors have a significantly better outcome in comparison to dual negative tumors; (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Efficacy, safety, and lot-to-lot immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152): interim results of a randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Background We report the clinical efficacy against COVID-19 infection of BBV152, a whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) in Indian adults.
   Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals or medical clinics to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBVI52. Adults (age >= 18 years) who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions (not an immunocompromising condition or requiring treatment with immunosuppressive therapy) were randomised 1:1 with a computer-generated randomisation scheme (stratified for the presence or absence of chronic conditions) to receive two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered 4 weeks apart. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, studyrelated personnel, the sponsor, and nurses who administered the vaccines were masked to treatment group allocation; an unmasked contract research organisation and a masked expert adjudication panel assessed outcomes. The primary outcome was the efficacy of the BBV152 vaccine in preventing a first occurrence of laboratoryconfirmed (RT-PCR-positive) symptomatic COVID-19 (any severity), occurring at least 14 days after the second dose in the per-protocol population. We also assessed safety and reactogenicity throughout the duration of the study in all participants who had received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. This report contains interim results (data cutoff May 17, 2021) regarding immunogenicity and safety outcomes (captured on days 0 to 56) and efficacy results with a median of 99 days for the study population. The trial was registered on the Indian Clinical Trials Registry India, CTRI/2020/11/028976, and ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT04641481 (active, not recruiting).
   Findings Between Nov 16, 2020, and an 7, 2021, we recruited 25 798 participants who were randomly assigned to receive BBV152 or placebo; 24419 received two doses of BBV152 (n=12 221) or placebo (n=12198). Efficacy analysis was dependent on having 130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19, which occurred when 16 973 initially seronegative participants had at least 14 days follow-up after the second dose. 24 (0.3%) cases occurred among 8471 vaccine recipients and 106 (1.2%) among 8502 placebo recipients, giving an overall estimated vaccine efficacy of 77.8% (95% CI 65.2-86.4). In the safety population (n=25 753), 5959 adverse events occurred in 3194 participants. BBV152 was well tolerated; the same proportion of participants reported adverse events in the vaccine group (1597 [12.4%] of 12879) and placebo group (1597 [12.4%] of 12874), with no clinically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between the groups, and no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths.
   Interpretation BBV152 was highly efficacious against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with no safety concerns raised in this interim analysis. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Addictive disorders are a significant contributor to the global burden of disease. The burden of addictive disorders in LMIC is expected to grow further over the coming years. Aims In this article we present the observations from the existing literature on the current status of education and training on addiction psychiatry in LMIC and provide recommendation on way forward for this specialized field of psychiatry. Materials and Methods We searched electronic databases of PubMed to access the literature on the current status of education and training on addiction psychiatry. Additional searches were also conducted in other database of Google Scholar for potential 'grey' literature. Results We were able to identify a total of 11 relevant articles. Discussion Currently there is limited published literature on education and training on addiction psychiatry from the LMICs. Conclusions Strengthening of the training on addictive disorders shall not only help bridge the gap of the unmet need for the evidence-based interventions of addictive disorders across these countries it shall also help enhance the research capacity on addictive disorders in these countries.

TI  - Frequency of Neurologic Manifestations in COVID-19 A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROLOGY
KW  - DELIRIUM
KW  - BIAS
AB  - Background and objectives
   One year after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we aimed to summarize the frequency of neurologic manifestations reported in patients with COVID-19 and to investigate the association of these manifestations with disease severity and mortality.
   Methods
   We searched PubMed, Medline, Cochrane library, ClinicalTrials.gov , and EMBASE for studies from December 31, 2019, to December 15, 2020, enrolling consecutive patients with COVID-19 presenting with neurologic manifestations. Risk of bias was examined with the Joanna Briggs Institute scale. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for neurologic manifestations. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated to determine the association of neurologic manifestations with disease severity and mortality. Presence of heterogeneity was assessed with I-2, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2.
   Results
   Of 2,455 citations, 350 studies were included in this review, providing data on 145,721 patients with COVID-19, 89% of whom were hospitalized. Forty-one neurologic manifestations (24 symptoms and 17 diagnoses) were identified. Pooled prevalence of the most common neurologic symptoms included fatigue (32%), myalgia (20%), taste impairment (21%), smell impairment (19%), and headache (13%). A low risk of bias was observed in 85% of studies; studies with higher risk of bias yielded higher prevalence estimates. Stroke was the most common neurologic diagnosis (pooled prevalence 2%). In patients with COVID-19 >= 60 years of age, the pooled prevalence of acute confusion/delirium was 34%, and the presence of any neurologic manifestations in this age group was associated with mortality (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.11-2.91).
   Discussion
   Up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 analyzed in this review experienced at least 1 neurologic manifestation. One in 50 patients experienced stroke. In those >60 years of age, more than one-third had acute confusion/delirium; the presence of neurologic manifestations in this group was associated with nearly a doubling of mortality. Results must be interpreted with the limitations of observational studies and associated bias in mind.

AB  - Background To evaluate the performance of the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) preterm preeclampsia (PE) screening algorithm in an indigenous South Asian population. Methods This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted in a tertiary maternal fetal unit in Delhi, India over 2 years. The study population comprised of 1863 women carrying a singleton pregnancy and of South Asian ethnicity who were screened for preterm pre-eclampsia (PE) between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation using Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), transvaginal Mean Uterine Artery Pulsatility Index (UtAPI) and biochemical markers - Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein-A (PAPP-A) and Placental Growth Factor.. Absolutemeasurements of noted biomarkers were converted to multiples of the expected gestational median (MoMS) which were then used to estimate risk for preterm PE < 37 weeks using Astraia software. Women with preterm PE risk of >= 1:100 was classified as as high risk. Detection rates (DR) at 10% false positive rate were calculated after adjusting for prophylactic aspirin use (either 75 or 150 mg). Results The incidence of PE and preterm PE were 3.17% (59/1863) and 1.34% (25/1863) respectively. PAPP-A and PlGF MoM distribution medians were 0.86 and 0.87 MoM and significantly deviated from 1 MoM. 431 (23.1%) women had a risk of >= 1:100, 75 (17.8%) of who received aspirin. Unadjusted DR using >= 1:100 threshold was 76%.Estimated DRs for a fixed 10% FPR ranged from 52.5 to 80% depending on biomarker combination after recentering MoMs and adjusting for aspirin use. Conclusion The FMF algorithm whilst performing satisfactorily could still be further improved to ensure that biophysical and biochemical markers are correctly adjusted for indigenous South Asian women.

AB  - IntroductionThere is a scarcity of data from India on the impact of cell of origin (COO) on outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of COO on outcomes of DLBCL patients treated with uniform rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (RCHOP) protocol. Materials and MethodsThis retrospective analysis included patients who received uniform RCHOP chemoimmunotherapy during the study period (2014-2020) at the Department of Medical Oncology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. The patients were classified as germinal center B-cell like (GCB) or activated B-cell (ABC) type using the Hans classification. ResultsFour hundred seventeen patients with median age of 48 years (range, 18-76) and a male-female ratio of 2:1 were included in the analysis. B symptoms and bulky disease were seen in 42.9% and 35.5%. Extranodal involvement was seen in 50.8% of cases. ECOG performance status (0-2) was present in 65%, and 51% presented with advanced disease. GCB subtype was seen in 43%, and 47% were ABC type. Low- and intermediate-risk international prognostic index (IPI) score was seen in 76% of cases. The overall response rate to RCHOP was 85.8%, including a complete response rate of 74.8%. After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 80% and 88%, respectively. The presence of B symptoms and poor ECOG performance status (3-4) was associated with inferior CR rate. Low albumin (p < 0.001), age >60 years (p = 0.001), bulky disease (p < 0.001), and extranodal involvement (p = 0.001) were associated with inferior EFS, whereas a high IPI risk score was associated with an inferior OS (p < 0.001). EFS and OS were not significantly different between the GCB and ABC subtypes. Grade III/IV anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were seen in 7.6%, 13.6%, and 2.7% of patients, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was seen in 8.9% of patients, and there were four treatment-related deaths. ConclusionsCell of origin for DLBCL has no impact on CR, EFS, and OS if patients are appropriately treated with standard doses and frequency of RCHOP. RCHOP is well tolerated in our patients, and results are comparable with the Western data.

AB  - Obstetrical forceps-induced Descemet membrane tears (FIDMT) are usually encountered during complicated forceps-assisted deliveries. The condition may lead to significant visual debilitation in young children and is frequently ignored due to its low incidence. Undue stretch on the Descemet's membrane during the process of forceps-assisted delivery results in their vertical/oblique tear (s), which usually leads to corneal edema in early neonatal life. On its resolution, these residual tears result in visually disabling astigmatism that can lead to dense and recalcitrant amblyopia. Slit-lamp examination, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, specular microscopy, confocal microscopy, and corneal topography and tomography can be employed for its accurate diagnosis. While these can be prevented by improved perinatal care, once diagnosed, they mandate prompt refractive correction and amblyopia therapy to prevent disabling visual deterioration in affected children. In adulthood, medical and surgical management may be planned for symptomatic patients based on coexistent amblyopia as this is the major factor guiding visual prognosis. There is limited comprehensive literature in this regard, and the present review discusses the pathogenesis, clinical features, and recent developments in investigations, management, and outcomes of FIDMT during the last three decades.

AB  - Plasmablasts represent a specialized class of antibody-secreting effector B cells that transiently appear in blood circulation following infection or vaccination. The expansion of these cells generally tends to be massive in patients with systemic infections such as dengue or Ebola that cause hemorrhagic fever. To gain a detailed understanding of human plasmablast responses beyond antibody expression, here, we performed immunophenotyping and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the plasmablasts from dengue febrile children in India. We found that plasmablasts expressed several adhesion molecules and chemokines or chemokine receptors that are involved in endothelial interactions or homing to inflamed tissues, including skin, mucosa, and intestine, and upregulated the expression of several cytokine genes that are involved in leukocyte extravasation and angiogenesis. These plasmablasts also upregulated the expression of receptors for several B-cell prosurvival cytokines that are known to be induced robustly in systemic viral infections such as dengue, some of which generally tend to be relatively higher in patients manifesting hemorrhage and/or shock than in patients with mild febrile infection. These findings improve our understanding of human plasmablast responses during the acute febrile phase of systemic dengue infection.
   IMPORTANCE Dengue is globally spreading, with over 100 million clinical cases annually, with symptoms ranging from mild self-limiting febrile illness to more severe and sometimes life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever or shock, especially among children. The pathophysiology of dengue is complex and remains poorly understood despite many advances indicating a key role for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. While serum antibodies have been extensively studied, the characteristics of the early cellular factories responsible for antibody production, i.e., plasmablasts, are only beginning to emerge. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional profiles of human plasmablasts from dengue patients.

AB  - Macrophage activation syndrome is a severe yet under-recognized complication encountered in pediatric rheumatology. It manifests as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis leading to a hyper-inflammatory state resulting from an underlying cytokine storm. If unchecked, it may lead to multiorgan failure and mortality. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of specific therapy is pivotal for a successful outcome. This review outlines the key clinical and laboratory features and management of macrophage activation syndrome.

AB  - Objective Nearly 40% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) might not respond to first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX). Hence, there is a need for a biomarker that can predict MTX response and help in tailoring initial therapy. Our objective was to study the role of serum myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8/14, and other inflammatory cytokines, as predictors of response to MTX among children with JIA. Methods We did a longitudinal follow-up study among children diagnosed with JIA at our institute. All MTX-naive children with JIA requiring DMARDs were eligible for this study; those who either took corticosteroids or DMARDs for more than 6 weeks at time of presentation were excluded. The demographic and clinical information was collected using a pretested semistructured questionnaire, and selected biomarkers were collected at baseline and again at 3 months. Response at 3 months was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria; responders were children who achieved ACR50, whereas those failing to achieve ACR30 were classified as nonresponders. Multivariate binary logistic regression was done to assess determinants of being a responder. Results We enrolled 69 children (36 boys) with JIA, of which 48 (69.5%) were responders. The baseline value of serum MRP8/14 was significantly higher in responders (median, 144.34 [interquartile range, 88.54-188.34] ng/mL) compared with the nonresponders (median, 95.34 [interquartile range, 76.54-130.28] ng/mL), p = 0.047. Being a responder was significantly associated with baseline serum MRP8/14 with adjusted odds ratio of 1.01 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.02). Conclusions The baseline levels of MRP8/14 were significantly raised in children meeting ACR50 at follow-up and suggest a prognostic value in predicting response to MTX.

AB  - Recently, great interest has been gained regarding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as an excellent target for theranostics. Several FAP inhibitor molecules such as [Ga-68]Ga-labelled FAPI-02, 04, 46, and DOTA.SA.FAPi have been introduced and are highly promising molecular targets from the imaging point of view. FAP inhibitors introduced via bifunctional DOTA and DOTAGA chelators offer the possibility to complex Lutetium-177 due to an additional coordination site, and are suitable for theranostic applications owing to the increased tumor accumulation and prolonged tumor retention time. However, for therapeutic applications, very little has been accomplished, mainly due to residence times of the compounds. In an attempt to develop a promising therapeutic radiopharmaceutical, the present study aimed to evaluate and compare the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi, and [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) in patients with various cancers. The FAPi agents, [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi and [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2), were administered in two different groups of patients. Three patients (mean age-50 years) were treated with a median cumulative activity of 2.96 GBq (IQR: 2.2-3 GBq) [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi and seven (mean age-51 years) were treated with 1.48 GBq (IQR: 0.6-1.5) of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). Patients in both the groups underwent serial imaging whole-body planar and SPECT/CT scans that were acquired between 1 h and 168 h post-injection (p.i.). The residence time and absorbed dose estimate in the source organs and tumor were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 2.2 software. Time versus activity graphs were plotted to determine the effective half-life (Te) in the whole body and lesions for both the radiotracers. Physiological uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi was observed in the kidneys, colon, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, oral mucosa, lacrimal glands, and urinary bladder contents. Physiological biodistribution of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) involved liver, gall bladder, colon, pancreas, kidneys, and urinary bladder contents, lacrimal glands, oral mucosa, and salivary glands. In the [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi group, the highest absorbed doses were noted in the kidneys (0.618 & PLUSMN; 0.015 Gy/GBq), followed by the colon (right colon: 0.472 Gy/GBq and left colon: 0.430 Gy/GBq). In the [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) group, the colon received the highest absorbed dose (right colon: 1.160 Gy/GBq and left colon: 2.870 Gy/GBq), and demonstrated a significantly higher mean absorbed dose than [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi (p < 0.011). [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) had significantly longer median whole-body Te compared to that of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi [46.2 h (IQR: 38.5-70.1) vs. 23.1 h (IQR: 17.8-31.5); p-0.0167]. The Te of tumor lesions was significantly higher for [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) compared to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi [86.6 h (IQR: 34.3-94.6) vs. 14 h (IQR: 12.8-15.5); p-0.0004]. The median absorbed doses to the lesions were 0.603 (IQR: 0.230-1.810) Gy/GBq and 6.70 (IQR: 3.40-49) Gy/GBq dose per cycle in the [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi, and [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) groups, respectively. The first clinical dosimetry study demonstrated significantly higher tumor absorbed doses with [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.
   FAPi)(2) compared to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi. [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) is safe and unveiled new frontiers to treat various end-stage cancer patients with a theranostic approach.

AB  - The Indian Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ISBMR) has herein drafted clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis for the people of India. Implementation of the position statement in clinical practice is expected to improve the overall care of patients with osteoporosis in India. Purpose In India, osteoporosis is a major public health problem. However, in the absence of any robust regional guidelines, the screening, treatment, and follow-up of patients with osteoporosis are lagging behind in the country. Methods The Indian Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ISBMR), which is a multidisciplinary group of physicians, researchers, dietitians, and epidemiologists and who study bone and related tissues, in their annual meeting, drafted the guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis that would be appropriate in a resource constraint setting like India. Results Diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made in a patient with minimal trauma fracture without the aid of any other diagnostic tools. In others, bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry remains the modality of choice. Data indicates that osteoporotic fractures occur at an earlier age in Indians than in the West; hence, screening for osteoporosis should begin at an earlier age. FRAX can be used for fracture risk estimation; however, it may underestimate the risk of future fractures in our population and still needs validation. Maintaining optimum serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels is essential, which, in most cases, would require regular vitamin D supplementation. Pharmacotherapy should be guided by the presence/absence of vertebral/hip fractures or the severity of risk based on clinical factors, although bisphosphonates remain the first choice in most cases. Regular follow-up is essential to ensure adherence and response to therapy. Conclusions Implementation of the position statement in clinical practice is expected to improve the overall care of patients with osteoporosis in India.

AB  - Precis: The addition of limited deep sclerectomy (LDS) to conventional trabeculectomy increases the success rate, especially in pseudophakic eyes.
   Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of LDS in enhancing the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering outcomes of trabeculectomy.
   Design: This was a parallel-arm, single-masked, randomized-controlled trial.
   Methods: A total of 68 patients (68 eyes) with moderate to advanced primary open-angle glaucoma or primary angle-closure glaucoma with pseudophakia were recruited at a tertiary eye care center in Northern India and randomized into 2 groups. Thirty-five eyes in group 1 were subjected to trabeculectomy alone and 33 eyes in group 2 were subjected to trabeculectomy with LDS. All cases were supplemented with low-dose sub-conjunctival mitomycin-C (0.1 mg/mL for 1 min) in both groups. The primary outcome measure was IOP, and success rates were calculated for IOP <= 18/15/12 and >= 5 mm Hg. The secondary outcome measures included evaluation of bleb morphology, presence of an intrascleral aqueous lake, and supraciliary flow on ultrasound biomicroscopy.
   Results: The mean postoperative IOP at 12 months was 13.4 +/- 1.83 mm Hg in group 1 and 12.5 +/- 1.67 mm Hg in group 2 (P = 0.04). For IOP cutoff <= 15 mm Hg, absolute success was noted in 11 (31.4%) and 22 eyes (66.6%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.004). At 12 months, the intrascleral lake was detected in 2 (6%) eyes in group 1 and in 9 (29%) eyes in group 2 (P = 0 .02) . Supraciliary flow was detected in 2 eyes (6.2%) in group 2 and none in group 1 at 12 months (P = 0.02). In the Cox proportional hazard model, trabeculectomy with LDS was associated with a lower rate of failure (hazard ratio: 0.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.75, P = 0.009).
   Conclusion: The addition of LDS to trabeculectomy led to lower mean IOP and higher success rates at 12 months, compared with trabeculectomy alone.

AB  - Objective Determine the sensitivity and specificity of neonatal jaundice visual estimation by primary healthcare workers (PHWs) and physicians as predictors of hyperbilirubinaemia. Design Multicentre observational cohort study. Setting Hospitals in Chandigarh and Delhi, India; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Durban, South Africa; Kumasi, Ghana; La Paz, Bolivia. Participants Neonates aged 1-20 days (n=2642) who presented to hospitals for evaluation of acute illness. Infants referred for any reason from another health facility or those needing immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded. Outcome measures Infants were evaluated for distribution (head, trunk, distal extremities) and degree (mild, moderate, severe) of jaundice by PHWs and physicians. Serum bilirubin level was determined for infants with jaundice, and analyses of sensitivity and specificity of visual estimations of jaundice used bilirubin thresholds of >260 mu mol/L (need for phototherapy) and >340 mu mol/L (need for emergency intervention in at-risk and preterm babies). Results 1241 (47.0%) neonates had jaundice. High sensitivity for detecting neonates with serum bilirubin >340 mu mol/L was found for 'any jaundice of the distal extremities (palms or soles) OR deep jaundice of the trunk or head' for both PHWs (89%-100%) and physicians (81%-100%) across study sites; specificity was more variable. 'Any jaundice of the distal extremities' identified by PHWs and physicians had sensitivity of 71%-100% and specificity of 55%-95%, excluding La Paz. For the bilirubin threshold >260 mu mol/L, 'any jaundice of the distal extremities OR deep jaundice of the trunk or head' had the highest sensitivity across sites (PHWs: 58%-93%, physicians: 55%-98%). Conclusions In settings where serum bilirubin cannot be measured, neonates with any jaundice on the distal extremities should be referred to a hospital for evaluation and management, where delays in serum bilirubin measurement and appropriate treatment are anticipated following referral, the higher sensitivity sign, any jaundice on the distal extremities or deep jaundice of the trunk or head, may be preferred.

AB  - Aims Despite clinical evidence of liver involvement in patients with coeliac disease (CeD), there is a lack of a method to prove this association. Methods Of 146 treatment-naive patients with CeD, 26 had liver dysfunction. Liver biopsies and corresponding small intestinal biopsies were obtained from these 26 patients. Multicolour immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence confocal microscopic studies were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue to detect the IgA/anti-TG2 deposits. Follow-up liver biopsies were taken after a gluten-free diet. Results Twenty-six out of the 146 patients (17.8%) with suspected coeliac-associated liver disease on histological examination revealed irregular sinusoidal dilatation in 15 (57.6%), steatohepatitis in 4 (15.3%), non-specific chronic hepatitis in 3 (11.5%), autoimmune hepatitis in 2 (7.6%) biopsies, including cirrhosis in one of them, irregular perisinusoidal fibrosis and changes of non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis in one biopsy each (3.8%). IgA/anti-tTG deposits were observed in 22 (84.6%) liver biopsies by dual immunohistochemistry technique, and in 24 (92.3%) by confocal immunofluorescence technique and in all corresponding duodenal biopsies (100%). Overall, IgA/anti-tTG deposits showed 100% sensitivity, 77% specificity and 85% positive predictive value for establishing an association of extraintestinal pathology and CeD using archived tissues. Follow-up liver biopsies could be obtained in five patients; four of them showed not only resolution of the histological lesions but disappearance of IgA/anti-tTG co-localisation. Conclusions Data of the present study adds to the body of evidence that liver lesions in patients with CeD are disease related and may have been caused by a similar pathogenic mechanism that causes intestinal changes.

AB  - Background: Complete peroneal nerve dysfunction associated with congenital clubfoot is uncommonly reported. Our retrospec-tive study highlights the recognition of clinical presentation and mid-term outcomes of treatment in these patients. Methods: Eight out of 658 patients undergoing treatment for clubfoot were identified with unilateral complete peroneal nerve dys-function associated with congenital clubfoot. Three patients presented primarily to our center; 5 were treated elsewhere initially. All patients were treated with Ponseti casts, Achilles tenotomy, and subsequent foot abduction bracing. Diagnosis of complete peroneal nerve dysfunction was confirmed using nerve conduction velocity studies in all patients. After full-time bracing, an insole polythene molded ankle foot orthosis was given. Three patients underwent tibialis posterior transfer to improve foot dorsiflexor power. Results: The mean age at presentation was 1.3 years (range, 1 week-5 years). All patients had prominence of lateral 3 metatarsal heads and dimpling of intermetatarsal spaces. At a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, mean shortening of 1.2 cm in tibia (range, 1-2.5 cm) and mean calf wasting of 4.4 cm were observed. There was no relapse of any clubfoot deformity till the final follow-up. Conclusions: Prominence of lateral metatarsal heads and dimpling of intermetatarsal spaces should raise early suspicion of pe-roneal nerve dysfunction. Standard Ponseti protocol is useful in treatment of these patients. Tibialis posterior transfer to dorsum partially restores the ankle dorsiflexion.

AB  - Three-dimensional visualisation is invaluable for evaluating cardiac anatomy. Patient-specific three-dimensional printed models of the heart are useful but require significant infrastructure. The three-dimensional virtual models, derived from 3D echocardiography, computed tomographic (CT) angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), permit excellent visualisation of intracardiac anatomy, but viewing on a two-dimensional screen obscures the third dimension. Various forms of extended reality, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, augment the third dimension but only using expensive equipment. Herein, we report a simple technique of anaglyph stereoscopic visualisation of three-dimensional virtual cardiac models. The feasibility of achieving stereovision on a personal computer, using open-source software, and the need for inexpensive anaglyph glasses for viewing make it extremely cost-effective. Further, the retained depth perception of resulting stereo images in electronic and printed format makes sharing with other members of the team easy and effective.

AB  - Lower rectal and anal cancers are distinct from neoplasms involving rest of the rectum. These are relatively difficult to manage owing to important relationships with the sphincter muscles. Involvement of the latter portends a poorer prognosis and increased chance of recurrence. Lymphatic drainage of these tumours is into the systemic circulation and the exact set of lymph nodes involved depends on the precise location of the tumour. The role of imaging includes assessment of local invasion, infiltration of adjacent pelvic organs, assessment of locoregional lymphatic spread and metastasis, post-chemoradiation restaging as well as posttreatment surveillance.

AB  - Background: Female Genital Tuberculosis (FGTB) causes infertility in a large number of females in developing countries. Presence of granuloma on histopathological examination of endometrial samples is diagnostic of FGTB. But immunohistochemical evaluation of endometrial aspirates has not been explored before.
   Aim: To evaluate the immunohistochemical delineation of immune cells in FGTB.
   Methods: 1515 infertile women from 20 to 35 years were enrolled and underwent endometrial aspiration (EA), which was subjected to microbiological and histopathological examination along with PCR. Patients positive for conventional tests like granulomas, acid fast bacilli, mycobacterial culture on LJ medium or liquid (MGIT) culture were started on antitubercular therapy. Conventional test negative but PCR positive patients were posted for laparoscopy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for LCA, CD68, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD 20, CD138, IFN gamma and IL10 were evaluated.
   Result: 38/1515 (2.5%) subjects tested positive for conventional methods. PCR-TB was positive in 615/1515 samples (40.59%). On IHC, the number of CD45 (LCA) positive immune cells (p = 0.03) and IFN gamma (p = 0.002) and IL10 expression (p = 0.012) at 1 + level were higher in the PCR positive samples. Laparoscopy done in 418/463 patients and 89/418 (21.3%) showed definitive findings of tuberculosis. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68 and CD138 showed no correlation with PCR and laparoscopy.
   Conclusion: Increased IFN gamma and IL 10 expressing immune cells in PCR positive EA suggests subclinical early changes, and can be useful as a research tool but have no role in diagnosing FGTB. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report an unusual case of bilateral immune-mediated corneal melting and necrosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) vaccination. Methods: This is a case report and literature review. Results: A 48-year-old man presented to the ophthalmic emergency department with progressive bilateral corneal melting 5 weeks after receiving the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) vaccine. Systemic complaints of fever, diarrhea, and vomiting were noted in the first 2 weeks, which subsided before the onset of ocular symptoms at day 21 of vaccine administration. The patient could only perceive light bilaterally and demonstrated features of bilateral keratolysis with choroidal detachment on ultrasonography. The microbiological scraping specimen did not reveal growth of any microorganism. Tectonic penetrating keratoplasty was performed, and the host corneal tissue was sent for histopathology, bacterial culture, fungal culture, polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and SARS-CoV-2. Microbial culture was sterile, and viral polymerase chain reaction reports were negative. Histopathological examination revealed dense inflammatory cell infiltration. Detailed systemic workup revealed no underlying systemic or autoimmune pathology. Conclusions: Immune-mediated keratolysis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) vaccination is a rare entity, and we believe that this is the first report of a temporal association between a serious ocular adverse event after a single dose of any SARS-CoV-19 vaccine. It may be included as a possible adverse event associated with this vaccine.

AB  - Background: Anteromedial osteoarthritis is a recognized indication for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Favorable postoperative outcomes largely depend on proper patient selection, correct implant positioning, and limb alignment. Computer navigation has a proven value over conventional systems in reducing mechanical errors in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the lack of strong evidence impedes the universal use of computer navigation technology in UKA. Therefore, this study was pro-posed to investigate the accuracy of component positioning and limb alignment in computer navigated UKA and to observe the role of navigation in proper patient selection. Methods: A total of 50 knees (38 patients) underwent computer navigated UKA between 2016 and 2018. All operations were performed by the senior surgeon using the same navigation system and implant type. The navigation system was used as a tool to aid patient selection: knees with preoperative residual varus > 5 degrees on valgus stress and hyperextension > 10 degrees were switched to navigated TKA. We measured the accuracy of component placement in sagittal and coronal planes on postoperative radiographs. Functional outcomes were also evaluated at the final follow-up (a minimum of 16 months). Results: Nine patients had tibia vara and 14 patients had preoperative hyperextension deformity. We observed coronal outliers for the tibial component in 12% knees and for the femoral component in 10% knees. We also observed sagittal outliers for the tibial component in 14% knees and for the femoral component in 6% knees. There was a significant improvement in the functional score at the final follow-up. On multiple linear regression, no difference was found in functional scores of knees with or without tibia vara (p = 0.16) and with or without hyperextension (p = 0.25). Conclusions: Our study further validates the role of computer navigation in desirable implant positioning and limb alignment. We encourage use of computer-assisted navigation as a tool for patient selection, as it allows intraoperative dynamic goniometry and provides real-time kinematic behavior of the knee to obviate pitfalls such as significant residual varus angulation and hyperexten-sion that predispose early failure of UKA.

KW  - PROFILES
KW  - COST
AB  - Background & objectives: Prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has improved significantly in the past two decades. However, the symptoms burden is high at onset and treatment is generally prolonged with significant financial burden. This study was undertaken to assess the quality of life (QoL) and to analyse out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) incurred on MM patients being treated at a tertiary care cancer centre in north India. Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study included 116 patients (aged > 18 yr) of MM (both newly diagnosed and those with recurrent disease). For QoL assessment, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-validated questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C 30 version 3.0) and disease-specific QLQ MY20 were used. For assessing OOPE incurred on treatment, the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) questionnaire was used. Results: Bone pains (68.1%), fatigue (59.7%) and dyspnoea (54.6%) were common symptoms. The mean global health status/QoL score was 59.62 +/- 19.21. International Staging System (ISS) score correlated with global health status score, and gastritis was the main adverse effect. QoL score showed negative correlation to side effects of treatment (-0.53) of MY20 domain. On multivariate analysis, ISS stage (P < 0.001) and adverse effects of treatment (P=0.02) were predictive factors. The median OOPE was (sic) 7900 (IQR, (sic) 4950-13,550) towards medical and (sic) 1150 (IQR, (sic) 500-3100) for non-medical expenses for the past one month. Interpretation & conclusions: Regular assessment of QoL in the clinical management of multiple myeloma patients has the potential of improving treatment outcomes. Measures to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure may improve treatment compliance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) over noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is not known. We aimed to assess the incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 treated with either HFNC or NIV. METHODS: This was a single-center randomized controlled trial performed in the COVID-19 ICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi, India. One hundred and nine subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were recruited and allocated to either HFNC (n = 55) or NIV (n = 54) arm. Primary outcome was intubation by 48 h. Secondary outcomes were improvement in oxygenation by 48 h, intubation rate at day 7, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and PaO2/FIO2 ratio were similar in both the groups. Intubation rate at 48 h was similar between the groups (33% NIV vs 20% HFNC, relative risk 0.6, 95% CI 0.31-1.15, P = .12). Intubation rate at day 7 was lower in the HFNC (27.27%) compared to the NIV group (46.29%) (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99, P = .045), and this difference remained significant after adjustment for the incidence of chronic kidney disease and the arterial pH (adjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.93, P = .03). Hospital mortality was similar between HFNC (29.1%) and NIV (46.2%) group (relative risk 0.6, 95% CI 0.38-1.04, P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: We were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of oxygenation parameters nor of the intubation rate at 48 h between NIV and HFNC. These findings should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial. The study was registered at the Clinical Trials Registry of India (www.ctri.nic.in; reference number: CTRI/2020/07/026835) on July 27, 2020.

AB  - Purpose: In India, COVID-19 infected more than 10 million and caused more than 148,000 fatalities during 2020. Due to "lockdown" eye banks were shuttered in March, 2020 and reopened for operations in the month of May, 2020. This study assesses the immediate impact of the pandemic on eye banking and cornea transplantation in India. Methods: Data was gathered through an online survey of the eye banks and cornea surgeons in India. The questionnaire collected information on the vital statistics of eye bank operations and cornea transplants for the period from March to June for the years 2019 and 2020. Results: 47 eye banks responded to the survey. Collectively in the March-May 2020 period, corneas collected and transplanted declined by 78.27% and 79.14%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2019. In June 2020, the first full month after operations restarted, the collection and transplants were respectively, 82.10% and 81.82%, lower than June, 2019. Long-term glycerine preservation of corneas in the period from March to June 2020 increased by 124.5% compared to same period in 2019, but overall only 5.26% of the corneas recovered were preserved in this way. 44.44% of the eye banks collected corneas only from donors with negative COVID-19 diagnosis. 36.11% of the respondents rejected all suspicious cases, such as donors with respiratory pathologies, and 2.78% of the respondents accepted donations from medico legal cases only. 19.44% of the responding eye banks did SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab test for the deceased donor. 79.5% of the eye banks reported that staff were willing to work during the pandemic, and 82.05% eye banks gave special training to staff before restarting services. Conclusion: Due to the steep decline in collections and transplants, 2020 can be termed as a lost year in Indian eye banking. Attention to Hospital Cornea Recovery Programs, continuous situation monitoring, and ongoing staff training programs are recommended.

AB  - Purpose:In India, COVID-19 infected more than 10 million and caused more than 148,000 fatalities during 2020. Due to "lockdown" eye banks were shuttered in March, 2020 and reopened for operations in the month of May, 2020. This study assesses the immediate impact of the pandemic on eye banking and cornea transplantation in India.Methods:Data was gathered through an online survey of the eye banks and cornea surgeons in India. The questionnaire collected information on the vital statistics of eye bank operations and cornea transplants for the period from March to June for the years 2019 and 2020.Results:47 eye banks responded to the survey. Collectively in the March-May 2020 period, corneas collected and transplanted declined by 78.27% and 79.14%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2019. In June 2020, the first full month after operations restarted, the collection and transplants were respectively, 82.10% and 81.82%, lower than June, 2019. Long-term glycerine preservation of corneas in the period from March to June 2020 increased by 124.5% compared to same period in 2019, but overall only 5.26% of the corneas recovered were preserved in this way. 44.44% of the eye banks collected corneas only from donors with negative COVID-19 diagnosis. 36.11% of the respondents rejected all suspicious cases, such as donors with respiratory pathologies, and 2.78% of the respondents accepted donations from medico legal cases only. 19.44% of the responding eye banks did SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab test for the deceased donor. 79.5% of the eye banks reported that staff were willing to work during the pandemic, and 82.05% eye banks gave special training to staff before restarting services.Conclusion:Due to the steep decline in collections and transplants, 2020 can be termed as a lost year in Indian eye banking. Attention to Hospital Cornea Recovery Programs, continuous situation monitoring, and ongoing staff training programs are recommended.

AB  - Purpose: Stress and Type A personality are established risk factors for the development of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Meditation is known to have a positive effect on reducing stress levels. This study aimed to assess the effect of short-term meditation training in patients of CSC. Methods: A pilot study was conducted where 40 patients diagnosed with acute and non-resolving CSC were randomly assigned to either of two groups - meditation training and routine care (without meditation). The primary outcome measure was time to resolution of CSC based on optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography. Secondary outcome measures were changes in anxiety score (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] scores) and blood pressure. The patients were followed up for a minimum period of 4 months. Results: Twenty cases were included in each group. The demographic pattern, baseline swept-source optical coherence tomography parameters, and STAI scores were similar in both groups. The time to disease resolution was 9.4 +/- 4.22 weeks in the meditation group and 19.5 +/- 2.79 weeks in the nonmeditation group (P < 0.001). At 4 months, CSC had failed to resolve in 60% of patients with routine care compared with 8% in cases following short-term meditation training. STAI scores showed a reduction in stress levels in the meditation group. Furthermore, statistically significant improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressures was also observed following meditation training. Conclusion: Short-term meditation training may be a useful approach in the management of patients with CSC as it tends to reduce stress and prehypertension, and promotes earlier resolution of the condition. However, patient's motivation to complete and pursue the meditation training is a significant barrier.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of CT texture analysis (CTTA) in (1) differentiating Thymoma (THY) from thymic hyperplasia (TH) (2) low from high WHO grade, and (3) low from high Masaoka Koga (MK)/Inter-national Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) stages. Methods: After institute ethical clearance, this cross-sectional study analyzed 26 patients (THY-18, TH-8) who underwent dual energy CT (DECT) and surgery between January 2016 and December 2018. CTTA was performed using TexRad (Feedback Medical Ltd., Cambridge, UK-www.fbkmed.com) by a single observer. Free hand regions of interest (ROIs) were placed over axial sections where there was maximum enhancement and homogeneity. Filtration histogram was used to generate six first-order texture parameters [mean, standard devi-ation (SD), mean of positive pixels (MPP), entropy, skew-ness, and kurtosis] at six spatial scaling factors "SSF 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6". Mann-Whitney test was applied among various categories and p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Three-step feature selection was performed to determine the best parameters among each category. Results: The best performing parameters were (1) THY vs TH-Mean at "SSF 0" (AUC: 0.8889) and MPP at "SSF 0" (AUC: 0.8889), (2) Low vs high WHO grade -no param-eter showed statistical significance with good AUC, and (3) Low vs high MK/ITMIG stage-SD at "SSF 6" (AUC: 0.8052 and 0.8333 respectively]). Conclusion: CTTA revealed several parameters with excellent diagnostic performance in differentiating thymoma from thymic hyperplasia and MK/ITMIG high vs low stages. CTTA could potentially serve as a non-invasive tool for this stratification. Advances in knowledge: This study has employed texture analysis, a novel radiomics method on DECT scans to determine the best performing parameter and their corresponding cut-off values to differentiate among the above-mentioned categories. These new parameters may help add another layer of confidence to non-invasively stratify and prognosticate patients accu-rately which was only previously possible with a biopsy.

AB  - Background & objectives: Primary or idiopathic osteonecrosis of femur head (ONFH) is the second most commonly observed cause among Indian patients suffering from ischemic ONFH. Although a number of genetic polymorphisms have been associated with idiopathic ONFH pathogenesis in Korean and Chinese populations, there are no studies in the Indian population. This is an exploratory study designed to implicate in promoter sequence polymorphisms of a critical fibrinolytic system regulator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene, in cases of idiopathic osteonecrosis. Promoter sequence variations can affect expression levels of PAI-1 gene and may disrupt the coagulation/fibrinolytic equilibrium, which may finally culminate into osteonecrosis. Hence, the aim of the study was to investigate the role of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of PAI-1 gene and osteonecrosis development. Methods: Two SNPs of the PAI-1 gene (rs2227631, -844 G/A; rs1799889, -675 4G/5G) were genotyped in 25 patients diagnosed with idiopathic ONFH and 25 control subjects, using direct sequencing. Subsequently, association analyses were performed for the genotyped SNPs. Results: Both the rs2227631 and rs1799889 genotype and allele frequencies of PAI-1 gene showed an insignificant association with osteonecrosis risk (P=0.717, 0.149). Haplotype frequencies of rs2227631 and rs1799889 were also calculated in patients having idiopathic ONFH and controls. Although the distribution of haplotype GA-4G 4G was found to be the highest among the cases, it was not significantly different when compared with the controls. Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the minor alleles of promoter region sequences of the PAI-1 gene do not contribute to an increase in ONFH predisposition. However, this is a preliminary study and its findings should be considered as suggestive for studies to be done in a larger sample size.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the ophthalmic practice pattern among ophthalmologists in India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online questionnaire-based analysis was performed among members of the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) and results were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. Results: A total of 2253 responses were received. The majority of the participants (72.6%) were between 30 and 60 years of age and were into private practice (64.7%). During the lockdown, over one-third of participant ophthalmologists reported not attending any OPD patients, whereas a majority (64%) provided only emergency ophthalmic services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, <15% surgeries were performed compared to the pre-COVID-19 era by 81% of participants, whereas elective surgeries were performed by only 4.3%. The proportion of participants utilizing telemedicine in ophthalmology showed a two-fold rise from the pre-COVID-19 era (21.9%) to the COVID-19 pandemic (46%). Over half of the participants reported following the AIOS guidelines, reducing clinic hours, use of screening questionnaires, minimizing staff, and use of breath shield on a slit lamp as precautionary measures to reduce the exposure. Over 95% of ophthalmologists were satisfied (score > 5/10) by the AIOS guidelines for ophthalmic practice during COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the ophthalmic care services across India with telemedicine emerging as a major rescue. The majority of practicing ophthalmologists are satisfied with guidelines provided by AIOS for ophthalmic care during the COVID-19 pandemic and have implemented the same in their setup.

AB  - Equitable and timely access to COVID-19-related care has emerged as a major challenge, especially in developing and low-income countries. In India, similar to 65% of the population lives in villages where infrastructural constraints limit the access to molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 infection. Especially, the requirement of a cold chain transport for sustained sample integrity and associated biosafety challenges pose major bottlenecks to the equitable access. Here, we developed an innovative clinical specimen collection medium, named SupraSens microbial transport medium (SSTM). SSTM allowed a cold chain-independent transport at a wide temperature range (15 degrees C to 40 degrees C) and directly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (<15 min). Evaluation of SSTM compared to commercial viral transport medium (VTM) in field studies (n = 181 patients) highlighted that, for the samples from same patients, SSTM could capture more symptomatic (similar to 26.67%, 4/15) and asymptomatic (52.63%, 10/19) COVID-19 patients. Compared to VTM, SSTM yielded significantly lower quantitative PCR (qPCR) threshold cycle (CT) values (mean Delta C-T > -3.50), thereby improving diagnostic sensitivity of SSTM (18.79% [34/181]) versus that of VTM (11.05% [20/ 181]). Overall, SSTM had detection of COVID-19 patients 70% higher than that of VTM. Since the logistical and infrastructural constraints are not unique to India, our study high-lights the invaluable global utility of SSTM as a key to accurately identify those infected and control COVID-19 transmission. Taken together, our data provide a strong justification to the adoption of SSTM for sample collection and transport during the pandemic.
   IMPORTANCE Approximately forty-four percent of the global population lives in villages, including 59% in Africa (https://unhabitat.org/World%20Cities%20Report%202020). The fast-evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2 and its extremely contagious nature warrant early and accurate COVID-19 diagnostics across rural and urban population as a key to prevent viral transmission. Unfortunately, lack of adequate infrastructure, including the availability of biosafety-compliant facilities and an end-to-end cold chain availability for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis, limits the accessibility of testing in these countries. Here, we fulfill this urgent unmet need by developing a sample collection and transport medium, SSTM, that does not require cold chain, neutralizes the virus quickly, and maintains the sample integrity at broad temperature range without compromising sensitivity. Further, we observed that use of SSTM in field studies during pandemic improved the diagnostic sensitivity, thereby establishing the feasibility of molecular testing even in the infrastructural constraints of remote, hilly, or rural communities in India and elsewhere.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on lifestyle of school-going children. Methods: This was a questionnaire-based prospective study of 1237 school children aged 9-14 years enrolled from various private and government schools across Delhi in October-December 2020. These children were being followed-up over the previous 2 years (before pandemic) with details of their lifestyle like near/outdoor/reading activities using a questionnaire as a part of another study. The data during the COVID-19 lockdown was collected by telephonic interview. This was compared to similar information collected from this cohort in the pre-Covid period in 2019 when the students had a regular physical school curriculum. Results: A significant decline was noted in time spent on outdoor activity (from 8.5 hours/week in pre-COVID-19 time to 1.6 hours/week during COVID-19 lockdown; P < 0.001) and doing homework offline (from 15.3 hour/week to 14 hours/week; P < 0.001). A significant increase was noted in screen time spent on digital devices (from 6.2 hours/week to 19.8 hours/week; P<0.001), and watching television (from 12.2 hours/week to 13.4 hours/week; P < 0.001). The rise in the digital on-screen time was significantly more in boys (P < 0.001) and in students from private schools (P < 0.001). The rise in the duration of watching television was significantly more in girls than boys (P < 0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 lockdown has markedly impacted the lifestyle of school children by significantly decreasing the outdoor activity and increasing the screen time, thereby pre-disposing them to ocular ill-health and myopia. This necessitates the adoption of guidelines for promoting healthy digital habits in children.

AB  - Ethambutol use may lead to permanent vision loss by inducing a dose- and duration-dependent optic neuropathy. This has been of concern to ophthalmologists and physicians both; however, ethambutol continues to be used because of its anti-mycobacterial action with relative systemic safety. Recently, the guidelines of the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme of India have been revised to allow for fixed dose and longer duration of ethambutol use; this is likely to result in an increase in vision-threatening adverse effects. Taking cognizance of this, neuro-ophthalmologists, infectious disease specialists, and scientists met under the aegis of the Indian Neuro-Ophthalmology Society to deliberate on prevention, early diagnosis, and management of ethambutol-related toxic optic neuropathy. The recommendations made by the expert group focus on early suspicion of ethambutol toxicity through screening at the physician's office and opportunistic screening by the ophthalmologist. Further, they focus on an early diagnosis through identification of specific clinical biomarkers and on management in way of early stoppage of the drug and supportive therapy. This statement also describes the mechanism of reporting a case of toxic optic neuropathy through the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India and emphasizes the need for spreading awareness regarding vision-threatening adverse effects among patients and healthcare workers.

AB  - Objective Role of texture parameters on the basis of Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer (Pca) is largely unexplored. Present work done is a preliminary study that aims to evaluate the role of Haralick texture features on the basis of Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT in Pca in which texture features were used to differentiate between normal prostate and Pca tissue. Methods The study retrospectively enrolled patients in two groups: group 1 included 30 patients with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma prostate and median age 64 years (range: 50-82 years) who underwent baseline Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT prior to therapy; group 2 included 24 patients with pathologies other than Pca and median age 53.5 years (range: 18-80 years) who underwent Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT as part of another study in our department. Patients in group 2 did not have any prostate pathology and served as controls for the study. The segmented images of prostate (3-D image) were used to calculate 11 Haralick texture features in MATLAB. SUVmax was also evaluated. All parameters were compared among the two groups using appropriate statistical analysis and P value Results All 11 Haralick texture features, as well as SUVmax, were significantly different among Pca and controls (P < 0.05). Among the texture features, contrast was most significant (P value of Mann-Whitney U <0.001) in differentiating Pca from normal prostate with AUROC curve of 82.9% with sensitivity and specificity 83.30% and 73.30%, respectively at cut-off 0.640. SUVmax was also significant with AUROC curve 94.0% and sensitivity and specificity 62.5% and 90%, respectively at cut-off 5.7. A significant negative correlation of SUVmax was observed with contrast. Conclusion Haralick texture features have a significant role in differentiating Pca and normal prostate.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY
KW  - OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY
AB  - Four patients with pseudophakic corneal edema were subjected to pre-Descemet endothelial keratoplasty (PDEK) under the direct guidance of microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography (i-OCT). i-OCT facilitated successful type 1 big bubble formation during donor preparation, debridement of the hypertrophic epithelium, planning and placement of surgical wounds, descemetorrhexis with removal of remnant Descemet membrane tags, and identification of correct donor orientation and interface details. It was also possible to discern the stability of intraocular lens, flat iris configuration, adequate stromal hydration, and wound apposition on i-OCT. Preoperative visual acuity was counting fingers (50%), 0.78 logMAR (25%), and 1.48 logMAR (25%), whereas postoperative visual acuity was 0.6 logMAR (50%) and 0.3 logMAR (50%). At 6-months of follow-up, all grafts were clear and well attached, the mean central corneal thickness, graft size, graft thickness, and endothelial cell loss were 557.25 +/- 13.45 mu m, 7.75 +/- 0.20 mm, 25.5 +/- 2.64 mu m, and 21.6 +/- 0.02%, respectively. To conclude, i-OCT helped during various surgical steps of PDEK. Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Wolters Kluwer on behalf of ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - We describe two cases with epiretinal membrane (ERM) from uncontrolled gliosis seen after multilayered inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique for full thickness macular hole (FTMH). Two patients with FTMH who had undergone surgery with inverted ILM flap technique were examined by serial optical coherence tomography scans to evaluate the course of multilayered ILM flaps seen as fovea] hyperreflective lesions postoperatively. We observed excessive uncontrolled gliosis over these hyperreflective ILM flaps with ERM formation, along with worsening metamorphopsia and best-corrected visual acuity. Case 1 underwent a repeat surgery for ERM. We report excessive uncontrolled gliosis as a rare complication of multilayered inverted ILM flap technique for FTMH.

KW  - SURVIVAL
AB  - Background & objectives: Despite advances in diagnostics and therapeutics, tuberculosis (TB) is widely prevalent and contributes to a significant burden of illness in both developing and developed nations. The present study was aimed to assess the role of coronin in TB patients and healthy controls. Coronin is a leucocyte-specific protein that is actively recruited in mycobacterial phagolysosomes, where it inhibits lysosomal delivery of Mycobacterium by activating a calcium-dependent phosphatase-calcineurin. Methods: In the study, 100 newly diagnosed cases of TB (pulmonary and extra-pulmonary) and healthy controls were prospectively enrolled over one year and the levels of coronin-1a in these patients and controls were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: A total of 100 TB patients and 100 healthy individuals as controls were assessed. There were 59 patients with extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) and 41 of pulmonary TB (PTB). In 47 per cent of patients, corroborative histopathological evidence of TB was also available. Significantly higher values of coronin-1a were observed in TB patients (19.94 +/- 2.61) than in healthy controls (16.09 +/- 1.91) (P < 0.001). Interpretation & conclusions: Coronin 1a appears to play an important role in the TB disease pathophysiology and agents developed against coronin may have a role in the treatment of TB. Further studies are required to assess if coronin-1a levels are elevated in non-tubercular infective a etiologies and whether these can be a potential drug target in patients with TB.

AB  - Background: "Line sign," "cookie cutter sign," "square biopsy sign," "high eccrine glands sign" have been previously described in morphoea and lichen sclerosus. We found focal areas of thickened collagen bundles with lymphocytes interspersed between them in several biopsies of these conditions. Materials and Methods: We reviewed slides of sclerosing disorders obtained from the archives of the pathology department in our hospital for the period 2013-2019. Results: A total of 73 slides including 40 of lichen sclerosus, 24 of morphea, 2 of lichen sclerosus-morphea overlap, and 7 of systemic sclerosis were evaluated. Lymphocytes were noted between sclerotic collagen bundles in 46 (63%) slides, being most common in lichen sclerosus (80%, 32/40) followed by morphea (50%, 12/24), whereas it was seen in one case each of lichen sclerosus with morphea overlap (50%, 1/2) and systemic sclerosis (14.3%, 1/7). The finding was noted in the upper dermis in 20 of 32 (62.5%) slides of lichen sclerosus and in both the superficial and deep dermis in 11 (91.7%) of 12 slides of morphea. Conclusion: Lymphocyte-peppered sclerotic collagen may be a useful histological clue to the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus, morphea, and systemic sclerosis.

AB  - Purpose: It is not known if the muscle matrix that becomes functional after gap arthroplasty (GA) in temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA), induces growth of the mandible or the reconstructive arthroplasty with costochondral graft (CCG) is responsible for growth. The study aimed to evaluate the mandibular growth and functional outcome with the use of CCG/GA in the management of pediatric TMJA.
   Methods: The investigators designed a cluster randomized controlled trial on pediatric (3 to 16 years) TMJA patients. Treatment applied (CCG and GA), was the primary predictor variable. Patients were divided into CCG and GA groups. The primary outcome variable was growth. Secondary outcome variables included etiology and duration of ankylosis, maximal incisal opening (MIO), reankylosis, occlusion, laterotrusion, chin deviation, facial asymmetry, occlusal tilt, and complications. The distance condylion (Co) to gnathion (Gn) was used to measure mandibular length. Ramal height was measured from Co- gonion (Go). Lower facial height was measured from the anterior nasal spine to Gn. Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate the regression coefficient adjusted for the cluster. The patient was considered as a cluster and the unit of analysis was joint.
   Results: Fifty-six {n = 28 in each group, (n = 33 joint in the CCG group and n = 31 joints in GA group)} patients were analyzed. The median follow-up was 33-months (31.93 +/- 15.24) in the CCG group and 32-months (32.85 +/- 17.84) in the GA group. Intergroup comparison between the CCG and GA group showed a statistically significant difference in mandibular length (CCG = 77.51 +/- 9.31 and GA = 66.66 +/- 8.32 mm, P < .001), ramal height (CCG = 44.21 +/- 7.3 and GA = 31.87 +/- 8.4 mm, P < .001), and statistically insignificant difference in lower facial height (CCG = 52.53 +/- 6.1 and GA = 50.19 +/- 6.3 mm, P = 0.14) at follow-up. Statistically, significant improvement was seen in MIO in both groups (<.001).
   Conclusions: The results of the present study concluded that growth and jaw functions were better in reconstructive arthroplasty with CCG than GA in pediatric TMJA. (C) 2021 The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Background: FOXP3 gene, known to be a potential tumor suppressor, has been identified to interact with HER2 in mammary cancer. Moreover, the high expression of FOXP3 serves as a good predictor of the survival of patients in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer. The expression and epigenetic alterations were evaluated in female breast cancer patients.Material and Methods: Expression studies at the mRNA level and protein level were conducted in 140 breast cancer cases by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Epigenetic studies were also conducted by analyzing the methylation status at the promoter region of the gene using MS-PCR.Results: FOXP3 mRNA expression and protein expression were downregulated in breast cancer patients. The absence of FOXP3 protein expression is significantly associated with promoter methylation, where 70 methylated cases exhibited protein loss (70/95, 73.6%). Statistically, we also found a significant correlation between FOXP3 protein expression and TNM stage, promoter methylation, and histological grade. The methylated FOXP3 cases that did not express protein were also significantly associated with positive lymph node metastasis and HER-2 status.Conclusion: The expression profile of FOXP3 may serve as a prognostic factor. In short, FOXP3 may stand in the most crucial list of biomarkers for breast cancer, bringing compelling results in terms of treatment and management of the disease.

AB  - Purpose: The literature lacks evidence about activity of masseter and anterior temporalis muscles in temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate longitudinal electromyography (EMG) changes in masseter and anterior temporalis muscle before and after gap arthroplasty in unilateral TMJA patients. Specific aim was to investigate the EMG activity restoration to the level of non-ankylosed side after arthroplasty.
   Methods: The investigator implemented a prospective longitudinal study amongst TMJA patients treated with gap arthroplasty. EMG of masseter and anterior temporalis were recorded bilaterally on ankylosed and non-ankylosed side. EMG signals of masseter and anterior temporalis were recorded preoperatively and 1 week, 3 month and 6 month postoperatively at rest and at maximum voluntary clench (MVC).
   Results: The study sample was composed of 16 (male:female = 1:1.28) unilateral TMJA patients. The mean duration of ankylosis was 3.25 +/- 1.18 years. The difference in EMG root-mean-square (RMS) values of ankylosed side when compared to the preoperative values of non-ankylosed side was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001) preoperatively, 1 week and 3 month postoperatively, while it was statistically not significant (p > 0.99) at 6-month postoperatively.
   Conclusion: The present study concludes that the TMJA patients have hyperactivity of masseter and anterior temporalis muscle. Restoring the function causes the muscle activity to progress to the values of normal side. EMG activity as measured on follow-up may be one of the predicting factor for re-ankylosis.

AB  - Adipose tissue is a compact and well-organized tissue containing a heterogeneous cellular population of progenitor cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells. Due to its availability and accessibility, adipose tissue is considered a "stem cell depot. " Adipose tissue products possess anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects. Nanofat, being a compact bundle of stem cells with regenerative and tissue remodeling potential, has potential in translational and regenerative medicine. Considering the wide range of applicability of its reconstructive and regenerative potential, the applications of nanofat can be used in various disciplines. Nanofat behaves on the line of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. At the site of injury, these stromal cells initiate a site-specific reparative response comprised of remodeling of the extracellular matrix, enhanced and sustained angiogenesis, and immune system modulation. These properties of stromal cells provide a platform for the usage of regenerative medicine principles in curbing various diseases. Details about nanofat, including various preparation methods, characterization, delivery methods, evidence on practical applications, and ethical concerns are included in this review. However, appropriate guidelines and preparation protocols for its optimal use in a wide range of clinical applications have yet to be standardized.

AB  - Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used in chemotherapy but its associated hepatotoxicity is a major complication, limiting its use. This study evaluates possible therapeutic effect of oral alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) supplementation against MTX-induced hepatotoxicity.
   Methods: HepG2 cells were used to evaluate in-vitro cyto-protection conferred by AKG against MTX induced cytotoxicity. For in-vivo animal study, rats were divided into three groups. Group-I served as control. Group-II animals were administered single intraperitoneal injection of MTX (20 mg/kg/body weight), while Group-III received MTX as in group-II followed by oral AKG (2 gm/kg body weight) for 5 days. Tc-99m-Mebrofenin hepatobiliary study was performed under a gamma camera to determine real time functional status of rats' livers. Multiple parameters concerning hepatic mebrofenin uptake and excretion, including T-peak and T-1/2 peak in control and treated animals were determined. Biochemical analysis of the liver homogenate in terms of hepatic enzyme activities in serum, antioxidant status, tissue factor activity, tissue collagen content and histological analysis of the liver tissue were also done.
   Results: AKG supplementation significantly reversed MTX induced derangement in activities of serum liver enzymes [ALT and ALP (p = 0.003); AST (p = 0.005)], antioxidant status [LPO and GSH (p = 0.005); CAT (p = 0.004)], tissue factor activity (p = 0.005) and tissue collagen content (p = 0.005). Functional imaging confirmed that hepatic retention and fractional biliary excretion were significantly abnormal in MTX treated group (T-peak: 234 s +/- 40 s; T-1/2 peak: 846sec +/- 32sec) as compared to AKG supplemented group (T-peak: 144 s +/- 35sec; T-1/2 peak: 468sec +/- 27sec). Hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) was 92.2 +/- 1.8%, 48.7 +/- 2.6% and 69.8 +/- 4.3% in control, MTX and AKG supplemented rats respectively.
   Conclusion: Tc-99m-mebrofenin imaging strongly suggests therapeutic action of AKG in protecting liver damage by MTX in rats. Functional imaging parameters correlated well with biochemical and histopathological findings.

AB  - TB-IRIS is an abnormal inflammatory response in a subset of HIV-TB co-infected patients shortly after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Therapy in these patients could have greatly improved the life expectancy as ART reconstitutes the function and number of CD4+ T cells and many patients see improvement in symptoms but paradoxically up to 54% of co-infected patients develop TB-IRIS. Different studies have indicated that both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in the pathology of IRIS but the role of macrophages in abnormal activation of CD4+ T cells is poorly understood. Since macrophages are one of the major antigen-presenting cells and are infected by M.tb at a high frequency, they are very much likely to be involved in the development of TB-IRIS. In this study, we have developed a mouse model of experimental IRIS, in which M.tb-infected T-cell knockout mice undergo a fatal inflammatory disease after CD4+ T cell reconstitution. Lung macrophages and blood monocytes from M.tb-infected TCR beta(-/-) mice showed upregulated expression of cell surface activation markers and also showed higher mRNA expression of inflammation-associated chemokines and matrix metalloproteases responsible for tissue damage. Furthermore, cytokine and TLR signaling feedback mechanism to control excessive inflammation was also found to be dysregulated in these macrophages under lymphopenic conditions. Previous studies have shown that hyperactive CD4+ T cells are responsible for disease induction and our study shows that somehow macrophages are in a higher activated state when infected with M.tb in an immune-deficient condition, which results in excessive activation of the adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of TB-IRIS would facilitate identification of prospective biomarkers for disease development in HIV-TB co-infected patients before starting antiretroviral therapy.

AB  - Background: Traditionally, peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM) were considered terminal diseases because of their advanced nature, therefore, systemic chemotherapy was given with palliative intent only. As a result, very poor survival outcomes were observed. But with the introduction of complete Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), the scenario has changed dramati-cally. Methodology: An objective electronic database search was performed in Pubmed, NLM Catalog, Google scholar, Bookshelf, and Pubmed Central published in the time period from 20 0 0 till 2020. All the random-ized studies were included. In the absence of randomized studies, both prospective and retrospective stud-ies were included. The outcomes of HIPEC were measured in terms of median survival, disease-free sur-vival, overall survival, complications and drug toxicities. Results: CRS and HIPEC are considered the standard of care for PMP and MPM even in the absence of level 1 evidence due to lack of an effective alternative treatment. In colorectal and gastric cancer, several phase-three trials are showing overall survival benefit in selected cases while there is a prophylactic and palliative role of HIPEC in gastric cancer. Three reported phase 3 trials showed positive results in ovarian cancer. In peritoneal sarcomatosis, the role of HIPEC is yet to be proven. Conclusion: The patient selection is the key to the successful outcomes after HIPEC. HIPEC should be performed by the experienced surgeons in specialized centres with a strong critical care and in-tensive care support to reduce the morbidity and mortality. Ongoing trials and future directions will prove to be an indispensable arm in the oncological armamentarium. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Cell free DNA (cfDNA) shed by cancer cells into blood and body fluids is a potential substrate for molecular testing. While plasma is approved for EGFR mutation testing in certain clinical settings, mutation testing on urine is not well explored in lung cancer. In this study, we assess the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of EGFR mutation analysis on plasma and urine samples. Methods: Matched plasma and urine were collected prospectively from TKI-naive lung adenocarcinoma (ADCA) patients (Group A) with available tumor tissue. Only plasma was collected from TKI-treated, known EGFR mutant ADCA patients developing TKI resistance (Group B). qPCR (tumor tissue) or digital droplet-PCR (urine/plasma) was performed for exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R and exon 20 T790M. Results: Eighty-one patients (60 Group A, 21 Group B) were included. In Group A, EGFR mutations were detected in tissue in 34/60 (57%) patients. Mutations were detected in matched plasma in 24 (24/34, 70.5% sensitivity), and in matched urine in 15 (15/25, 60% sensitivity) of the 34 EGFR mutant cases, with no false positives (100% positive predictive value). Plasma and urine mutation results showed moderate agreement (70%) with a combined sensitivity of 88% (22/25). In Group B, new T790M mutations were detected in plasma in 61% (13/21) patients. Con- clusion: Liquid biopsies show moderate sensitivity (plasma > urine) with 100% positive predictive rates for EGFR mutations. Testing of more than one type of liquid biopsy sample increases sensitivity. In TKI-resistant settings, liquid biopsies can obviate need for invasive biopsies in > 60% patients.

AB  - eLife digest Infectious diseases, particularly those caused by airborne pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, spread by social contact, and understanding how people mix is critical in controlling outbreaks. To explore these patterns, researchers typically carry out large contact surveys. Participants are asked for personal information (such as gender, age and occupation), as well as details of recent social contacts, usually those that happened in the last 24 hours. This information includes, the age and gender of the contact, where the interaction happened, how long it lasted, and whether it involved physical touch. These kinds of surveys help scientists to predict how infectious diseases might spread. But there is a problem: most of the data come from high-income countries, and there is evidence to suggest that social contact patterns differ between places. Therefore, data from these countries might not be useful for predicting how infections spread in lower-income regions. Here, Mousa et al. have collected and combined data from 27 contact surveys carried out before the COVID-19 pandemic to see how baseline social interactions vary between high- and lower-income settings. The comparison revealed that, in higher-income countries, the number of daily contacts people made decreased with age. But, in lower-income countries, younger and older individuals made similar numbers of contacts and mixed with all age groups. In higher-income countries, more contacts happened at work or school, while in low-income settings, more interactions happened at home and people were also more likely to live in larger, intergenerational households. Mousa et al. also found that gender affected how long contacts lasted and whether they involved physical contact, both of which are key risk factors for transmitting airborne pathogens. These findings can help researchers to predict how infectious diseases might spread in different settings. They can also be used to assess how effective non-medical restrictions, like shielding of the elderly and workplace closures, will be at reducing transmissions in different parts of the world.
   Background: Transmission of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depends on patterns of contact and mixing across populations. Understanding this is crucial to predict pathogen spread and the effectiveness of control efforts. Most analyses of contact patterns to date have focused on high-income settings. Methods: Here, we conduct a systematic review and individual-participant meta-analysis of surveys carried out in low- and middle-income countries and compare patterns of contact in these settings to surveys previously carried out in high-income countries. Using individual-level data from 28,503 participants and 413,069 contacts across 27 surveys, we explored how contact characteristics (number, location, duration, and whether physical) vary across income settings. Results: Contact rates declined with age in high- and upper-middle-income settings, but not in low-income settings, where adults aged 65+ made similar numbers of contacts as younger individuals and mixed with all age groups. Across all settings, increasing household size was a key determinant of contact frequency and characteristics, with low-income settings characterised by the largest, most intergenerational households. A higher proportion of contacts were made at home in low-income settings, and work/school contacts were more frequent in high-income strata. We also observed contrasting effects of gender across income strata on the frequency, duration, and type of contacts individuals made. Conclusions: These differences in contact patterns between settings have material consequences for both spread of respiratory pathogens and the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions. Funding: This work is primarily being funded by joint Centre funding from the UK Medical Research Council and DFID (MR/R015600/1).

AB  - One of the significant challenges in the fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering lies in the direct interaction of bioactive agents with cells in the scaffolds matrix, which curbs the effectiveness of bioactive agents resulting in diminished cell recognition and attachment ability of the scaffolds. Here, three-dimensional porous scaffolds were fabricated using polycaprolactone (PCL) and chitosan, by two approaches, i.e., blending and surface coating to compare their overall effectiveness. Blended scaffolds (Chi-PCL) were compared with the scaffolds fabricated using surface coating technique, where chitosan was coated on the pore wall of PCL scaffolds (C-PCL). The C-PCL exhibited a collective improvement in bioactivities of the stem cell on the scaffold, because of the cell compatible environment provided by the presence of chitosan over the scaffolds interface. The C-PCL showed the enhanced cell attachment and proliferation behavior of the scaffolds along with two-fold increase in hemolysis compatibility compared to Chi-PCL. Furthermore, the compression strength in C-PCL increased by 24.52% and 8.62% increase in total percentage porosity compared to Chi-PCL was attained. Along with this, all the bone markers showed significant upregulation in C-PCL scaffolds, which supported the surface coating technique over the conventional methods, even though the pore size of C-PCL was compromised by 19.98% compared with Chi-PCL.

AB  - HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are commonly encountered blood-borne infectious microorganisms. Infection with these viruses typically requires long-lasting drug therapy. Coinfections, especially with tuberculosis, pose a challenge to the creation of a regimen with adequate efficacy and minimal drug-drug interactions and adverse effects. We present the case of a young man with a history of intravenous drug misuse who was diagnosed with disseminated tuberculosis and with a triple infection with HBV, HCV, and HIV. The treatment for tuberculosis was initiated first, followed 2 months later by antiretrovirals that were effective against both HIV and HBV. After 9 months of antitubercular therapy, HCV was successfully treated with 12 weeks of oral direct-acting antivirals. We describe the challenges faced in formulating a therapeutic plan for such patients and discuss the various drug interactions that can arise between antitubercular drugs, antiretrovirals, anti-HBV drugs, and direct-acting antivirals against HCV.

AB  - The most recent version of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of localised colon cancer was published in 2020. It was decided by both the ESMO and the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology (JSMO) to convene a special virtual guidelines meeting in March 2021 to adapt the ESMO 2020 guidelines to take into account the ethnic differences associated with the treatment of localised colon cancer in Asian patients. These guidelines represent the consensus opinions reached by experts in the treatment of patients with localised colon cancer representing the oncological societies of Japan (JSMO), China (CSCO), India (ISMPO), Korea (KSMO), Malaysia (MOS), Singapore (SSO) and Taiwan (TOS). The voting was based on scientific evidence and was independent of the current treatment practices and drug availability and reimbursement situations in the different Asian countries.

AB  - In a multicentric, observational, investigator-blinded, and longitudinal clinical study of 764 ART-naive subjects, we identified nine different promoter variant strains of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) emerging in the Indian population, with some of these variants being reported for the first time. Unlike several previous studies, our work here focuses on the evolving viral regulatory elements, not the coding sequences. The emerging viral strains contain additional copies of the existing transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), including TCF-1 alpha/LEF-1, RBEIII, AP-1, and NF-kappa B, created by sequence duplication. The additional TFBS are genetically diverse and may blur the distinction between the modulatory region of the promoter and the viral enhancer. In a follow-up analysis, we found trends, but no significant associations between any specific variant promoter and prognostic markers, probably because the emerging viral strains might not have established mono infections yet. Illumina sequencing of four clinical samples containing a coinfection indicated the domination of one strain over the other and establishing a stable ratio with the second strain at the follow-up time points. Since a single promoter regulates viral gene expression and constitutes the master regulatory circuit with Tat, the acquisition of additional and variant copies of the TFBS may significantly impact viral latency and latent reservoir characteristics. Further studies are urgently warranted to understand how the diverse TFBS profiles of the viral promoter may modulate the characteristics of the latent reservoir, especially following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

AB  - GNE gene-specific c.2179G>A(p.V727M) is a key alteration reported in patients with hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) and represents an ethnic founder mutation in the Indian cohort. However, the underlying role of this mutation in pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to access pos-sible mechanisms of V727M mutation that could be leading to myopathy. We evaluated various in silico tools to predict the effect of this mutation on pathogenicity, structural or possible interactions, that could induce myopathy. Our results propose that V727M mutation could induce deleter-ious effects or pathogenicity and affect the stability of GNE protein. Analysis of differential genes reported in the V727 mutant case suggests that it can affect GNE pro-tein interaction with Myc-proto-oncogene (MYC) transcrip-tion factor. Our in silico analysis also suggests a possible interaction between GNE ManNac-kinase domain with MYC protein at the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. MYC targets reported in skeletal muscles via ChIP-seq suggest that it plays a key role in regulating the expression of many genes reported differentially expressed in V727M-mutated HIBMs. We conclude that V727M mutation could alter the interaction of GNE with MYC thereby altering transcription of sialyltransferase and neuromuscular genes, thus understanding these effects could pave the way for developing effective therapies against HIBM.

AB  - Background. Lack of robust data on economic burden due to enteric fever in India has made decision making on typhoid vaccination a challenge. Surveillance for Enteric Fever network was established to address gaps in typhoid disease and economic burden.
   Methods. Patients hospitalized with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever and nontraumatic ileal perforation were identified at 14 hospitals. 'these sites represent urban referral hospitals (tier 3) and smaller hospitals in urban slums, remote rural, and tribal settings (tier 2). Cost of illness and productivity loss data from onset to 28 days after discharge from hospital were collected using a structured questionnaire. The direct and indirect costs of an illness episode were analyzed by type of setting.
   Results. In total, 274 patients from tier 2 surveillance, 891 patients from tier 3 surveillance, and 110 ileal perforation patients provided the cost of illness data. The mean direct cost of severe enteric fever was US$119.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], US$85.8-152.4) in tier 2 and US$405.7 (95% CI, 366.9-444.4) in tier 3; 16.9% of patients in tier 3 experienced catastrophic expenditure.
   Conclusions. The cost of treating enteric fever is considerable and likely to increase with emerging antimicrobial resistance. Equitable preventive strategies are urgently needed.

AB  - Background. Ileal perforation occurs in about 1% of enteric fevers as a complication, with a case fatality risk (CFR) of 20%-30% in the early 1990s that decreased to 15.4% in 2011 in South East Asia. We report nontraumatic ileal perforations and its associated CFR from a 2-year prospective enteric fever surveillance across India.
   Methods. The Surveillance for Enteric Fever in India (SEFI) project established a multitiered surveillance system for enteric fever between December 2017 and March 2020. Nontraumatic ileal perforations were surveilled at 8 tertiary care and 6 secondary care hospitals and classified according to etiology.
   Results. Of the 158 nontraumatic ileal perforation cases identified,126 were consented and enrolled. Enteric fever (34.7%), tuberculosis (19.0%), malignancy (5.8%), and perforation of Meckel diverticulum (4.9%) were the common etiology. In those with enteric fever ileal perforation, the CFR was 7.1%.
   Conclusions. Enteric fever remains the most common cause of nontraumatic ileal perforation in India, followed by tuberculosis. Better modalities of establishing etiology are required to classify the illness, and frame management guidelines and preventive measures. CFR data are critical for comprehensive disease burden estimation and policymaking.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the pooled prevalence of depression in persons with epilepsy and assess the methodological moderators affecting the prevalence estimates.
   Methods: Five electronic databases PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, WHO Global Index Medicus, and Clinicaltrial.gov were searched for studies reporting prevalence of depression in PWE >= 18 years of age in any setting.
   Results: Out of 13,873 studies, after deduplication and screening, 56 studies with 10,527 PWE met the eligibility criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of depression in PWE was 32% (95%confidence interval [CI] 28-35%) and significant heterogeneity (Chi-square =1171.53, p = 0.00; tau(2) = 0.02; I-2 = 94.36%). Prevalence has doubled in the recent years (16% in 2000-2005 vs. 35% in 2016-2020), was higher in Asia than in Europe (coefficient 0.899, 95%CI: 0.809-0.999; p = 0.049). Among assessment methods, prevalence was highest in HAM-D scale (54%, 95%CI: 27-82%) and lowest in MINI (22%, 95%CI: 19-26%). Sensitivity analysis also corroborated findings when MINI was excluded (35%, 95%CI: 31-38%).
   Conclusions: A significant proportion of PWE have depression. Though there is substantial heterogeneity due to various methodological moderators, it is unlikely to affect the routine screening of PWE for depression. Use of a screening tool should be based on ease of administration, and cutoff selection should ensure identification of minimal depression as well. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Therefore, a multicenter study on the Surveillance of Enteric Fever in India was carried out to estimate the incidence, clinical presentation, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trend. The data presented here represent the national burden of AMR in Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A.
   Methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A (n = 2373) isolates collected prospectively during a 2-year period from November 2017 to January 2020.
   Results. Of 2373 Salmonella isolates, 2032 (85.6%) were identified as S. Typhi and 341 (14.4%) were S. Paratyphi A. Approximately 2% of S. Typhi were multidrug-resistant (MDR), whereas all 341 (100%) of S. Paratyphi A isolates were sensitive to the first-line antimicrobials. Among 98% of ciprofloxacin nonsusceptible isolates, resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] >0.5 mu g/mL) was higher in S. Typhi (37%) compared with S. Paratyphi A (20%). Azithromycin susceptibility was 99.9% and 100% with a mean MIC of 4.98 mu g/ml. for S. Typhi and 7.39 mu g/ml. for S. Paratyphi A respectively. Ceftriaxone was the only agent that retained 100% susceptibility. Moreover, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors showed potent in vitro activity against the study isolates.
   Conclusions. Data obtained from this systematic surveillance study confirms the declining trend of MDR Salmonella isolates from India. The higher prevalence of ciprofloxacin nonsusceptibility enforces to limit its use and adhere to the judicious usage of azithromycin and ceftriaxone for enteric fever management.

AB  - Background There is an urgent need to understand the key events driving pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease, so that precise treatment can be instituted. In this respect NETosis is gaining increased attention in the scientific community, as an important pathological process contributing to mortality. We sought to test if indeed there exists robust evidence of NETosis in multiple transcriptomic data sets from human subjects with severe COVID-19 disease. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to test for up-regulation of gene set functional in NETosis in the blood of patients with COVID-19 illness. Results Blood gene expression functional in NETosis increased with severity of illness, showed negative correlation with blood oxygen saturation, and was validated in the lung of COVID-19 non-survivors. Temporal expression of IL-6 was compared between severe and moderate illness with COVID-19. Unsupervised clustering was performed to reveal co-expression of IL-6 with complement genes. In severe COVID-19 illness, there is transcriptional evidence of activation of NETosis, complement and coagulation cascade, and negative correlation between NETosis and respiratory function (oxygen saturation). An early spike in IL-6 is observed in severe COVID-19 illness that is correlated with complement activation. Conclusions Based on the transcriptional dynamics of IL-6 expression and its downstream effect on complement activation, we constructed a model that links early spike in IL-6 level with persistent and self-perpetuating complement activation, NETosis, immunothrombosis and respiratory dysfunction. Our model supports the early initiation of anti-IL6 therapy in severe COVID-19 disease before the life-threatening complications of the disease can perpetuate themselves autonomously.

AB  - Introduction Micro-embolic signals (MESs) detected using transcranial Doppler (TCD) help in risk stratification in stroke patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to estimate the prevalence of MES and its association with stroke recurrence, functional outcome, and mortality in different stroke subtypes. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted before 26(th) January 2021 in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and . Studies were identified that used TCD to detect MES in stroke/TIA patients. Pooled prevalence and odds ratio (OR) along with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated for different outcome measures. The entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. Findings Fifty-eight studies involving 5123 patients (1329 MES+, 3794 MES-) were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MES among all acute stroke/TIA patients was 30% (95% CI 25-34%). The pooled prevalence adjusted after the trim-and-fill analysis among all acute stroke/TIA patients was 18% (95% CI 14-23%). The prevalence of MES was high among all stroke subtypes except in patients with small vessel disease (SVD). In patients with new-onset stroke/TIA, the presence of MES was associated with a high risk of recurrence of cerebral ischemia (OR 4.03; 95% CI 2.38-6.82). Although no significant association was observed for the presence of MES with increased mortality (OR 2.37; 95% CI 0.75-7.50) and poor functional outcome (OR 2.11; 95% CI 0.20-22.50) among patients with new-onset stroke/TIA, this could only be determined in a smaller sample size of 477 patients. Conclusions Our meta-analysis showed a 30% prevalence of MES following acute stroke/TIA. The presence of MES increased the chance of recurrence of cerebral ischemia but was not associated with poor functional outcomes and mortality in the studied subgroup.

AB  - Monotherapy with triptans in acute migraine is ineffective in many patients and contraindicated in certain cardiovascular diseases where alternative therapeutic options are necessary to explore. This meta-analysis has evaluated the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan for the treatment of acute migraine in adults. After performing a literature search on MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane databases, and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data from 4 relevant articles. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed in the selection, analysis, and reporting of findings. A random-effects model was used to estimate effect size. Quality assessment was done using the risk of bias assessment tool and meta-regression for probable variables affecting effect size. Subgroup analysis was done depending on the dose of lasmiditan. Lasmiditan use was associated with a significantly higher percentage of patients with pain freedom (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-2.39; P < .00001), sustained pain freedom (OR, 1.93; 95%CI, 1.55-2.39; P <.00001), headache response (OR, 2.05; 95%CI, 1.77-2.36; P < .00001), clinical disability level (OR, 1.36; 95%CI, 1.20-1.55; P < .00001), patients' global impression (OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.69-2.10; P < .00001), and significantly lower use of rescue medication (OR, 0.49; 95%CI, 0.38-0.63; P < .00001) compared to placebo. Lasmiditan use was also associated with a higher likelihood of adverse effects like dizziness (OR, 6.54; 95%CI, 4.24-10.07; P < .00001), paresthesia (OR, 4.28; 95%CI, 2.97-6.17; P < .00001), and fatigue (OR, 5.67; 95%CI, 3.78-8.52; P < .00001) compared to placebo. Subgroup analysis showed a dose-dependent effect of lasmiditan on pain freedom, sustained pain freedom, patient's global impression, and occurrence of adverse drug reactions. Prediction probability for effect estimate favoring placebo was calculated to be 0.0017%. Lasmiditan has shown a favorable effect in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of an acute attack of migraine in comparison to placebo. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term safety, efficacy, and use in specific subgroups of patients. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42020177838

AB  - To the Editor: Choueiri et al. (Aug. 19 issue)(1) reported a significant improvement in disease-free survival with the addition of adjuvant pembrolizumab after nephrectomy in patients with renal-cell carcinoma (disease-free survival at 24 months, 77.3% vs. 68.1%; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.87; P=0.002). Although the results are encouraging, the arbitrary duration of 12 months of adjuvant treatment is a concern. In the pembrolizumab group, 61.1% of the patients completed 17 cycles of treatment over 1 year, and the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was an adverse event (which occurred in 21.3% of patients).(1) In patients . . .

AB  - Aim: Hepatic fibrosis in injured liver is characterized by the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from their quiescent state. Survivin (BIRC5) is one of the key genes that are upregulated during activation of HSCs but their role in HSC activation and fibrosis progression is unknown. Here, we have investigated the role of survivin protein in early fibrogenic activation of HSCs and fibrosis progression in chronic liver injury. Materials & methods: Primary quiescent HSCs were isolated from healthy mice liver through perfusion and cultured for fibrogenic activation. Survivin expression was suppressed by its pharmacological suppressant, YM155. We developed chronic liver injury induced fibrotic mice model through administrating repeated dose of CCl4 for 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Mice were pre-treated with YM155 a week before CCl4 administration till 2nd week of dosing and then discontinued. Hepatic parameters were characterized and underlying mechanisms were investigated. Key findings: Survivin expression gradually increased along with the expression of alpha SMA, collagen I activation maker in HSCs during their activation from quiescent state. Survivin suppression through YM155 downregulated alpha SMA, collagen I. Pre-treatment of YM155 in mice ceased the early activation of HSCs and onset of fibrosis in injured liver. However, discontinuation of YM155 initiated the activation of HSCs and fibrosis progression that shows survivin expression in HSCs is essential for their early activation and onset of liver fibrosis. Significance: Survivin expression induces with activation of HSCs and drives onset of liver fibrosis in injured liver. Targeting survivin protein in activated HSCs could be a potential anti-fibrotic therapeutic approach in chronic liver injury.

AB  - Protein ubiquitination is one of the most crucial posttranslational modifications responsible for regulating the stability and activity of proteins involved in homeostatic cellular function. Inconsistencies in the ubiquitination process may lead to tumorigenesis. Ubiquitin-specific peptidases are attractive therapeutic targets in different cancers and are being evaluated for clinical development. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 37 (USP37) is one of the least studied members of the USP family. USP37 controls numerous aspects of oncogenesis, including stabilizing many different oncoproteins. Recent work highlights the role of USP37 in stimulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in lung and breast cancer by stabilizing SNAI1 and stimulating the sonic hedgehog pathway, respectively. Several aspects of USP37 biology in cancer cells are yet unclear and are an active area of research. This review emphasizes the importance of USP37 in cancer and how identifying its molecular targets and signalling networks in various cancer types can help advance cancer therapeutics.

AB  - IntroductionCurrent risk predictors of multiple myeloma do not integrate ethnicity-specific information. However, the impact of ethnicity on disease biology cannot be overlooked. In this study, we have investigated the impact of ethnicity in multiple myeloma risk prediction. In addition, an efficient and robust artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled risk-stratification system is developed for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients that utilizes ethnicity-specific cutoffs of key prognostic parameters. MethodsK-adaptive partitioning is used to propose new cutoffs of parameters for two different datasets-the MMIn (MM Indian dataset) dataset and the MMRF (Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation) dataset belonging to two different ethnicities. The Consensus-based Risk-Stratification System (CRSS) is designed using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and agglomerative clustering. CRSS is validated via Cox hazard proportional methods, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and log-rank tests on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is utilized to establish the biological relevance of the risk prediction by CRSS. ResultsThere is a significant variation in the key prognostic parameters of the two datasets belonging to two different ethnicities. CRSS demonstrates superior performance as compared with the R-ISS in terms of C-index and hazard ratios on both the MMIn and MMRF datasets. An online calculator has been built that can predict the risk stage of a multiple myeloma (MM) patient based on the values of parameters and ethnicity. ConclusionOur methodology discovers changes in the cutoffs with ethnicities from the established cutoffs of prognostic features. The best predictor model for both cohorts was obtained with the new ethnicity-specific cutoffs of clinical parameters. Our study also revealed the efficacy of AI in building a deployable risk prediction system for MM. In the future, it is suggested to use the CRSS risk calculator on a large dataset as the cohort size of the present study is 25% of the cohort used in the R-ISS reported in 2015.

AB  - Rationale Mitochondrial dysfunctions have emerged as new biological hypothesis and therapeutic target for bipolar disorder. This network meta-analysis has been done to evaluate the comparative efficacy of mitochondrial agents in bipolar depression. Methods After a comprehensive literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane databases, and International Trials Registry Platform, efficacy data were extracted from 15 randomized controlled trials. Random-effects meta-analysis was done following both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to pool the effects across the interventions. A network graph was built, relative effects of interventions in respect to one another and placebo were calculated, and treatments were ranked as per P- and SUCRA scores. Change in depression rating score was the primary outcome. Data was entered in contrast level and arm level for frequentist and Bayesian approaches, respectively. Results Amongst mitochondrial agents, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was shown to have the highest probability of being the best treatment, followed by coenzyme Q10 and combination therapy of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) as depicted by P- and SUCRA scores. In the Bayesian approach, none of the treatments had better efficacy than placebo, but in the frequentist approach, NAC (effect estimate: - 1.18 (95% CI: - 2.05; - 0.31)) was significantly better than placebo. Conclusion Methodically, there may be a difference of magnitude in frequentist and Bayesian approaches, but the direction of effect and ranking probabilities do not differ. We conclude that none of the existing mitochondrial agents showed better efficacy than placebo in bipolar depression regarding depression rating scores.

AB  - Aims: The approach to potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. There is a benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), but the ideal regimen is unknown. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dose-dense NAG in potentially resectable NSCLC in this phase II trial.
   Materials and methods: Paclitaxel at 80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8 and 15 with AUC-6 carboplatin on day 1, 3 weekly for four cycles was evaluated as NACT. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, stage BB and IIIA (with only non-bulky N2 nodes) were included. The primary end point was the objective response rate. Secondary end points included toxicity, progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, complete resection rate and overall survival. The relative dose intensity (RDI) was calculated to define tolerability (CTRI/2016/05/006916).
   Results: In total, 37 patients were enrolled (median age 55 years). Most (78.8%) were smokers. Most patients had adenocarcinoma (57.6%) and stage IIIA disease (81.0%) according to the seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Seventy-eight per cent of patients completed four cycles. The objective response rate was 75.6% with a complete response in 10.8%. The mean RDI of paclitaxel was 88.61%, with 68.0% of patients able to maintain an RDI >= 85.0%. In total, 187 toxicity events were recorded (120 grade 1, 64 grade 2 and three grade 3 events). Common toxicities were peripheral neuropathy (20.3%), myalgia (19.8%), nausea (15.7%) and neutropenia (10.2%). There were no treatment-related deaths. Seventeen patients underwent surgery (lobectomy 82.4%). After a median follow-up of 47 months (95% confidence interval 27-50.7 months), the median progression-free survival was 9.6 months (7.4-17.4) and overall survival was 29.2 months (16.0-37.2).
   Conclusion: Dose-dense paclitaxel-carboplatin is feasible, safe and efficacious and should be evaluated further in potentially resectable NSCLC. (C) 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe cardiopulmonary disease characterized by complement dependent, fibroblast-induced perivascular accumulation and proinflammatory activation of macrophages. We hypothesized that, in PH, nanoscale-sized small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), released by perivascular/adventitial fibroblasts, are critical mediators of complement-dependent proinflammatory activation of macrophages. Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and age-matched controls (CO-Fibs). PH-Fibs exhibited increased secretion of sEVs, compared with CO-Fibs, and sEV biological activity was tested on mouse and bovine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and showed similar responses. Compared with sEVs derived from CO-Fibs, sEVs derived from PH-Fibs (PH-Fib-sEVs) induced augmented expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and metabolic genes in BMDMs. Pharmacological blockade of exosome release from PH-Fibs resulted in significant attenuation of proinflammatory activation of BMDMs. "Bottom-up" proteomic analyses revealed significant enrichment of complement and coagulation cascades in PH-Fib-sEVs, including augmented expression of the complement component C3. We therefore examined whether the PH-Fib-sEV- mediated proinflammatory activation of BMDMs was complement C3 dependent. Treatment of PH-Fibs with siC3-RNA significantly attenuated the capacity of PH-Fib-sEVs for proinflammatory activation of BMDMs. PH-Fib-sEVs mediated proglycolytic alterations and complement-dependent activation of macrophages toward a proinflammatory phenotype, as confirmed by metabolomic studies. Thus, fibroblast-released sEVs served as critical mediators of complement-induced perivascular/microenvironmental inflammation in PH.

AB  - Background: There is an increasing need for Mental Health Promotion (MHP) among adolescents, especially in developing countries with limited resources and rapid socio-demographic transition. With the growing burden of mental health problems among adolescents (suicide, depression) and their preferences to seek help from their peers, improving Mental Health Literacy (MHL) and behaviours for First Aid in Mental Health (MH-FA) becomes crucial to promote their mental health.
   Methods: Schools are ideal settings for reaching the vulnerable adolescents. The proposed study evaluates the effectiveness of a classroom-based teacher-led integrated school mental health intervention called SUMS (MHP + MHL + MH-FA). The study will involve a pragmatic, cluster-randomised waitlist-controlled design to evaluate the effectiveness of SUMS intervention using schools as unit-of-randomisation. The study will be conducted in Srinivaspura taluka (Sub-district) of Kolar district (administrative unit of health) of Karnataka in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary expert team from NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences), Bangalore-India and Department of Education, Government of Karnataka, India. A total of 8 schools (400 students studying in 6-8 grade) from Srinivaspura taluka will be randomised into intervention and waitlist control group. The intervention group will receive SUMS intervention through 10-15 h of classroom sessions. The primary outcome is the improvement in positive mental health literacy, as measured by the Mental Health-Promoting Knowledge (MHPK-10) scale. Changes in MH-FA knowledge and intentions, Mental health stigma, help-seeking and resilience are assessed as secondary outcomes. Data will be collected at baseline, 6-weeks, 6-months and 12-months post-intervention. The waitlist-control schools will receive the interventions at the end of the 12-month follow-up assessment in intervention-schools.
   Discussion: This is the first study to integrate Mental Health Literacy with Mental Health Promotion and behaviours for First Aid in Mental Health to promote mental health well-being among adolescent school children in India. With a need to build a more substantial evidence base on School Mental Health Promotion approaches in developing countries, the study findings will have implications for implementing and operationalising Health and Wellness Ambassador initiative in India.

AB  - By analysis of lncRNA expression profiles of macrophages in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, we identified novel highly expressed transcripts, unique in encompassing a protein coding transcript- Cytidine Monophosphate Kinase 2 (CMPK2) and a previously identified lncRNA- Negative Regulator of Interferon Response (NRIR). While these transcripts (TILT1, 2,3 - TLR4 and Infection induced Long Transcript) are induced by virulent Mtb as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) early, lack of/delayed expression in non-viable Mtb/BCG infected cells, respectively, suggest an important role in macrophage responses. The elevated expression by 3 hr in response to fast growing bacteria further emphasizes the importance of these RNAs in the macrophage infection response. Overall, we provide evidence for the presence of multiple transcripts that form a part of the early infection response programme of macrophages.

AB  - Background: Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) represent a promising cell source for cell-based therapy in autoimmune diseases and other degenerative disorders due to their immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory and regenerative potentials. Belonging to a glucocorticoid family, Dexamethasone (Dex) is a powerful anti-inflammatory compound that is widely used as therapy in autoimmune disease conditions or allogeneic transplantation. However, minimal immunomodulatory effect of hMSCs may limit their therapeutic uses. Moreover, the effect of glucocorticoids on the immunomodulatory molecules or other regenerative properties of tissue-specific hMSCs remains unknown.
   Method: Herein, we evaluated the in vitro effect of Dex at various dose concentrations and time intervals, 1000 ng/ ml, 2000 ng/ml, 3000 ng/ml and 24 h, 48 h respectively, on the basic characteristics and immunomodulatory properties of Bone marrow derived MSC (BM-MSCs), Adipose tissue derived MSCs (AD-MSCs), Dental Pulp derived MSC (DP-MSCs) and Umbilical cord derived MSCs (UC-MSCs).
   Results: The present study indicated that the concentration of Dex did not ramify the cellular morphology nor showed cytotoxicity as well as conserved the basic characteristics of tissue specific hMSCs including cell proliferation and surface marker profiling. However, quite interestingly it was observed that the stemness markers (Oct-4, Sox-2, Nanog and Klf-4) showed a significant upregulation in DP-MSCs and AD-MSCs followed by UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs. Additionally, immunomodulatory molecules, Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2), Indoleamine- 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G) were seen to be upregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, there was a differential response of tissue specific hMSCs after pre-conditioning with Dex during mixed lymphocyte reaction, wherein UC-MSCs and DP-MSCs showed enhanced immunosuppression as compared to AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs, thereby proving to be a better candidate for therapeutic applications in immune-related diseases.
   Conclusion: Dex preconditioning improved the hMSCs immunomodulatory property and may have reduced the challenge associated with minimal potency and strengthen their therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Since the emergence of the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the viral genome has constantly undergone rapid mutations for better adaptation in the host system. These newer mutations have given rise to several lineages/ variants of the virus that have resulted in high transmission and virulence rates compared to the previously circulating variants. Owing to this, the overall caseload and related mortality have tremendously increased globally to > 233 million infections and > 4.7 million deaths as of Sept. 28th, 2021. SARS-CoV-2, Spike (S) protein binds to host cells by recognizing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The viral S protein contains S1 and S2 domains that constitute the binding and fusion machinery, respectively. Structural analysis of viral S protein reveals that the virus undergoes conformational flexibility and dynamicity to interact with the hACE2 receptor. The SARS-CoV-2 variants and mutations might be associated with affecting the conformational plasticity of S protein, potentially linked to its altered affinity, infectivity, and immunogenicity. This review focuses on the current circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the structure-function analysis of key S protein mutations linked with increased affinity, higher infectivity, enhanced transmission rates, and immune escape against this infection.

AB  - C-lobe represents the C-terminal half of lactoferrin which is a bilobal 80 kDa iron binding glycoprotein. The two lobes are designated as N-lobe (Ser1-Glu333) and C-lobe (Arg344-Arg689). The N- and C-lobes are connected by a 10-residue long alpha-helical peptide (Thr334-Thr343). Both lobes adopt similar conformations and have identical iron binding sites. The bilobal lactoferrin was hydrolyzed in a limited proteolysis using pepsin at pH 2.0. It produced a 40 kDa and fully functional C-lobe which was purified and crystallized at pH 8.0. The structure determination revealed that the structure contained residues from Tyr342 to Arg689 representing a fully functional monoferric C-lobe. It showed that pepsin cleaved lactoferrin at the peptide bond Arg341-Tyr342 which is part of the inter-lobe decapeptide. Interestingly, the two previously determined structures of the enzymatically produced C-lobe using trypsin and proteinase K also cleaved lactoferrin at the same peptide bond Arg341-Tyr342. This was a striking result as the three enzymes, pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K have different specificity requirements and yet they cleaved the bilobal lactoferrin at the same peptide bond and generated an identical and fully functional C-lobe. This shows that the observed cleavage site in lactoferrin adopts a highly favourable conformation for proteolysis. It is noteworthy that the three enzymes with different specificities cut the protein at the same peptide bond which may be of physiological significance because the antibacterial action of lactoferrin is extended further through the C-lobe.

AB  - With increasing demand for large numbers of testing during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, alternative protocols were developed with shortened turn-around time. We evaluated the performance of such a protocol wherein 1138 consecutive clinic attendees were enrolled; 584 and 554 respectively from two independent study sites in the cities of Pune and Kolkata. Paired nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested by using both reference and index methods in a blinded fashion. Prior to conducting real-time polymerase chain reaction, swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) were processed for RNA extraction (reference method) and swabs collected in a dry tube without VTM were incubated in Tris-EDTA-proteinase K buffer for 30 min and heat-inactivated at 98 degrees C for 6 min (index method). Overall sensitivity and specificity of the index method were 78.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71-86) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.6), respectively. Agreement between the index and reference method was 96.8% (k = 0.83, s.e. = 0.03). The reference method exhibited an enhanced detection of viral genes (E, N and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) with lower Ct values compared to the index method. The index method can be used for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 infection with an appropriately chosen primer-probe set and heat treatment approach in pressing time; low sensitivity constrains its potential wider use.

KW  - Bubbling
KW  - charring
KW  - compartmental resection
KW  - image guidance/neuronavigation
KW  - insular glioma
KW  - neuromonitoring
KW  - subcortical mapping
AB  - Background: Insular glioma was considered a nonsurgical entity due to resection-associated morbidities. The advancement in neurosurgical techniques and adjuncts used in the last two decades made the resection of insular gliomas simpler for neurosurgeons with the maximum extent of resection and acceptable morbidity rates. The complex anatomy of this region remains a challenge for neurosurgeons and requires expertise. The key factors to achieve complete resection in the insular region are the thorough knowledge of surgical anatomy and meticulous microsurgical techniques. Intraoperative adjuncts such as image guidance along with cortical and subcortical mapping assist in excellent outcomes.
   Objective: In this study, we describe the operative technique and application of trans-Sylvian approach to do the compartmental dissection done by the senior author, along with challenges faced, with the hope to highlight the efficacy of the approach to achieve maximal resection of this entity without compromising patient's safety.
   Materials and Methods: A 32-year-old right-handed gentleman presented with episodes of excessive salivation, tingling sensation on the right side of the body along with nausea that lasted for 15-20 s for the last 8 months and one episode of speech arrest without any loss of consciousness and motor or sensory deficit. CEMRI of the brain was suggestive of left insular glioma. The patient underwent left pterional craniotomy, and gross total resection of the tumor was done using compartmental dissection.
   Results: At follow-up after 1 month, the patient is seizure-free without any speech difficulty and motor or sensory deficit.
   Conclusion: Compartmental dissection of insular glioma is a safe and efficacious technique to achieve gross total resection of the tumor in this complex region without morbidity.

TI  - Vaccine efficacy against persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 infection at 10 years after one, two, and three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls in India: a multicentre, prospective, cohort study
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background A randomised trial designed to compare three and two doses of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in adolescent girls in India was converted to a cohort study after suspension of HPV vaccination in trials by the Indian Government. In this Article, the revised aim of the cohort study was to compare vaccine efficacy of single dose to that of three and two doses in protecting against persistent HPV 16 and 18 infection at 10 years post vaccination. Methods In the randomised trial, unmarried girls aged 10-18 years were recruited from nine centres across India and randomly assigned to either two doses or three doses of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil [Merck Sharp & Dohme, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA]; 0middot5 mL administered intramuscularly). After suspension of recruitment and vaccination, the study became a longitudinal, prospective cohort study by default, and participants were allocated to four cohorts on the basis of the number vaccine doses received per protocol: the two-dose cohort (received vaccine on days 1 and 180 or later), three-dose cohort (days 1, 60, and 180 or later), two-dose default cohort (days 1 and 60 or later), and the single-dose default cohort. Participants were followed up yearly. Cervical specimens were collected from participants 18 months after marriage or 6 months after first childbirth, whichever was earlier, to assess incident and persistent HPV infections. Married participants were screened for cervical cancer as they reached 25 years of age. Unvaccinated women age-matched to the married vaccinated participants were recruited to serve as controls. Vaccine efficacy against persistent HPV 16 and 18 infections (the primary endpoint) was analysed for single-dose recipients and compared with that in two-dose and three-dose recipients after adjusting for imbalance in the distribution of potential confounders between the unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN98283094, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00923702. Findings Vaccinated participants were recruited between Sept 1, 2009, and April 8, 2010 (date of vaccination suspension), and followed up over a median duration of 9middot0 years (IQR 8middot2-9middot6). 4348 participants had three doses, 4980 had two doses (0 and 6 months), and 4949 had a single dose. Vaccine efficacy against persistent HPV 16 and 18 infection among participants evaluable for the endpoint was 95middot4% (95% CI 85middot0-99middot9) in the single-dose default cohort (2135 women assessed), 93middot1% (77middot3-99middot8) in the two-dose cohort (1452 women assessed), and 93middot3% (77middot5-99middot7) in three-dose recipients (1460 women assessed). Interpretation A single dose of HPV vaccine provides similar protection against persistent infection from HPV 16 and 18, the genotypes responsible for nearly 70% of cervical cancers, to that provided by two or three doses.

AB  - Background: The clinical picture of COVID-19 is as complex as it is psychosocial impact. The sheer subjectivity of the illness experience demands that each individual affected be heard and noticed.
   Aims: To assess lived-in experiences and coping strategies of COVID-19 positive individuals.
   Settings and Design: The study was conducted at designated COVID care center of a tertiary care hospital using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Materials and Methods: Interviews were collected from 13 COVID-19-positive individuals using an open-ended interview guide and were recorded, transcribed and further analyzed.
   Statistical Analysis: Analysis was done using Smith's Interpretative Phenomenological Approach. Themes and sub-themes were extracted and thematic schema was developed.
   Results: A total of 10 themes and 36 sub-themes were identified. The themes extracted with context to before being diagnosed with COVID-19 positive are impact of COVID-19 and preconception about hospitalization and hospitalized individuals. The themes with relation to active COVID-19 infection are psychological reactions, behavioral responses, positive experiences, negative experiences, stigma, coping strategies, and perceived needs. The theme re-adjustment with life was identified for postrecovery from COVID-19.
   Conclusions: COVID-19-positive individuals have myriad of experiences from their transition of being positive to finally being free of infection. Their experience with the illness sheds light on the gray areas like stigma that demand immediate attention. Future policies need to be developed in accordance with the identified perceived needs to potentially guide the satisfaction and recovery of COVID-19-positive individuals.

AB  - The parasite Entamoeba histolytica is the etiological agent of amoebiasis, a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to parasitic diseases in developing countries. Phagocytosis is an essential mode of obtaining nutrition and has been associated with the virulence behaviour of E. histolytica. Signalling pathways involved in activation of cytoskeletal dynamics required for phagocytosis remains to be elucidated in this parasite. Our group has been studying initiation of phagocytosis and formation of phagosomes in E. histolytica and have described some of the molecules that play key roles in the process. Here we showed the involvement of non-Dbl Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor, EhGEF in regulation of amoebic phagocytosis by regulating activation of EhRho1. EhGEF was found in the phagocytic cups during the progression of cups, until closure of phagosomes, but not in the phagosomes themselves. Our observation from imaging, pull down experiments and down regulating expression of different molecules suggest that EhGEF interacts with EhRho1 and it is required during initiation of phagocytosis and phagosome formation. Also, biophysical, and computational analysis reveals that EhGEF mediates GTP exchange on EhRho1 via an unconventional pathway. In conclusion, we describe a non-Dbl EhGEF of EhRho1 which is involved in endocytic processes of E. histolytica.

AB  - Objective To evaluate factors associated with risk of hospitalization in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Multi-site hospital based study. Intervention A separate acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) treatment unit (ATU) was established. The revised WHO case definition for ARI was used across all the study sites to ensure uniformity in management of ARI patients (2-59 months). Clinical history, examination findings and investigations of enrolled patients were recorded on a predesigned case record form. Children were followed up at 1 week (+/- 1 day). Main outcome measure Risk factors for hospitalization among pneumonia patients. Results A total of 7026 children with the diagnosis of ARI were enrolled. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 938 (13.4%) patients (median (IQR) age: 15 (8, 25) months; 63.5% boys). Hospitalization was needed in 56.8% of pneumonia patients. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with risk of hospitalization were: Oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) <92% in room air (OR 7.04; 95% CI 1.6, 30.8, >0.5 ng/mL (OR: 7.5, 95% CI: 1.0, 57.7, P=0.05), and lower weight for height z-score (OR 0.8; 95 % CI: 0.6, 0.9, P=0.02). Conclusion Present study found SpO(2) <92% at room air, serum procalcitonin level >0.5 ng/mL and lower weight for height z-score to be predictors for risk of hospitalization in under-five children presenting with community acquired pneumonia. These factors can be utilized to assess a child with CAP regarding the need of hospitalization.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its risk factors among diabetic patients in rural and urban West Bengal (WB). Methods: Patients were screened in the physician's clinic by a team of ophthalmologist, optometrist and counsellor. Demographic details, diabetic control, compliance to eye checkup, awareness regarding diabetic blindness, and visual acuity were recorded using a questionnaire. DR was graded both by indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus photo taken with a portable fundus camera. Results: A total of 1553 subjects were screened over 39 camps across 14 districts of WB over 17 months. The prevalence of DR was 21.51%, with a significant difference between rural (26.55%) and urban (13.89%) areas (P < 0.01). No significant difference with gender was seen (P = 0.99). Presence and grade of DR were related to age, loss of vision, diabetic age, diabetic control, awareness of diabetic blindness and last eye checkup. Conclusion: This study provides the first major prevalence data from WB, and gives valuable insight regarding modifiable risk factors for DR. It is also the first DR study in India to be conducted in the physician's clinic. The study results emphasise the need to "fix the missing link" between ophthalmologists and treating physicians to win the battle against DR.

Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis or early onset oste-oporosis isa rare cause of primary osteoporosis in childhood associated with mutations in "bone fragility" genes. Case presentation: The index case presented with upper back pain and was detected to have multiple vertebral fractures. Further workup for the cause revealed a homo-zygous benign mutation in low-density lipoprotein recep-tor-related protein 5, which was also detected in the mother who remained asymptomatic till presentation. The child was successfully treated with intravenous zoledronate. Conclusions: The case report describes the management approach and four-year follow-up of the child.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of three general prognostic models (APACHE II, SAPS II, and SOFA) with serum galactomannan antigen in a clinically suspected invasive aspergillosis (IA) subpopulation admitted to a respiratory medicine ICU and to identify azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (ARAF) cases. Methodology and Results: A total of 235 clinically suspected IA patients were prospectively enrolled and observed 30-day mortality was 29.7%. The three general models showed poor discrimination assessed by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs, < 0.7) and good calibration (p = 0.92, 0.14, and 0.13 for APACHE II, SAPS II, and SOFA, respectively), evaluated using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests. However, discrimination was significantly better with galactomannan values (AUC, 0.924). In-vitro antifungal testing revealed higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 12/34 isolates (35.3%) whereas azole resistance was noted in 40% of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates (6/15) with two hotspot cyp51A mutations, G54R and P216L. Conclusions: Patients diagnosed with putative and probable IA (71.4% and 34.6%, respectively), had high mortality. The general prognostic model APACHE II seemed fairly accurate for this subpopulation. However, the use of local GM cut-offs calculated for mortality, may help the intensivists in prompt initiation or change of therapy for better outcome of patients. In addition, the high MICs highlight the need of antifungal surveillance to know the local resistance rate which might aid in patient treatment.

AB  - Background Current WHO algorithm has retained the signs and symptoms used in the older version for classifying severity of childhood pneumonia. Objective To study the role of clinical features (including that of current WHO criteria), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia. Study design Multicenter prospective cohort study. Participants Children, 2 to 59 months of age, suffering from acute respiratory infection (ARI). Outcome measures Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated for clinical features, and SpO2. Results Of a total 7026 children with ARI enrolled, 13.4% had pneumonia (37% of them had severe pneumonia), according to WHO criteria. Based on any abnormality on chest x ray (CXR), 46% had pneumonia. The sensitivity and specificity of the existing WHO criteria for diagnosis of pneumonia was 56.5% and 66.2%, respectively, when compared against abnormalities in CXR. Cough and fever, each had sensitivity of >80%. Audible wheeze and breathing difficulty, each had a specificity of >80%. Sensitivity and specificity of tachypnoea were 58.7% and 63.3%, respectively. None of the clinical features alone had a sensitivity and specificity of >80%. Addition of SpO2 of Conclusions Current WHO criteria based on rapid respiratory rate and/or chest indrawing has modest sensitivity and specificity, considering CXR abnormalities as gold standard for diagnosis of pneumonia. Addition of SpO2 of <92% to chest indrawing alone or WHO criteria increases the probability of pneumonia diagnosis, and is important in the management of a child with pneumonia.

AB  - Background: Post-infective hydrocephalus (PIH) arises as a complication of any CNS infection, and can be either communicating or noncommunicating.
   Objective: The aim of this article is to study the various causes of PIH and its pathophysiology and treatment.
   Material and Methods: The literature was searched for articles describing the causes of PIH.
   Results: Common causes of PIH are CNS tuberculosis (TB), neurocysticercosis, and perinatal or neonatal infection. TBM is most likely to result in hydrocephalus out of all these manifestations of CNS TB, and hydrocephalus is more likely to occur early in the course, typically 4-6 weeks after the onset of TBM, and is more common among children as compared to adults. A trial of medical management (antitubercular therapy, steroids, and decongestants) can be given to patients with communicating hydrocephalus. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is the most employed method of CSF diversion in these patients. Though traditionally considered contraindicated, many recent studies have found ETV to be a reasonable option in patients with PIH. HCP in patients with neurocysticercosis can be associated with intraventricular cysts and racemose cysts in the basal subarachnoid cisterns. Surgical intervention is required either for cyst removal or CSF diversion. Endoscopic approaches can be used to remove the intraventricular cysts, which takes care of the HCP. PIH in infants can result either from antenatal infections (TORCH infections) or postnatal infections such as meningitis.
   Conclusions: Management of PIH can be challenging. Management has to be individualized.

AB  - Ever since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, mucocutaneous manifestations started being noticed and are still being documented. Many of these have been described with the prefix "COVID" and may occur due to the infection (e.g., COVID rash), use of personal protective equipment in healthcare workers (e.g., COVID hand dermatitis) or extensive use of novel vaccines (e.g., COVID arm). This article attempts to summarize such entities with clinical relevance to dermatologists and physicians in general and to create awareness about this fast-evolving COVID lexicon.

AB  - Objective: To identify the risk factors for pneumonia and severe pneumonia in children.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Five tertiary-care teaching hospitals in India.
   Participants: Children 2 to 59 months of age suffering from acute respiratory infection (ARI).
   Main outcome measures: Risk factors for the development of WHO defined pneumonia and severe pneumonia.
   Result: A total of 18159 children screened, and 7026 (39%) children with ARI were enrolled. According to the WHO criteria, 938 (13.4%) and 6088 (86.6%) of the enrolled children had pneumonia and no pneumonia, respectively. Out of 938 children with pneumonia, 347 (36.9%) had severe pneumonia. On univariate analysis, younger age, male gender and low weight for height, were significant risk factors for pneumonia. On multivariate analysis, one-unit increase in age in months (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.97-0.98) and weight for height z-score (OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.72-0.79) had a protective effect.
   Conclusions: Young age and undernutrition (low weight for height/length) in children are significant independent risk factors for pneumonia.

AB  - Non-Invasive respiratory support can be viewed as mechanical respiratory support without endotracheal intubation and it includes continuous positive airway pressure, bi-level positive airway pressure, high flow nasal cannula, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Over past few years, non-invasive respiratory support is getting more popular across pediatric intensive care units for acute respiratory failure as well as for long-term ventilation support at home. It reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, decreases the risk of nosocomial pneumonia as well as mortality in selected pediatric and adult population. Unfortunately, majority of available studies on non-invasive respiratory support have been conducted in high-income countries, which are different from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) in terms of resources, manpower, and the disease profile. Hence, we need to consider disease profile, severity at hospital presentation, availability of age-appropriate equipment, ability of healthcare professionals to manage patients on non-invasive respiratory support, and cost-benefit ratio. In view of the relatively high cost of equipment, there is a need to innovate to develop indigenous kits/devices with available resources in LMICs to reduce the cost and potentially benefit health system. In this review, we highlight the role of non-invasive respiratory support in different clinical conditions, practical problems encountered in LMICs setting, and few indigenous techniques to provide non-invasive respiratory support.

AB  - The management of malignant glaucoma involves either anterior vitrectomy with zonulectomy and iridectomy or 3-port core pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) by retinal surgeons. The proposed modification can be performed with reasonable success rates. In this technique, synechiolysis and anterior chamber irrigation were performed through a limbal incision, and a single-port 23- or 25-gauge vitrector was introduced through PPV superotemporally to perform anterior vitrectomy and central posterior capsulotomy in pseudophakic eyes. The same procedure can be performed after cataract surgery in phakic eyes. Vitrectomy is continued until anterior chamber deepens, ensuring a conduit between anterior and posterior chambers through the posterior capsulotomy alone, bypassing the need for a posterior iridectomy/zonulectomy. In a series on 9 eyes, all achieved optimization of anterior chamber depth with intraocular pressure normalization in 8 of 9 eyes, without showing any signs of recurrence at a mean follow-up of 8.6 months.

AB  - Objectives There are no head-to-head trials of different dose escalation strategies of methotrexate (MTX) in RA. We compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 'usual' (5 mg every 4 weeks) versus 'fast' (5 mg every 2 weeks) escalation of oral MTX. Methods This multicentre, open-label (assessor blinded) RCT included patients 18-55 years of age having active RA with disease duration <5 years, and not on DMARDs. Patients were randomized 1:1 into usual or fast escalation groups, both groups starting MTX at 15 mg/week till a maximum of 25 mg/week. Primary outcome was EULAR good response at 16 weeks, secondary outcomes were Delta DAS28 and adverse effects (AE). Analyses were intention-to-treat. Results 178 patients with mean DAS28-CRP of 5.4(1.1) were randomized to usual (n=89) or fast escalation groups (n=89). At 16 weeks, there was no difference in good EULAR response in the usual (28.1%) or fast escalation (22.5%) groups (p=0.8). There was no difference in mean Delta DAS28-CRP at 8 weeks (-0.9, -0.8, p=0.72) or 16 weeks (-1.3, -1.3, p=0.98). Even at 24 weeks (extended follow-up), responses were similar. There were no inter-group differences in Delta HAQ, or MTX-polyglutamates 1-3 levels at 8 or 16 weeks. Gastrointestinal AE were higher in the fast escalation group over initial 8 weeks (27%, 40%, p=0.048), but not over 16 weeks. There was no difference in cytopenias, transaminitis, or drug discontinuation/dose reduction between the groups. No serious AE were seen. Conclusion A faster MTX escalation strategy in RA was not more efficacious over 16-24 weeks, and did not significantly increase AE, except higher gastrointestinal AE initially.

An ageing population, advances in prevention and management, as well as increasing impact of non-communicable diseases have led to the need for a novel definition of health. We suggest health to be "a sustainable state of optimized physical, social and mental well-being, and not merely the absence of acute disease or infirmity".

AB  - Background: The use of programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt (P-VPS) in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) has increased over the last two decades, however, there is no definitive evidence to favor them over non-programmable VPS (NP-VPS). Thus, there is a growing need for studies comparing these two procedures for their efficacy and safety profile in iNPH.
   Objective: In this study, we attempt to quantitatively summarize the findings of all the prospective and retrospective studies that have directly compared the P-VPS and NP-VPS in terms of efficacy, complications, or overall healthcare expenditure.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed of PubMed, the Cochrane Library databases, and Google Scholar for studies till June 2021 comparing the outcomes of P-VPS with NP-VPS. Four studies were finally included in the quantitative analysis. A trial sequential analysis was done to evaluate the need for further studies.
   Results: The total rates of subdural collection (odds ratio (OR) 1.03; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.46; P = 0.85; I-2 = 12%) as well as surgically evacuated subdural collection (OR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.14-1.55; P = 0.21; I-2 = 75%) were not significantly different for P-VPS compared to NP-VPS with pooled data. Similarly, the rate of postoperative infection was found to be similar between the two types of VPS (OR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.39-2.5; P = 0.97; I-2 = 0%). The trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the need of surgical evacuation of subdural collection and shunt revision revealed that the meta-analysis of the currently accrued information is not conclusive.
   Conclusions: Though, associated with higher initial costs, P-VPS does not seem to result in increased healthcare costs in the long run while enabling the surgeon to titrate the opening pressure and avoiding additional surgical procedures like shunt revision or evacuation of subdural collection at least theoretically. However, further trials with a greater sample size are needed to confirm these findings as the current accrued information size is insufficient to reach an unequivocal verdict.

AB  - Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) plays a crucial, conserved role in development, growth, reproduction, stress tolerance, and longevity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the enhanced longevity under reduced insulin signaling (rIIS) is primarily regulated by the transcription factors (TFs) DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1/Nrf-1, and HSF1/HSF-1. The specific and coordinated regulation of gene expression by these TFs under rIIS has not been comprehensively elucidated. Here, using RNA-sequencing analysis, we report a systematic study of the complexity of TF-dependent target gene interactions during rIIS under analogous genetic and experimental conditions. We found that DAF-16 regulates only a fraction of the C. elegans transcriptome but controls a large set of genes under rIIS; SKN-1 and HSF-1 show the opposite trend. Both of the latter TFs function as activators and repressors to a similar extent, while DAF-16 is predominantly an activator. For expression of the genes commonly regulated by TFs under rIIS conditions, DAF-16 is the principal determining factor, dominating over the other two TFs, irrespective of whether they activate or repress these genes. The functional annotations and regulatory networks presented in this study provide novel insights into the complexity of the gene regulatory networks downstream of the IIS pathway that controls diverse phenotypes, including longevity.

AB  - Stem cells are precursor cells present in many tissues with ability to differentiate into various types of cells. This interesting property of plasticity can have therapeutic implications and there has been substantial research in this field in last few decades. As a result, stem cell therapy is now used as a therapeutic modality in many conditions, and has made its way in dermatology too. Stem cells can be classified on the basis of their source and differentiating capacity. In skin, they are present in the inter-follicular epidermis, hair follicle, dermis and adipose tissue, which help in maintaining normal skin homeostasis and repair and regeneration during injury. In view of their unique properties, they have been employed in treatment of several dermatoses including systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleromyxedema, alopecia, Merkel cell carcinoma, pemphigus vulgaris, psoriasis, wound healing, epidermolysis bullosa and even aesthetic medicine, with variable success. The advent of stem cell therapy has undoubtedly brought us closer to curative treatment of disorders previously considered untreatable. Nevertheless, there are multiple lacunae which need to be addressed including ideal patient selection, timing of intervention, appropriate conditioning regimens, post-intervention care and cost effectiveness. Further research in these aspects would help optimize the results of stem cell therapy.

AB  - Even after one and a half years since the outbreak of COVID-19, its complete and effective control is still far from being achieved despite vaccination drives, symptomatic management with available drugs, and wider lockdowns. This has inspired researchers to screen potential phytochemicals from medicinal plants against SARS-CoV-2, adopting a bio-informatics approach. The current study aimed to assess anti-viral activity of the phytochemicals derived from Ayurvedic medicinal plants against SARS-CoV-2 drug targets [3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)] using validated in silico methods.3D Structures of 196 phytochemicals from three Ayurvedic plants were retrieved from PubChem and KNApSAcK databases and screened for Absorption Distribution Metabolism Excretion and Toxicity(ADMET) to predict drug-likeness. The phytochemicals were subjected to molecular docking and only three showed promise: Acetovanillonewith a binding affinity of -4.7Kcal/mol with RdRp and -4.1 Kcal/mol with 3CL pro; myrtenol with equivalent values of -4.3 Kcal/mol with RdRP and -3.2 Kcal/mol with 3CLpro; and nimbochalcin with equivalent values of -5.0Kcal/mol with RdRp and -4.9 Kcal/mol with 3CLpro. Molecular dynamics simulation (50ns) analysis was made of 3CL(pro) and RdRp using Autodock Vina 1.1.2 software and VMD software. After ADMET analysis, 78 phytochemicals were found suitable for molecular docking. Three, namely acetovanillone, myrtenol and nimbochalcin from Picrorhiza kurroa, Azadirachta indica and Cyperus rotundus,respectively,exhibited good binding affinity with 3CL(pro)and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. Interaction analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA calculations were executed for two complexes, acetovanillone_RdRp and myrtenol_3CL pro.Acetovanillone_RdRpcomplex did not display any structural change after MD simulation as compared to myrtenol_3CL pro. The overall stability of acetovanillone_6NUR was 154.7 kJ/mol, and for myrtenol_1UJ1 90.5 kJ/mol.In silico analysis revealed that acetovanillone (Picrorhiza kurroa) and myrtenol (Cyperus rotundus) possess anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Further studies are needed to validate their efficacy in biological models.

AB  - Methylation of adenosines at N6 position (m6A) is the most frequent internal modification in mRNAs of the human genome and attributable to diverse roles in physiological development, and pathophysiological processes. However, studies on the role of m6A in neuronal development are sparse and not well-documented. The m6A detection remains challenging due to its inconsistent pattern and less sensitivity by the current detection techniques. Therefore, we applied a sliding window technique to identify the consensus site (5 & PRIME;-GGACT-3 & PRIME;) n & GE; 2 and annotated all m6A hotspots in the human genome. Over 6.78 x 10(7) hotspots were identified and 96.4% were found to be located in the non-coding regions, suggesting that methylation occurs before splicing. Several genes, RPS6K, NRP1, NRXN, EGFR, YTHDF2, have been involved in various stages of neuron development and their functioning. However, the contribution of m6A in these genes needs further validation in the experimental model. Thus, the present study elaborates the location of m6A in the human genome and its function in neuron physiology.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most incapacitating pathologies, leading to huge rehabilitation challenges besides a social-economic burden on SCI patients and their families. There is no complete curative treatment available so far. Non-invasive and patient-friendly use of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field stimulation (EMF) has emerged as a therapeutic and rehabilitation option. In this study, we tested whole-body EMF stimulation on thoracic complete SCI-induced nociception including sensorimotor deficits in rats. The EMF application significantly attenuated hyperalgesia and allodynia to thermal, electrical, and chemical stimuli from 6 weeks onwards as well as restoration of spinal reflexes, viz., H-reflex and nociceptive flexion reflex at the study endpoint (week 8). Besides, massively increased glutamate at the SCI injury site was observed in SCI rats with no treatment, which was also attenuated significantly by EMF stimulation. Spinal cord histology of the injury area showed a decrease in lesion volume and glial population in the EMF-stimulated rats. These findings indicate the beneficial role of EMF stimulation after thoracic complete SCI in adult male rats and, thereby, a beneficial patient-friendly rehabilitation tool.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate risk factors and outcomes of preferred practice for infants with aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP) at a tertiary eye center in India.
   Methods: This was an observational study of infants with APROP where patients were divided into three groups after 2 weeks of initial treatment depending on the treatment received: anti-VEGF only, laser only, and combination of anti-VEGF injection followed by laser within 2 weeks of anti-VEGF injection (combined group). All infants were evaluated for risk factors and followed up at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks to determine treatment outcomes in terms of regression, vascular re-growth, progression, and recurrence of the disease.
   Results: Sixty eyes of 31 infants were included in the study, with 26 eyes in the anti-VEGF only group, 19 eyes in the laser-only group, and 15 eyes in the combined group. Infants in the combined group presented late with lower birth weight (BW), smaller gestational age (GA), and a history of longer duration of ventilatory support. After 3 months of follow-up, regression occurred in 73.08% in the anti-VEGF only group, 89.5% in the laser-only group, and 86.66% in the combined group (P= .07). Zone of vascularization was greater in the anti-VEGF only group and the combined group compared to the laser-only group. Disease recurrence was seen in 27% in the anti-VEGF group, none in the laser-only group, and 13.33% in the combined group (P < .001). However, progression to stage 4 ROP requiring surgery was noted in 2 eyes in the laser-only group.
   Conclusions: Infants with APROP who have a lower GA or BW or require longer ventilatory support are possibly a subset best suited for planned combination therapy. A combination of anti-VEGF therapy followed by laser treatment within 2 weeks allows for early regression, a stable course, lower recurrence, and a larger area of retinal vascularization.

AB  - Purpose: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas with aggressive clinical behavior. We performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in PTCLs and corresponding normal CD4(+) Th1/2 and TFH-like polarized subsets to elucidate the role of miRNAs in T-cell lymphomagenesis.
   Experimental Design: We used nCounter (NanoString Inc) for miRNA profiling and validated using Taqman qRT-PCR (Applied Biosystems, Inc). Normal CD4(+) T cells were polarized into effector Th subsets using signature cytokines, and miRNA significance was revealed using functional experiments.
   Results: Effector Th subsets showed distinct miRNA expression with corresponding transcription factor expression (e.g., BCL6/miR-19b, -106, -30d, -26b, in IL21-polarized; GATA3/miR-155, miR-337 in Th2-polarized; and TBX21/miR-181a, -331-3p in Th1-polarized cells). Integration ofmiRNA signatures suggested activation of TCR and PI3K signaling in IL21-polarized cells, ERKsignaling in Th1-polarized cells, and AKT-mTOR signaling in Th2-polarized cells, validated at protein level. In neoplastic counterparts, distinctive miRNAs were identified and confirmed in an independent cohort. Integrative miRNA-mRNA analysis identified a decrease in target transcript abundance leading to deregulation of sphingolipid andWnt signaling and epigenetic dysregulation in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma(AITL), while ERK, MAPK, andcell cyclewere identified in PTCL subsets, and decreased target transcript abundance was validated in an independent cohort. Elevated expression of miRNAs (miR-126-3p, miR-145-5p) in AITL was associated with poor clinical outcome. In silico and experimental validation suggest two targets (miR-126 -> SIPR2 and miR-145 -> ROCK1) resulting in reduced RhoA-GTPase activity and T-B-cell interaction.
   Conclusions: Unique miRNAs and deregulated oncogenic path-ways are associated with PTCL subtypes. Upregulated miRNA-126-3p andmiR-145-5p expression regulate RhoA-GTPase and inhibit T-cell migration, crucial for AITL pathobiology.

AB  - Sildenafil is a widely used drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in a dosage ranging from 50 to 100 mg per day. Recreational use is reported among youth for its sexual function enhancing effects. To date, however, no study has reported the use of sildenafil for its nonsexual, psychoactive effects. We report a case of a 38-year-old male with opioid and sedative use disorder who self-administered sildenafil orally in a dose of up to 2000 mg per day for its psychoactive effects (primarily) for 10 years before seeking treatment and discuss the literature relevant to the case.

TI  - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as an endobronchial mass with lung involvement in an adolescent boy
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Primary endobronchial presentation of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is rare in the paediatric age group. We present a 12-year-old boy with breathlessness, fever, cough and weight loss, who was misdiagnosed as a case of tuberculosis and started on antitubercular therapy, which showed no improvement. Chest X-ray showed a completely opacified left hemithorax and chest computed tomography revealed a mass encircling the left main bronchus with collapse- consolidation of the left lung. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy revealed a growth in the left main bronchus. Subsequently, fine-needle aspiration cytology and biopsy from the mass confirmed it to be a malignancy consistent with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Metastatic work-up revealed no other sites of involvement. Chemotherapy resulted in rapid and complete regression of the tumour. No evidence of local or distant recurrence was reported after 18 months of followup. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware of this presentation as prompt diagnosis and treatment can give promising results. This case highlights the importance of timely tissue diagnosis in patients with non-resolving pyrexia and organ lesions on imaging.

TI  - Tectal Rosette-Forming Glioneuronal Tumor - A Case Report Focusing on a Possible Role for Radiotherapy in Inoperable Tumors
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
KW  - Radiotherapy
KW  - RGNT
KW  - tectum
AB  - Background: Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT) is a rare and distinctive glioneuronal tumor. Although surgical excision is considered the standard treatment for these slow growing WHO Grade I tumors, gross-total resection is achieved in less than 50% of RGNTs due to its localisation amidst vital structures. With very few cases with long term follow-up reported, there is limited knowledge of the natural clinical course and the role of radiotherapy in inoperable RGNTs.
   Case Description: A previously well 26-year old male, presented with long standing headache, increasing gait instability and fainting episodes. Imaging revealed a tectal plate mass with hydrocephalous. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy and biopsy was done, revealing RGNT. He received radiotherapy with a curative intent. The patient remained neurologically stable for 4 years. Follow-up imaging done after 4 years showed decrease in tumor size.
   Conclusions: The current case highlights a role for radiotherapy in RGNTs occurring in surgically challenging sites.

AB  - Introduction: Annually, hydrocephalus affects nearly 7 children per 10,000 live births around the world. It significantly impairs the quality of life of such children and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality The high cost of treatment and post-intervention complications add to the burden of disease. Deployment of machine learning (ML) models in actual clinical settings have led to improved outcomes.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to analyze the utility as well as acknowledge the achievements of AI/ML in HCP decision making.
   Methodology: PubMed and Cochrane databases were used to perform a systematic search with proper terminology to include all the relevant articles up to May 2021.
   Results: Fifteen studies that described the use of ML models in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication of pediatric hydrocephalus were identified. The median accuracy of prediction by the ML model in various tasks listed above was found to be 0.88. ML models were most commonly employed for ventricular segmentation for diagnosis of hydrocephalus. The most frequently used model was neural networks. ML models attained faster processing speeds than their manual and non-ML-based automated counterparts.
   Conclusion: This study attempts to evaluate the important advances and applications of ML in pediatric hydrocephalus. These methods may be better suited for clinical use than manual methods alone due to faster automated processing and near-human accuracy. Future studies should evaluate whether the use of these models is feasible in the future for patient care and management in field settings.

AB  - Mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene leads to the production of oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate and is associated with better prognosis in glioma. As Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is an important regulator of tumor progression, its role in glioma expressing IDH1 with an R132H mutation was investigated. Diminished nuclear levels of YAP1 in IDH1 mutant glioma tissues and cell lines were accompanied by decreased levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to investigate the functionality of the TEAD2-binding site on the TFAM promoter in mediating its YAP1-dependent expression. YAP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation and ROS generation were accompanied by decreased telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) levels and increased mitochondrial TERT localization in IDH1 R132H cells. Treatment with the Src kinase inhibitor bosutinib, which prevents extranuclear shuttling of TERT, further elevated ROS in IDH1 R132H cells and triggered apoptosis. Importantly, bosutinib treatment also increased ROS levels and induced apoptosis in IDH1 wild-type cells when YAP1 was concurrently depleted. These findings highlight the involvement of YAP1 in coupling mitochondrial dysfunction with mitochondrial shuttling of TERT to constitute an essential noncanonical function of YAP1 in the regulation of redox homeostasis.

AB  - Mycotic keratitis is common in warm, humid regions with a varying profile of pathogenic fungi according to geographical origin, socioeconomic status, and climatic condition. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging in difficult cases and those refractory to treatment. Fungal hyphae on microscopic examination and culture isolation have been the gold standard in the laboratory diagnosis of fungal keratitis. A culture isolate of the aetiological fungus is essential to perform antifungal susceptibility testing. As the culture isolation of fungi is time-consuming, causing delays in the initiation of treatment, newer investigative modalities such as in vivo confocal microscopy and molecular diagnostic methods have recently gained popularity. Molecular diagnostic techniques now help to obtain a rapid diagnosis of fungal keratitis. Genomic approaches are based on detecting amplicons of ribosomal RNA genes, with internal transcribed spacers being increasingly adopted. Metagenomic deep sequencing allows for rapid and accurate diagnosis without the need to wait for the fungus to grow. This is also helpful in identifying new emerging strains of fungi causing mycotic keratitis. A custom-tear proteomic approach will probably play an important diagnostic role in future in the management of mycotic keratitis. Positive repeat cultures are being suggested as an important gauge indicative of a poor prognosis. Positive repeat fungal cultures help to modify a treatment regimen by increasing its frequency, providing the addition of another topical and oral antifungal agent along with close follow-up for perforation and identifying need for early therapeutic keratoplasty. The role of collagen crosslinking in the treatment of fungal keratitis is not convincingly established. Rapid detection by multiplex PCR and antifungal susceptibility testing of the pathogenic fungi, adopted into a routine management protocol of fungal keratitis, will help to improve treatment outcome. Early therapy is essential in minimizing damage to the corneal tissue, thereby providing a better outcome. The role of conventional therapy with polyenes, systemic and targeted therapy of antifungal agents, newer azoles and echinocandins in fungal keratitis has been widely studied in recent times. Combination therapy can be more efficacious in comparison to monotherapy. Given the diversity of fungal aetiology, the emergence of new corneal pathogenic fungi with varying drug susceptibilities, increasing the drug resistance to antifungal agents in some genera and species, it is perhaps time to adopt recent molecular methods for precise identification and incorporate antifungal susceptibility testing as a routine.

AB  - Purpose: To study if an additional virtual interactive epilepsy education session improves post-test epilepsy knowledge scores more than providing digital educational material alone in persons with epilepsy (PWE) and caregivers. Methods: In a single centre, open labelled, randomised controlled trial, PWE and caregivers were randomised to receive digital epilepsy educational material alone or an additional virtual interactive epilepsy session along with the digital educational material. Pre-test knowledge scores were compared with post-test knowledge scores. A difference between the post-test scores in the two arms was the primary outcome. This was assessed one week after the epilepsy education had been received. Secondary outcomes were the difference between the two arms in quality of life and breakthrough seizure frequencies at the end of one month. Results: A total of 130 participants (PWE+caregivers) were randomised of which 66 were in the control arm and 64 in the intervention arm. Baseline demographic and epilepsy characteristics were comparable in both arms except for the higher age of PWE in the intervention arm. Post-test knowledge scores improved significantly from the pre-test knowledge scores in both control and intervention arms (p<0.001). Post-test knowledge scores in the intervention arm were significantly better both for patients (p = 0.003) as well as for caregivers (p = 0.007) compared to controls. There was no difference in the quality of life and frequency of breakthrough seizures between the two arms. Conclusion: Digital educational material is effective in improving post-test epilepsy knowledge scores in PWE and caregivers. Knowledge scores can be further improved by an additional virtual interactive session.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the utility of optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and comparison versus fluorescein angiography (FA) in vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR). Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, 60 eyes with no DR (NDR), 60 eyes with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 60 eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) underwent OCT-A. FA was done in VTDR. OCT-A of the NDR eyes was analyzed by two independent retina specialists. Vessel density (VD) (mm/mm(2)), perfusion density (PD) (%), and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) (mm(2)) area was analyzed among the groups. Montage angiography with vitreoretinal interface (VRI) segmentation was done in PDR. A qualitative comparison was done between OCT-A and FA for features of DR. Results: OCT-A detected 16.66% of the eyes with microaneurysm and 57.5% of the patients with capillary non-perfusion (CNP) areas in the NDR group. The inter-grader coefficient between the two observers was 0.820 for microaneurysm and 0.880 for CNP. The mean VD in NDR, NPDR, and PDR was 16.865, 13.983, and 11.643 mm/mm(2). The mean PD in NDR, NPDR, and PDR was 30.595, 26.853, and 23.193%. The VD and PD values were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The mean FAZ area was not statistically significant (NPDR and PDR) (P > 0.05). The VRI showed elevated neovascularization in four eyes. OCT-A delineated microaneurysm and FAZ in 97/97 eyes who underwent FA. The FA failed to delineate FAZ in 2/37 NPDR eyes and 13/60 PDR eyes. The CNP areas (OCT-A) were detectable in all eyes. The FA demonstrated CNP areas in 17/37 and 36/60 eyes in NPDR and PDR, respectively. The FA could show peripheral CNP. Conclusion: The OCT-A helps in the early diagnosis of DR by providing vascular indices which are consistent with disease progression. OCT-A is non-invasive and ideal for follow-up. FA is a dynamic test with a larger field of view.

AB  - Objective To evaluate whether 1% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) when compared with 2% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate is non-inferior for neonatal skin antisepsis.
   Design Parallel, blinded, non-inferiority randomised trial.
   Setting Level III, academic, neonatal intensive care unit.
   Patients Infants born at 26(0/7) to 42(6/7) weeks of gestation from June 2019 to December 2019.
   Interventions Participants were randomised to skin antisepsis by either 1% aqueous CHG or 2% aqueous CHG.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the proportion of negative skin swab cultures after skin antisepsis. Secondary outcomes were local skin reactions at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours and plasma chlorhexidine levels in a subset of the study population.
   Results A total of 308 neonates with a median gestation age of 34 (31-37) weeks and mean birth weight of 2029 g were randomised on 685 occasions (1% CHG: n=341; 2% CHG: n=344). 93.0% of the post-antisepsis skin swabs were sterile in 1% CHG group compared with 95.6% of the swabs in the 2% CHG group (risk difference -2.7%, 95% CI -6.2% to +0.8%). The lower bound of 95% CI crossed the pre-specified absolute non-inferiority limit of 5%. Neonates developed mild dermatitis on 16 (2.3%) occasions. There was no significant difference in median plasma CHG levels in the two groups, 19.6 (12.5-36.4) and 12.6 (8.7-26.6) ng/mL, respectively.
   Conclusions Application of 1% aqueous CHG was not shown to be non-inferior to 2% chlorhexidine aqueous for skin antisepsis in neonates. There were no severe skin-related adverse events in either of the two groups.

Epidermal growth factor receptor mutational status was negative in immunohistochemistry analysis, as well as in repeat liquid biopsy. When she developed progression on conventional chemotherapy, a trial of T. Erlotinib was given (since patient was a nonsmoker woman). Within a month, patient reported significant improvement in the dyspnea and did not require nebulization. F-18-FDG PET/CTwas repeated after similar to 6 months, which showed significant response to the oral erlotinib monotherapy. Patientwas doingwell at 1-year follow-up, with only dermatological adverse effects (rashes).

AB  - The role of inflammation in diabetic retinopathy (DR) is well-established and dysregulation of a large number of inflammatory mediators is known. These include cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, mediators of proteogenesis, and pro-apoptotic molecules. This para-inflammation as a response is not directed to a particular pathogen or antigen but is rather directed toward the by-products of the diabetic milieu. The inflammatory mediators take part in cascades that result in cellular level responses like neurodegeneration, pericyte loss, leakage, capillary drop out, neovascularization, etc. There are multiple overlaps between the inflammatory pathways occurring within the diabetic retina due to a large number of mediators, their varied sources, and cross-interactions. This makes understanding the role of inflammation in clinical manifestations of DR difficult. Currently, mediator-based therapy for DR is being evaluated for interventions that target a specific step of the inflammatory cascade. We reviewed the role of inflammation in DR and derived a simplified clinicopathological correlation between the sources and stimuli of inflammation, the inflammatory mediators and pathways, and the clinical manifestations of DR. By doing so, we deliberate mediator-specific therapy for DR. The cross-interactions between inflammatory mediators and the molecular cycles influencing the inflammatory cascades are crucial challenges to such an approach. Future research should be directed to assess the feasibility of the pathology-based therapy for DR.

AB  - The mechanical properties of soft tissues play a key role in studying human injuries and their mitigation strategies. While such properties are indispensable for computational modelling of biological systems, they serve as important references in loading and failure experiments, and also for the development of tissue simulants. To date, experimental studies have measured the mechanical properties of peripheral tissues (e.g. skin) in-vivo and limited internal tissues ex-vivo in cadavers (e.g. brain and the heart). The lack of knowledge on a majority of human tissues inhibit their study for applications ranging from surgical planning, ballistic testing, implantable medical device development, and the assessment of traumatic injuries. The purpose of this work is to overcome such challenges through an extensive review of the literature reporting the mechanical properties of whole-body soft tissues from head to toe. Specifically, the available linear mechanical properties of all human tissues were compiled. Non-linear biomechanical models were also introduced, and the soft human tissues characterized using such models were summarized. The literature gaps identified from this work will help future biomechanical studies on soft human tissue characterization and the development of accurate medical models for the study and mitigation of injuries.

AB  - Background: Pre-stroke anti-platelet (PAP) therapy can potentially influence the severity and outcome after ischemic stroke.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the prospective multicenter IndouUS collaborative stroke project for the impact of PAP therapy. Outcome measures included the admission National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, 3-month modified Rankin scale (mRS) score, and rates of in-hospital mortality and post-ischemic intracerebral hemorrhage.
   Results: Among 2048 of 2066 patients (M:F = 2:1) with known pre-stroke medication status, 336 (16.3%) were on PAP therapy. As compared to the non-PAP group, the PAP group had significantly higher mean age (62.2 vs 57.4 years, P < 0.001) and significantly more men, vascular risk factors, cerebral microbleeds (12.8% vs 6.2%, P = 0.001) and intravenous thrombolysis treatment (17% vs. 10.6%, P = 0.001). Cardioembolic strokes were significantly more in the PAP group (P < 0.001), but not large artery atherosclerosis. No significant differences were observed in the median NIHSS score (9 vs. 10, P = 0.274), 3-month mRS (score 0-2,51.4% vs. 49.0%, P = 0.428), in-hospital mortality (8.6% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.592), or symptomatic post ischemic intracerebral haemorrhage (12.2% vs. 10.6%, P = 0.382). The PAP group had more stroke recurrence (6.6% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.002) which was not significant (P = 0.065) after multivariate regression analysis adjusting for age, sex and vascular risk factors. PAP therapy was not an independent predictor of initial stroke severity or stroke outcome.
   Conclusion: PAP therapy has no significant effect on initial stroke severity, rates of post-ischemic hemorrhage with or without thrombolysis, in-hospital mortality, stroke recurrence, and 3-month outcome after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Background: Shunt infection is the most significant morbidity associated with shunt surgery. Based on the existing literature for the prevention and management of shunt infection, region and resource-specific recommendations are needed.
   Methods: In February 2020, a Guidelines Development Group (GDG) was created by the Indian Society of Paediatric Neurosurgery (IndSPN) to formulate guidelines on shunt infections, which would be relevant to our country and LMIC in general. An initial email survey identified existing practices among the membership of the IndSPN, and eight broad issues pertaining to shunt infection were identified. Next, members of the GDG performed a systematic review of the literature on the prevention and management of shunt infection. Then, through a series of virtual meetings of the GDG over 1 year, evidence from the literature was presented to all the members and consensus was built on different aspects of shunt infection. Finally, the guidelines document was drafted and circulated among the GDG for final approval. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the evidence and strength of recommendation.
   Results: The guidelines are divided into eight sections. Level I and Level II evidence was available for only five recommendations and led to a moderate level of recommendations. Most of the available evidence was at Level III and below, and hence the level of recommendation was low or very low. A consensus method was used to provide recommendations for several issues.
   Conclusions: Although most of the recommendations for the prevention and management of shunt infections are based on a low level of evidence, we believe that this document will provide a useful reference to neurosurgeons not only in India but also in other low and middle income countries. These guidelines need to be updated as and when new evidence emerges.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Skin autofluorescence (SAF) has been suggested as a novel and noninvasive technique for assessing tissue accumulation of advanced glycation end products in diabetes and related complications. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the use of SAF in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).
   DATA SOURCES: PubMed/MEDLINE and other digital databases.
   STUDY SELECTION: The authors included studies comparing the SAF levels in patients with DFU with a non-DFU group to determine its association with DFU risk.
   DATA EXTRACTION: Collected data included the SAF method and its values in DFU and non-DFU groups, covariates used in adjustment along with the unadjusted and/or multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association of SAF with DFU risk, and other study characteristics.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of six studies were included in this meta-analysis. Five studies that involved 611 participants were included to compare SAF methods Compared with the non-DFU group, the DFU group showed a significantly increased level of SAF (standardized mean difference, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-1.01; P<.031). The results of meta-analysis of ORs revealed that the increased SAF level was independently associated with increased DFU risk in both unadjusted (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.18-4.57; P< .001) and adjusted models (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.95-4.81; P< .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SAF could be useful as a novel and noninvasive technology to help determine DFU risk. However, further studies establishing its diagnostic and prognostic utilities are needed.

AB  - Purpose:Diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) contribute to ocular morbidity and are emerging as diseases with significant public health impact. Our aim was to assess the countrywide prevalence of DR and sight-threatening DR (STDR) among persons with diabetes and to evaluate the coverage of DR examinations among them. Methods:The present survey was planned to estimate the burden of DR in the population aged >= 50 years for assisting in the planning and prioritization of diabetic eye services. For this survey, 21 districts with a high prevalence of DM were selected among the 31 districts where the national blindness and visual impairment survey was conducted. The total sample size was 63,000 people aged 50 years and above. DR was assessed by dilated fundus examination with indirect ophthalmoscope and was graded according to Scottish DR grading. STDR included severe nonproliferative DR, proliferative DR, and clinically significant macular edema. Results:The prevalence of diabetes in the surveyed population was 11.8%. Among them, one-third were newly diagnosed DM, that is, diagnosed at the time of the survey. The study revealed that the prevalence of DR among persons with diabetes was 16.9%, the prevalence of STDR was 3.6%, and the prevalence of mild retinopathy was 11.8%. Risk factors for DR in the current study were duration of diabetes (>10 years, OR 4.8, 95% CI: 3.3-6.9), poor glycemic control (>= 200 mg/dL, OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.7) and insulin treatment (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.7-4.1). Conclusion:The current study highlights the substantial burden of DM and DR in India and the critical need to adopt a coordinated and multisectoral approach to reduce their prevalence. There is a need for early identification of persons with diabetes and their routine screening for DR along with availability of treatment facilities.

AB  - Background: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) presents with the triad of gait difficulty, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline. However, the definitive diagnosis and treatment may be challenging at times due to secondary causes of NPH (sNPH) versus idiopathic NPH (iNPH), co-existing other degenerative, vascular, and metabolic causes of similar clinical presentations.
   Objective: The objective of this narrative review is to outline the approach to patient evaluation and decision-making in cases where there is clinical suspicion of iNPH.
   Methods: This review article intends to provide a practical approach to the patients with a suspected diagnosis of iNPH.
   Results: The cardinal clinical features with a guide from investigations like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and CSF tap assessment have been outlined. The interpretation of conflicting MRI brain findings or CSF analysis may need resolution by further tests. The decision algorithm following the examination and investigations has been included to address the dilemma in the case of a non-supportive MRI and/or CSF tap test.
   Conclusion: iNPH is a treatable cause of the cognitive decline and gait disorder. While neurodegenerative causes may accompany iNPH, any patient with improvement after CSF drainage deserves therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Purpose: To study and compare the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with the internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in the eyes with recalcitrant diabetic macular edema (DME) with and without vitreomacular traction. Methods: A comparative prospective interventional study was undertaken in which group 1 included 45 eyes of 45 patients with DME with vitreomacular tractional component and group 2 included 45 eyes of 45 patients with recalcitrant DME without a tractional component. Both groups underwent standard PPV with ILM peeling. All the patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. The parameters evaluated were changes in the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) parameters, and occurrence of any intraoperative/postoperative surgical complication. Results: The mean CMT improved significantly from 540.6 and 490.2 mu m at the baseline to 292.5 and 270.6 mu m at 6 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean BCVA logMAR improved from 0.78 +/- 0.21 to 0.62 +/- 0.22 in group 1 and 0.84 +/- 0.19 to 0.65 +/- 0.21 in group 2 at 6 months follow-up which was not statistically significant. The improvement in the mfERG was seen in group 2 as a significant increase in P1 wave amplitude in ring 2 (2-5 degrees) (P < 0.004) and a significant decrease in P 1 wave implicit time in ring 1 (central 2 degrees) (P < 0.001). None of the eyes suffered from the loss of BCVA or any major surgical complication in either group. Conclusion: PPV in recalcitrant DME provides good anatomical outcomes and the results are comparable in DME with and without a tractional component.

AB  - Background and aim: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of visual impairment worldwide. Next to intraocular pressure (IOP), vascular factors play a major role in glaucoma. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been shown to reduce the IOP, normalize the stress biomarkers, modulate gene expression, and also improve the quality of life. This study was aimed to assess the effect of MBSR in optic disc perfusion of patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Experimental procedure: POAG patients with controlled IOP (<21 mmHg) were randomised in to intervention group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). Both the groups continued their routine glaucoma medications while the intervention group practiced 45 min of MBSR every day in addition. IOP and optic disc perfusion using OCT-Angiography were recorded at baseline and at 6 weeks for both the groups. Results: The mean age of the participants were 53.23 +/- 8.4yr in intervention and 50.23 +/- 7.3yr in the control group (p = 0.06). All the baseline parameters were comparable in both groups. After MBSR, in the intervention group there was a significant reduction of IOP (p=0.001), increase in circum-papillary vessel density in superior quadrant (15.8%-17.4%, p=0.02) and nasal quadrant (14.2%-16.5%, p=0.01), increase in circum papillary vascular perfusion, in superior quadrant (38.9%-41.1%, p<0.001), in temporal quadrant (42.2%-4 4.5%, p<0.001), in inferior quadrant (40.1%-43.8%, p<0.001), and in nasal quadrant (40.6%-42.8%, p<0.001). There was also a significant increase in Flux Index after 6weeks (0.38-0.40, p<0.001). Conclusion: MBSR can reduce barotrauma and improve optic disc perfusion in POAG patients and serve as a useful adjunct to the standard medical therapy.

AB  - Background Documentation of patterns and long-term trends in mortality in young people, which reflect huge changes in demographic and social determinants of adolescent health, enables identification of global investment priorities for this age group. We aimed to analyse data on the number of deaths, years of life lost, and mortality rates by sex and age group in people aged 10-24 years in 204 countries and territories from 1950 to 2019 by use of estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.
   Methods We report trends in estimated total numbers of deaths and mortality rate per 100 000 population in young people aged 10-24 years by age group (10-14 years, 15-19 years, and 20-24 years) and sex in 204 countries and territories between 1950 and 2019 for all causes, and between 1980 and 2019 by cause of death. We analyse variation in outcomes by region, age group, and sex, and compare annual rate of change in mortality in young people aged 10-24 years with that in children aged 0-9 years from 1990 to 2019. We then analyse the association between mortality in people aged 10-24 years and socioeconomic development using the GBD Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure based on average national educational attainment in people older than 15 years, total fertility rate in people younger than 25 years, and income per capita. We assess the association between SDI and all-cause mortality in 2019, and analyse the ratio of observed to expected mortality by SDI using the most recent available data release (2017).
   Findings In 2019 there were 1.49 million deaths (95% uncertainty interval 1.39-1.59) worldwide in people aged 10-24 years, of which 61% occurred in males. 32.7% of all adolescent deaths were due to transport injuries, unintentional injuries, or interpersonal violence and conflict; 32.1% were due to communicable, nutritional, or maternal causes; 27.0% were due to non-communicable diseases; and 8.2% were due to self-harm. Since 1950, deaths in this age group decreased by 30.0% in females and 15.3% in males, and sex-based differences in mortality rate have widened in most regions of the world. Geographical variation has also increased, particularly in people aged 10-14 years. Since 1980, communicable and maternal causes of death have decreased sharply as a proportion of total deaths in most GBD super-regions, but remain some of the most common causes in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where more than half of all adolescent deaths occur. Annual percentage decrease in all-cause mortality rate since 1990 in adolescents aged 15-19 years was 1.3% in males and 1.6% in females, almost half that of males aged 1-4 years (2.4%), and around a third less than in females aged 1-4 years (2.5%). The proportion of global deaths in people aged 0-24 years that occurred in people aged 10-24 years more than doubled between 1950 and 2019, from 9.5% to 21.6%.
   Interpretation Variation in adolescent mortality between countries and by sex is widening, driven by poor progress in reducing deaths in males and older adolescents. Improving global adolescent mortality will require action to address the specific vulnerabilities of this age group, which are being overlooked. Furthermore, indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to jeopardise efforts to improve health outcomes including mortality in young people aged 10-24 years. There is an urgent need to respond to the changing global burden of adolescent mortality, address inequities where they occur, and improve the availability and quality of primary mortality data in this age group.

AB  - Background: Sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE) is a severe form of hypertensive acute heart failure with a dramatic presentation. Rapid identification and management in the emergency department (ED) is key to saving these patients and preventing morbidity associated with endotracheal intubation and intensive care treatment. Use of high-dose nitroglycerin (NTG) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been advocated in management of such patients. Objective: To study the feasibility and safety of high-dose NTG combined with NIV in SCAPE. Methods: This was a prospective observational pilot study done in the ED of a tertiary care hospital. All patients were treated with high-dose NTG and NIV. The primary objective was to study the feasibility and safety of the SCAPE management protocol in terms of the outcome of the patient. Resolution of symptoms in 6 h and need for intubation were recorded as endpoints. Any complications associated with high-dose NTG were also recorded. Results: A total of 25 patients were recruited. The mean bolus dose of NTG given was 872 mu g, and mean cumulative dose, 35 mg. There was no incidence of hypotension after the bolus dose of nitroglycerin. Eleven patients had resolution of symptoms at 3 h of therapy. Twenty-four patients were discharged from the ED itself after a brief period of observation, and one patient was intubated and shifted to the intensive care unit. Conclusion: Use of our specific SCAPE treatment algorithm, which included high-dose NTG and NIV, was safe and provided rapid resolution of symptoms. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: There exists substantial variability in the management of pelvic ring injuries among pelvic trauma surgeons. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive survey on the management of pelvic ring injuries among an international group of pelvic trauma surgeons to determine areas of agreement and disagreement.
   Methods: A 45-item questionnaire was developed using an online survey platform and distributed to 30 international pelvic trauma surgeons. The survey consisted of general questions on the acute management of pelvic ring injuries and questions regarding 5 cases: Lateral compression (LC) type 1 injury, LC-3, Anterior-posterior compression (APC) type 3 injury, a combined vertical shear (VS) injury through the sacrum, and VS injury through sacroiliac joint. Respondents were shown blinded anteroposterior pelvis radiographs and axial computed tomography (CT) images for each case and asked if the injury needed fixation, the type of fixation, the order of fixation, and postoperative weight-bearing status. The Kappa statistic was calculated to assess agreement between respondents for each question.
   Results: Nineteen out of 30 pelvic trauma surgeons completed the survey. Respondents practiced in Brazil (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), India (n = 1), Italy (n = 1) United Kingdom (n = 1), and the United States (n = 14). Of the 45 questions in this survey, 38 (84%) had minimal to no agreement among the respondents. There was moderate agreement, for performing lumbopelvic fixation when indicated, for anterior and posterior fixation of the LC-3 injury, and on forgoing EUA or stress X-rays for the APC-3 injury. There was strong agreement for open reduction and internal fixation of the anterior pelvic ring in the APC-3 injury and the VS injury through the SI joint. In contrast, LC-1 injury and combined VS pelvic ring injury through the sacrum had no areas of moderate to strong agreement.
   Discussion: This study identified specific areas of pelvic ring injury management with minimal to no agreement among pelvic trauma surgeons.

AB  - -OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of clinical evidence that guides perioperative glycemia management in patients -ndergoing craniotomy for brain tumor resection. The purpose of this study was to better understand global perceptions and practices related to glycemia management in these patients. -METHODS: Neuroanesthesiologists throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia filled out a brief online questionnaire related to their perceptions and practices regarding glycemia management in patients undergoing craniotomy for brain tumor resection. -RESULTS: Over 4 weeks, 435 participants practicing in 34 countries across 6 continents participated in this survey. Although responders in North America were found to perceive a higher risk hyperglycemia compared with those practicing in European (P = 0.024) and South Asian (P = 0.007) countries, responders practicing in South Asian countries (P = 0.030), Middle Eastern countries (P = 0.029), and South American (P = 0.005) countries were more likely than those from North America to remeasure glucose after an initial normal glucose measurement at incision. Responders from North America reported that a higher blood glucose threshold was necessary for them to delay or cancel the surgery compared with responders in Slavic (P < 0.001), European (P = 0.002), South American (P = 0.002), and Asian and Pacific (P < 0.001) countries. Responders from North America were more likely to report that they would delay or cancel the surgery because of a higher blood glucose threshold. -CONCLUSIONS: Our survey results suggest that perceptions and practices related to blood glucose management in patients undergoing brain tumor resection are variable. This study highlights the need for stronger clinical evidence and guidelines to help guide decisions for when and how to manage blood glucose derangements in these patients.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate and compare the immediate and long-term outcomes of radiological interventions for hemorrhagic complications in patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis.
   Materials and Methods: This retrospective study, conducted between January 2014 and June 2020, included all patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis presenting with hemorrhagic complications who underwent angiography and/or embolization. Their clinical, angiographic, and embolization details were evaluated and correlated with procedure success, complications, recurrence, and mortality. The patients were subgrouped into groups A (acute pancreatitis) and C (chronic pancreatitis), and comparisons were made.
   Results: The study included 141 patients (mean age, 36.3 +/- 11.2 years; 124 men), of whom 106 patients had abnormal angiography findings and underwent embolization. Of them, group A had 50 patients (56 lesions) and group C had 56 patients (61 lesions). All the patients in group A had severe acute pancreatitis, with a mean computed tomography severity index of 7.6. The technical and clinical success rates of embolization, complications, recurrence, and long-term outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. Group A had significantly higher mortality due to sepsis and organ failure. Embolic agents did not have any significant association with complications, recurrence, and mortality. After a mean follow-up of 2 years, 72.5% of the patients were asymptomatic, and none had symptoms attributable to embolization.
   Conclusions: Success, complications, and recurrence after embolization for hemorrhagic complications were comparable between acute and chronic pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was associated with significantly higher mortality. Embolic agents did not significantly influence the outcomes. None had long-term adverse effects attributable to embolization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vertebral hemangiomas are benign but highly vascular lesions and are one of the most common lesions of the vertebral column. Anterior soft-tissue compression of spinal cord due to vertebral body hemangioma is challenging to manage. Our objective was to assess long-term clinical and radiologic effects of direct transpedicular absolute alcohol embolization, laminectomy, and short segment instrumented fusion on resolution of extraosseous epidural soft tissue and improvement in myelopathy in cases of vertebral hemangioma causing anterior soft-tissue compression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis that included patients with single-level vertebral hemangioma with anterior intraspinal soft-tissue growth causing spinal cord compression and clinical features of myelopathy between June 2007 and June 2019 at authors' institute. Transpedicular vertebral body injection of absolute alcohol, laminectomy, and pedicle screw rod instrumentation was performed in all patients. Clinicoradiologic outcomes of surgery were noted. We proposed a grading system for the extent of anterior extraosseous epidural soft-tissue compression. RESULTS: In total, 14 patients were included in study. Their mean age was 28.4 +/- 14.4 years. Mean follow-up duration was 67.5 +/- 36.2 months. All patients had preoperative radiologic grade 4 compression. Postoperative radiologic grading improved to grade 1 in 4 (28.6%), grade 2 in 8 (57.1%), and grade 3 in 2 (14.3%). All the patients improved neurologically after surgery. Eleven patients improved to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade E, 2 improved to ASIA D, and 1 improved to ASIA C at the last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral hemangiomas with anterior extraosseous epidural extension causing spinal canal compromise and myelopathy can be managed with direct transpedicular ethanol embolization, laminectomy, and short-segment instrumented fusion with resolution of the extraosseous soft tissue and improvement in myelopathy. The procedure is relatively simple, cost effective, and has a good outcome.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops during sleep. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and OSA are linked with an increased risk of oxidative stress and inflammation. The possible link between LTL and OSA in Asian Indians has not been evaluated. Thus, the present study aims to compare the link between LTL and OSA in Asian Indians.Methods: In this study, 300 subjects (120 obese with OSA, 110 obese without OSA, and 70 non-obese without OSA) were included after overnight polysomnography and a fasting blood sample. Clinical, anthropometry, metabolic markers, insulin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D], and parathyroid hormones (PTH) levels were investigated. LTL was investigated by a QPCR. Univariate and stepwise multivariate linear regression analyses adjusting for age, gender, BMI, and % body fat were conducted while treating LTL as a dependent variable in relation to AHI and other covariates.Results: Obese subjects with OSA had significantly decreased 25(OH)D and increased PTH levels. The mean telomere length (T/S) ratio was significantly shorter in patients with OSA. The adjusted correlation analysis showed that shortening of telomere length correlated with increasing age, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index, and RDI. Univariate analysis showed that LTL revealed a trend toward a negative correlation with a mean age (beta + SE, -0.015 + 0.0006; p = 0.01) and positive correlation with AHI [beta +slandered error (SE), 0.042 + 0.017; p = 0.008]. In the multiple regression analysis, LTL was positively associated with AHI (beta + SE, 0.281 + 0.04; p = 0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and % body fat. Even when adjusted for confounding factors, 25(OH)D, and PTH levels, LTL still was related to AHI (beta + SE, 0.446 + 0.02; p = 0.05).Conclusion: Our study indicates the presence of an association between LTL and OSA and a significant impact of OSA severity and telomeres shortening in Asian Indians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among patients with diabetes and chronic coronary disease, it is unclear if invasive management improves outcomes when added to medical therapy.
   METHODS: The ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) trials (ie, ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-Chronic Kidney Disease) randomized chronic coronary disease patients to an invasive (medical therapy + angiography and revascularization if feasible) or a conservative approach (medical therapy alone with revascularization if medical therapy failed). Cohorts were combined after no trial-specific effects were observed. Diabetes was defined by history, hemoglobin A1c >= 6.5%, or use of glucose-lowering medication. The primary outcome was all-cause death or myocardial infarction (MI). Heterogeneity of effect of invasive management on death or MI was evaluated using a Bayesian approach to protect against random high or low estimates of treatment effect for patients with versus without diabetes and for diabetes subgroups of clinical (female sex and insulin use) and anatomic features (coronary artery disease severity or left ventricular function).
   RESULTS: Of 5900 participants with complete baseline data, the median age was 64 years (interquartile range, 57-70), 24% were female, and the median estimated glomerular filtration was 80 mL.min(-1.)1.73(-2) (interquartile range, 64-95). Among the 2553 (43%) of participants with diabetes, the median percent hemoglobin A1c was 7% (interquartile range, 7-8), and 30% were insulin-treated. Participants with diabetes had a 49% increased hazard of death or MI (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.31-1.70]; P<0.001). At median 3.1-year follow-up the adjusted event-free survival was 0.54 (95% bootstrapped CI, 0.48-0.60) and 0.66 (95% bootstrapped CI, 0.61-0.71) for patients with diabetes versus without diabetes, respectively, with a 12% (95% bootstrapped CI, 4%-20%) absolute decrease in event-free survival among participants with diabetes. Female and male patients with insulin-treated diabetes had an adjusted event-free survival of 0.52 (95% bootstrapped CI, 0.42-0.56) and 0.49 (95% bootstrapped CI, 0.42-0.56), respectively. There was no difference in death or MI between strategies for patients with diabetes versus without diabetes, or for clinical (female sex or insulin use) or anatomic features (coronary artery disease severity or left ventricular function) of patients with diabetes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher risk for death or MI, chronic coronary disease patients with diabetes did not derive incremental benefit from routine invasive management compared with initial medical therapy alone.

AB  - With developments in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, the use of biological products for the treatment of various disorders has come into the limelight among researchers and clinicians. Among all the available biological tissues, research and exploration of adipose tissue have become more robust. Adipose tissue engineering aims to develop by-products and their substitutes for their regenerative and immunomodulatory potential. The use of biodegradable scaffolds along with adipose tissue products has a major role in cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Adipose tissue, apart from being the powerhouse of energy storage, also functions as the largest endocrine organ, with the release of various adipokines. The progenitor cells among the heterogeneous population in the adipose tissue are of paramount importance as they determine the capacity of regeneration of these tissues. The results of adipose-derived stem-cell assisted fat grafting to provide numerous growth factors and adipokines that improve vasculogenesis, fat graft integration, and survival within the recipient tissue and promote the regeneration of tissue are promising. Adipose tissue gives rise to various by-products upon processing. This article highlights the significance and the usage of various adipose tissue by-products, their individual characteristics, and their clinical applications.

AB  - Context. Addressing symptoms of anxiety and depression is important in cancer palliative care. However, little information exists on the prevalence of anxiety and depression and mental health service use among advanced cancer patients in South Asia.
   Objectives. To examine among South Asian advanced cancer patients, the 1) prevalence of high anxiety and depression scores, 2) factors associated with high anxiety and depression scores, and 3) mental health service use.
   Methods. This cross-sectional, multi-site study recruited patients receiving oncology care across six major public hospitals in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Participants were adults, diagnosed with stage IV metastatic solid cancer and aware they had cancer. Participants' high anxiety and depression scores (using clinically-relevant Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale thresh-old of >10), sociodemographic characteristics, patient-perceived cancer stigma and mental health service use were assessed.
   Results. In the overall sample (N = 1140), 54% met threshold for high anxiety and/or depression scores: 32% reported high anxiety scores and 47% reported high depression scores. Symptom burden (OR's [95% CI's] = 1.09-1.13 [1.05-1.09, 1.12-1.17]) and perceived stigma (1.11-1.16 [1.06-1.11, 1.16-1.22]) were statistically significantly associated with high anxiety and depression scores. Of the patients with high anxiety and/or depression scores (n = 617), 97% had not received mental health services, and 38% of them indicated they were open to a referral.
   Conclusion. High, clinically-relevant anxiety and depression scores are common among South Asian advanced cancer patients.

AB  - Background
   Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is evolving continuously with emergence of several variants of increasing transmission capabilities and pandemic potential. Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases.
   Methods
   In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases.
   Key Findings
   Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient's stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes.
   Conclusions
   The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed to investigate how the psychological health of health care professionals (HCP) on COVID duty was different from those who were not directly in contact. Methodology: Of 473 (76%) randomly selected respondents (doctors and nurses) to a WhatsApp request message, 450 subjects' data were finally analyzed. Result: The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression among HCP was 33.8, 38.9 and 43.6%, respectively. Compared with nonexposed professionals, COVID-19-exposed professionals had roughly double the score of these morbidities (t = 6.3, p < 0.001; t = 6.9, p < 0.001; t = 6.0, p < 0.001). Most worry (71.11%) was about the health of their family, followed by themselves (35.55%). Conclusion: The level of exposure, feelings of uncertainty and fear of infection emerged in our study as possible risk factors for psychological morbidities among HCP.

AB  - Introduction: Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug which has in-vitro efficacy in reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load. Hence, Ivermectin is under investigation as a repurposed agent for treating COVID-19. Methods: In this pilot, double blind, randomized controlled trial, hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were assigned to a single oral administration of an elixir formulation of Ivermectin at either 24 mg or 12 mg dose, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The co-primary outcomes were conversion of RT-PCR to negative result and the decline of viral load at day 5 of enrolment. Safety outcomes included total and serious adverse events. The primary outcomes were assessed in patients who had positive RT-PCR at enrolment (modified intention-to-treat population). Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients who received the intervention (intention-to-treat population). Results: Among the 157 patients randomized, 125 were included in modified intention-to-treat analysis. 40 patients each were assigned to Ivermectin 24 mg and 12 mg, and 45 patients to placebo. The RT-PCR negativity at day 5 was higher in the two Ivermectin arms but failed to attain statistical significance (Ivermectin 24 mg, 47.5%; 12 mg arm, 35.0%; and placebo arm, 31.1%; p-value = 0.30). The decline of viral load at day 5 was similar in each arm. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: In patients with mild and moderate COVID-19, a single oral administration of Ivermectin did not significantly increase either the negativity of RT-PCR or decline in viral load at day 5 of enrolment compared with placebo.

AB  - Individuals with calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones can have secondarily infected calculi which may play a role in the development of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the most common causative pathogen of UTIs. Macrophages play a critical role in host immune defense against bacterial infections. Our previous study demonstrated that oxalate, an important component of the most common type of kidney stone, impairs monocyte cellular bioenergetics and redox homeostasis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether oxalate compromises macrophage metabolism, redox status, anti-bacterial response, and immune response. Monocytes (THP-1, a human monocytic cell line) were exposed to sodium oxalate (soluble oxalate; 50 mu M) for 48 hours prior to being differentiated into macrophages. Macrophages were subsequently exposed to calcium oxalate crystals (50 mu M) for 48 hours followed by UPEC (MOI 1:2 or 1:5) for 2 hours. Peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from C57BL/6 mice were also exposed to oxalate. THP-1 macrophages treated with oxalate had decreased cellular bioenergetics, mitochondrial complex I and IV activity, and ATP levels compared to control cells. In addition, these cells had a significant increase in mitochondrial and total reactive oxygen species levels, mitochondrial gene expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokine (i.e. Interleukin-1 beta, IL-1 beta and Interleukin-6, IL-6) mRNA levels and secretion. In contrast, oxalate significantly decreased the mRNA levels and secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-10 (IL-10). Further, oxalate increased the bacterial burden of primary macrophages. Our findings demonstrate that oxalate compromises macrophage metabolism, redox homeostasis, and cytokine signaling leading to a reduction in anti-bacterial response and increased infection. These data highlight a novel role of oxalate on macrophage function.

AB  - Background and aims: Both endoscopic and laparoscopic transmural internal drainage are practiced for drainage of walled-off necrosis (WON) following acute pancreatitis (AP) but the superiority of either is not established. Our aim was to compare transperitoneal laparoscopic drainage with endoscopic drainage using either lumen apposing metal stents (LAMS) or plastic stents tailored to the amount of necrotic debris in WON. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, adequately powered to exclude the null hypothesis, patients with symptomatic WON were randomized to either endoscopic or laparoscopic drainage. In the endoscopy group, two plastic stents were placed if the WON contained <1/3rd necrotic debris and a LAMS was placed if it was >1/3rd. Primary outcome was resolution of WON within 4 weeks without reintervention for secondary infection. Secondary outcome was overall success (resolution of WON at 6 months) and adverse events. Results: Forty patients were randomized: 20 to each group. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Primary outcome was similar between the groups [16 (80%) in laparoscopy and 15 (75%) in endoscopy group; p = 0.89]. The overall success was similar [18 (90%) in laparoscopy vs. 17 (85%) in endoscopy; p = 0.9]. Median duration of hospital stay was shorter in endoscopy group [4 (4-8) vs. 6 days (5-9); p = 0.03]. Adverse events were comparable between the groups. Conclusion: Laparoscopic drainage was not superior to endoscopic transmural drainage with placement of multiple plastic stent or LAMS depending on the amount of necrotic debris for symptomatic WON in AP. The hospital stay was shorter with the endoscopic approach. (c) 2021 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. We sought to ascertain the short- and long-term results of total pericardiectomy for chronic constrictive pericarditis using a modified left anterolateral thoracotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass on postoperative low cardiac output, normalization of intracardiac pressures, survival, and reoperations.
   Methods. Between January 2005 and December 2019 a series of 127 consecutive patients (91 male patients) between ages 4 and 72 years (median, 25 years; interquartile range, 18-38) underwent radical total pericardiectomy using a modified left anterolateral thoracotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Results. Operative and late mortalities were 3.1% and 1.6%, respectively. Thirty-one patients (24.4%) had postoperative low cardiac output, and none required reoperations. At a median follow-up of 99 months (interquartile range, 56-141) the actuarial survival was 97.6% +/- 0.01% months (95% confidence interval, 92.8-99.2). At their last follow-up 113 (93.4%) and 8 (6.6%) survivors were in New York Heart Association class I and II, respectively.
   Conclusions. Total pericardiectomy is associated with lower perioperative and late mortality and decreased low cardiac output syndrome and confers significant long-term advantage of superior hemodynamics. (C) 2021 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons

Major incidents occurred not only due to their use as chemical warfare agents but also because of occupational hazards. Therefore, a clear understanding of these agents and their mode of action is essential to develop effective decontamination and therapeutic strategies. The blister agents have been categorised on the basis of their chemistry and the biological interactions that entail post contamination. These compounds have been known to majorly cause blisters/bullae along with alkylation of the contaminated DNA. However, due to the high toxicity and restricted use, very little research has been conducted and a lot remains to be clearly understood about these compounds. Various decontamination solutions and detection technologies have been developed, which have proven to be effective for their timely mitigation. But a major hurdle seems to be the lack of proper understanding of the toxicological mechanism of action of these compounds. Current review is about the detailed and updated information on physical, chemical and biological aspects of various blister agents. It also illustrates the mechanism of their action, toxicological effects, detection technologies and possible decontamination strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND Prevalence of both degenerative severe aortic stenosis (AS) and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) increases with age. Dual disease (AS+myocardial ATTR-CA) occurs in significant proportion of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). OBJECTIVES This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ATTR-CA in severe AS in the Indian population, identify noninvasive predictors of its diagnosis, and understand its impact on prognosis. METHODS Symptomatic severe AS patients aged $65 years undergoing SAVR were enrolled. ATTR-CA diagnosis was based on preoperative 99m-technetium pyrophosphate (PYP) scan and intraoperatively obtained basal interventricular septum biopsy for myocardial ATTR-CA, and excised native aortic valve for isolated valvular ATTR-CA. Primary amyloidosis was excluded by serum/urine protein electrophoresis with serum immunofixation. RESULTS SAVR was performed in 46 AS patients (age 70 +/- 5 years, 70% men). PYP scan was performed for 32 patients, with significant PYP uptake in 3 (n = 3 of 32, 9.4%), suggestive of myocardial ATTR-CA. On histopathological examination, none of the interventricular septum biopsy specimens had amyloid deposits, whereas 33 (71.7%) native aortic valves showed amyloid deposits, of which 19 (57.6%) had transthyretin deposition suggestive of isolated valvular amyloidosis. Noninvasive markers of dual disease included low myocardial contraction fraction (median [interquartile range], 28.8% [23.8% to 39.1%] vs 15.3% [9.3% to 16.1%]; P = 0.006), deceleration time (215 [144 to 236] ms vs 88 [60 to 106] ms; P = 0.009) and global longitudinal strain (-18.7% [-21.1% to-16.9%] vs-14.2% [-17.0% to-9.7%]; P = 0.030). At 1-year follow-up, 2 patients died (4.3%); 1 each in myocardial ATTR-CA negative and positive groups (3.4% vs 33.3%; P = 0.477). CONCLUSIONS Dual disease is not uncommon in India. Isolated valvular amyloidosis in severe AS is much more common.

AB  - Introduction Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is a common radiological entity, with myriad etiologies. A significant proportion of the published literature on Endobronchial ultrasound-guided trans-bronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is focused on the diagnostic and staging aspects of lung cancer. However, the value of EBUS-TBNA in a high tuberculosis burden setting is not well established. We therefore sought to assess the diagnostic utility of EBUS-TBNA in suspected non-malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy in a tertiary care referral center in North India.
   Methods In this prospective study, consecutive patients with suspected non-malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy were included and underwent clinical assessment and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) to establish a baseline clinico-radiological-laboratory diagnosis (CRLD). EBUS-TBNA was performed, and aspirates were sent for cytology and microbiological tests for TB. In cases of non-diagnostic EBUS-TBNA, CRLD was used to guide therapy. Treatment was instituted, and follow-up was done at 6 months. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of EBUS-TBNA were calculated on the basis of final diagnosis at 6 months. We also evaluated diagnostic utility of EBUS-TBNA as the percentage of patients wherein EBUS-TBNA diagnosis led to an alteration of management over CRLD-guided treatment.
   Results Ninety-six patients underwent the procedure, of which 55 (57%) had adequate and 47 (49%) had diagnostic EBUS-TBNA, respectively. Among those with adequate EBUS, TB was the most common diagnosis in 29 (53%) patients, followed by sarcoidosis in 14 (25%). One patient was diagnosed with non-TB mycobacterium infection, three patients had malignancy, and eight specimens showed reactive lymphadenitis. The sensitivity for diagnosis of TB and sarcoidosis was 85% and 88%, respectively, with a negative predictive value of 100% for both diagnoses. The diagnostic utility of an adequate EBUS-TBNA was 22% over CRLD, and 77% in cases where CRLD was indeterminate. The adequacy of EBUS-TBNA was significantly higher with lymph node size 2 cm compared to < 2 cm (63% vs. 37%, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion EBUS-TBNA is a valuable method in the evaluation of suspected non-malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy in a high-TB-burden setting, providing specific diagnosis in about half of the patients. If adequate samples are obtained, utility of EBUS-TBNA is 22% overall and 77% in cases with indeterminate CRLD. The adequacy of procedure is significantly higher with lymph node size 2 cm.

AB  - Objectives Literature shows that the expression of various biomarkers in peri-miniscrew crevicular fluid (PMICF) is related to the stability of miniscrew implants (MSIs). The present study investigated the role and alterations in levels of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) in PMICF before and after orthodontic loading. Material and methods This prospective study consisted of forty-six MSIs placed between the second premolar and first molar in the maxillary and mandibular arches. Direct loading was done after 3 weeks of MSI insertion with nickel-titanium closed coil spring exerting a force of 200 g. The PMICF sample was collected at various time intervals, and the level of cfNA was determined. Clinical parameters, including implant mobility and gingival health, were also assessed. Pre-loading and post-loading parameters were assessed using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. Results Among 46 MSIs, 36 were stable during the study and 10 MSIs showed peri-implant inflammation and increased mobility. There was a significant rise in the cfNA concentration 24 h after implant insertion (0.4 +/- 0.86 ng/mu l). The level of cfNAs significantly decreased over 3 weeks and reached the baseline level (0.2 +/- 0.31 ng/mu l). There was also a significant rise in the levels of cfNA (0.8 +/- 0.70 ng/mu l) at 24 h after loading MSIs, which gradually decreased to 0.2 +/- 0.24 ng/mu l after 63 days. The expression of cfNAs was on the average 0.32 units more in the cases with failed implants (P = 0.05). Conclusions cfNA levels in PMICF showed an upward trend 24 h after MSI insertion and 24 h after orthodontic loading. The expression of cfNA was more in cases with failed MSIs. Hence, the cfNAs can be considered as a prognostic biomarker of MSI stability.

AB  - Objectives: The growing prevalence of dementia, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), has raised the need for a unified cognitive screening tool that can aid its early detection. The linguistically and educationally diverse population in India contributes to challenges in diagnosis. The present study aimed to assess the validity and diagnostic accuracy of the Indian Council of Medical Research-Neurocognitive Toolbox (ICMR-NCTB), a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery adapted in five languages, for the diagnosis of dementia.
   Methods: A multidisciplinary group of experts developed the ICMR-NCTB based on reviewing the existing tools and incorporation of culturally appropriate modifications. The finalized tests of the major cognitive domains of attention, executive functions, memory, language, and visuospatial skills were then adapted and translated into five Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. Three hundred fifty-four participants were recruited, including 222 controls and 132 dementia patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the adapted tests were established for the diagnosis of dementia.
   Results: A significant difference in the mean (median) performance scores between healthy controls and patients with dementia was observed on all tests of ICMR-NCTB. The area under the curve for majority of the tests included in the ICMR-NCTB ranged from 0.73 to 1.00, and the sensitivity and specificity of the ICMR-NCTB tests ranged from 70 to 100% and 70.7 to 100%, respectively, to identify dementia across all five languages.
   Conclusions: The ICMR-NCTB is a valid instrument to diagnose dementia across five Indian languages, with good diagnostic accuracy. The toolbox was effective in overcoming the challenge of linguistic diversity. The study has wide implications to address the problem of a high disease burden and low diagnostic rate of dementia in LMICs like India.

AB  - Zinc-dependent viral proteins rely on intracellular zinc homeostasis for successful completion of infectious life-cycle. Here, we report that the intracellular labile zinc levels were elevated at early stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection in hepatic cells and this increase in free zinc was abolished in cells infected with UV-inactivated virus or with a DENV replication inhibitor implicating a role for zinc homeostasis in viral RNA replication. This change in free zinc was mediated by zinc transporter, ZIP8, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZIP8 resulted in abrogation of increase in free zinc levels leading to significant reduction in DENV titers suggesting a crucial role for ZIP8 in early stages of DENV replication. Furthermore, elevated free zinc levels correlated with high copy numbers of dengue genome in peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from dengue patients compared to healthy controls suggesting a critical role for zinc homeostasis in dengue infection. Take Aways Dengue virus utilises cellular zinc homeostasis during replication of its RNA. ZIP8 upregulates free zinc levels during dengue virus replication. Enhanced viremia associates with elevated intracellular free zinc in dengue.

AB  - Background There is substantial interest in leveraging digital health technology to support hypertension management in low- and middle-income countries such as India. The potential for healthcare infrastructure and broader context to support such initiatives in India has not been examined. We evaluated existing healthcare infrastructure to support digital health interventions and examined epidemiologic, socioeconomic, and geographical contextual correlates of healthcare infrastructure in 544 districts covering 29 states and union territories across India. Methods The study was a cross-sectional analysis of India's Fourth District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-4; 2012-2014), the most up-to-date nationally representative district-level healthcare infrastructure data. Facilities were the unit of analysis, and analyses accounted for clustering within states. The main outcome was healthcare system infrastructural context to implement hypertension management programs. Domains included diagnostics (functional BP instrument), medications (anti-hypertensive medication in stock), essential clinical staff (e.g., staff nurse, medical officer, pharmacist), and IT specific infrastructure (regular power supply, internet connection, computer availability). Descriptive analysis was conducted for infrastructure indicators based on the Indian Public Health Standards, and logistic regression was conducted to estimate the association between epidemiologic and geographical context (exposures) and the composite measure of healthcare system. Results Data from 32,215 government facilities were analyzed. Among lowest-tier subcenters, 30% had some IT infrastructure, while at the highest-tier district hospitals, 92% possessed IT infrastructure. At mid-tier primary health centres and community health centres, IT infrastructure availability was 28 and 51%, respectively. For all but sub-centres, the availability of essential staff was lower than the availability of IT infrastructure. For all but district hospitals, higher levels of blood pressure, body mass index, and urban residents were correlated with more favorable infrastructure. By region, districts in Western India tended towards having the best prepared health facilities. Conclusions IT infrastructure to support digital health interventions is more frequently lacking at lower and mid-tier healthcare facilities compared with apex facilities in India. Gaps were generally larger for staffing than physical infrastructure, suggesting that beyond IT infrastructure, shortages in essential staff impose significant constraints to the adoption of digital health interventions. These data provide early benchmarks for state- and district-level planning.

AB  - The choriocapillaris (CC), the capillary bed in the choroid, essentially nourishes the photoreceptor cells. Its damage in aging and age-related diseases significantly influences the survival of the photoreceptor cells. Earlier reports implicated endothelial loss in aged and diseased CC; however, age-related pericyte changes and their contribution in CC death remain unknown. We examined human donor eyes (age: 56-94 years; N = 24), and found that CC pericyte damage preceded endothelial changes. With aging (>70 years), the sub-macular choroid accumulated debris in Bruch's membrane (BM). Of the debris content, the long-spaced collagens had a tendency to settle over the capillary basal lamina (BL), and this often resulted in endothelial projection into capillary lumen. Between 75 and 83 years, pericytes contained dark mitochondria, and their processes facing the BM debris showed partial loss of BL and intermediate filaments (IFs), when the endothelium remained unaltered. The endothelial changes appeared beyond 83 years, the abundance of IFs and autophagy reinforced their survival until late aging. TUNEL+ pericytes, and immunoreactivity to carboxymethyl lysine and 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal, but no nitro-tyrosine, was detected in aged CC walls. Iba-1+ dystrophic microglia were present in the vicinity of the CC. Our data indicate that (1) BM debris exerts pressure on the CC, leading to the damage of the capillary BL and pericyte processes (2) loss of IFs results in early pericyte destabilization (3) capillary wall undergoes lipid peroxidative and glycative damage, and (4) pericyte damage leads to late endothelial changes and ultimately CC loss. Future research should explore the normal ways of pericyte maintenance in the aging nervous system.

AB  - Background: Ruptured interventricular septal aneurysms are rare. We present a case of an interventricular membranous septal aneurysm in a 7-year-old boy who presented with features of congestive heart failure, 2 years after undergoing a patch closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect and tricuspid valve repair. Material and methods and results: Transthoracic echocardiography suggested the presence of an aneurysm that has ruptured into the right ventricle (RV), however, the precise origin of the aneurysm could not be identified on echocardiography. Subsequently, a computed tomography (CT) angiography was done which revealed that the aneurysm was originating from the membranous interventricular septum with evidence of rupture into the RV inflow. Discussion: Due to its close proximity to the aortic annulus, an aneurysm of the membranous interventricular septum may be confused with a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, especially if the former is associated with aortic regurgitation. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of CT in the precise differentiation of these two abnormalities.

AB  - Objective: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which, autonomic dysfunction is a common manifestation. Brain area atrophy also involves the areas comprising central autonomic net-work (CAN) in SCA. Structural atrophy of CAN and autonomic dysfunction should go hand in hand. But this important relationship has not been studied to date. Therefore, using SCA as a disease model, the present study has been designed to explore the plausible correlations between the brain areas of CAN and clinical autonomic function modalities in SCA patients. Materials and methods: 3D T1-weighted scans were acquired on 3T MRI, analyzed by FreeSurfer software in genetically confirmed forty-nine SCA patients (SCA1 = 18, SCA2 = 25 and SCA3 = 6). Heart rate variabil-ity (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and autonomic reactivity tests were used for evaluation of autonomic nervous system. Additionally, autonomic dysfunction scoring was done using composite autonomic severity score (CASS). Results: On correlation analysis, the study showed the association of atrophic cortical and subcortical brain areas (predominantly prefrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal, left cuneus, left lingual and left caudate) with altered clinical autonomic function parameters in SCA patients. These areas were primarily comprised of sympathetic and parasympathetic brain areas of CAN. One of the key brain areas of CAN - left cuneus was found to be associated with both HRV (r = 0.295, p = 0.040) and BRS (r = 0.326, p = 0.022). Conclusion: A characteristic pattern of association between particular brain areas of CAN and clinical autonomic function parameters was observed in SCA patients. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the morphology and associated cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with an anomalous subaortic course of brachiocephalic vein on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography. Material and Methods A retrospective study was performed at a tertiary referral institute to identify patients with subaortic brachiocephalic vein on multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography using dual source CT scanner between January 2014 and July 2021. The morphology of the subaortic brachiocephalic vein along with the cardiovascular anatomy and associated anomalies were evaluated. Results Out of 4349 patients who had undergone MDCT angiography for evaluation of congenital heart diseases, we identified 126 (2.9%) patients with subaortic brachiocephalic vein. The subaortic brachiocephalic vein was left-sided in 125 patients while a right-sided subaortic brachiocephalic vein was identified in a patient with left isomerism. Common cardiovascular associations included tetralogy of Fallot (109/126; 88.1%), double outlet right ventricle (8/126; 6.3%) and common arterial trunk (5/126; 3.9%). The presence of a right aortic arch was seen in 78/126 (62%) patients. Some degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction was present in 119/126 (94.4%) patients; pulmonary stenosis was seen in 78 (62%) patients while pulmonary atresia was seen in 41 (32.5%) patients. Conclusion A subaortic brachiocephalic vein can coexist with various complex congenital heart diseases, most commonly tetralogy of Fallot and commonly associated with right aortic arch and pulmonary stenosis/atresia. It is important to identify this anomalous course of brachiocephalic vein before performing surgical procedures or venous catheterization to avoid potential complications.

AB  - Dietary factors have important role in modulating the gut microbiome, which in-turn regulates the molecular events in colonic mucosa. The composition and resulting metabolism of the gut microbiome are decisive factors in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis. Altered gut microbiome is associated with impaired immune response, and the release of carcinogenic or genotoxic substances which are the major microbiome-induced mechanisms implicated in CRC pathogenesis. Diets low in dietary fibers and phytomolecules as well as high in red meat are important dietary changes which predispose to CRC. Dietary fibers which reach the colon in an undigested form are further metabolized by the gut microbiome into enterocyte friendly metabolites such as short chain fatty acid (SCFA) which provide anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects. Healthy microbiome supported by dietary fibers and phytomolecules could decrease cell proliferation by regulating the epigenetic events which activate proto-oncogenes and oncogenic pathways. Emerging evidence show that predominance of microbes such as Fusobacterium nucleatum can predispose the colonic mucosa to malignant transformation. Dietary and lifestyle modifications have been demonstrated to restrict the growth of potentially harmful opportunistic organisms. Synbiotics can protect the intestinal mucosa by improving immune response and decreasing the production of toxic metabolites, oxidative stress and cell proliferation. In this narrative review, we aim to update the emerging evidence on how diet could modulate the gut microbial composition and revive colonic epithelium. This review highlights the importance of healthy plant-based diet and related supplements in CRC prevention by improving the gut microbiome.

AB  - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a rare rheumatic disease affecting subjects of all ages. Prevalence and incidence of this systemic disease greatly varies across different ethnic groups. GPA is the commonest form of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) with PR3 positivity among 85-95% of the cases. Scientific investigations of GPA is warranted because its severity, clinical heterogeneity, fast disease manifestation and end-organ damage. The etiology of GPA is still unknown. Major role of HLA and non-HLA genes with immune functions were identified, however, very limited replication was observed in different ethnic populations. In the present review, we have discussed the updates on the global epidemiology and contribution of HLA and major non-HLA genes/loci in GPA. We have also highlighted the cross disease association of GPA associated genes that may help in better disease management and predictive medicine. We proposed that high-resolution HLA typing and development of genetic risk model would help in early disease diagnosis and understanding the prognosis.

AB  - Cross-reactivity among the two diverse viruses is believed to originate from the concept of antibodies recognizing similar epitopes on the two viral surfaces. Cross-reactive antibody responses have been seen in previous variants of SARS and SARS-CoV-2, but little is known about the cross reactivity with other similar RNA viruses like HIV-1. In the present study, we examined the reactivity the SARS-CoV-2 directed antibodies, via spike, immunized mice sera and demonstrated whether they conferred any cross-reactive neutralization against HIV-1. Our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 spike immunized mice antibodies cross-react with the HIV-1 Env protein. Crossneutralization among the two viruses is uncommon, suggesting the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes amongst the two viruses. Our results indicate, that SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody cross reactivity is targeted towards the gp41 region of the HIV-1 Env (gp160) protein. Overall, our investigation not only answers a crucial question about the understanding of cross-reactive epitopes of antibodies generated in different viral infections, but also provides critical evidence for developing vaccine immunogens and novel treatment strategies with enhanced efficacy capable of recognising diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features.

AB  - Background and Aim: Vitiligo is a progressive, autoimmune, hypomelanotic acquired disorder of skin which is characterized by depigmentation. The initial immunological events of this diseases are still at enigma that includes breach of immune tolerance, and defect in antigen presentation. Hence, we aimed to explore role of Dendritic cells (DCs) and its associated cytokines in the pathogenesis of generalized vitiligo (GV) patients. Methodology: For this case-control study, 20 active patients and controls were enrolled. Phenotypic characterization of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs (mDCs, pDCs) were done by flow-cytometry. Primary culture of DCs was done by monocyte differentiation supplemented with rIL-4 and rGM-CSF. Functional analysis DCs related cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD40) was done by ELISA and qPCR respectively. Tissue localization of DCs was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Result: The frequency of mDCs (0.3715% v/s 0.188%) and pDCs (0.2331% v/s 0.1156%) were elevated in patients as compared to controls. Circulatory level of IL-12, TNF-alpha were significantly higher whereas IFN-alpha was decreased in patients than controls. Similar results were obtained in the culture supernatants of patients. Relative mRNA expression profiling of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD40) were found to be up regulated in patient's skin. Tissue localization of Langerhans cells (Langerin, CD1a(+)) were found to be significantly higher in patients. Conclusion: Elevated frequency of mDCs and pDCs along with elevated levels of IL-12, TNF-alpha and CD80, CD40 may contribute in defective antigen presentation of DCs. Altered pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines along with tissue localization of Langerhans cells might be involved in the pathogenesis of GV. These DCs associated cytokines can be explored as a therapeutic target in future.

AB  - Prolonged inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure is widely associated with brain damage particularly in the hippo-campus via oxidative and apoptotic pathways. Resveratrol (RES) has gained considerable attention because of its benefits to human health. However, its neuroprotective potential against iAs-induced toxicity in CA1 region of hippocampus remains unexplored.
   Therefore, we investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of RES against arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-induced adverse effects on neuronal morphology, apoptotic markers and oxidative stress parameters in mouse CA1 region (hippocampus).
   Adult female Swiss albino mice of reproductive maturity were orally exposed to either As2O3 (2 and 4 mg/kg bw) alone or in combination with RES (40 mg/kg bw) for a period of 45 days. After animal sacrifice on day 46, the perfusion fixed brain samples were used for the observation of neuronal morphology and studying the morphometric features. While the freshly dissected hippocampi were processed for biochemical estimation of oxidative stress markers and western blotting of apoptosis-associated proteins.
   Chronic iAs exposure led to significant decrease in Stratum Pyramidale layer thickness along with reduction in cell density and area of Pyramidal neurons in contrast to the controls. Biochemical analysis showed reduced hippocampal GSH content but no change in total nitrite (NO) levels following iAs exposure. Western blotting showed apparent changes in the expression levels of Box and Bcl-2 proteins following iAs exposure, however the change was statistically insignificant. Contrastingly, iAs +RES co-treatment exhibited substantial reversal in morphological and biochemical observations.
   Together, these findings provide preliminary evidence of neuroprotective role of RES on structural and biochemical alterations pertaining to mouse hippocampus following chronic iAs exposure.

AB  - The emergence of antifungal drug resistance in Candida species has led to increased morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Understanding species distribution and antifungal drug resistance patterns is an essential step for novel drug development. A systematic review was performed addressing this challenge in India with keywords inclusive of 'Candida', 'Antifungal Drug Resistance', 'Candidemia', 'Candidiasis' and 'India'. A total of 106 studies (January 1978-March 2020) from 20 Indian states were included. Of over 11,429 isolates, Candida albicans was the major species accounting for 37.95% of total isolates followed by C. tropicalis (29.40%), C. glabrata (11.68%) and C. parapsilosis (8.36%). Rates of antifungal resistance were highest in non-albicans Candida (NAC) species - C. haemuloni (47.16%), C. krusei (28.99%), C. lipolytica (28.89%) and C. glabrata (20.69%). Approximately 10.34% isolates of C. albicans were observed to be drug resistant. Candida species were frequently resistant to certain azoles (ketoconazole-22.2%, miconazole-22.1% and fluconazole-21.8%). In conclusion, the present systematic review illustrates the overall distribution and antifungal resistance pattern of Candida species among the Indian population that could be helpful in the future for the formation of treatment recommendations for the region but also elsewhere.

AB  - Microbes evolve rapidly by modifying their genome through mutations or acquisition of genetic elements. Antimicrobial resistance in Helicobacter pylori is increasingly prevalent in India. However, limited information is available about the genome of resistant H. pylori isolated from India. Our pan- and core-genome based analyses of 54 Indian H. pylori strains revealed plasticity of its genome. H. pylori is highly heterogenous both in terms of the genomic content and DNA sequence homology of ARGs and virulence factors. We observed that the H. pylori strains are clustered according to their geographical locations. The presence of point mutations in the ARGs and absence of acquired genetic elements linked with ARGs suggest target modifications are the primary mechanism of its antibiotic resistance. The findings of the present study would help in better understanding the emergence of drug-resistant H. pylori and controlling gastric disorders by advancing clinical guidance on selected treatment regimens.

AB  - Objectives: COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare services for chronic disorders such as epilepsy. In this study, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on persons with epilepsy (PWE) with regard to their seizure control, depression status, and medication adherence was assessed. Methods: After ethical clearance, 449 PWE who had been previously evaluated for depression at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India, were telephonically revaluated using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and surveyed for source of medication and medication adherence over past 6 months. The prevalence and the association of depression, suicidality, and seizures during pandemic with different PWE variables were determined. Results: Out of 449 PWE, 70.6% responded. 19.9% were diagnosed positive for depression as per MINI while suicidal ideation was observed in 5.4%. Seventy six (23.9%) PWE reported seizures during pandemic. The incidence was greater in females, unemployed, previously uncontrolled epilepsy, polytherapy, altered use of medications, and depressed PWE. Seizure during pandemic, increased seizure frequency, previous history of depression, and altered use of medications were all significantly associated with depression during COVID-19 pandemic (2.6-95%CI, 1.45-4.73; 1.9-95%CI, 1.01-3.57; 8.8-95%CI, 4.54- 17.21; 2.9-95%CI, 1.19-7.24), and polytherapy (2.9-95%CI, 0.92-9.04), seizures during pandemic (3.9- 95%CI, 1.45-10.53) and previous history of depression and suicidality, were related with suicidal ideation. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic-induced disruptions can be detrimental for PWE, and restoring services to the precovid levels as well as putting appropriate continuity plans in place for care of PWE should be a priority.

AB  - Standard automated perimetry (SAP) is the gold standard for evaluating the presence of visual field defects (VFDs). Nevertheless, it has requirements such as prolonged attention, stable fixation, and a need for a motor response that limit application in various patient groups. Therefore, a novel approach using eye movements (EMs) - as a complementary technique to SAP - was developed and tested in clinical settings by our group. However, the original method uses a screen-based eye-tracker which still requires participants to keep their chin and head stable. Virtual reality (VR) has shown much promise in ophthalmic diagnostics - especially in terms of freedom of head movement and precise control over experimental settings, besides being portable. In this study, we set out to see if patients can be screened for VFDs based on their EM in a VR-based framework and if they are comparable to the screen-based eyetracker. Moreover, we wanted to know if this framework can provide an effective and enjoyable user experience (UX) compared to our previous approach and the conventional SAP. Therefore, we first modified our method and implemented it on a VR head-mounted device with built-in eye tracking. Subsequently, 15 controls naive to SAP, 15 patients with a neuro-ophthalmological disorder, and 15 glaucoma patients performed three tasks in a counterbalanced manner: (1) a visual tracking task on the VR headset while their EM was recorded, (2) the preceding tracking task but on a conventional screen-based eye tracker, and (3) SAP. We then quantified the spatio-temporal properties (STP) of the EM of each group using a cross-correlogram analysis. Finally, we evaluated the human-computer interaction (HCI) aspects of the participants in the three methods using a user-experience questionnaire. We find that: (1) the VR framework can distinguish the participants according to their oculomotor characteristics; (2) the STP of the VR framework are similar to those from the screen-based eye tracker; and (3) participants from all the groups found the VR-screening test to be the most attractive. Thus, we conclude that the EM-based approach implemented in VR can be a user-friendly and portable companion to complement existing perimetric techniques in ophthalmic clinics.

AB  - Introduction: We aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with beta cell dysfunction and progression of glycemic and cardiometabolic variables in an established cohort.
   Methods: Study participants (n = 352, 46.9% men) underwent a detailed evaluation at two time points: (a) pre-COVID (2016-19) and (b) peri-COVID (2020-21). At the second visit, SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined on the basis of a quantitative S1/S2 IgG antibody test (DiaSorin Liaison) and/or a documented history of infection.
   Results: A total of 159 (45.2%) participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 122 (76.7%) had mild/asymptomatic infection. Progression in body mass index (BMI) category [34 (21.4%) vs. 22 (11.4%), p = 0.011] was seen in a significantly higher proportion of the participants in the infected group compared to the non-infected group. Progression in glycemic and insulin indices [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Matsuda index, and oral disposition index (oDI)] categories was also evident in a larger proportion of participants in the infected group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. On logistic regression analysis, the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and BMI category progression was statistically significant [fully adjusted OR 2.14 (95% CI, 1.18-3.90; p = 0.013)].
   Conclusion: In this longitudinal study, predominant mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increase in BMI, but not with worsening of beta cell function and insulin resistance, nor glycemic progression.

AB  - Pediatric overweight/obesity has assumed epidemic proportions in India. It is associated with several significant complications and tracks into adulthood. The mainstay of management is a holistic lifestyle modification that must be adopted by the family as a whole. It involves dietary changes, regular physical activity, and behavioral changes that favor a healthy way of life. Regular follow-up, and attention to keeping up the motivation of the child and family achieves good results. In the present paper, a stepwise approach to prevention and management of childhood obesity is presented along with the recommendations for screening and management of associated complications and the role of pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery.

AB  - Lipid droplets store neutral lipids, primarily triacylglycerol and steryl esters. Seipin plays a role in lipid droplet biogenesis and is thought to determine the site of lipid droplet biogenesis and the size of newly formed lipid droplets. Here we show a seipin-independent pathway of lipid droplet biogenesis. In silico and in vitro experiments reveal that retinyl esters have the intrinsic propensity to sequester and nucleate in lipid bilayers. Production of retinyl esters in mammalian and yeast cells that do not normally produce retinyl esters causes the formation of lipid droplets, even in a yeast strain that produces only retinyl esters and no other neutral lipids. Seipin does not determine the size or biogenesis site of lipid droplets composed of only retinyl esters or steryl esters. These findings indicate that the role of seipin in lipid droplet biogenesis depends on the type of neutral lipid stored in forming droplets.

AB  - Introduction Increased number of primary and revision arthroplasties performed globally has led to a surge in the numbers of periprosthetic fractures. The Unified Classification System (UCS) advocated a rational approach towards the classification of periprosthetic fractures. We present here an update to the UCS with addition of new fracture pattern encountered in orthopedic practice. Methods A retrospective study was conducted to review the service arthroplasty register for the cases with unique fracture pattern where the periprosthetic fracture around total hip arthroplasty was also associated with fracture of the prosthetic component. The details were retrieved from the medical record and the patients were called for a review. The radiological assessment was done with X-rays and clinical assessment with Harris Hip Scores at the latest follow-up. Results Between 2012 and 2019, 11 patients (7 males and 4 females) were operated for peri-prosthetic fracture with a unique pattern where the fracture of femur was associated with fracture of the femoral stem as well. The mean age of the patient at the time of fracture was 56.8 years (range 42-71 years). All patients were managed with revision hip surgery. One patient died due to malignancy after 7 years of revision surgery. All the surviving patients are doing well with a mean Harris Hip Score of 86.8 at the latest follow-up of 2-9 years (mean 5.0 years). Conclusion With emergence of this new fracture pattern, it is recognition as a separate entity would help in better understanding and augmentation of the existing classification system of periprosthetic fractures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There was significant surge in the academic publications after the onset of COVID-19 outbreak. The aim of this study was to scientometrically analyze all the medical publications on COVID-19 in 2020 as well as the top 100 cited articles.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a search of the "Web of Science" database using the keywords "COVID," and "corona" on December 20, 2020.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Our search retrieved a total of 45,420 articles on the topic COVID-19 in the year 2020. Corresponding authors from 143 countries contributed to these articles. The highest number of articles were contributed by corresponding authors from the USA (N.=10299), whereas 50 articles in the top 100 cited articles had corresponding authors from China. Among the top 100 cited, the majority were published from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China (N.=37). New England Journal of Medicine had the maximum impact (h-index of 57), closely followed by Lancet (h-index=55).
   CONCLUSIONS: Scientific publications amount on COVID-19 disease grew at an astonishing pace during 2020. We caution the readers that this rapidity of publication could have missed out on the rigorous review process and the scientific basis of the methods followed.

AB  - In the last 2 decades, authors have gained considerable interest in modifying the age-old classical parotidectomy incisions to address cosmetic concerns of their patients. The article reviews all the incisions that have been introduced over time after modified facelift and Blair incision for performing parotidectomy. These include retroauricular hairline approach, Arden technique, trichophytic incision, periauricular incision, intraauricular modification of facelift approach, endaural approach, postaural approach, Panda technique, preauricular crutch approach, and mini Blair incision. Although these have been reported to be safe, feasible, and cosmetically better approaches, at present, the absence of well-designed prospective observational and interventional studies do not warrant them to be widely used in clinical practice. This will guide surgeons in making patient curated parotidectomy incisions under special circumstances. Currently, these remain limited to the hands of experienced surgeons in high volume centers.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Children with neuroblastoma (NB) and opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS) have a favorable oncologic outcome and overall survival. In contrast, despite intensive multidrug immunomodulation, the neurologic outcome is complicated by the relapsing nature of the neurologic symptoms and long-term neurobehavioral sequelae. Being associated with low-risk NB, there exists an ambiguity in the current literature regarding the administration of chemotherapy in these children. We reviewed our archives for children with NB-OMAS over a 22-year (January 1996 to January 2018) period. Eighteen children (10 female) with a median age at diagnosis of 23 months had NB-OMAS and were included. They had stage 1 (9/18; 50%), 2 (1/18; 5.5%), 3 (7/18; 39%), and 4 (1/18; 5.5%) disease according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System. Multimodality therapy included surgery (16/18; 89%), chemotherapy (11/18; 61%), and immunomodulatory therapy (10/18; 55%). Complete oncologic remission was achieved in all children. Relapse of OMAS and presence of neurologic sequelae were observed in 1 (5.5%) and 5 (28%) cases, respectively. Presence of neurologic sequelae was significantly associated with low-tumor stage (P=0.036) and treatment without chemotherapy (P=0.003). Chemotherapy administration was the only variable significantly predicting a favorable neurologic outcome (95% confidence interval: 0.26-1.40, P=0.01). To conclude, our study including a limited cohort of patients highlights a favorable neurologic outcome associated with chemotherapy administration in children with NB-OMAS. However, further studies with larger sample size need to be conducted before drawing any definite conclusions.

AB  - Preterm neonates - especially those with prolonged duration of intensive care stay - are prone to develop fungal endocarditis. Majority of these children have a stormy course, however, a few may be relatively asymptomatic. Occasionally these vegetations may be large and pedunculated, originating from the atrial septum, mimicking a cardiac myxoma on echocardiography.

AB  - Laparoscopic suture transfixation and free tie ligation are the most commonly used cost-effective technique of managing the base of the appendix during laparoscopic appendectomy in low resource settings such as India. This becomes technically cumbersome especially in the presence of the long friable appendix and for novice surgeons. We hereby describe an innovative technique of suspending the appendix using a transfacial suture to ease the placement of suture at the base of the appendix during laparoscopic appendectomy.

AB  - The objective of this review was to analyze the existing data on acute inflammatory myelopathies associated with coronavirus disease 2019 infection, which were reported globally in 2020. PubMed, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and online publication databases were searched. Thirty-three acute inflammatory myelopathy cases (among them, seven cases had associated brain lesions) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 infection were reported. Demyelinating change was seen in cervical and thoracic regions (27.3% each, separately). Simultaneous involvement of both regions, cervical and thoracic, was seen in 45.4% of the patients. Most acute inflammatory myelopathy disorders reported sensory motor and bowel bladder dysfunctions. On cerebrospinal fluid analysis, pleocytosis and increased protein were reported in 56.7% and 76.7% of the patients, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was positive in five patients. On T2-weighted imaging, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and short-segment demyelinating lesions were reported in 76% and 21%, respectively. Among the patients with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, 61% reported "moderate to significant" improvement and 26% demonstrated "no improvement" in the motor function of lower limbs. Demyelinating changes in the entire spinal cord were observed in three patients. Most of the patients with acute inflammatory myelopathy (including brain lesions) were treated with methylprednisolone (81.8%) and plasma-exchange therapy (42.4%). An early treatment, especially with intravenous methylprednisolone with or without immunoglobulin and plasma-exchange therapy, helped improve motor recovery in the patients with acute inflammatory myelopathy associated with coronavirus disease 2019.

AB  - Objectives: The POLO (Pancreas Cancer Olaparib Ongoing) trial demonstrated improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with olaparib maintenance in advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations who had disease control after 16 weeks of platinum-based first-line therapy. However, in the real-world, the first assessment is usually performed at 12 weeks. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the proportion of real-world patients with APC that have disease control at 12 weeks (DC12) after FOLFIRINOX, assess any associations of baseline variables with DC12, and to determine the effect of DC12 on PFS and overall survival (OS). Methods: APC patients treated with first-line FOLFIRINOX from 2011 to 2018 in Alberta, Canada, were identified. We conducted an analysis of baseline characteristics to identify factors associated with DC12 and to compare the PFS and OS of patients with DC12 to those with earlier disease progression. Results: We identified 165 APC patients treated with FOLFIRINOX with unknown BRCA1/2 status, of which 56% were men, and the median age at diagnosis was 59 years (interquartile range, 38 to 75 y). Of these, 72 (44%) had DC12. Lower serum carbohydrate antigen 19.9 and normal serum albumin were associated with a higher likelihood of DC12. The PFS and OS of patients with DC12 was significantly higher than those with earlier progression (9.3 vs. 2.5 mo; hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.32; P<0.001; 21.6 vs. 8.9 mo; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.49; P<0.0001). Conclusion: Less than half of real-world patients treated with first-line FOLFIRINOX have DC12. Patients with APC who have higher carbohydrate antigen 19.9 and low albumin are less likely to have DC12. DC12 is significantly associated with longer PFS and OS.

AB  - In 2014, FIGO's Committee for Gynecologic Oncology revised the staging of ovarian cancer, incorporating ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer into the same system. Most of these malignancies are high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC). Stage IC is now divided into three categories: IC1 (surgical spill); IC2 (capsule ruptured before surgery or tumor on ovarian or fallopian tube surface); and IC3 (malignant cells in the ascites or peritoneal washings). The updated staging includes a revision of Stage IIIC based on spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes alone without intraperitoneal dissemination. This category is now subdivided into IIIA1(i) (metastasis <= 10 mm in greatest dimension), and IIIA1(ii) (metastasis >10 mm in greatest dimension). Stage IIIA2 is now "microscopic extrapelvic peritoneal involvement with or without positive retroperitoneal lymph node" metastasis. This review summarizes the genetics, surgical management, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies for epithelial cancers, and the treatment of ovarian germ cell and stromal malignancies.

AB  - Background: Although safe practice guidelines were issued by the Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society of India (OSSI) in the end of May 2020, surgeons have been in a dilemma about risk of subjecting patients to hospitalisation and bariatric surgery. This survey was conducted with the objective to evaluate the risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection in peri- and post-operative period after bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS). Methods: A survey with OSSI members was conducted from 20 July 2020 to 31 August 2020 in accordance with EQUATOR guidelines. Google Form was circulated to all surgeon members through E-mail and WhatsAppTM. In the second phase, clinical details were captured from surgeons who reported positive cases. Results: One thousand three hundred and seven BMS were reported from 1 January 2020 to 15 July 2020. Seventy-eight per cent were performed prior to 31 March 2020 and 276 were performed after 1 April 2020. Of these, 13 (0.99%) patients were reported positive for COVID-19 in the post-operative period. All suffered from a mild disease and there was no mortality. Eighty-seven positive cases were reported from patients who underwent BMS prior to 31 December 2019. Of these, 82.7% of patients had mild disease, 13.7% of patients had moderate symptoms and four patients succumbed to COVID-19. Conclusion: BMS may be considered as a safe treatment option for patients suffering from clinically severe obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due care must be taken to protect patients and healthcare workers and all procedures must be conducted in line with the safe practice guidelines.

AB  - Since the publication of the 2018 FIGO Cancer Report, giant strides have been made in the global effort to reduce the burden of cervical cancer, with the World Health Organization (WHO) rolling out a global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, aiming for implementation by 2030. In over 130 countries, including low- and middle-income countries, HPV vaccination is now included in the national program. Screening has seen major advances with wider implementation of HPV testing. These interventions will take a few years to show their impact. Meanwhile, over half a million new cases are added each year. FIGO's revised staging of cervical cancer (2018) has been widely implemented and retrospective analyses of data based on the new staging have been published. Minimally invasive surgery has been shown to be disadvantageous in women with cervical cancer. This chapter discusses the management of cervical cancer based on the stage of disease, including attention to palliation and quality of life issues.

AB  - Glaucoma is a heterogeneous group of optic neuropathies and is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major subtype, prevalent mostly in east and south Asia, where occludable anterior chamber angle is considered as a primary risk factor, which in turn could be responsible for high intraocular pressure (IOP) and subsequent neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Clinically, IOP is considered as a major risk factor for glaucoma and viewed as an important endophenotype to promote the disease severity. To investigate the comprehensive genomic insights, we conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) on IOP in individuals with occludable angle (< 15 degrees), thus anatomically predisposed to PACG. After performing GWAS on IOP, we identified 25 genomewide suggestive significant loci (P < 1e(-05), n = 240) of which, six were in complete linkage disequilibrium with the ABCA4 genic region. We successfully replicated the most significant discovery, SNPs of ABCA4 (rs2065712) in a separate cohort of 89 individuals (P =1.16e(-09)). We identified multiple SNPs in ABCA4 to be associated with IOP. Also, we obtained genes harbouring significantly associated SNPs, included in relevant biological pathways that could potentially be involved in IOP variation and glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the postmortem positivity for COVID-19 among voluntary eye donors who had been certified to have died of non-COVID-19 causes. Methods: All donors who donated their corneas (from March 2021 onward) were assessed for COVID-19 positivity tested by nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Relevant screening history was taken prior to collection. Strict precautions were taken during the retrieval as per the guidelines issued by the National Program for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment and the Eye Bank Association of India, and the tissues were handled as per standard operating protocol. Results: 85 eye calls were attended during this period, of which 56 were home-based and 29 were from a hospital setting. Samples from 12 of the former group of donors were found to be positive for COVID-19 (14%). Conclusion: This study highlights the possibility of postmortem RT-PCR positivity in voluntary corneal tissue donors without a prior history of symptoms, signs, or diagnosis of illness suggestive of COVID-19. It is recommended that postmortem testing of donors should be done by RT-PCR for retrievals made during the pandemic.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related scientific publications have increased exponentially during the present pandemic but their influence on biomedical literature is not known. The characteristics of highly cited articles help us to identify important advances and their scientific impact. Objectives: In the present study, we have identified and analyzed the top 100 most highly-cited articles of COVID-19 research published in the year 2020. Methods: A cross-sectional bibliometric analysis was using the search terms "severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2," "COVID," "nCoV," "Coronavirus," and "HCoV" querying the Google Scholar database using the program "Publish or Perish." The first 100 English language articles with the maximum number of citations were identified and evaluated in detail. Results: The top 100 COVID-19 articles in 2020 had citations ranging from 1147 to 20,440. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of citations was 1970 (1456-2939). The number of authors ranged from 1 to 79 (median 10; IQR 5.25-19). The majority of first authors was from China (58%), followed by the United States of America (16%) and the United Kingdom (7%). The top three journals in terms of the number of published articles (37%) were the New England Journal of Medicine. Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet. Most of the top-cited COVID-19 literature were descriptive studies focusing on epidemiology (48%) and clinical course (60%) of COVID-19. Conclusion: Clinical course and epidemiology have been the predominant areas of research interest in COVID-19 in 2020. Citation analysis of COVID-19 literature helps us to map out the most important focus for research in this pandemic and to identify gaps in knowledge which would guide further research.

AB  - Introduction: In patients with cirrhosis, highly prevalent vitamin D deficiency and low bone mineral density (BMD) increase the burden of disease, and role of vitamin D supplementation is not clear. So, our aim was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D level and BMD in patients with cirrhosis. Methods: Patients with cirrhosis (18-60 years) of any etiology were enrolled. We measured serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and health-related quality of life at entry and at 1 year; however, serum calcium was measured at 3-month interval. BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine and left hip neck at entry and after 1 year. Statistical analysis was performed according to intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Of 390 screened patients with cirrhosis, 164 participants (82 in each group) were randomized. There was significant increase in 25(OH)D levels in intervention group after 1 year (33.7 [24.3-45.7] ng/mL vs 23.1 [17-28.2] ng/mL; P < 0.001) when compared with placebo. The mean difference in BMD at lumbar spine and left hip neck was not significantly changed after 1 year of intervention with vitamin D between both groups. There was no significant change in both the groups in levels of calcium, thyroid-stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, free T4, IGF-1, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and quality of life. Discussion: Supplementation with vitamin D for 1 year improves vitamin D levels but did not result in improvement in BMD at lumbar spine and left hip neck in patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - Trauma is a major cause of death and disability throughout the world. It is a leading cause of death with or without sepsis in about 50% of patients. Limited therapeutic options are available besides definitive care with a mortality benefit. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the mortality benefit of estrogen in trauma hemorrhagic shock (THS). Based on encouraging results from preclinical studies, we hypothesized that early administration of estrogen in male THS patients may reduce the inflammatory storm, prevent sepsis-associated problems, and subsequently reduce mortality. The authors studied the safety of early administration of estrogen as a therapeutic adjunct in the emergency department (ED) and its effects on the inflammatory storm, prevention of sepsis, and mortality during the intensive care unit stay. Forty THS patients were recruited. THS patients were divided into experimental and placebo control groups based on the estrogen administration in the ED. Serum levels of cytokines and immune cells were measured at different time points on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 in both groups of THS patients. The experimental group received intravenous estrogen (25 mg) at a single time point in the ED beside standard of care as per advanced trauma life support guidelines. Patients did not develop any major or minor adverse events and showed favorable clinical outcomes in the experimental group. The levels of T regulatory cells, monocytes, and systemic cytokines significantly reduced and showed a balanced inflammatory response in THS patients who received estrogen. In conclusion, this preliminary study showed that intravenous estrogen therapy is safe and reduced the inflammatory insult due to trauma hemorrhagic shock. It may protect THS patients from sepsis-associated complications. Future clinical trials are required to study the efficacy and mechanistic pathway.

AB  - Background: Bariatric surgery, besides causing significant weight reduction, leads to improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there is a scarcity of data on the prediction of diabetes resolution in non-Western population. Objective: To evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on T2DM and to assess the accuracy of pre-operative scoring systems in predicting remission. Study Setting: A tertiary care academic centre, India. Methodology: We used a retrospective cohort of all diabetic patients (n = 244) who underwent bariatric surgery at our centre in the past 10 years. The cohort was followed up for diabetes remission, and pre-operative scoring systems were analysed against the observed results. Results: Of 244 patients, we were able to contact 156 patients. The median period of follow-up was 38 months. The mean body mass index (BMI) of the study group decreased from 45.4 to 33.4 kg/m2 (%excess BMI loss = 61.2%). The number of patients dependent on oral anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy and on insulin decreased from 133 (85.3%) to 40 (25.6%) and from 31 (19.9%) to 7 (4.5%), respectively. Remission was analysed for 96 patients, who submitted complete biochemical investigations. The median follow-up period for this sub-cohort was 36 months. 38 (39.6%) patients were in complete remission, 15 (15.6%) patients in partial remission and 34 (38.5%) patients showed an improved glycaemic control. The three pre-operative scores, Advanced-DiaRem, DiaRem and ABCD, showed predictive accuracies of 81.1%, 75.6% and 77.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Besides leading to excess BMI loss of 61.2%, bariatric surgery also resulted in diabetes remission in 55.2% of the patients. Amongst various pre-operative scores, Advanced-DiaRem has the highest predictive accuracy for T2DM remission.

AB  - Introduction: There is limited literature on the representation of women in leading roles in neuroanesthesiology and neurocritical care academia. We aimed to determine the representation of women as first and corresponding authors in articles published in 3 dedicated journals of neuroanesthesiology and neurocritical care during last 5 years. Methods: Articles published in the Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology, Neurocritical Care, and Journal of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2020 were included in this study. The primary outcome was the proportion of women first authors, and secondary outcomes were the percentage of women corresponding authors, and representation of women as first and corresponding author by article type and country of affiliation. Results: Of the 1164 articles included in the study, 403 (34.6%) had a woman first author. Women first authorship was highest for Special Articles (5/11; 45.5%), Clinical Reports (44/113; 38.9%) and Narrative Review Articles (58/151; 38.4%) and lowest for Original Research Articles (198/597; 33.2%). Women accounted for 29.6% (344/1164) of corresponding authors across all article types. Overall, the United States and India had the highest representation of women first authors (159/403; 39.0% and 107/344; 31.0%, respectively), and India also had highest proportion of women corresponding authors (107/272; 39.3%). Conclusions: Women were underrepresented compared with men as first author of articles published in 3 dedicated neuroanesthesiology and neurocritical care journals over the last 5 years. Women had the lowest representation as authors of Original Research Articles.

AB  - Background: Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is commonly performed in oromaxillofacial surgeries. We did this meta-analysis to ascertain whether use of video laryngoscopy (VL) provided better NTI characteristics as compared to direct laryngoscopy (DL) in patients undergoing oromaxillofacial surgeries.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search to identify randomized controlled trials comparing VL with DL for NTI in adults undergoing elective oromaxillofacial surgery. The primary outcome was time to intubation. Secondary outcomes included the first attempt success, overall success, incidence of nasal bleeding, Cormack and Lehane grade, and maneuvers required.
   Results: Of the 456 studies identified following a systematic search, 10 were included. Meta-analysis showed a significantly lower time to tracheal intubation favoring VL (mean difference: -9.04, 95% CI [-12.71, -5.36], P < 0.001; I-2 = 59%). VL was also associated with a greater first attempt success (relative risk [RR]: 1.10, 95% CI [1.04, 1.16], P = 0.001). Maneuvers to facilitate intubation were less with VL (RR: 0.22, 95% CI [0.10, 0.51], P < 0.001). There was no difference in overall intubation success (RR: 1.04, 95% CI [0.98, 1.10], P = 0.17). The incidence of bleeding did not differ between the DL and VL groups (RR: 0.59, 95% CI [0.32, 1.08], P = 0.09).
   Conclusions: Evidence as per this meta-analysis suggests VL leads to a shorter time to NTI, a greater first attempt success rate, and reduced need for maneuvers when compared to DL. The present study supports use of VL as a first line device for NTI in oral-maxillofacial surgeries in experienced hands.

AB  - A viral infection involves entry and replication of viral nucleic acid in a host organism, subsequently leading to biochemical and structural alterations in the host cell. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, over-activation of the host immune system may lead to lung damage. Albeit the regeneration and fibrotic repair processes being the two protective host responses, prolonged injury may lead to excessive fibrosis, a pathological state that can result in lung collapse. In this review, we discuss regeneration and fibrosis processes in response to SARS-CoV-2 and provide our viewpoint on the triggering of alveolar regeneration in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.</p>

AB  - Purpose: To report the association of procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2) mutations with bilateral primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in monozygotic twins and with nondominant juvenile-onset primary open-angle glaucoma (JOAG). Methods: We utilized family-based whole-exome sequencing to detect disease-causing mutations in a pair of monozygotic twins with de-novo PCG and compared its existence in 50 nonfamilial cases of JOAG and 30 healthy controls. To validate the identified mutations, direct Sanger sequencing was performed. For further evaluation of gene expression in the ocular tissues, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization in zebrafish embryos. Results: We identified a novel missense mutation (c.1925A>G, p.Tyr642Cys) in the PLOD2 gene in the monozygotic twin pair with PCG and another missense mutation (c.1880G>A, p.Arg627Gln) in one JOAG patient. Both mutations identified were heterozygous. Neither the parents of the twins nor the parents of the JOAG patient harbored the mutation and it was probably a de-novo change. The zebrafish in situ hybridization revealed expression of the PLOD2 gene during embryogenesis of the eye. Conclusion: We observed an association of PLOD2 mutations with PCG and with nonfamilial JOAG. This new gene needs to be further investigated for its role in pathways associated with glaucoma pathogenesis.

AB  - Background The sustainable development goals (SDGs) aim to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Understanding the current state of the HIV epidemic and its change over time is essential to this effort. This study assesses the current sex-specific HIV burden in 204 countries and territories and measures progress in the control of the epidemic.
   Methods To estimate age-specific and sex-specific trends in 48 of 204 countries, we extended the Estimation and Projection Package Age-Sex Model to also implement the spectrum paediatric model. We used this model in cases where age and sex specific HIV-seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care-clinic sentinel surveillance data were available. For the remaining 156 of 204 locations, we developed a cohort-incidence bias adjustment to derive incidence as a function of cause-of-death data from vital registration systems. The incidence was input to a custom Spectrum model. To assess progress, we measured the percentage change in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 (threshold >75% decline), the ratio of incident cases to number of people living with HIV (incidence-to-prevalence ratio threshold <0.03), and the ratio of incident cases to deaths (incidence-to-mortality ratio threshold <1.0).
   Findings In 2019, there were 36.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 35.1-38.9) people living with HIV worldwide. There were 0.84 males (95% UI 0.78-0.91) per female living with HIV in 2019, 0.99 male infections (0.91-1.10) for every female infection, and 1.02 male deaths (0.95-1.10) per female death. Global progress in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 was driven by sub-Saharan Africa (with a 28.52% decrease in incident cases, 95% UI 19.58-35.43, and a 39.66% decrease in deaths, 36.49-42.36). Elsewhere, the incidence remained stable or increased, whereas deaths generally decreased. In 2019, the global incidence-to-prevalence ratio was 0.05 (95% UI 0.05-0.06) and the global incidence-to-mortality ratio was 1.94 (1.76-2.12). No regions met suggested thresholds for progress.
   Interpretation Sub-Saharan Africa had both the highest HIV burden and the greatest progress between 1990 and 2019. The number of incident cases and deaths in males and females approached parity in 2019, although there remained more females with HIV than males with HIV. Globally, the HIV epidemic is far from the UNAIDS benchmarks on progress metrics. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This study is a retrospective analysis of patients with cervical ganglioneuromas highlighting the clinical course, radiological features, and histopathological characteristics.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients with cervical ganglioneuroma who were managed in a tertiary care center between January 2018 and December 2019 was performed. Data on their demographic profile, clinical presentation, management, and follow-up were collected. The relevant data of a representative case of cervical ganglioneuroma is described in detail along with the overall data of all the patients.
   Results: Three patients who had a diagnosis of biopsy proven ganglioneuroma from slowly progressive neck mass were included in this review. All 3 underwent complete surgical excision via transcervical approach. The tumor was seen to arise from the cervical sympathetic chain in all the cases with subsequent ipsilateral Homer's syndrome in the postoperative period. No recurrence was detected in the mean follow-up period of 14 months.
   Conclusion: Cervical ganglioneuromas are slow-growing and noninvasive neck masses with surgical excision as the treatment of choice. Postoperative risk of Homer's syndrome and lower cranial nerve weakness should be explained to the patients.

The family environment can affect the ability or willingness of individuals to make lifestyle changes. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a targeted family-based intervention for reduction of total cardiovascular risk in individuals with a family history of premature coronary heart disease.
   Methods We did an open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial (PROLIFIC) in the families (first-degree relatives and spouses, older than age 18 years) of individuals with coronary heart disease who had been diagnosed before age 55 years. Patients with coronary heart disease diagnosed within the past year were selected from a tertiary care speciality hospital that provides care for patients from Kerala, India. Family members of selected patients who were bedridden or terminally ill, and individuals with a history of established cardiovascular heart disease and stroke were excluded, as were families with fewer than two eligible family members. Simple randomisation with computergenerated random numbers was used to randomly assign families to intervention and usual care groups (1:1). Participants in the intervention group received a comprehensive package of interventions facilitated by non-physician health workers, consisting of: screening for cardiovascular risk factors; structured lifestyle interventions; linkage to a primary health-care facility for individuals with established chronic disease risk factors or conditions; and active follow-up for adherence. The usual care group received one-time counselling and annual screening for risk factors. We obtained data on lifestyle, clinical, and biochemical characteristics at baseline and annually during the 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome was achievement or maintenance of any three of the following: blood pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg, fasting plasma glucose lower than 110 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lower than 100 mg/dL, and abstinence from tobacco. The primary outcome was analysed in all participants available for followup at the relevant timepoint.
   Findings From Jan 1, 2015, to April 30, 2017, 980 patients with coronary heart disease were assessed for eligibility and 230 were excluded primarily due to lack of evidence of coronary artery disease (n=199), or a diagnosis of coronary heart disease more than 1 year previously (n=29). Of the 750 remaining families, 368 (with 825 participants) were assigned to the intervention group and 382 (with 846 participants) were assigned to the usual care group. At the 2-year follow-up, data from 803 (97%) of 825 participants in the intervention group and 819 (97%) of 846 participants in the usual care group were available. Of the 1671 participants, 1111 (66.5%) were women, and 560 (33.5%) were men. The mean age of the study population was 40.8 years (SD 14.2). At the 2-year follow-up, the primary outcome was achieved by 514 (64%) of 803 participants in the intervention group and 379 (46%) of 819 in the usual care group. After adjustment for clustering and baseline risk factors, the odds of achieving the primary outcome at the 2-year timepoint was two times higher in the intervention group than in the usual care group (odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.7; p<0.0001).
   Interpretation The reduction of total cardiovascular risk observed after the intervention could have a substantial public health impact by preventing future cardiovascular events. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in triggering abnormal osteoclastogenesis leading to articular destruction. Recent studies have demonstrated enhanced levels of interleukin-9 (IL-9) in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA. In RA, strong correlation has been observed between tissue inflammation and IL-9 expression in synovial tissue. Therefore, we investigated whether IL-9 influences osteoclastogenesis in patients with RA. We conducted the study in active RA patients. For inducing osteoclast differentiation, mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (sRANKL) and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in the presence or absence of recombinant (r) IL-9. IL-9 stimulation significantly enhanced M-CSF/sRANKL-mediated osteoclast formation and function. Transcriptome analysis revealed differential gene expression induced with IL-9 stimulation in the process of osteoclast differentiation. IL-9 mainly modulates the expression of genes, which are involved in the metabolic pathway. Moreover, we observed that IL-9 modulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are critical players in bone degradation. Our results indicate that IL-9 has the potential to influence the structural damage in the RA by promoting osteoclastogenesis and modulating the expression of MMPs. Thus, blocking IL-9 pathways might be an attractive immunotherapeutic target for preventing bone degradation in RA.</p>

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a serious concern and has negatively impacted public health and the economy. It primarily targets the lungs, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, it may also lead to multiple organ failure (MOF) and enhanced mortality rates. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop potential effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from various types of cells that participate in intercellular communication to maintain physiological and pathological processes. EVs derived from various cellular origins have revealed suppressive effects on the cytokine storm during systemic hyper-inflammatory states of severe COVID-19, leading to enhanced alveolar fluid clearance, promoted epithelial and endothelial recovery, and cell proliferation. Being the smallest subclass of EVs, exosomes offer striking characteristics such as cell targeting, being nano-carriers for drug delivery, high biocompatibility, safety, and low-immunogenicity, thus rendering them a potential cell-free therapeutic candidate against the pathogeneses of various diseases. Due to these properties, numerous studies and clinical trials have been performed to assess their safety and therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. Hence, in this review, we have comprehensively described current updates on progress and challenges for EVs as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of COVID-19.</p>

AB  - Purpose We describe here a multicentric community-dwelling cohort of older adults (>60 years of age) established to estimate incidence, study risk factors, healthcare utilisation and economic burden associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in India. Participants The four sites of this cohort are in northern (Ballabgarh), southern (Chennai), eastern (Kolkata) and western (Pune) parts of India. We enrolled 5336 participants across 4220 households and began surveillance in July 2018 for viral respiratory infections with additional participants enrolled annually. Trained field workers collected data about individual-level and household-level risk factors at enrolment and quarterly assessed frailty and grip strength. Trained nurses surveilled weekly to identify acute respiratory infections (ARI) and clinically assessed individuals to diagnose acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) as per protocol. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs are collected from all ALRI cases and one-fifth of the other ARI cases for laboratory testing. Cost data of the episode are collected using the WHO approach for estimating the economic burden of seasonal influenza. Handheld tablets with Open Data Kit platform were used for data collection. Findings to date The attrition of 352 participants due to migration and deaths was offset by enrolling 680 new entrants in the second year. All four sites reported negligible influenza vaccination uptake (0.1%-0.4%), low health insurance coverage (0.4%-22%) and high tobacco use (19%-52%). Ballabgarh had the highest proportion (54.4%) of households in the richest wealth quintile, but reported high solid fuel use (92%). Frailty levels were highest in Kolkata (11.3%) and lowest in Pune (6.8%). The Chennai cohort had highest self-reported morbidity (90.1%). Future plans The findings of this cohort will be used to inform prioritisation of strategies for influenza and RSV control for older adults in India. We also plan to conduct epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 using this platform.

AB  - Purpose:To assess the retinal features in eyes with postoperative metamorphopsia (POM) following rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair using multimodal imaging (MMI). Methods:In this cross-sectional; case-control study, patients after successful RRD repair following 25-gauge vitrectomy, clear vitreous cavity, and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA)>20/200 were categorized using Amsler chart: cases with POM and controls without POM. MMI was performed on swept-source platform (Triton, Topcon Inc) and the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope system (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg). The measures assessed were CDVA, morphological features on optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence, and multicolor imaging (MCI). Results:Thirty-nine eyes were included in each group. Cases had greater number of eyes with total RRD (P = 0.029) preoperatively; abnormal foveal contour (P = 0.036), ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption (P < 0.001) and poorer postoperative CDVA (P = 0.046) as compared to controls. Outer retinal folds and retinal shift (unintentional translocation of retina after reattachment surgery for RRD) did not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.48 and 0.35, respectively). On MCI, the distribution of detected ERM was similar between the groups (P = 0.25). Postoperative CDVA was significantly worse in eyes with POM. Conclusion:POM is affected by extent of RRD, postoperative foveal contour, and EZ status but not by retinal shift.

AB  - When public health programs with single nutrients are perceived to have a poor impact on the target health outcome, the policy response can be to supply more. by layering additional mandatory programs upon the extant programs. However, we argue for extreme caution, because nutrients (like medicines) are beneficial in the right dose, but potentially harmful when ingested in excess. Unnecessary motivations for the reactionary layering of multiple intervention programs emerge from incorrect measurements of the risk of nutrient inadequacy in the population. or incorrect biomarker cutoffs to evaluate the extent of nutrient deficiencies. The financial and social costs of additional layered programs are not trivial when traded off with other vital programs in a resource-poor economy, and when public health ethical dilemmas of autonomy, equity, and stigma are not addressed. An example of this conundrum in India is the perception of stagnancy in the response of the prevalence of anemia to the ongoing pharmacological iron supplementation program. The reaction has been a policy proposal to further increase iron intake through mandatory iron fortification of the rice provided in supplementary feeding programs like the Integrated Child Development Services and the School Mid-Day Meal. This is in addition to the ongoing pharmacological iron supplementation as well as other voluntary iron fortifications, such as those of salt and manufactured food products. However, before supplying more, it is vital to consider why the existing program is apparently not working, along with consideration of the potential for excess intake and related harms. This is relevant globally, particularly for countries contemplating multiple interventions to address micronutrient deficiencies. Supplying more by layering multiple nutrient interventions, instead of doing it right, without thoughtful considerations of social, biological, and ethics frameworks could be counterproductive. The cure, then, might well become the malady.

AB  - Objective To determine the incidence and risk factors of preterm white matter injury [WMI; periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) and/or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)]. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level-3 neonatal intensive care unit. Patients Inborn preterm neonates (n=140) delivered at Methods Serial cranial ultrasounds were performed at postnatal ages of 3 days (+/- 12 hour), 7 (+/- 1) days, 21 (+/- 3) days and 40 (+/- 1) weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). PIVH and PVL were graded as per Volpe and De-Vries criteria, respectively. Univariate followed by multivariate analysis was done to evaluate risk factors for PIVH and PVL. Outcome measures The primary outcome was the incidence of preterm WMI. The secondary outcomes were evaluation of risk factors and natural course of WMI. Results The mean (range) gestation and birth weight of enrolled neonates were 29.7 (24-36) weeks and 1143 (440-1887) g, respectively. PIVH occurred in 25 (17.8%) neonates. PVL occurred in 34 (24.3%) neonates. None of them were grade III or IV PVL. Preterm WMI (any grade PIVH and/or PVL) occurred in 52 (37.1%) neonates. Severe PIVH (grade III) and cystic PVL occurred in 7 (5%) and 5 (3.6%) neonates, respectively. On multivariate analysis, none of the presumed risk factors were associated with PIVH. However, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, and apnea of prematurity were significantly associated with increased risk of PVL. Conclusions Significant WMI occurred only in one-third of the cohort, which is comparable to that described in literature from the developed countries.

KW  - RENAL TUMORS
AB  - Renal tumors comprise a wide spectrum of benign and malignant tumors. The important prognostic factors in renal cell carcinoma include pathological stage, tumor grade, morphological type, sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation, and tumor necrosis. Therefore, the pathologist needs to be fully aware of how to gross nephrectomy specimens to be able to accurately provide the above prognostic information while reporting adult kidney tumors. With the advent of nephron-sparing surgeries, due diligence should be exercised to assess and sample the parenchymal surgical margin. This article discusses the approach to grossing nephrectomy specimens, elaborates the significance of every step, and also sheds light on the importance of clinical and radiological information in providing a holistic approach to the diagnosis and staging of adult renal tumors.

AB  - Many methods have been described, including pullout suture technique, for arthroscopic fixation of displaced tibial eminence fracture. We are describing our technique of pullout suture, which is a modification of previously described techniques. We passed two sutures arthroscopically through anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) just above the avulsed fragment and then pulled them out through medial and lateral bone tunnel in anterior aspect of crater in tibial plateau. The third suture passed through ACL was pulled out anteriorly under the transverse intermeniscal ligament through a submeniscal route. All sutures were tied under tension to a screw post placed on the anterior tibia after reducing the avulsed bone fragment. Our technique provides good reduction and even overreduction of the fragment. It also provides good initial fixation strength to work against displacing forces even in small and comminuted bony fragment. This is helpful for achieving adequate stability of knee, complete extension of knee, early rehabilitation, and quicker recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND Studies comparing phenylephrine and norepinephrine for the treatment of postspinal hypotension in pre-eclamptic patients are limited. OBJECTIVE To compare bolus doses of phenylephrine and norepinephrine for treating hypotension in pre-eclamptic mothers undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. It was hypothesised that norepinephrine and phenylephrine use would be associated with similar neonatal outcome. DESIGN Randomised controlled study. SETTING Single centre, tertiary care, university teaching hospital, from December 2018 to March 2020. PATIENTS A total of 86 women with pre-eclampsia and a singleton pregnancy who developed postspinal hypotension during caesarean section. INTERVENTIONS Patients received intravenous phenylephrine (50 mu g) or norepinephrine (4 mu g) for treatment of hypotension, defined as a fall in baseline systolic BP by >= 20% or an absolute value MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was umbilical artery pH. Secondary outcomes included Apgar scores, the number of hypotensive episodes, vasopressor requirements, the incidence of tachycardia/bradycardia/arrhythmias/hypertension and maternal complications. RESULTS Umbilical artery pH was not different between the phenylephrine and norepinephrine groups (7.26 +/- 0.06 and 7.27 +/- 0.06, respectively; P = 0.903). The median [IQR] number of hypotensive episodes was higher in the norepinephrine than the phenylephrine group: 2 [1 to 3] vs 1 [1 to 2], respectively; P = 0.014. Apgar scores, total number of vasopressor boluses required, systolic BP trends and the incidence of maternal complications were comparable in the two groups. Heart rate (HR) values were lower in phenylephrine group (P = 0.026), and one patient in phenylephrine group and none in the norepinephrine group developed bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm), P = 1.000. CONCLUSIONS In women with pre-eclampsia undergoing caesarean section, bolus doses of phenylephrine (50 mu g) and norepinephrine (4 mu g) used to treat hypotension after spinal anaesthesia are equally effective with similar neonatal and maternal outcomes.

AB  - To revise the FIGO staging for carcinoma of the vulva using a new approach that involves analyses of prospectively collected data. The FIGO Committee for Gynecologic Oncology reviewed the recent literature to gain an insight into the impact of the 2009 vulvar cancer staging revision. The Committee resolved to revise the staging with a goal of simplification and actively collaborated with the United States National Cancer Database to analyze prospectively collected data on carcinoma of the vulva. Many tumor characteristics were collected for all stages of vulvar cancer treated between 2010 and 2017. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS software. Overall survival was estimated based on tumor characteristics. Log-rank and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze overall survival similarities between and within groups of tumor characteristics. Characteristics with similar survivals were then grouped into the same stages and substages. Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves were generated for the resulting stages and substages. There were 12 063 cases with available data. The resulting new staging for carcinoma of the vulva has two substages in Stage I, no substage in Stage II, three substages in Stage III, and two substages in Stage IV. The Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves showed clear separation between stages and substages. The 2021 vulvar cancer staging is the first from the FIGO Committee for Gynecologic Oncology to be derived from data analyses. This revision has a new definition for depth of invasion, uses the same definition for lymph node metastases utilized in cervical cancer, and allows findings from cross-sectional imaging to be incorporated into vulvar cancer staging. The 2021 FIGO staging for carcinoma of the vulva is data-derived, validated, and much simpler than earlier revisions.

AB  - ADP ribosylation factor like protein 15 (ARL15) was identified as a novel susceptibility gene for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on a genomewide association study in a north Indian cohort. Mechanism of its action and functional relevance in RA biology remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to establish (i) ARL15 protein level in sera samples of RA patients; and (ii) its correlation, if any, with the RA associated ARL15 intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs255758 (A>C). DNA, RNA and sera were isolated from blood samples of 117 RA patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls recruited at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi with institutional ethical committee clearance. SNP rs255758 (A>C) was genotyped by Sanger sequencing; ARL15 RNA and protein levels were estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively; and genotype-phenotype correlation established using Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. Very low level of ARL15 expression in human blood was confirmed at both RNA and protein levels. Genotype-wise distribution showed increased levels (P=0.05) of ARL15 protein in RA patients with the homozygous variant (CC) as compared to AA+AC genotypes of rs255758. This first-ever correlation between higher ARL15 protein levels and the intronic susceptibility genotype (CC; rs255758) in RA patients may be of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance encouraging additional investigations.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Very few large scale multicentric stroke clinical trials have been done in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research funded INSTRuCT (Indian Stroke Clinical Trial Network) as a task force project with the objectives to establish a state-of-the-art stroke clinical trial network and to conduct pharmacological and nonpharmacological stroke clinical trials relevant to the nation and globally. The purpose of the article is to enumerate the structure of multicentric stroke network, with emphasis on its scope, challenges and expectations in India.
   METHODS: Multiple expert group meetings were conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research to understand the scope of network to perform stroke clinical trials in the country. Established stroke centers with annual volume of 200 patients with stroke with prior experience of conducting clinical trials were included. Central coordinating center, standard operating procedures, data and safety monitoring board were formed.
   DISCUSSION: In first phase, 2 trials were initiated namely, SPRINT (Secondary Prevention by Structured Semi-Interactive Stroke Prevention Package in India) and Ayurveda treatment in the rehabilitation of patients with ischemic stroke in India (RESTORE [Rehabilitation of Ischemic stroke Patients in India: A Randomized controlled trial]). In second phase, 4 trials have been approved. SPRINT trial was the first to be initiated. SPRINT trial randomized first patient on April 28, 2018; recruited 3048 patients with an average of 128.5 per month so far. The first follow-up was completed on May 27, 2019.

AB  - Objectives Abdominal pain is the primary symptom of chronic pancreatitis (CP), but pain is difficult to assess, and objective methods for pain assessment are lacking. The characterization of the sensory component of pain as a surrogate for nociception can be achieved by sensory testing using standardized stimuli. Herein, we describe the rationale for and development of an international consortium to better understand and characterize CP pain. Methods A collaboration was initially formed between the University of Aalborg, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Pittsburgh. This group refined the protocol for pancreatic quantitative sensory testing (P-QST) and then expanded the collaboration with plans for incorporating P-QST into prospective studies. Results The collaboration has successfully developed a P-QST nomogram. Chronic pancreatitis patients identified with P-QST as having widespread hyperalgesia had higher pain intensity scores, higher prevalence of constant pain, and decreased quality of life. Psychiatric comorbidities were independent of pain phenotypes. Multiple studies are underway to validate these findings and evaluate their utility in clinical trials. Conclusions Development of the P-QST Consortium will facilitate collaborative efforts to use P-QST as a means for evaluation and characterization of pain in CP patients, and optimize methods to guide individualized pain management approaches.

AB  - Background: Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LHR) in children has been widely performed in the last decades, although it is still not sufficiently researched in preterm infants. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the recurrence and complication rates following laparoscopic hernia repair among preterm (PT) versus full-term (FT) newborns. Methods: Scientific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases) were systematically searched for relevant articles. The following terms were used: (laparoscopic hernia repair) AND (preterm). The inclusion criteria were all preterm newborns with a unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia who underwent LHR. The main outcomes were the incidence of recurrence of hernia and the proportion of children developing postoperative complications in comparison with FT newborns following LHR. Results: The present meta-analysis included four comparative studies. Three studies had a retrospective study design while one was a prospective study. A total of 1702 children were included (PT n = 523, FT n = 1179). The incidence of hernia recurrence showed no significant difference between the PT versus FT groups (RR = 2.58, 95% CI 0.89-7.47, p = 0.08). A significantly higher incidence of complications was observed in the PT group compared to the FT group (RR = 4.05, 95% CI 2.11-7.77, p < 0.0001). The PT group of newborns accounted for 81% and 72% of the major and minor complications. The major complications were either non-surgical (i.e., severe respiratory distress requiring reintubation with prolonged ventilation (or high-frequency ventilation), seizures, bradycardia), or surgical (i.e., hydroceles requiring operative intervention and umbilical port-site hernia). Conclusions: LHR in PT infants is associated with similar recurrence rates as in FT infants. However, the incidence of complications is significantly higher in PT versus FT infants.</p>

AB  - Introduction: Pathway of psychiatric care is defined as the sequence of contacts with individuals and organizations initiated by the distressed person's efforts and his significant others to seek appropriate health care. This study aimed to find the prevalence of non-psychiatric referral as first encounter among patients attending the psychiatry outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital.
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out from 29th March 2015 to 25th April 2015 in the outpatient department of the department of psychiatry of a tertiary via direct interview using the World Health Organization's encounter form. Ethical approval was taken from undergraduate medical research protocol review board (Reference number 105/071/072). Psychiatric diagnoses were made by respective consultants using the International Classification of Diseases-10 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines criteria. Data was entered in the Microsoft Excel 2007 and analyzed by Stata version 15. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and percentage for binary data.
   Results: Out of 50 patients, 26 (52%) (38.2-65.8 at 95% Confidence Interval) of new cases in the outpatient department had non-psychiatric referrals. Among them, 13 (26%) referred from faith healers, 7 (14%) from the general hospital and 6 (12%) from medical out patient department.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of non-psychiatric referral for the patients seen for the first time in the psychiatry outpatient department was similar to findings from studies done in different parts of South Fast Asia.

KW  - DYSFUNCTION
AB  - Background & objectives:Working memory impairments in the subjects of opioid addiction may stem from an aberrant cortical activity in the executive areas, and may help in early identification of individuals with addictive tendencies and may also be used as a neurofeedback mechanism in adjunct to the existing therapeutics.Methods:Electrical neuroimaging via 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recording was done in 15 male subjects with opioid addiction (29.45 +/- 5.6 yr) during the performance of Sternberg Working Memory Task. EEG data were acquired and analyzed for cortical sources during task as compared to resting (baseline) condition.Results:Working memory deficits were manifested as decrease in accuracy percentage in the subjects with opioid addiction, while no significant difference was seen in reaction time, on comparison with laboratory-acquired matched controls. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)-based EEG source analysis revealed higher cortical activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior, middle and superior temporal gyri, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule and precuneus, whereas significant lower activity was seen in superior and middle frontal gyri, parietal lobule, cingulate cortex and pre- and postcentral gyri when the task was compared to baseline in the subjects with opioid addiction. Further, a negative correlation was seen between the accuracy of task performance and activation ratio for the significant gyri in the subjects with opioid addiction.Interpretation & conclusions:EEG cortical sources revealed the failure of deactivation of default-mode network (DMN) during the task amongst the subjects with opioid addiction. In addition, there was a decrease in the executive function areas in the subjects with opioid addiction. This lack of sufficiently active executive network and persistence of DMN during the task (as compared to baseline) may potentially form the basis of functional impairments in the subjects with opioid addiction.

AB  - As prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression is universal in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, it is commonly used for specifically differentiating recurrences from surgical site reparative tissues. Postoperative contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a residual disease in the left pterygoid base, but there was no PET/CT uptake with Ga-68-labeled PSMA at the same site. In retrospect, in comparison with preoperative PET/CT, it was found that the pterygoid base pneumatization was showing enhancement in contrast-enhanced MRI and not in functional PSMA. Postoperative Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT is a useful clinical tool in ambivalent diagnostic conditions avoiding morbidities.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the outcomes of water-soluble intrastromal natamycin (IS-NTM) as an adjunct therapy for recalcitrant fungal keratitis. Methods: This was a prospective interventional pilot study in the setting of a tertiary eye-care center. Twenty eyes of 20 consecutive patients with microbiologically proven recalcitrant fungal keratitis (ulcer size >2 mm, depth >50%, and not responding to topical NTM for 2 weeks) were recruited. The selected patients were injected with a novel composition of IS-NTM (10 ug/0.1 mL, soluble natamycin) prepared aseptically in the ocular pharmacology department. All the patients continued using topical NTM suspension 5% 4-hourly until the ulcer healed. Repeat injections were undertaken after 72 h depending on the clinical response and all the patients were followed till 6 months. Results: The mean age of the patients was 40.42 +/- 10.09 years. The mean duration of the presentation was 20.8 +/- 5.1 days. The most commonly isolated organisms were Aspergillus sp. (12/20, 60%) and Fusarium sp. (8/20, 40%). No patient had iatrogenic perforation or precipitate formation after IS-NTM injection. The overall cure rate with IS-NTM was 95% (19/20 patients). The number of patients who healed with the 1(st), 2(nd), and 3rd injection was 13, 5, and 1, respectively. One (5%) had no response to treatment and was subjected to penetrating keratoplasty. The average time taken for the resolution of the epithelial defect, stromal infiltrates, and hypopyon was 34 +/- 5.2 days, 35.3 +/- 6.4 days, and 15 +/- 2.5 days. Healing with deep vascularization and cataract was noted in 6/19 eyes (31%) and 13/19 eyes (68.42%), respectively. Conclusion: Intrastromal injection of a novel formulation of NTM holds a promising role as adjunctive therapy to topical NTM in the management of recalcitrant filamentous fungal keratitis. The preliminary results are encouraging and further studies are required to validate the results.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 harbors many known unknown regions in the form of hypothetical open reading frames (ORFs). Although the mechanisms underlying the disease pathogenesis are not clearly understood, molecules such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key regulatory role in the viral pathogenesis from endocytosis. We asked whether or not the lncRNAs in the host are associated with the viral proteins and argue that lncRNA-mRNAs molecules related to viral infection may regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Toward the end of the perspective, we provide challenges and insights into investigating these transgression pathways.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate long-term perimetric stabilization at set Target (IOPs) in primary angle-closure glaucoma with visual field defects. Methods: Two hundred forty-eight eyes, of 124 primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) patients on medical treatment, and 124 eyes, of 95 patients after trabeculectomy performed at least 5 years prior were evaluated. One hundred eighty-five eyes had a follow-up of >= 10 years. Target IOPs for mild, moderate, and severe glaucomatous optic neuropathy were set at <= 18, <= 15, and <= 12 mmHg, respectively. Progression was evaluated by event-based changes on guided progression analysis. Primary outcome measure was therapy required to achieve individualized Target IOP. Secondary outcome measure was assessment of perimetric change over time. Results: Mean baseline IOP was 23.34 +/- 6.16 mmHg in medically treated and 36.08 +/- 9.73 mmHg in surgically treated eyes (P = 0.0001). All eyes with a baseline IOP of <25 mmHg were on medications alone, 65.33%, of those with a baseline IOP of 25-30 mmHg were on medications, while 34.67% required trabeculectomy. In total, 91.4% of eyes with a baseline IOP of >30 mmHg underwent a trabeculectomy for achieving Target IOP. Perimetric stabilization was achieved in 98.17% of PACG eyes. "Target" IOP was achieved for mild, moderate, and severe glaucomatous optic neuropathy, medically in 90.2, 73.9, and 29.7%, and surgery was required in 9.8, 26.1, and 70.3%, respectively. Overall analysis found that percentage reduction in IOP was significantly more after trabeculectomy than medical treatment, 64.16 +/- 14.91 and 43.61 +/- 13.73%, P = 0.0001. Decrease in IOP was significantly greater 5-9 years after trabeculectomy, in comparison to >= 10 years, P = 0.001. Conclusion: Medications controlled IOP to "Target" in PACG eyes with mild and moderate glaucoma for over >= 10 years, when the baseline IOP off treatment was <30 mmHg. Trabeculectomy was necessary in PACG eyes having severe glaucomatous optic neuropathy, or with a baseline IOP of >30 mmHg to achieve Target IOP. These appropriate initial therapeutic interventions and Target IOPs are therefore suggested as a clinically validated algorithm of care for different severities of PACG.

AB  - Objectives: To study the presence of biofilms in patients of chronic otitis media (COM)-active squamosal disease and to evaluate the microflora and clinical impact of biofilms. Methods: A total of 35 patients suffering from COM - active squamosal disease was studied. Cholesteatoma sample was collected at the time of mastoid surgery and the same was used to image for biofilms by scanning electron microscope. The said sample was also analyzed microbiologically. Results: Biofilms were present in 25 (72%) patients including 6 cases of fungal biofilms (24%). Biofilms were detected irrespective of the micro-organism growth. No statistically significant relationship was observed between biofilms and discharging ear and complications of COM. Though univariate analysis of our data found some correlation between duration of disease, the extent of cholesteatoma and ossicular necrosis but multivariate analysis revealed no such associations, thereby implying a doubtful association between these factors and biofilm. Conclusions: Biofilms are an integral part of cholesteatoma ear disease and sometimes harbors fungal isolates.

AB  - Background & objectives:To eliminate tuberculosis (TB), the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) has given an algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of TB in children. This study was carried out to assess the prevailing practices to identify TB in severely malnourished children admitted to various nutrition rehabilitation centres (NRCs).Methods:A retrospective chart review of 41 NRCs across five States having a maximum number of NRCs was carried out. Details of children admitted to the NRCs and the investigations carried out in the form of obtaining X-ray film, tuberculin skin test (TST) and gastric aspirate for cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) for diagnosis of TB over three months were collected.Results:A total of 2121 children with severe acute malnourished (SAM) across 41 NRCs (Bhopal, Jodhpur, Patna, Kolkata, Lucknow and Ratlam) were evaluated. X-ray of the chest was done in 473 (22%), TST was done in 135 (6%) and gastric aspirate was collected in 56 (3%) children. CBNAAT was done in only 56 SAM children. Ten children among those screened were confirmed to have pulmonary TB and were linked to treatment as per the National TB guidelines.Interpretation & conclusions:Although NTEP suggests universal screening of all malnourished children admitted in the NRCs, but the prevailing practices indicate that the NRCs are grossly under-utilizing molecular diagnostic tests for diagnosis of TB. There is a gap between prevailing practices and suggested guidelines for the identification of TB in children admitted in the NRCs.

AB  - The current work explored the inhibitory effect of selected homeopathic drugs, in experimental models of inflammation and CFA-induced arthritis. Twelve groups of animals were made, each containing 6 animals. The selected homeopathic drugs (causticum, calcarea, medorrhinum, mercurius, formica, proteus, silica, sulphur, thuja), placebo and standard drug, Indomethacin. In CFA model, treatment groups and the reference drug were administered daily for a period of 21 days. Dysfunction in joints was evaluated by parameters such as joint diameter, expression of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6). Findings of the study revealed that on CFA administration, there is a significant (p<0.01) increase in joint diameter in all the tested animals. On day 3, we found highest increase in the joint diameter in all treatment groups. Medorrhinum, silica, sulphur showed significant (p<0.01) decrease in joint diameter on day 21. Significant (p<0.05) reduction in paw edema was observed at 5 h post carrageenan administration. IHC of NF-kappa B in CFA treated group revealed presence of vacuoles, infiltration of inflammatory cells. However, prominent reversal of joint damage was seen in homeopathic drugs (medorrhinum, silica, sulphur) and indomethacin. Study inferred that the homeopathic drugs (medorrhinum, silica, sulphur) and indomethacin were found to be potent in ameliorating inflammation.

AB  - Endometrial stromal sarcoma with sex cord differentiation is a very unusual neoplasm affecting the uterine cavity with an incidence of only 0.25%. They can cause difficulties in diagnosis due to it is histologic appearance and rarity of occurrence. Histopathological diagnosis still remains the cornerstone of diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry and molecular studies are also very helpful. We report a case of a 47-year-old patient who was diagnosed clinically and radiologically as intramural leiomyoma, but on histopathology examination and immunohistochemically proved to be endometrial stromal sarcoma with sex cord differentiation.

AB  - Ga-68-NOTA Glu-Urea-Lys (NGUL) is a novel prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting tracer used for PET/CT imaging. This study aimed to compare performance in the detection of primary and metastatic lesions and to compare biodistribution between Ga-68-NGUL and Ga-68-PSMA-11 in the same patients with prostate cancer. Methods: Eleven patients with metastatic prostate cancer were prospectively recruited. The quantitative tracer uptake was determined in normal organs and in primary and metastatic lesions. Results: Ga-68-NGUL showed significantly lower normal-organ uptake and rapid urinary clearance. The number and sites of detected PSMA-positive primary and metastatic lesions were identical, and no significant quantitative uptake difference was observed. Ga-68-NGUL showed a relatively lower tumor-to-background ratio than Ga-68-PSMA-11. Conclusion: In a head-to-head comparison with Ga-68-PSMA-11, Ga-68-NGUL showed lower uptake in normal organs and similar performance in detecting PSMA-avid primary and metastatic lesions. Ga-68-NGUL could be a valuable option for PSMA imaging.

AB  - Background Algorithms for predicting retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) requiring treatment need to be validated in Indian settings to determine if the burden of screening can be reduced without compromising the sensitivity of existing gestation and weight-based cut offs. Objective To evaluate the performance of the available algorithms namely, WINROP (Weight, Insulin-like growth factor I, Neonatal ROP), CHOP-ROP (children's Hospital of Philadelphia ROP) and ROPScore in predicting type 1 ROP and time from alarm to treatment by each algorithm. Study design Ambispective observational. Setting Tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit in India. Participants Neonates less than 32 weeks or less than 1500 g born between July, 2013 to June, 2019 (N=578), who underwent ROP screening. Primary outcome Sensitivity, specificity and time from alarm to treatment by each algorithm. Results The sensitivity and specificity of WINROP was 85% and 36%, for CHOP-ROP it was 54% and 71%, and for ROPScore it was 73% and 67%, respectively in detecting type 1 ROP. A total of 50/51 (98%) of neonates with type 1 ROP underwent treatment at median gestation of 9 weeks and median time from alarm to treatment by WINROP, CHOP-ROP and ROPScore was 7, 7 and 3 weeks, respectively. Conclusion WINROP, CHOP-ROP and ROPScore were not sensitive enough to replace the gestational age, weight and risk factor-based screening criteria for type 1 ROP.

AB  - Endothelial keratoplasty (EK) with pseudophakia often presents with late-onset proliferative after-cataract with posterior capsule distension. We performed a modified technique of capsular bag lavage in 11 eyes with late-onset PCO after EK (4 cases: post-DSAEK, 7 cases: post-DMEK). Anterior capsular rim was separated from the underlying IOL optic using MVR blade. Circumferential relaxing radial nicks were made on the capsular rim to create space for the passage of irrigation-aspiration (IA) probes behind the IOL. Bimanual IA of the flocculent cortical material was performed without damaging the posterior capsule. Air was injected at end of surgery to ensure graft apposition. All cases gained 1-3 lines of Snellen's acuity and no case developed graft failure, rejection, or endothelial decompensation. An intact posterior capsule is associated with better outcomes post a repeat graft, if required. Our technique helps avoid complications related to a disturbed anterior hyaloid phase and minimizes postoperative inflammation.

AB  - The oro-facial morphology is greatly affected in neonates with a cleft lip and palate. The initial evaluation of neonate's body and maxillary arch dimensions is important for treatment planning and predicting growth in cleft patients. The objective of this study was comparative evaluation of the anthropometric and physiologic parameters of cleft and non-cleft neonates in a hospital-based set up. This cross sectional study was conducted on 88 cleft and non-cleft neonates (n = 44 in each group) aged between 0 and 30 days after obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee and positive written informed consent from their parents. Neonates' body weight, body length, head length, head circumference, and maxillary arch dimensions were measured. Maxillary arch dimensions were measured on dental casts with digital sliding calipers. Statistical analyses performed using the independent t-test and one-way ANOVA analysis were followed by Bonferroni correction for post-hoc comparison. The results showed statistically significant differences in birth weight (p < 0.0001), head length (p < 0.01), head circumference (p < 0.007), and maxillary arch dimensions (p < 0.0001) between cleft and non-cleft neonates. These findings suggest that cleft neonates had significant anthropometric and physiologic variations than non-cleft neonates.</p>

AB  - Background & objectives:Uncorrected refractive error and cataract are the two most common causes of impairment of vision among elderly persons, and both are treatable. Treatment-seeking in patients is driven by symptom (decreased vision) rather than any anatomical or physiological measurement. The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment-seeking behavior and barriers to treatment-seeking among elderly persons with impairment of vision in an urban resettlement colony of New Delhi, India.Methods:This community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among 604 persons aged >= 60 yr selected by the simple random sampling. House-to-house visit was done, and a self-developed pretested semi-structured interview schedule was used to collect socio-demographic information, treatment-seeking behaviour and barriers to treatment-seeking.Results:Majority of participants reported impairment of vision (84%); 16.5 per cent of them did not visit any healthcare facility for their vision problem. Lack of felt need (48.1%) was the most common barrier to visiting healthcare facility. Of the 401 participants who gave a history of being prescribed spectacles, 277 (69%) used spectacles. Discomfort, lack of improvement in vision and lack of felt need were the most common reasons cited for non-usage. Among 300 participants who gave a history of cataract, 61 (20.3%) had not undergone cataract surgery. Lack of felt need was the most common barrier to cataract surgery.Interpretation & conclusions:A substantial proportion of elderly persons in the urban community have impairment of vision. Lack of felt need was the main reason for not visiting healthcare facility. As quality of spectacles was an important reported deterrent to use of spectacles, provision of appropriate refraction services and low-cost, good quality spectacles would be important.

AB  - Background Accurate insertion depth of endotracheal tube (ETT) in children has been predicted using the demographic variables, such as age, weight, and height. Middle finger length showed good correlation with ETT depth measurement in children aged 4-14 years. Aims The primary objective was to correlate the actual ETT insertion depth with the depth derived from middle finger length, age, weight, and height formulae in children aged 1-4 years. The secondary objective was to find the most accurate formula for prediction of ETT insertion depth. Methods This prospective parallel group study was done in 50 american society of anesthesiologists 1 or 2 children aged 1-4 years undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. Children with difficult airway, finger anomalies, or syndromic associations were excluded. Age, weight, height, and middle finger length of all children were measured. Depth of orally inserted uncuffed ETT and tracheal length was measured by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The actual ETT depth was correlated with the depth calculated from different formulae. Results The mean middle finger length was 4.42 +/- 0.50 cm, age was 2.64 +/- 1.07 years, weight was 12.28 +/- 2.84 kg, and height was 82.89 +/- 16.23 cm. The mean tracheal length was 6.42 +/- 0.96 cm. The mean depth of ETT was actual depth (12.89 +/- 1.09 cm), middle finger depth (13.23 +/- 1.53cm; p = .001; 95%CI 0.12-0.50), age-based depth 1(3.31 +/- 0.53 cm; 95%CI 0.37-1.44; p = .001), weight-based depth (14.14 +/- 1.42 cm; 95% CI 0.10-0.51; p = .004), and height-based depth (13.73 +/- 0.94 cm; 95% CI 0.15-0.77; p = .004). Middle finger length and age-based formulae showed higher number of accurate placements (58% each). Weight- (74%) and height (64%)-derived formulae gave a higher number of distal ETT placements. Conclusion Formulas based on the demographic variables and middle finger length showed good correlation with the actual ETT depth in children aged 1-4 years. The percentage of accurate ETT depth placements was higher with middle finger length and age-based formulae.

AB  - Aim: We conducted this network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of targeted pharmacotherapies and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT). Patients & methods: Nineteen studies were included and there was only one head-to-head randomized controlled trial (adalimumab vs vedolizumab). Results: All interventions, including FMT, were superior to a placebo in inducing clinical remission (except adalimumab - odds ratio 1.66; 95% CI: 0.97-2.85), clinical response and endoscopic remission. FMT was comparable with other agents in achieving all efficacy outcomes. Infliximab was ranked highest in inducing clinical remission (surface under the cumulative ranking, 0.8). There was no difference in safety outcomes between FMT and other targeted therapies. Conclusion: FMT is as efficacious and as safe as other targeted therapies in inducing clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic remission. Further studies to assess the long-term benefits are needed in order to reach a definitive conclusion.

AB  - Background: With increasing availability of data on outcomes of surgery for prostate cancer, the profile of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has changed over the past decade. This impacts the decision-making process for surgeons and patients, particularly in low-incidence regions of Asia. Our institution was among the first in Asia to acquire a da Vinci surgical robot in 2005. We evaluated the changes in the clinical and pathology profile of patients undergoing RARP at our institution over the past 15 years (2005-2019).
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing RARP between April 2005 and December 2019 was conducted from the hospital database. The patients were divided into two groups; patients undergoing RARP from April 2005 to December 2012 (Group I, first 8 years) and January 2013 to December 2019 (Group II, next 7 years). The perioperative characteristics were compared between these two groups to assess changes in their profile and outcome.
   Results: Four hundred forty-seven patients were included in this study; 244 (54.6%) in Group I and 203 (45.4%) in Group II. The median prostate specific antigen in Group II was significantly higher than that in Group I (14.5 vs. 11.7 ng/ml, P = 0.016). Unfavorable pathological characteristics, i.e., Gleason Grade >= 3, perineural invasion, and the margin positivity rate increased substantially from 18.5% to 37.5%, 20.5% to 36.9%, and 15.2% to 26.6%, respectively, in Group II compared with Group I. More patients in Group II received adjuvant therapy than in Group I (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: There has been a change in profile of patients undergoing RARP and patients with more unfavorable disease characteristics such as higher prostate specific antigen and tumor grade are undergoing surgery. In line with international trends, the number of patients with low-grade disease undergoing surgery has substantially decreased. Multimodal treatment with adjuvant therapy is increasingly used, particularly in high-risk disease. (C) 2021 Asian Pacific Prostate Society. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

KW  - WORKERS
AB  - Background
   The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the lacunae in the preparedness of healthcare systems across the globe. This preparedness also includes the safety of healthcare providers (HCPs) at various levels. Sudden spread of COVID-19 infection has created threatening and vulnerable conditions for the HCPs. The current pandemic situation has not only affected physical health of HCPs but also their mental health.
   Objective
   This study aims to understand the prevalence and severity of secondary traumatic stress, optimism parameters, along with states of mood experienced by the HCPs, viz., doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals (including Physiotherapist, Lab technicians, Phlebotomist, dieticians, administrative staff and clinical pharmacist), during the COVID-19 lockdown in India.
   Methodology
   The assessment of level of secondary traumatic stress (STS), optimism/pessimism (via Life Orientation Test-Revised) and current mood states experienced by Indian HCPs in the present COVID-19 pandemic situation was done using a primary data of 2,008 HCPs from India during the first lockdown during April-May 2020. Data was collected through snow-ball sampling technique, reaching out to various medical health care professionals through social media platforms.
   Result
   Amongst the study sample 88.2% of doctors, 79.2 of nurses and 58.6% of allied HCPs were found to have STS in varying severity. There was a female preponderance in the category of Severe STS. Higher optimism on the LOTR scale was observed among doctors at 39.3% followed by nurses at 26.7% and allied health care professionals 22.8%. The mood visual analogue scale which measures the "mood" during the survey indicated moderate mood states without any gender bias in the study sample.
   Conclusion
   The current investigation sheds light on the magnitude of the STSS experienced by the HCPs in the Indian Subcontinent during the pandemic. This hitherto undiagnosed and unaddressed issue, calls for a dire need of creating better and accessible mental health programmes and facilities for the health care providers in India.

AB  - Study design Development and validation of fracture classification system. Objective To develop and validate a Simplified Classification System (SCS) for Thoraco-Lumbar (TL) fractures (SCS - TL fractures). Setting Tertiary Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi, India Methods Based on the International Spinal Cord Society Spine Trauma Study Group (ISCoS STSG, n = 23) experts' clinical consensus conducted by the senior author and on his own experience, the Denis classification for TL fractures was modified to develop a SCS-TL fractures that could guide the management. After Face and Content validation, Construct validation was done in two stages. First stage analyzed if management of 30 cases of TL fractures, as suggested by the SCS - TL fractures and ISCoS STSG (n = 9) as well as other (n = 5) experts, matched. Second stage was a one year prospective study analyzing if the management suggested matched the management actually carried out by different spine surgeons (n = 10) working at a single institution. Results In the first stage there was 100% agreement for management (conservative or surgical) as proposed by experts and that suggested by the proposed classification for TL fractures whereas for surgical approach there was 88% agreement. In the second stage, there was 100% agreement for the management as well as surgical approach as carried out at our centre and that proposed by the SCS for TL fractures. Conclusions The proposed SCS-TL fractures helps in classifying and in decision making for management of TL fractures. The next phase of validation would involve multicentric reliability studies and prospective application of the SCS- TL fractures.

AB  - Background There is limited evidence on the role of the type of lobectomy after primary lung cancer with postoperative cerebral infarction (CI). The purpose of this review was to evaluate the role of left upper lobectomy (LUL) in pulmonary vein thrombosis (PVT) and eventual CI. Methods A search was performed on MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to January 2021. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies investigating the association between types of lobectomies for primary lung cancer with PVT and/or CI were included. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the risk of bias. A random-effect model meta-analysis was utilized if significant heterogeneity was observed. Results Twelve studies, including 5266 patients were included. The majority of studies were having a low risk of bias. LUL was associated with higher likelihood of CI (ORfixed 6.27, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.12-12.56; p < 0.00001) and PVT (ORfixed 13.46, 95% CI 5.97-30.33; p < 0.00001) as compared to other lobectomies. Sensitivity analysis showed an independent role of LUL without underlying PVT in CI (ORfixed 2.44, 95% CI 1.25-4.74; p = 0.009). Male and diabetic patients were at a higher risk, while Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) was protective from CI. Conclusion The results of this review indicate that LUL after lung cancer is an independent risk factor for developing CI without underlying PVT. In addition, the risk of CI increases significantly when PVT develops after LUL. LUL is also a risk factor for PVT. A more frequent follow-up may be beneficial in lung cancer patients after LUL, especially in those with diabetes or undergoing adjuvant systemic therapy.

AB  - Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a common pathology responsible for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Failure to precisely localize the epileptogenic zones (EZs) is a major reason for poor surgical outcome in FCD. Currently, there are no molecular or cellular biomarkers available which can aid in defining the EZs in FCD. Phospholipid alterations between healthy and malignant tumor tissues are reported and have been used for marking tumor margins. In this study, we utilize liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify altered lipids in resected brain specimens from FCD patients compared to non-epileptic controls. Based on these results, we propose that a similar approach utilizing unique lipid mass spectra can be used for defining the EZs in FCD. The observed distinct lipid mass spectra of cortical tissues from FCD patients could be used for real-time guidance during surgery as well as for ex vivo examination of resected tissues for diagnostic purposes.

AB  - Ependymoma is a relatively rare glial tumor of the central nervous system that arise from the cells lining the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord. Ependymosarcoma (ES) is a newly introduced tumor entity of uncertain prognosis characterized by a rare phenomenon of a malignant mesenchymal transition arising within an ependymoma. ESs are surgically challenging tumors for diagnosis and therapy with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Here, we report two diagnostically challenging cases of primary ES in a 25-year-old female and a 17-year-old male. Both the cases presented with progressive and sequential neurological deficits over a period of five to eight months, and histological examination revealed a biphasic gliomesenchymal architecture comprised of anaplastic ependymomatous and sarcomatous components. Molecular genetic analysis revealed the presence of type 1 C11orf95:RELA fusion transcript. To date, 22 cases of ES have been reported in the literature, and only one case harbored type 1 C11orf95:RELA fusion transcript.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of mortality worldwide, but its medical management is still limited to the use of thrombolytics as a lifesaving option. Multiple molecular deregulations of the protein kinase family occur during the period of ischemia/reperfusion. However, experimental studies have shown that alterations in the expression of essential protein kinases and their pharmacological modulation can modify the neuropathological milieu and hasten neurophysiological recovery. This review highlights the role of key protein kinase members and their implications in the evolution of stroke pathophysiology. Activation of ROCK-, MAPK-, and GSK-3 beta-mediated pathways following neuronal ischemia/reperfusion injury in experimental conditions aggravate the neuropathology and delays recovery. Targeting ROCK, MAPK, and GSK-3 beta will potentially enhance myelin regeneration, improve blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, and suppress inflammation, which ameliorates neuronal survival. Conversely, protein kinases such as PKA, Akt, PKC alpha, PKC epsilon, Trk, and PERK salvage neurons post-ischemia by mechanisms including enhanced toxin metabolism, restoring BBB integrity, neurotrophic effects, and apoptosis suppression. Certain protein kinases such as ERK1/2, JNK, and AMPK have favourable and unfavourable effects in salvaging ischemia-injured neurons. Targeting multiple protein kinase-mediated pathways simultaneously may improve neuronal recovery post-ischemia.

AB  - Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) is associated with innate immune dysfunction and high short-term mortality. Neutrophils have been identified to influence prognosis in ACLF. Neutrophil biology is under-evaluated in ACLF. Therefore, we investigated neutrophil-specific genes and their association with ACLF outcomes. This is an observational study. Enriched granulocytes, containing neutrophils, isolated from study participants in three groups- ACLF(n = 10), chronic liver disease (CLD, n = 4) and healthy controls (HC, n = 4), were analysed by microarray. Differentially expressed genes were identified and validated by qRT-PCR in an independent cohort of ACLF, CLD and HC (n = 30, 15 and 15 respectively). The association of confirmed overexpressed genes with ACLF 28-day non-survivors was investigated. The protein expression of selected neutrophil genes was confirmed using flow cytometry and IHC. Differential gene expression analysis showed 1140 downregulated and 928 upregulated genes for ACLF versus CLD and 2086 downregulated and 1091 upregulated genes for ACLF versus HC. Significant upregulation of neutrophilic inflammatory signatures were found in ACLF compared to CLD and HC. Neutrophil enriched genes ELANE, MPO and CD177 were highly upregulated in ACLF and their expression was higher in ACLF 28-day non-survivors. Elevated expression of CD177 protein on neutrophil surface in ACLF was confirmed by flow cytometry. IHC analysis in archival post mortem liver biopsies showed the presence of CD177(+) neutrophils in the liver tissue of ACLF patients. Granulocyte genes ELANE, MPO and CD177 are highly overexpressed in ACLF neutrophils as compared to CLD or HC. Further, this three-gene signature is highly overexpressed in ACLF 28-day non-survivors.

AB  - Background Hypertriglyceridemia has emerged as a critical coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factor. Rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants in apolipoprotein C-III have been reported to reduce triglycerides (TG) and are cardioprotective in American Indians and Europeans. However, there is a lack of data in other Europeans and non-Europeans. Also, whether genetically increased plasma TG due to ApoC-III is causally associated with increased CAD risk is still unclear and inconsistent. The objectives of this study were to verify the cardioprotective role of earlier reported six LoF variants of APOC3 in South Asians and other multi-ethnic cohorts and to evaluate the causal association of TG raising common variants for increasing CAD risk. Methods We performed gene-centric and Mendelian randomization analyses and evaluated the role of genetic variation encompassing APOC3 for affecting circulating TG and the risk for developing CAD. Results One rare LoF variant (rs138326449) with a 37% reduction in TG was associated with lowered risk for CAD in Europeans (p = 0.007), but we could not confirm this association in Asian Indians (p = 0.641). Our data could not validate the cardioprotective role of other five LoF variants analysed. A common variant rs5128 in the APOC3 was strongly associated with elevated TG levels showing a p-value 2.8 x 10(- 424). Measures of plasma ApoC-III in a small subset of Sikhs revealed a 37% increase in ApoC-III concentrations among homozygous mutant carriers than the wild-type carriers of rs5128. A genetically instrumented per 1SD increment of plasma TG level of 15 mg/dL would cause a mild increase (3%) in the risk for CAD (p = 0.042). Conclusions Our results highlight the challenges of inclusion of rare variant information in clinical risk assessment and the generalizability of implementation of ApoC-III inhibition for treating atherosclerotic disease. More studies would be needed to confirm whether genetically raised TG and ApoC-III concentrations would increase CAD risk.

AB  - Differences in the incidence and outcome of glioma between males and females are well known, being more striking for glioblastoma (GB) than low-grade glioma (LGG). The extensive and well-annotated data in publicly available databases enable us to analyze the molecular basis of these differences at a global level. Here, we have analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases to identify molecular indicators for these gender-based differences by different methods. Based on the nature of data available/accessible, the transcriptomic profile was studied in TCGA by using DeSeq2 and in CGGA by T-test, after correction based. Only IDH1 wild-type tumors were studied in CGGA. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), network analysis was done, followed by the assessment of modular differential connectivity. Differentially affected signaling pathways were identified. The gender-based effects of differentially expressed genes on survival were determined. DNA methylation was studied as an indicator of gender-based epigenetic differences. The results clearly showed gender-based differences in both GB and LGG, whatever method or database was used. While there were differences in the results obtained between databases and methods used, some major signaling pathways such as Wnt signaling and pathways involved in immune processes and the adaptive immune response were common to different assessments. There was also a differential gender-based influence of several genes on survival. Also, the autosomal genes NOX, FRG1BP, and AL354714.2 and X-linked genes such as PUDP, KDM6A, DDX3X, and SYAP1 had differential DNA methylation and expression profile in male and female GB, while for LGG, these included autosomal genes such as CNIH3 and ANKRD11 and X-linked genes such as KDM6A, MAOB, and EIF2S3. Some, such as FGF13 and DDX3X, have earlier been shown to have a role in tumor behavior, though their dimorphic effects in males and females have not been identified. Our study thus identifies several crucial differences between male and female glioma, which could be validated further. It also highlights that molecular studies without consideration of gender can obscure critical elements of biology and emphasizes the importance of parallel but separate analyses of male and female glioma.

AB  - The WHO classification of soft tissue tumours categorizes the lesions based on histological differentiation. In the recent fifth edition (2020), many new entities have been introduced, based on their distinct biological behaviour, genetics and morphology. With the recent advances and better understanding of molecular genetics, several novel recurrent genetic alterations have been incorporated in this edition. These may serve as reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers for various soft tissue tumours. Though predominantly a pathologist's game; the radiologists must be aware of the recent updates to contribute towards the optimal diagnosis and management of soft tissue tumours. The imaging features of the new entities have not yet been described but are expected to be explored in the coming years. We hereby present a concise review of the updates in the recent WHO classification of soft tissue tumours. We have tried to emphasize the novel molecular genetics and their surrogate immunohistochemical markers which have brought a paradigm shift in the diagnosis, therapeutics, and prognosis of soft tissue tumours. We also present simplified diagnostic algorithms to characterize soft tissue tumours based on the clinico-radiological features.

AB  - Outcomes relevant to treatment decision-making are inconsistently reported in trials involving glomerular disease. Here, we sought to establish a consensus-derived set of critically important outcomes designed to be reported in all future trials by using an online, international two-round Delphi survey in English. To develop this, patients with glomerular disease, caregivers and health professionals aged 18 years and older rated the importance of outcomes using a Likert scale and a Best-Worst scale. The absolute and relative importance was assessed and comments were analyzed thematically. Of 1198 participants who completed Round 1, 734 were patients/ caregivers while 464 were health care professionals from 59 countries. Of 700 participants that completed Round 2, 412 were patients/caregivers and 288 were health care professionals. Need for dialysis or transplant, kidney function, death, cardiovascular disease, remission-relapse and life participation were the most important outcomes to patients/caregivers and health professionals. Patients/ caregivers rated patient-reported outcomes higher while health care professionals rated hospitalization, death and remission/relapse higher. Four themes explained the reasons for their priorities: confronting death and compounded suffering, focusing on specific targets in glomerular disease, preserving meaning in life, and fostering self-management. Thus, consistent reporting of these critically important outcomes in all trials involving glomerular disease is hoped to improve patient-centered decision-making.

AB  - Background: We report results of an internet-based field study evaluating the diagnostic guidelines for ICD-11 mood disorders. Accuracy of clinicians' diagnostic judgments applying draft ICD-11 as compared to the ICD10 guidelines to standardized case vignettes was assessed as well as perceived clinical utility. Methods: 1357 clinician members of the World Health Organization's Global Clinical Practice Network completed the study in English, Spanish, Japanese or Russian. Participants were randomly assigned to apply ICD11 or ICD-10 guidelines to one of eleven pairs of case vignettes. Results: Clinicians using the ICD-11 and ICD-10 guidelines achieved similar levels of accuracy in diagnosing mood disorders depicted in vignettes. Those using the ICD-11 were more accurate in identifying depressive episode in recurrent depressive disorder. There were no statistically significant differences detected across classifications in the accuracy of identifying dysthymic or cyclothymic disorder. Circumscribed problems with the proposed ICD-11 guidelines were identified including difficulties differentiating bipolar type I from bipolar type II disorder and applying revised severity ratings to depressive episodes. Clinical utility of ICD-11 bipolar disorders was found to be significantly lower than for ICD-10 equivalent categories. Limitations: Standardized case vignettes were manipulated to evaluate specific changes. The degree of accuracy of clinicians' diagnostic judgments may not reflect clinical decision-making with patients. Conclusions: Alignment of the ICD-11 with current research appears to have been achieved without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy or clinical utility though specific training may be necessary as ICD-11 is implemented worldwide. Areas in which the ICD-11 guidelines did not perform as intended resulted in further revisions.

AB  - A new cobalt-based mixed ligand metal-organic framework (MOF), [Co-2(L1)(obc)(2)]center dot DMF (MOF1), (where L1 = 2,7-bis (3-(1H-imidazole-1- yl)propyl)benzo-[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone and H(2)obc = 4,4-oxybisbenzoic acid) was prepared solvothermally that simultaneously exhibits sensing and adsorption capability. The single-crystal X-ray structural analysis revealed that MOF1 exhibits an interpenetrated three-dimensional framework, of pcu topology, comprising classic paddlewheel-type units. The synthesized MOF1 was found to be luminescent with an emission/excitation peak at 402/275 nm that is enhanced by Zr4+ ions due to absorbance-caused enhancement (ACE). The fluorescence studies displayed the highly selective and sensitive behavior of MOF1 towards Zr4+ ions through the turn-on fluorescence effect with a short response time and detection limit of 0.067 mu M. Furthermore, MOF1 was successfully applied for the treatment of commercial dyes Reactive Black 5 and Orange G with adsorption capacity of 33.79 and 22.32 mg/g, respectively, thus showing rapid adsorption for these dyes.

AB  - Comminuted mandibular fracture poses a surgical challenge. Extensive comminution and absence of reference adds complexity particularly in anterior region. In this technical note, we describe a novel application of virtual surgical planning combined with 3D printing which grants precise anatomic reduction in such cases. Computed Tomography data (mandible) of another patient of same age and sex was utilized to create reference model by virtual surgical planning. Virtually created model was 3D printed and utilized for precontouring the reconstruction plate which assisted in achieving satisfactory outcome (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific disorder, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. In PE, trophoblasts mediated inadequate remodeling of uterine spiral arteries seem to interrupt uteroplacental blood flow, one of the hallmarks in the early onset of PE (EO-PE). This, in turn, results in placental ischemia-reperfusion injury during hypoxia and reoxygenation episodes, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS). But still it is debatable if OS is a cause or consequence of PE. In this present study, we have investigated the effects of OS on PE placentae and trophoblast cell functions using BeWo and HTR8/SVneo cell lines. PE placental tissues showed abnormal ultrastructure, high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with altered unfolded protein responses (UPR) in compare with term placental tissues. Similar to PE placentae, during OS induction, the trophoblast cells showed altered invasion and migration properties with significantly variable expression of differentiation and invasion markers, e.g., syncytin and MMPs. The effect was rescued by antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine, thereby implying a ROS-specific effect and in the trophoblast cells, OS triggers UPR pathway through IRE1 alpha-XBP1 axis. Taken together, these findings highlight the harmful effect of unfolded protein response, which was induced due to OS on trophoblast cells and deformed invasion and differentiation programme and can be extended further to clinical settings to identify clinically approved antioxidants during pregnancy as a therapeutic measure to reduce the onset of PE.

AB  - The main protease (Mpro) is the key enzyme of nCOVID-19 and plays a decisive role that makes it an attractive drug target. Multiple analysis of crystal structures reveals the presence of W1, W2, and W3 water locations in the active site pocket of Mpro; W1 and W2 are unstable and are weakly bonded with protein in comparison to W3 of Mpro-native. So, we adopt the water displacement method to occupy W1 or W2 sites by triggering HCQ or its analogs to inactivate the enzyme. Virtual screening is employed to find out best analogs of HCQ, molecular docking is used for water displacement from catalytic region of Mpro, and finally, MD simulations are conducted for validation of these findings. The docking study reveals that W1 and W2 are occupied by respective atoms of ZINC28706440 whereas W2 by HCQ and indacaterol. Finally, MD results demonstrate (i) HCQ occupies W1 and W2 positions, but its analogs (indacaterol and ZINC28706440) are inadequate to retain either W1 or W2 (ii) His41 and Asp187 are stabilized by W3 in Mpro-native and His41, Cys145 and HCQ by W7 in ZINC28706440, and W4, W5, and W6 make water mediated bridge between indacaterol with His41. The structural, dynamical, and thermodynamic (WFP and J value) profiling parameters suggest that W3, W4, and W7 are prominent in their corresponding positions in comparison with W5 and W6. The final results conclude that ZINC28706440 may act as a best analog of HCQ with acceptable physico-chemical and toxicological scores and may further be synthesized for experimental validation.

AB  - Background: IL6 is an important candidate gene implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The present study assessed the genetic association of -174G > C and -572G > C polymorphisms in the IL6 promoter region with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in a north Indian Punjabi cohort.
   Methods: 910 subjects (313 POAG, 148 PACG cases and 449 controls) were recruited. Genotyping was done by TaqMan assays. Genetic association was tested under different genetic models using Plink. Diplotype and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was done through Haploview. Association of clinical parameters with the genotypes was assessed by one-way ANOVA. Adjustment for potential confounding variables was done by binary logistic regression. IL6 levels were measured in POAG patients and controls.
   Results: 572G > C variant showed marginal difference in genotype frequency between pooled cases and POAG subgroup with respect to controls (p = 0.042; OR = 1.33; and p = 0.041; OR = 1.37). The GC genotype conferred 1.37-fold protection under codominant model in POAG cases (p = 0.034, OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.02-1.85; p(corr) = 0.025, OR =1.45, 95% CI = 1.04-2.02). The mean value for IOP was elevated among cases having 'CC' genotype at the -572G > C locus (p = 0.037).
   Lower levels of IL6 were detected in POAG patients in plasma samples (p = 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The study reports suggestive evidence for -572G > C variant in IL6 in affecting genetic sus-ceptibility to POAG in the targeted North Indian Punjabi cohort. A correlation of IL6 levels in aqueous humor (AH) and systemic circulation in POAG was observed, the functional and diagnostic relevance of which may be further investigated.

AB  - Background: Stroke is a devastating complication of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and is an important determinant of its outcome. We propose a model which would help to predict development of infarction or cerebrovascular events in patients of TBM. Methods: A prospective study with n=129 patients of TBM were evaluated for predictors and outcomes of stroke. A diagnostic grid was formulated with clinical, laboratory and radiology as parameters to predict the vascular outcomes. All patients were followed up for mortality and disability on the basis of modified ran kin score (mRS). MRI & CSF cytokines TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma & IL-6,8, 10 were measured at baseline and 3 months. The diagnosis of TBM included definite, probable & possible types and stage I & II with early and late onset of symptoms respectively. Results: The mortality was 16.2% and 19.4% of all patients developed stroke. The mean GCS, barthel index and mRS at admission was 57.03 +/- 9.5,10.2 +/- 2.3 & 3.3 +/- 0.03 respectively mild to moderate infection and functional limitation. Barthel index (BI) happened to be a strong predictor [F=32.6, p=0.001, t=15.5, Beta coefficient = 0.002] followed by biomarker TNF-alpha [F=18.9, p=0.02, t=-2.07, Beta coefficient=-0.04]. N=25 patients developed stroke with TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma showing statistically significant increase in all the stroke affected TBM (95% CI; 4.5 to 1.2; p=0.003). At 3 months, it was observed that mRS was statistically significant between stage I & II (95% CI; 5.4 to 2.1; p=0.04). Conclusions: Our data revealed that 19.4% patients developed vascular events during the hospital stay or follow up. We recruited late onset TBM as compared to early onset. BI, TNF-alpha, IL6 are most potent predictors of stroke post TBM.

AB  - Background Regularly updated data on stroke and its pathological types, including data on their incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability, risk factors, and epidemiological trends, are important for evidence-based stroke care planning and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) aims to provide a standardised and comprehensive measurement of these metrics at global, regional, and national levels.
   Methods We applied GBD 2019 analytical tools to calculate stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of DALYs (with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) associated with 19 risk factors, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. These estimates were provided for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and all strokes combined, and stratified by sex, age group, and World Bank country income level.
   Findings In 2019, there were 12.2 million (95% UI 11.0-13.6) incident cases of stroke, 101 million (93.2-111) prevalent cases of stroke, 143 million (133-153) DALYs due to stroke, and 6.55 million (6.00-7.02) deaths from stroke. Globally, stroke remained the second-leading cause of death (11.6% [10.8-12.2] of total deaths) and the third-leading cause of death and disability combined (5.7% [5.1-6.2] of total DALYs) in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the absolute number of incident strokes increased by 70.0% (67.0-73.0), prevalent strokes increased by 85.0% (83.0-88.0), deaths from stroke increased by 43.0% (31.0-55.0), and DALYs due to stroke increased by 32.0% (22.0-42.0). During the same period, age-standardised rates of stroke incidence decreased by 17.0% (15.0-18.0), mortality decreased by 36.0% (31.0-42.0), prevalence decreased by 6.0% (5.0-7.0), and DALYs decreased by 36.0% (31.0-42.0). However, among people younger than 70 years, prevalence rates increased by 22.0% (21.0-24.0) and incidence rates increased by 15.0% (12.0-18.0). In 2019, the age-standardised stroke-related mortality rate was 3.6 (3.5-3.8) times higher in the World Bank low-income group than in the World Bank high-income group, and the age-standardised stroke-related DALY rate was 3.7 (3.5-3.9) times higher in the low-income group than the high-income group. Ischaemic stroke constituted 62.4% of all incident strokes in 2019 (7.63 million [6.57-8.96]), while intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 27.9% (3.41 million [2.97-3.91]) and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 9.7% (1.18 million [1.01-1.39]). In 2019, the five leading risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood pressure (contributing to 79.6 million [67.7-90.8] DALYs or 55.5% [48.2-62.0] of total stroke DALYs), high body-mass index (34.9 million [22.3-48.6] DALYs or 24.3% [15.7-33.2]), high fasting plasma glucose (28.9 million [19.8-41.5] DALYs or 20.2% [13.8-29.1]), ambient particulate matter pollution (28.7 million [23.4-33.4] DALYs or 20.1% [16.6-23.0]), and smoking (25.3 million [22.6-28.2] DALYs or 17.6% [16.4-19.0]).
   Interpretation The annual number of strokes and deaths due to stroke increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, despite substantial reductions in age-standardised rates, particularly among people older than 70 years. The highest age-standardised stroke-related mortality and DALY rates were in the World Bank low-income group. The fastest-growing risk factor for stroke between 1990 and 2019 was high body-mass index. Without urgent implementation of effective primary prevention strategies, the stroke burden will probably continue to grow across the world, particularly in low-income countries.

AB  - In view of restrictions imposed to control COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in online survey-based studies because of its ability to collect data with greater ease and faster speed compared to traditional methods. However, there are important concerns about the validity and generalizability of findings obtained using the online survey methodology. Further, there are data privacy concerns and ethical issues unique to these studies due to the electronic and online nature of survey data. Here, we describe some of the important issues associated with poor scientific quality of online survey findings, and provide suggestions to address them in future studies going ahead.

AB  - Buerger's disease or thromboangiitis obliterans is a type of obstructive vascular diseases categorized as vasculitis and usually present in 95% of young smoker men. The main pathogenetic mechanism is interplay between immune system and inflammation. Earlier our phase II study has shown that stempeucel are safe when injected at 2 million cells/kg body weight by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and angiogenetic properties. The present study was conducted to further assess the safety and efficacy of stempeucel in critical limb ischemia due to Buerger's disease after obtaining approval from Indian FDA based on the data generated in the phase II study. This is an open label, multicenteric phase IV PMS study conducted across India with experienced vascular surgeons. Fifty patients of critical limb ischemia due to Buerger's disease with Rutherford III-5 or III-6 were included in the study and each individual received a dose of 2 million cells/kg body weight of stempeucel in the calf muscles and around the ulcer. These patients were evaluated over 12 months from drug administration. The present study showed the continued long term efficacy over a period of 12 months follow up in these patients corroborating the result obtained in the previous phase II studies. There was significant improvement in rest pain, ankle systolic pressure, and ankle brachial pressure index with accelerated ulcer healing. In conclusion, the present study shows that the intramuscular administration of stempeucel continues to be safe, tolerable, and effective alternative treatment in patients with Buerger's disease.

AB  - Background
   The incidence of hypervirulent (hv) carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is increasing globally among various clones and is also responsible for nosocomial infections. The CR-hvKp is formed by the uptake of a virulence plasmid by endemic high-risk clones or by the uptake of plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance genes by the virulent clones. Here, we describe CR-hvKp from India belonging to high-risk clones that have acquired a virulence plasmid and are phenotypically unidentified due to lack of hypermucoviscosity.
   Methods
   Twenty-seven CRKp isolates were identified to possess rmpA2 by whole-genome sequencing; and resistance and virulence determinants were characterized. By in silico protein modeling (and validation), protein backbone stability analysis, and coarse dynamics study, the fitness of RmpA, RmpA2, and aerobactin-associated proteins-IucA and IutA, were determined to establish a reliable marker for clinical identification of CR-hvKp.
   Results
   The CR-hvKp belonged to multidrug-resistant (MDR) high-risk clones such as CG11, CG43, ST15, and ST231 and carried OXA-232 as the predominant carbapenemase followed by NDM. The virulence plasmid belonged to IncHI1B replicon type and carried frameshifted and truncated rmpA and rmpA2. This resulted in a lack of hypermucoviscous phenotype. However, functional aerobactin was expressed in all high-risk clones. In silico analysis portrayed that IucA and IutA were more stable than classical RmpA. Furthermore, IucA and IutA had lower conformational fluctuations in the functional domains than the non-functional RmpA2, which increases the fitness cost of the latter for its maintenance and expression among CR-hvKp. Hence, RmpA and RmpA2 are likely to be lost among CR-hvKp owing to the increased fitness cost while coding for essential antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors.
   Conclusion
   Increasing incidence of convergence of AMR and virulence is observed among K. pneumoniae globally, which warrants the need for reliable markers for identifying CR-hvKp. The presence of non-functional RmpA2 among high-risk clones highlights the significance of molecular identification of CR-hvKp. The negative string test due to non-functional RmpA2 among CR-hvKp isolates challenges phenotypic screening and faster identification of this pathotype. This can potentially be counteracted by projecting aerobactin as a stable, constitutively expressed, and functional marker for rapidly evolving CR-hvKp.

AB  - Objective This study was undertaken to determine whether the vertical parasagittal approach or the lateral peri-insular/peri-Sylvian approach to hemispheric surgery is the superior technique in achieving long-term seizure freedom. Methods We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of the HOPS (Hemispheric Surgery Outcome Prediction Scale) study, an international, multicenter, retrospective cohort study that identified predictors of seizure freedom through logistic regression modeling. Only patients undergoing vertical parasagittal, lateral peri-insular/peri-Sylvian, or lateral trans-Sylvian hemispherotomy were included in this post hoc analysis. Differences in seizure freedom rates were assessed using a time-to-event method and calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival method. Results Data for 672 participants across 23 centers were collected on the specific hemispherotomy approach. Of these, 72 (10.7%) underwent vertical parasagittal hemispherotomy and 600 (89.3%) underwent lateral peri-insular/peri-Sylvian or trans-Sylvian hemispherotomy. Seizure freedom was obtained in 62.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 53.5%-70.2%) of the entire cohort at 10-year follow-up. Seizure freedom was 88.8% (95% CI = 78.9%-94.3%) at 1-year follow-up and persisted at 85.5% (95% CI = 74.7%-92.0%) across 5- and 10-year follow-up in the vertical subgroup. In contrast, seizure freedom decreased from 89.2% (95% CI = 86.3%-91.5%) at 1-year to 72.1% (95% CI = 66.9%-76.7%) at 5-year to 57.2% (95% CI = 46.6%-66.4%) at 10-year follow-up for the lateral subgroup. Log-rank test found that vertical hemispherotomy was associated with durable seizure-free progression compared to the lateral approach (p = .01). Patients undergoing the lateral hemispherotomy technique had a shorter time-to-seizure recurrence (hazard ratio = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.08-6.04, p = .03) and increased seizure recurrence odds (odds ratio = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.05-12.86, p = .04) compared to those undergoing the vertical hemispherotomy technique. Significance This pilot study demonstrated more durable seizure freedom of the vertical technique compared to lateral hemispherotomy techniques. Further studies, such as prospective expertise-based observational studies or a randomized clinical trial, are required to determine whether a vertical approach to hemispheric surgery provides superior long-term seizure outcomes.

AB  - Combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblC type, (MAHCC) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of remethylation caused due to mutations in the MMACHC (metabolism of cobalamin associated C) gene with predominant neurological involvement. Microvascular, renal, and cardiovascular complications are also known to occur. However, the disease presenting primarily with a cardiovascular phenotype without any neurological involvement is a rare entity. We report a case of developmentally normal 23-mo-old female child, who presented with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and succumbed to cardiac failure. Extensive workup for PAH was inconclusive. Posthumous trio whole-exome sequencing revealed pathogenic compound heterozygous variants in the MMACHC. Diagnosis of MAHCC should be considered as a differential diagnosis for unexplained PAH in children. An elevated plasma homocysteine level can serve as a simple screening modality for this disorder. Accurate diagnosis has paramount therapeutic implications, as management with hydroxocobalamin and betaine may lead to partial or complete remission of PAH in these patients.

AB  - Background Hypertension can be detected at the primary health-care level and low-cost treatments can effectively control hypertension. We aimed to measure the prevalence of hypertension and progress in its detection, treatment, and control from 1990 to 2019 for 200 countries and territories.
   Methods We used data from 1990 to 2019 on people aged 30-79 years from population-representative studies with measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age.
   Findings The number of people aged 30-79 years with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95% credible interval 306-359) million women and 317 (292-344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584-668) million women and 652 (604-698) million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019, age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe including Switzerland, Spain, and the UK for women; and in several low-income and middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50% for women in two countries and men in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Globally, 59% (55-62) of women and 49% (46-52) of men with hypertension reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47% (43-51) of women and 38% (35-41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension in 2019 were 23% (20-27) for women and 18% (16-21) for men. In 2019, treatment and control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment >70%; control >50%), followed by the USA, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment rates were less than 25% for women and less than 20% for men in Nepal, Indonesia, and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10% for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa, central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran.
   Interpretation Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.

AB  - Trans-rectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy is a well-established diagnosis technique for prostate cancer. To enhance the needle manoeuvring skills under ultrasound (US) guidance, it is preferable to train medical practitioners in needle biopsy on tissue-mimicking phantoms. This phantom should mimic the morphology as well as mechanical and acoustic properties of the human male pelvic region to provide a surgical experience and feedback. In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used and evaluated for prostate phantom development, that is stiffness tunable, US-compatible and durable phantom material. Three samples, each with 5%, 10%, and 15% concentration of PVA material, were prepared, and their mechanical and shrinkage characteristics were investigated. The anatomy of male pelvic region was used to develop an anatomically correct phantom. Later US guided needle biopsy was performed on the phantom. The range of elastic moduli of the PVA samples was 2 similar to 146 kPa. Their elastic moduli and volumes were found to remain statistically close from seventh to eighth freeze-thaw cycle (p>0.05). Initial US scans of the phantom resulted in satisfactory B-mode images, with a clear distinction between the prostate and its surrounding organs. This study demonstrated the applicability of PVA hydrogel as a phantom material for training in US-guided needle biopsy.

AB  - Backgrounds Leucas cephalotes is a common ethnomedicinal plant widely used by traditional healers for the treatment of Malaria and other types of fever. Oleanolic acid and its derivatives have been reported for various types of pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, anti-HIV and anti-HCV activity. Methods L.cephalotes plant extracts were prepared by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method and oleanolic acid was isolated by preparatory thin-layer chromatography. The compound was identified and characterize by using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), Fourier transform infra-Red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). The structure of the compound was elucidated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((HNMR)-H-1) and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ((CNMR)-C-1) and the purity checked by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The MTT assay was used to determine the toxicity of plant extract and oleanolic acid using a microplate reader at 595 nm. The anti-dengue activity of plant extract and oleanolic acid was tested in vitro and in silico using real-time RT-PCR. Results The optimum yield of the extract was obtained at 40 degrees C temperature and 15Mpa pressure. The maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of plant extract and oleanolic acid were found as 46.87 mu g/ml and 93.75 mu g/ml, respectively in C6/36 cell lines. UV spectrophotometer curve of the isolated compound was overlapped with standard oleanolic acid at 232 nm. Superimposed FT-IR structure of the isolated compound was indicated the same spectra at 3433, 2939, 2871, 1690, 1500,1463, 1387, 1250, 1209, 1137 and 656 position as per marker compound. HPTLC analysis showed the retention factor of L. cephalotes extract was 0.19 + 0.06 as similar to the standard oleanolic acid chromatogram. The NMR structure of the isolated compound was identified as similar to the marker oleanolic acid structure. DSC analysis revealed the purity of isolated oleanolic acid was 98.27% with a melting point of 311.16 degrees C. Real-time RT PCR results revealed that L. cephalotes supercritical extract and isolated oleanolic acid showed 100 and 99.17% inhibition against the dengue - 2 virus when treated with MNTD value of plant extract (46.87 mu g/ml) and the test compound (93.75 mu g/ml), respectively. The molecular study demonstrated the binding energy of oleanolic acid with NS1and NS5 (non-structural protein) were - 9.42 & -8.32Kcal/mol, respectively. Conclusions The SFE extract L. cephalotes and its active compound, oleanolic acid inhibiting the activity of dengue-2 serotype in the in vitro and in silico assays. Thus, the L.cephalotes plant could be an excellent source for drug design for the treatment of dengue infection.

AB  - Purpose: Prediction of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) failure in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respi-ratory failure (AHRF) may improve clinical management and stratification of patients for optimal treatment. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine performance of ROX index as a predictor of HFNC failure. Materials and methods: Systematic search was performed in electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Cochrane Library) for articles published till 15 June 2021 investigating ROX index as a predictor for HFNC failure. Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was used to analyze risk of bias for prognostic factors, by two independent authors. Results: Eight retrospective or prospective cohort studies involving 1301 patients showed a good discriminatory value, summary area under the curve (sAUC) 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84) with sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.80) and specificity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.88) for predicting HNFC failure. The positive and negative likelihood ratio were 3.0 (95% CI, 2.2-5.3) and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.28-0.50) respectively, and was strongly associated with a promis-ing predictive accuracy (Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 9, 95% CI, 5-16). onclusion: This meta-analysis suggests ROX index has good discriminating power for prediction of HFNC failure in COVID-19 patients with AHRF.

AB  - Objective Optimal bone mass (a function of foetal programming and adequate intrauterine bone mineral accrual) is essential for prevention of osteoporosis. The present study was planned with the objectives to describe newborn bone mass (NBBM) and study the associated factors. Design Observational study Patients: Singleton pregnant women <= 16 weeks gestation. Measurements Maternal factors and antenatal events: Dietary assessment (3 days-24-h diet recalls at <= 16 and 32-34 weeks), fetal femoral volume (FFV) assessment at 19 and 34 weeks, serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (S.25OHD) and placental weight. Newborn anthropometric parameters, cord S.25OHD & IGF-1 level and NBBM by DXA (whole-body bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD) and bone area). Results Total 224 subjects were studied: 198 full-term and 26 preterm. The mean BMC, BMD and bone area for term newborns was 46.5 g (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.35-47.66), 0.209 g/cm(2) (95% CI: 0.206-0.212) and 221.6 cm(2) (95% CI: 218.52-224.62), respectively. The mean placental weight was 403.2 +/- 75.01 g (n = 72) while FFV was 0.71 +/- 0.28 ml (19 weeks; n = 59) and 4.4 +/- 1.17 ml (34 weeks; n = 33). Factors significantly associated with NBBM -gestational age at delivery, gestational weight gain, FFV at 19 weeks, placental weight, third-trimester maternal serum albumin and newborn anthropometric parameters (univariable analysis) and newborn birth weight, placental weight and FFV at 19 weeks (multivariable analysis). Conclusion This study described NBBM among term newborns and birth weight, second-trimester FFV and placental weight were the associated factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES This study sought to describe worldwide variations in the use of myocardial perfusion imaging hardware, software, and imaging protocols and their impact on radiation effective dose (ED). BACKGROUND Concerns about long-term effects of ionizing radiation have prompted efforts to identify strategies for dose optimization in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Studies have increasingly shown opportunities for dose reduction using newer technologies and optimized protocols. METHODS Data were submitted voluntarily to the INCAPS (International Atomic Energy Agency Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Study) registry, a multinational, cross-sectional study comprising 7,911 imaging studies from 308 labs in 65 countries. The study compared regional use of camera technologies, advanced post-processing software, and protocol characteristics and analyzed the influence of each factor on ED. RESULTS Cadmium-zinc-telluride and positron emission tomography (PET) cameras were used in 10% (regional range 0% to 26%) and 6% (regional range 0% to 17%) of studies worldwide. Attenuation correction was used in 26% of cases (range 10% to 57%), and advanced post-processing software was used in 38% of cases (range 26% to 64%). Stress-first single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging comprised nearly 20% of cases from all world regions, except North America, where it was used in just 7% of cases. Factors associated with lower ED and odds ratio for achieving radiation dose <-9 mSv included use of cadmium-zinc-telluride, PET, advanced post-processing software, and stress-or rest-only imaging. Overall, 39% of all studies (97% PET and 35% SPECT) were <-9 mSv, while just 6% of all studies (32% PET and 4% SPECT) achieved a dose <-3 mSv. CONCLUSIONS Newer-technology cameras, advanced software, and stress-only protocols were associated with reduced ED, but worldwide adoption of these practices was generally low and varied significantly between regions. The imple-mentation of dose-optimizing technologies and protocols offers an opportunity to reduce patient radiation exposure across all world regions.

AB  - Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are the mainstay of epilepsy treatment but these may be a potential risk factor for behavioral disturbances particularly depression which requires treatment. In this study, the effect of antidepressant sertraline (SRT) in combination with AEDs sodium valproate (SV) and levetiracetam (LEV) on seizures, cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats was evaluated.
   After administration of 24th injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), 77.8% rats were kindled. Administration of SRT showed no protective effect on kindling development while SV was 100% protective. With LEV 42.9% were kindled. On combining SRT with SV or LEV 25% and 20% rats were kindled. A significant increase in latency to reach platform zone in Morris water maze(MWM), and increased transfer latencies in Elevated plus maze(EPM) was observed in PTZ kindled rats as compared to normal control on day 49 and when LEV was combined with SRT. In EPM test, however none of the drug treatments had any effect on transfer latencies except LEV pretreated kindled group. In Passive avoidance (PA) test, kindling was associated with a significant decrease in retention time(p = 0.018) while LEV and SV had no effect. The PTZ kindled rats showed significantly higher malondialdehyde(MDA) levels in brain hippocampus(p = 0.0286) while both SRT and SV were associated with significantly lower MDA levels as compared to kindled control group. In case of glutathione (GSH), kindling had no significant effect.
   The use of sertraline for depression in persons with epilepsy on AEDs needs to be carefully evaluated and monitored due to likelihood of individual variation.

AB  - Purpose: Neurotransmitters (NTs) are the key mediators of essential ocular functions, such as processing the visual functions of the retina, maintaining homeostasis of aqueous humor, and regulating ocular blood flow. This study aims to determine variations in the levels of L-glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), histaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic NTs in patients with primary glaucoma versus patients with cataract.
   Methods: This case-control study involved three age-matched groups of patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG, n = 14), primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG, n = 21), and cataract (control, n = 19). Patients' aqueous humor and plasma were collected, snap frozen at -80 degrees C, and subjected to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis for quantification of NTs.
   Results: Baseline intraocular pressure and the cup-to-disc ratio were found to be statistically significantly elevated in the POAG and PACG groups compared to the cataract control group. In aqueous humor, histamine was found to be statistically significantly elevated (fivefold, p<0.0001), whereas 1-methyl histamine was statistically significantly decreased (p<0.05) in POAG compared to the control group. A statistically significant increase in L-glutamate and GABA was observed among both patient groups with glaucoma compared to the cataract control group. Adrenaline was found to be elevated only in the PACG group (2.7-fold, p<0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed among the plasma NT levels between the groups.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the prominent role of the histaminergic system apart from autonomic mechanisms in the progression of glaucoma. Elevated L-glutamate and GABA could be due to retinal ganglionic cell death. Further studies are required to evaluate the effects of histamine on Muller cell dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sarcoidosis (PS) is a noncaseating granulomatous disease of un-known origin. Despite conflicting reports, it is considered that the regulatory T (Treg) cells are functionally impaired in PS, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. OX40, a pivotal costimulatory molecule, is essential for T-cell functions and memory development, but its impact on Treg cells is ambiguous.
   RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the OX40 pathway influence the suppressive functions of Treg cells in PS?
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty treatment-naive patients with PS and 30 healthy control participants were recruited for this study. Polychromatic flow cytometry-based immunologic assays were performed to enumerate effector T helper (Th) cells and Treg cells along with their functions. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, small interfering RNA, and pharmacologic inhibitors, the impact of OX40 on Treg cell function was investigated.
   RESULTS: We observed enrichment of Th-9 cells perhaps for the first time along with Th-1, Th-17, and Treg cells in patients' BAL fluid (BALF) compared with peripheral blood. However, Treg cells were observed to be functionally defective at the pathological site. We observed higher expression of OX40 on both T effector (CD4(+)Foxp3(-)) and Treg (CD4(+)Foxp3(+)) cells obtained from the BALF of patients with PS. However, OX40 exerted contrasting impact on these T-cell subsets, enhancing effector T-cell functions (interferon g, tumor necrosis factor a) while inhibiting Treg cell function (IL-10, transforming growth factor (3). OX40 silencing or blocking on Treg cells resulted in restoration of their impaired functions.
   INTERPRETATION: We propose that inhibiting the OX40 pathway may constitute a therapeutic strategy for controlling inflammatory T cells by restoring Treg cell functions in patients with PS.

AB  - Background: Yoga-based interventions can be effective in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We developed a Yoga program for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) among high-risk people and conducted a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) in India. The objective of this study was to identify and explore why potential participants declined to participate in the feasibility RCT.</p>
   Methods: An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews, was conducted at a Yoga center in New Delhi, India. Fourteen people (10 women and four men) who declined to participate in the feasibility RCT were interviewed, and 13 of them completed the non-participant questionnaire, which captured their socio-demographics, diets, physical activities, and reasons for declining.</p>
   Results: Three types of barriers were identified and explored which prevented participation in the feasibility RCT: (1) personal barriers, such as lack of time, perceived sufficiency of knowledge, preferences about self-management of health, and trust in other traditional and alternative therapies; (2) contextual barriers, such as social influences and lack of awareness about preventive care; and (3) study-related barriers, such as lack of study information, poor accessibility to the Yoga site, and lack of trust in the study methods and intervention.</p>
   Conclusions: We identified and explored personal, contextual, and study-related barriers to participation in a feasibility RCT in India. The findings will help to address recruitment challenges in future Yoga and other RCTs.</p>

AB  - Background Inguinal hernia containing ovary and fallopian tube can be found in paediatric population and is a rare finding in women of reproductive age group. Most of the cases are associated with congenital abnormalities of the female genital tract. Case presentation A 20 year old female presented with right reducible inguinal hernia, primary amenorrhea and normal secondary sexual characteristics. Clinical examination revealed scoliosis with convexity towards left side, prominence of left rib cage with Sprengel deformity and right sided heart sounds. Ultrasound of the inguinal swelling revealed right ovary within the hernial sac, Chest X-ray revealed right lung collapse and dextrocardia. Further Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pelvis revealed inguinal hernia with right ovary as its content, normal left ovary and absent uterus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed complete collapse of right lung with compensatory left lung hyperinflation and absent right kidney. Karyotyping of the patient was normal, 46XX. A diagnosis of MURCS syndrome with right ovarian hernia was made. The hernia was surgically managed with repositioning of ovary and fallopian tube into the pelvis. Discussion Ovary in inguinal hernia is rare in women of reproductive age group. MRKH syndrome, a mullerian duct anomaly, is the congenital aplasia of uterus and upper two-thirds of vagina in a female with normal ovaries, fallopian tube, secondary sexual characteristics and 46XX karyotype. MURCS is a subtype of MRKH type 2 having mullerian duct agenesis with renal, cardiac, muscular & vertebral defects. General physical examination and primary investigations if yields abnormal findings; the patient must undergo an array of investigations to rule out MRKH/MURCS, or other congenital abnormality. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent its incarceration or torsion. The primary treatment of ovary in inguinal hernia is repositioning the ovary and fallopian tube back to pelvis to preserve fertility and repair of inguinal hernia. A multidisciplinary team is required to deal with various abnormalities present in a patient with MURCS.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to investigate whether serum biochemical parameters can be used as a surrogate for chest computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Materials & methods: We evaluated potential associations between various serum biochemical markers and the COVID-reporting and data system (RADS) pneumonia grading system in 53 individuals with confirmed COVID-19. Results: A total of 28 chest CT scans (52.8%) were abnormal. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 on CT showed a statistically significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase (186.4 +/- 56.5 vs 228.4 +/- 60.6; p = 0.01), which was significantly correlated with the COVID-RADS pneumonia grading system. Conclusion: Lactate dehydrogenase can be used as a surrogate marker for chest CT in children with COVID-19. This can reduce exposure to ionizing radiation during initial diagnostic procedures in children with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of paraphilic disorder is a complicated clinical judgment based on the integration of information from multiple dimensions to arrive at a categorical (present/absent) conclusion. The recent update of the guidelines for paraphilic disorders in ICD-11 presents an opportunity to investigate how mental health professionals use the diagnostic guidelines to arrive at a diagnosis which thereby can optimize the guidelines for clinical use.
   Aim: This study examined clinicians' ability to use the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for paraphilic disorders which contain multiple dimensions that must be simultaneously assessed to arrive at a diagnosis.
   Methods: The study investigated the ability of 1,263 international clinicians to identify the dimensions of paraphilic disorder in the context of written case vignettes that varied on a single dimension only.
   Outcomes: Participants provided diagnoses for the case vignettes along with dimensional ratings of the degree of presence of five dimensions of paraphilic disorder (arousal, consent, action, distress, and risk).
   Results: Across a series of analyses, clinicians demonstrated a clear ability to recognize and appropriately integrate the dimensions of paraphilic disorders; however, there was some evidence that clinicians may over-diagnose non-pathological cases.
   Clinical Translation: Clinicians would likely benefit from targeted training on the ICD-11 definition of paraphilic disorder and should be cautious of over-diagnosing.
   Strengths and Limitations: This study represents a large international sample of health professionals and is the first to examine clinicians' ability to apply the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for paraphilic disorders. Important limitations include not generalizing to all clinicians and acknowledging that results may be different in direct clinical interactions vs written case vignettes.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that clinicians appear capable of interpreting and implementing the diagnostic guidelines for paraphilic disorders in ICD-11. Copyright (C) 2021, International Society of Sexual Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 has targeted elimination of preventable child mortality, reduction of neonatal death to less than 12 per 1000 livebirths, and reduction of death of children younger than 5 years to less than 25 per 1000 livebirths, for each country by 2030. To understand current rates, recent trends, and potential trajectories of child mortality for the next decade, we present the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 findings for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in children younger than 5 years of age, with multiple scenarios for child mortality in 2030 that include the consideration of potential effects of COVID-19, and a novel framework for quantifying optimal child survival.
   Methods We completed all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality analyses from 204 countries and territories for detailed age groups separately, with aggregated mortality probabilities per 1000 livebirths computed for neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and under-5 mortality rate (USMR). Scenarios for 2030 represent different potential trajectories, notably including potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of improvements preferentially targeting neonatal survival. Optimal child survival metrics were developed by age, sex, and cause of death across all GBD location-years. The first metric is a global optimum and is based on the lowest observed mortality, and the second is a survival potential frontier that is based on stochastic frontier analysis of observed mortality and Healthcare Access and Quality Index.
   Findings Global U5MR decreased from 71.2 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% uncertainty interval WI] 68.3-74-0) in 2000 to 37.1 (33.2-41.7) in 2019 while global NMR correspondingly declined more slowly from 28.0 deaths per 1000 live births (26.8-29-5) in 2000 to 17.9 (16.3-19-8) in 2019. In 2019,136 (67%) of 204 countries had a USMR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold and 133 (65%) had an NMR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold, and the reference scenario suggests that by 2030,154 (75%) of all countries could meet the U5MR targets, and 139 (68%) could meet the NMR targets. Deaths of children younger than 5 years totalled 9.65 million (95% UI 9.05-10.30) in 2000 and 5.05 million (4.27-6.02) in 2019, with the neonatal fraction of these deaths increasing from 39% (3.76 million [95% UI 3.53-4.021) in 2000 to 48% (2.42 million; 2.06-2.86) in 2019. NMR and U5MR were generally higher in males than in females, although there was no statistically significant difference at the global level. Neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years in 2019, followed by lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, congenital birth defects, and malaria. The global optimum analysis suggests NMR could be reduced to as low as 0.80 (95% UI 0.71-0.86) deaths per 1000 livebirths and U5MR to 1.44 (95% UI 1-27-1.58) deaths per 1000 livebirths, and in 2019, there were as many as 1.87 million (95% UI 1-35-2.58; 37% [95% UI 32-43]) of 5.05 million more deaths of children younger than 5 years than the survival potential frontier.
   Interpretation Global child mortality declined by almost half between 2000 and 2019, but progress remains slower in neonates and 65 (32%) of 204 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, are not on track to meet either SDG 3.2 target by 2030. Focused improvements in perinatal and newborn care, continued and expanded delivery of essential interventions such as vaccination and infection prevention, an enhanced focus on equity, continued focus on poverty reduction and education, and investment in strengthening health systems across the development spectrum have the potential to substantially improve USMR. Given the widespread effects of COVID-19, considerable effort will be required to maintain and accelerate progress. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: The slow increase in use of telemedicine began to expand rapidly, along with reimbursement changes, during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Standardized protocols for these services are lacking but are needed for effective and equitable health care. In this study, we queried pediatric nephrologists and their patients about their telemedicine experiences during the pandemic
   Methods: Surveys that were in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act were deployed online to patients and physicians.
   Results: We collected survey responses from 400 patients and 197 pediatric nephrologists. Patients reported positive experiences with telemedicine visits as it was logistically easier than in-person visits. Patients also felt that the quality of their visits were equivalent to what they would receive in person. Physicians used a wide variety of online systems to conduct synchronous telemedicine with Zoom (23%), EPIC (9%), Doxy.me (7%), services not specified (37%), or a mix of local or smaller services (24%). Most physicians' concerns were related to technological issues and the ability to procure physical exams and/or laboratory results.
   Conclusions: There is a paucity of published trials on telemedicine services in pediatric nephrology. Virtual care was feasible and acceptable for patients, caregivers, and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Case Report: Subconjunctival Triamcinolone Acetate-associated Scleral Necrosis: Is It Really Obsolete?
T2  - OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE
KW  - SCLERITIS
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE Recent studies have established the safety of subconjunctival steroids for anterior scleritis, refuting scleral necrosis as a potential complication. However, presently, we report a rare case of scleral necrosis associated with subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to report a case of scleral necrosis after subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate administration for nonresponsive anterior nodular scleritis. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old man diagnosed with nodular anterior scleritis was administered subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate (4 mg) adjacent to the nodule after noting nonresponse for 4 months. Worsening of congestion was noted 3 weeks after the injection. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse congestion, 10 clock hours of anterior scleral necrosis, superior whitish depot of subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate, anterior segment flare, and few posterior synechiae. Ultrasound biomicroscopic imaging and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography showed a localized outpouching of sclera and buckling of anterior scleral wall superiorly. The result of the comprehensive blood profile and systemic evaluation undertaken to rule out any underlying autoimmune disorders and herpes zoster ophthalmicus was found negative. A diagnosis of subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate-associated scleral necrosis was made, and the patient was managed conservatively. Gradual improvement with dissolution of subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate and no recurrences till 2 years of follow-up were noted. CONCLUSIONS Scleral necrosis is a potential complication of subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate. Judicious and cautious use of subconjunctival triamcinolone acetate is advocated for nonresolving anterior scleritis.

AB  - Long standing adult temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) results in smaller ramal height, and warped and undulated ramus. Despite the efforts made to standardise the sizes available in stock joint (Zimmer Biomet (R)), the system causes fit challenges in TMJA patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the virtual feasibility of stock prostheses in TMJA patients. The data included amount of bone contouring for fossa placement, available ramal length, length discrepancy if placed straight, angulation of mandibular component required to adapt to the bone, and mediolateral fit discrepancy. CT data of 50 TMJA patients (71 joints; unilateral, n = 29; bilateral, n = 21; male, n = 33; female, n = 17) with mean age of 24.26 +/- 8.88 years were included. 53 joints required more than 3 mm lateral bone reduction for fossa placement. The ramal length were categorised into ranges 35-40 mm (n = 15), 41-45 mm (n = 14), 46-50 mm (n = 28) and >50 mm (n = 14). Correlation between the age of occurrence of ankylosis and ramal length using the Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a positive correlation (r = 0.38, p = 0.001). Length discrepancy, angulation of mandibular component, and mediolateral fit discrepancy decreases as the ramal length increases. Only 14 joints had appropriate fit of stock prostheses while the remaining 57 joints warranted compromised placement. Even the smallest available stock mandibular component (45 mm) had a compromised fit in terms of length and adaptability on the lateral aspect of ramus. The study concludes that a short ramus is mostly limiting factor in using stock prosthesis in TMJA patients. There is a need for still smaller size stock prostheses.

AB  - Objective Infantile hemiplegia due to brain injury is associated with poor attention span, which critically affects the learning and acquisition of new skills, especially among children with left-sided infantile hemiplegia (LSIH). This study aimed to improve the selective visual attention (SVA) of children with LSIH through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
   Methods: A total of 15 children participated in this randomized, double-blinded, pilot study; of them, 10 experienced LSIH, and the remaining 5 were healthy age-matched controls. All the children performed the Computerized Stroop Color-Word Test (CSCWT) at baseline, during the 5th and 10th treatment sessions, and at follow-up. The experimental (n = 5) and control groups (n = 5) received tDCS, while the sham group (n = 5) received placebo tDCS. All three groups received cognitive training on alternate days, for 3 weeks, with the aim to improve SVA.
   Results: Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a statistically significant change in the mean scores of CSCWT between time points (baseline, 5th and 10th sessions, and follow-up) within-subject factor, group (experimental, sham) between-subject factor and interaction (time points X group) (p < 0.005). Furthermore, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences between time point (p < 0.005) for the experimental and control group but not the sham group.
   Conclusion: These pilot results suggest that future research should be conducted with adequate samples to enable conclusions to be drawn.

AB  - Introduction: Corticospinal tracts (CST) forms the basis of motor neurophysiology after stroke. Motor skill recovery has been correlated well to the microstructural properties of CST in both hemispheres. Functional imaging has opened up new possibilities of imaging functionality of cortex and fiber tracts in the brain. We studied therapy-induced changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and DTI imaging on 20 chronic stroke patients at baseline, 8, and 24 weeks.
   Settings and Design: All the patients were subjected to MR imaging on a 1.5 T MR scanner. We used block design for BOLD with alternate baseline and activation cycles (repetition time (TR) =4520 ms, echo time (TE) = 44 ms, slices = 31, slice thickness = 4 mm). DTI parameters were as follows: TE = 76 ms, TR = 10,726 ms, EPI factor = 127, resolution = 128 x 128 matrix, field of view = 230 mm and a slice thickness of 4.0 mm.
   Statistical Analysis Used: The data was analyzed on SPSS software and tractography/DTI processing software (M/s. Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen Germany.
   Results: The mean axial diffusivity (lambda 11) and radial diffusivity (lambda perpendicular to) in the affected hemisphere were 0. 30 and 0.18, respectively. The mean number (FN) ratio (+/- SD) was 0.27 +/- 0.14 at baseline, 0.33 +/- 0.19 at 8 weeks, and 0.41 +/- 0.23 at 24 weeks. Multivariate regression analysis at baseline showed that rFA was well-correlated to the Fugl-Meyer score (regression coefficient: 0.198, F = 10.382, P = 0.001), MI followed by signal intensity.
   Discussion: All patients had high % signal intensity after 8 weeks of physiotherapy regime with a greater percentage change in rFA as compared at follow-up suggesting that a focused exercise regime in stroke patients helps in the reconnection of neural and myelin networks.
   Conclusion: Clinical and functional recovery after stroke is well-correlated with the DTI and BOLD parameters i.e., rFA ratios, CST involvement fiber numbers, and % signal intensity of the ipsilesional cortex.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Occurrence of stroke has been reported among patients with COVID-19. The present study compares clinical features and outcomes of stroke patients with and without COVID-19. Methods: The COVID-19 Stroke Study Group (CSSG) is a multicentric study in 18 sites across India to observe and compare the clinical characteristics of patients with stroke admitted during the current pandemic period and a similar epoch in 2019. The present study reports patients of stroke with and without COVID-19 (CoVS and non-CoVS, respectively) seen between February 2020 and July 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcome details of patients were collected. Results: The mean age and gender were comparable between the two groups. CoVS patients had higher stroke severity and extent of cerebral involvement on imaging. In-hospital complications and death were higher among CoVS patients (53.06% vs. 17.51%; P < 0.001) and (42.31% vs. 7.6%; P < 0.001), respectively. At 3 months, higher mortality was observed among CoVS patients (67.65% vs. 13.43%; P < 0.001) and good outcome (modified Rankin score [mRS]: 0-2) was seen more often in non-CoVS patients (68.86% vs. 33.33%; P < 0.001). The presence of COVID-19 and baseline stroke severity were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions: CoVS is associated with higher severity, poor outcome, and increased mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and baseline stroke severity are independent predictors of mortality.

AB  - Simple Summary Breast cancer prevalence is a major challenge worldwide due to the lack of early diagnostics and treatment modalities. In this era of technological advancements, researchers are exploring several grey areas in breast cancer research, which may lead to the appropriate point of care, non-invasive and diagnostic aid for early breast cancer detection and management. Exosome-based research, an emerging area, endeavors to locate and elucidate the role of exosomes in breast cancer diagnostics, immune response and clinical outcomes. This review may provide insights on small extracellular vesicles research and their role in breast cancer. Future extensive studies on exosome biology in conjunction with cancer genetics shall undoubtedly open up new vistas in exosome-based diagnostics for early cancer detection and therapeutics. Despite the recent advancements in therapeutics and personalized medicine, breast cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers among women. The prognostic and diagnostic aids mainly include assessment of tumor tissues with conventional methods towards better therapeutic strategies. However, current era of gene-based research may influence the treatment outcome particularly as an adjunct to diagnostics by exploring the role of non-invasive liquid biopsies or circulating markers. The characterization of tumor milieu for physiological fluids has been central to identifying the role of exosomes or small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). These exosomes provide necessary communication between tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The manipulation of exosomes in TME may provide promising diagnostic/therapeutic strategies, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer patients. This review has described and highlighted the role of exosomes in breast carcinogenesis and how they could be used or targeted by recent immunotherapeutics to achieve promising intervention strategies.

AB  - Consequent to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, pedagogic changes were introduced in postgraduate courses in Physiology, where face-to-face teaching was replaced with synchronous virtual mode for leader-centered (seminar, symposium) and participant-centered (journal club, group discussion) academic activities. We hypothesized that the effectiveness of virtual and face-to-face modes as perceived by postgraduate students in terms of facilitating their overall learning may differ across the spectrum of leader-centered and participant-centered activities. To assess the same, we designed and administered a comprehensive, structured, and validated feedback questionnaire. Postgraduate students (n = 29) rated virtual sessions significantly more convenient, but less attentive and comprehensible, and reported better audiovisual experience during face-to-face sessions. Students rated flexibility to attend, self-paced learning, ability to revise, lookup for information in real time, and accessibility to distant expertise as important features of virtual sessions and instant feedback, eye-to-eye contact, and ability to interact in the group for face-to-face sessions. Virtual and face-to-face sessions were perceived as equally effective in facilitating their overall learning for the conduct of leader-centered seminars and symposia. However, face-to-face sessions were considered more effective for the conduct of participant-centered group discussions and journal clubs. During the pandemic, students perceive the synchronous virtual mode as an equally effective alternative for the conduct of leader-centered academic activities, but face-to-face teaching is still preferred for the conduct of participant-centered academic activities.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze the caries protective factors, salivary parameters, and microbial counts in high caries risk children with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P). Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Setting: This study was conducted in a tertiary health care teaching hospital in New Delhi, India. Participants: The study was conducted in 40 children, 20 with CL/P and 20 without aged between 5 and 12 years. Methods: Children with 2 or more caries lesions in both groups were included in this study. Demographic details, dental caries of affected teeth (World Health Organization criteria for Decayed Missing Filled Teeth [WHO-DMFT] and International Caries Detection and Assessment System [ICDAS II]), caries protective factors, salivary parameters, and microbial counts were recorded by one calibrated investigator. Main Outcome Measures: Caries protective factors, salivary parameters, and microbial profile. Results: The Chi-square (chi(2)) test and Pearson correlation were used for statistical analysis. All the children participating in the study brushed their teeth only once in a day and consumed sweets more than twice a day. None of the children had ever received fluoride varnish. Resting saliva had a low buffering capacity in 80% of children with CL/P and 95% of children without CL/P. Microbial assessment of stimulated saliva showed that with the increases in the numbers (DMFT scores >= 4) and severity (ICDAS codes from 1-2 to 5-6) of caries lesions, both Streptococci and Lactobacilli counts were >= 10(5) colony-forming units/mL of saliva in the both groups. Conclusions: Children with CL/P showed limited access to caries protective measures and low buffering capacity in resting saliva, along with elevated levels of salivary Streptococci and Lactobacilli in stimulated saliva.

TI  - Intra-atrial right coronary artery on dual-source CT: prevalence and characteristics
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - PURPOSE
   We aimed to determine the prevalence rate and radiological characteristics of intra-atrial right coronary artery (IARCA) in an adult population undergoing computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) on a dual-source CT scanner.
   METHODS
   Overall, 7114 consecutive CTCAs acquired using a dual-source CT scanner in a high-volume, specialized cardiac care facility were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of IARCA. We scrutinized the CTCA datasets to determine the prevalence rate of IARCA and also to characterize its various imaging features including its length, depth from right atrial wall, segment involved, and presence and absence of atherosclerosis within the involved segment and in the rest of the right coronary artery (RCA).
   RESULTS
   The prevalence of IARCA was 0.29% (21/7114) in our study population. The mean length and depth of the intra-atrial segment was 14.85 mm and 2.57 mm, respectively. The mid-RCA was the most common segment to be involved, and no significant atherosclerosis was noted either in the intra-atrial segment or the rest of the RCA.
   CONCLUSION
   The prevalence rate of the incidental IARCA in the adult subjects undergoing CTCA is higher than previously reported for anatomical series, as seen in our study using a dual-source scanner. This under-reported anomaly must be explicitly assessed in patients undergoing ablative and other electrophysiological procedures, where it can have important implications.

AB  - Background & objectives: The prevalence of hypertension is increasing among all ethnic groups across the globe with only a handful of studies from India addressing the prevalence of hypertension among tribal population. In view of paucity of data, this study was aimed at estimating the prevalence of hypertension and associated risk factors among tribal population of Kashmir, India.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey included 6808 tribals aged >20 yr (5695 Gujjars and 1113 Bakarwals) from live randomly selected districts of Kashmir. Modified WHO-STEPS surveillance questionnaire was used to collect relevant data. Hypertension was defined by Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC 8) criteria.
   Results: The mean age of our study participants was 43.12 +/- 15.69 years. Overall prevalence of hypertension [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 41.4% (39.9-42.9%) [men=46.7% (44.1-49.1%); women 37.9% (35.9-39.9%)]. The prevalence of prehypertension (95% CI) in our study was 35 per cent (33.7-36.6%). Higher age [adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): >70 yr-2.2 (1.9-2.4)], passive smoking [OR-1.3 (1.1-1.5)], family history of hypertension [OR-1.6 (1.4-1.7)] and obesity [OR-1.3 (1.1-1.6)] were significantly associated with hypertension. A weak positive correlation was observed between BP (systolic/diastolic) with haemoglobin, red blood cell count and haematocrit (P<0.05).
   Interpretation & conclusions: Gujjar and Bakarwal tribes of Jammu and Kashmir showed high prevalence of hypertension. Hence, urgent policies and reforms are needed to tackle this silent epidemic and further studies focusing on community-based interventions are required.

Results Children with epilepsy receiving sodium valproate, phenytoin and carbamazepine were 111 (73%), 31 (20.4%) and 10 (6.6%), respectively, of which 7 were receiving multiple antiseizure drugs. Drug levels below the reference range were found in 64 (44.1%), within the reference range in 70 (48.3%), and the above reference range in 11 (7.6%) children. Conclusion Nearly half the children with breakthrough seizures had sub-therapeutic levels, especially those on phenytoin therapy. Drug levels in below therapeutic range were not associated with occurrence of breakthrough seizures.

AB  - Introduction: Hemangioblastomas (HMB) are extensively vascularized and benign neoplasms that are diagnosed predominantly in adults. The solid type of HMB is technically challenging to operate. The piecemeal resection of the tumor has been shown to have devastating intraoperative complications. Therefore, en-bloc tumor resection was shown to be the safest procedure to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding and facilitate the removal of large solid tumors. Unfortunately, most of these tumours are also not amenable for embolization, as they are fed by multiple pial vessels. However, the large arterial feeders may be embolized.
   Objective: This video abstract presents a case of en-bloc resection of a giant solid type of Vermian HMB.
   Surgical Technique: A 38-year-old male patient presented with headache and vomiting for 1 year, imbalance during walking for 6 months, and hoarseness of voice for 2 months. He underwent a CSF diversion procedure in another hospital and was referred to our center for definitive surgery. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed a large heterogeneously enhancing solid lesion of size 46 x 33 x 40 mm(3) with central necrotic area in the posterior fossa with perilesional edema and several large flow voids on T2-MR sequence. Preoperative embolization was performed; however, there was no significant reduction in the vascularity of the lesion. The patient underwent a wide midline suboccipital craniotomy with C1 laminectomy and gross total en-bloc resection of HMB.
   Results: The patient had an uneventful recovery in the postoperative period.
   Conclusions: The safest approach in the resection of giant solid HMB involves proper preoperative planning and understanding the vascular pattern of the lesion, wide exposure, circumferential dissection, and the en-bloc delivery of the tumor.

AB  - In this paper we assessed how lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can be used to teach students the physiological effects of central hypovolemia in the absence of the LBNP and/or a medical monitor using a "dry lab" activity using LBNP data that have been previously collected. This activity was performed using published LBNP papers, with which students could explore LBNP as an important tool to study physiological responses to central hypovolemia as well as consider issues in performing an LBNP experiment and interpreting experimental results. The activity was performed at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, with 31 graduate students and 4 teachers of physiology. Both students and teachers were provided with a set of questionnaires that inquired about aspects related to the structure of the activity and how this activity integrated research and knowledge, as well as aspects related to motivation of the students and teachers to perform the activity. Our results from student and teacher surveys suggest that a "dry lab" activity using LBNP to teach physiology can be an important tool to expose students to the basics of systems physiology as well as to provide useful insights into how research is performed. Providing insight into research includes formulating a research question and then designing (including taking into account confounding variables), implementing, conducting, and interpreting research studies. Finally, developing such an activity using LBNP can also serve as a basis for developing research capacities and interests of students even early in their medical studies.

AB  - Background One of the challenges has been coping with an increasing need for COVID-19 testing. A COVID-19 screening and testing facility was created. There was a need for increasing throughput of the facility within the existing space and limited resources. Discrete event simulation was used to address this challenge. Methodology A cross-sectional interventional study was done from September 2020 to October 2020. Detailed process mapping with all micro-processes was done. Patient arrival patterns and time taken at each step were measured by two independent observers at random intervals over two weeks. The existing system was simulated and a bottleneck was identified. Two possible alternatives to the problem were simulated and evaluated. Results Scenario 1 showed a maximum throughput of 316. The average milestone times of all the processes after the step of "Preparation of sampling kits" jumped 62%; from 82 to 133 min. Staff state times also showed that staff at this step was stretched and medical lab technicians were underutilized. Scenario 2 simulated the alternative with lesser time spent on sampling kit preparation with a 22.4% increase in throughput, but could have led to impaired quality check. Scenario 3 simulated with increased manpower at the stage of bottleneck with 26.5% increase in throughput and was implemented on-ground. Conclusion Discrete event simulation helped to identify the bottleneck, simulate possible alternative solutions without disturbing the ongoing work, and finally choose the most suitable intervention to increase throughput, without the need for additional space allocation. It therefore helped to optimally utilize resources and get "more from less."

AB  - From March to June 2021, India experienced a deadly second wave of COVID-19, with an increased number of post-vaccination breakthrough infections reported across the country. To understand the possible reason for these breakthroughs, we collected 677 clinical samples (throat swab/nasal swabs) of individuals from 17 states/Union Territories of the country who had received two doses (n = 592) and one dose (n = 85) of vaccines and tested positive for COVID-19. These cases were telephonically interviewed and clinical data were analyzed. A total of 511 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were recovered with genome coverage of higher than 98% from both groups. Analysis of both groups determined that 86.69% (n = 443) of them belonged to the Delta variant, along with Alpha, Kappa, Delta AY.1, and Delta AY.2. The Delta variant clustered into four distinct sub-lineages. Sub-lineage I had mutations in ORF1ab A1306S, P2046L, P2287S, V2930L, T3255I, T3446A, G5063S, P5401L, and A6319V, and in N G215C; Sub-lineage II had mutations in ORF1ab P309L, A3209V, V3718A, G5063S, P5401L, and ORF7a L116F; Sub-lineage III had mutations in ORF1ab A3209V, V3718A, T3750I, G5063S, and P5401L and in spike A222V; Sub-lineage IV had mutations in ORF1ab P309L, D2980N, and F3138S and spike K77T. This study indicates that majority of the breakthrough COVID-19 clinical cases were infected with the Delta variant, and only 9.8% cases required hospitalization, while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases. This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality.

AB  - Immune-mediated demyelination is a rare posttransplant complication. Here, we report an 8.5-year-old boy who developed left hemiparesis, 18 months post matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and was diagnosed to have tumefactive demyelination. The diagnosis was established based on clinical and radiological features. The complete resolution of the lesions with steroids further established the immune-mediated pathophysiology.

AB  - Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial disorder that causes loss of central vision. Three primary variants (m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A, and m.14484T>C) and about 16 secondary variants are responsible for LHON in the majority of the cases. We investigated the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of 189 LHON patients and found a total of 54 disease-linked pathogenic variants. The primary variants m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C were accountable for only 14.81% and 2.64% cases, respectively. Patients with these two variants also possessed additional disease-associated variants. Among 156 patients who lacked the three primary variants, 16.02% harboured other LHON-associated variants either alone or in combination with other disease-associated variants. Furthermore, we observed that none of the haplogroups were explicitly associated with LHON. We performed a meta-analysis of m.4216T>C and m.13708G>A and found a significant association of these two variants with the LHON phenotype. Based on this study, we recommend the use of complete mtDNA sequencing to diagnose LHON, as we found disease-associated variants throughout the mitochondrial genome.

AB  - Development of scaffold from biopolymers can ease the requirements for donor skin autograft and plays an effective role in the treatment of burn wounds. In the current study, a porous foam based, bilayered hydrogel scaffold was developed using gelatin, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate (G-HA-CS). The fabricated scaffold was characterized physicochemically for pre- and post-sterilization efficacy by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). In-vitro studies proved that the scaffold promoted cellular proliferation. The efficacy of G-HA-CS scaffold was compared with Integra (TM) at different time points (7, 14, 21 and 42 days), in a swine second degree burn wound model. Remarkable healing potential of the scaffold was evident from the wound contraction rate, reduction of IL-6, TNF-alpha and C3. The expression of healing markers TGF-beta 1 and collagen 1 revealed significant skin regeneration with regulated fibroblast activation towards the late phase of healing (p < 0.001 at day 21 and 42 vs. control). Expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), vimentin and N-cadherin were found to favor angiogenesis and skin regeneration. Mechanistically, scaffold promoted wound healing by modulation of CD-45, cyclooxygenase-2 and MMP-2. Thus, the promising results with foam based scaffold, comparable to Integra (TM) in swine burn injury model offer an innovative lead for clinical translation for effective management of burn wound.

AB  - Carnoy's solution (CS) is routinely used as adjuvant therapy in the management of odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) and a few other benign lesions. The purpose of this study was to explore the evidence of its application and efficacy in benign lesions other than OKC. We have systematically reviewed published articles to identify the evidence of CS in benign jaw lesions other than OKC following the PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and the Cochrane Library database, to find relevant articles from 1980 to March 2020. Finally, 39 studies were analysed in this review. It included studies where CS was used as an adjunct for the benign lesion of the jaw and followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Thirty-nine studies with 11 different types of lesion were reported where CS was used as an adjuvant and application time was restricted to 3-5 minutes. Recurrence were reported only in ameloblastoma cases [unicystic = 10.98% (10/91), mixed = 18.18% (26/143)]. Meta-analysis was not possible as all studies were non-controlled in nature. Based on the available data, there was no strong evidence for the use of CS as an adjuvant in the benign lesion of the jaw. Prospective and randomised control studies are recommended for the best stratification for the use of CS. (c) 2021 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Objectives To investigate if intravenous fentanyl or intravenous ketamine can provide adequate analgesia in preterm infants undergoing laser photocoagulation for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Design Open-label randomised trial. Setting Tertiary care institution. Participants Preterm infants who underwent laser photocoagulation for ROP. Interventions Infants were randomised to receive fentanyl as intravenous bolus dose of 2 mu g/kg, followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 mu g/kg/hour increased to a maximum of 3 mu g/kg/hour or intravenous ketamine as bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg, followed by further intermittent intravenous bolus doses of 0.5 mg/kg to a maximum of 2 mg/kg in the initial phase and intravenous fentanyl (bolus of 2 mu g/kg followed by infusion of 2 mu g/kg/hour to a maximum of 5 mu g/kg/hour) or intravenous ketamine (bolus dose of 1 mg/kg followed by intermittent bolus doses of 0.5 mg/kg to a maximum of 4 mg/kg) in the revised regimen phase. Main outcome measures Proportion of infants with adequate analgesia defined as the presence of both: (1) all the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised scores measured every 15 min less than seven and (2) proportion of the procedure time the infant spent crying less than 5%. Secondary outcomes included apnoea, cardiorespiratory or haemodynamic instability, feed intolerance and urinary retention requiring catheterisation during and within 24 hours following the procedure. Results A total of 97 infants were randomised (fentanyl=51, ketamine=46). The proportions of infants with adequate analgesia were 16.3% (95% CI 8.5% to 29%) with fentanyl and 4.5% (95% CI 1.3% to 15.1%) with ketamine. Ten infants (19.6%) in the fentanyl group and seven infants (15.2%) in the ketamine group had one or more side effects. In view of inadequate analgesia with both the regimens, the study steering committee recommended using a higher dose of intravenous fentanyl and intravenous ketamine. Consequently, we enrolled 27 infants (fentanyl=13, ketamine=14). With revised regimens, the proportions of infants with adequate analgesia were higher: 23.1% (95% CI 8.2% to 50.2%) with fentanyl and 7.1% (95% CI 1.3% to 31.5%) with ketamine. However, higher proportions of infants developed apnoea (n=4; 30.7%), need for supplemental oxygen (n=5, 38.4%) and change in cardiorespiratory scores (n=7; 53.8%) with fentanyl but none with ketamine. Conclusions Fentanyl-based and ketamine-based drug regimens provided adequate analgesia only in a minority of infants undergoing laser photocoagulation for ROP. More research is needed to find safe and effective regimens that can be employed in resource constrained settings.

TI  - A Global Survey of Emergency Department Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE

AB  - Introduction: Emergency departments (ED) globally are addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with varying degrees of success. We leveraged the 17-country, Emergency Medicine Education & Research by Global Experts (EMERGE) network and non-EMERGE ED contacts to understand ED emergency preparedness and practices globally when combating the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We electronically surveyed EMERGE and non-EMERGE EDs from April 3-June 1, 2020 on ED capacity, pandemic preparedness plans, triage methods, staffing, supplies, and communication practices. The survey was available in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish to optimize participation. We analyzed survey responses using descriptive statistics.
   Results: 74/129 (57%) EDs from 28 countries in all six World Health Organization global regions responded. Most EDs were in Asia (49%), followed by North America (28%), and Europe (14%). Nearly all EDs (97%) developed and implemented protocols for screening, testing, and treating patients with suspected COVID-19 infections. Sixty percent responded that provider staffing/back-up plans were ineffective. Many sites (47/74, 64%) reported staff missing work due to possible illness with the highest provider proportion of COVID-19 exposures and infections among nurses.
   Conclusion: Despite having disaster plans in place, ED pandemic preparedness and response continue to be a challenge. Global emergency research networks are vital for generating and disseminating large-scale event data, which is particularly important during a pandemic.

AB  - Background: Major neurocognitive disorders (major NCD) predominantly affect the elderly. Major NCD results in significant morbidity and socioeconomic burden.
   Objectives: To estimate the individual cost of care of a person with major NCD according to disease severity and component costs.
   Methods and Material: Fifty patients of major NCD with primary caregivers attending memory clinic of tertiary care center were included. A detailed questionnaire administered after inclusion provided demographic and clinical information. Caregivers were interviewed about details of care provided. Cognitive function was assessed by Hindi mental state examination (HMSE), and major NCD severity was determined by clinical dementia rating scale (CDR).
   Results: The annual cost of care per patient with mild to moderate and severe major MCD was INR 78288 and INR 167808, respectively. Costs increased with increasing severity of the disease. Direct nonmedical costs were significantly higher than direct medical costs in severe major NCD group and vice versa was found in mild to moderate major NCD group.
   Conclusion: Increasing population of elderly and prevalence of major NCD suggest an economic burden on caring families and hence the government. Comprehensive health policy toward providing affordable care to people with major NCD is the need of the hour.

AB  - Background: Chronic stress is known to be associated with dementia.
   Aim: This study looked for major stressors and their associations with dementia in the elderly demented population.
   Methods: Case group consisted of 60 subjects (age group 55-75 years; M:F = 7:3) with postscreening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's type dementia. Control group consisted of two subgroups: related (N = 60) and not-related (N = 60) subjects screened and confirmed not to be suffering from cognitive impairment. Sociodemographic variables were collected using a personal data sheet. The severity of cognitive impairment was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale. Subjects with a CDR score of range 0.5-1 were included in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's type dementia. Stressful life events were evaluated using the Presumptive Stressful Life Event Scale (PSLES). A present stress level of caregivers was evaluated using Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Assessed stress level scores were compared and validated with serum and plasma levels of cortisol and ACTH respectively.
   Results: Different groups exhibited distinct PSLES and DASS scores with statistical significance. It was also observed that Cortisol and ACTH levels were elevated in case group as compared with that of both sub-group controls.
   Conclusions: The outcome measures of this study projected that neural degeneration leading to mild cognitive impairment and dementia may be due to accumulative cortisol hormone associated with stressful life events.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the efficacy of daily supplementation of 200 mL milk fortified with 240 IU of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Design Double-blind randomized controlled trial. Settings School-based study in Delhi between October and December, 2019. Participants 235 healthy children aged 10-14 years. Intervention Daily supplementation of 200 mL milk fortified with 240 IU of ergocalciferol in intervention group (n=119) and 200 mL of plain milk in control group (n =116) for 3 months. Outcome Measures Change in serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone formation and resorption markers, and urinary calcium creatinine ratio (U-Ca/CrR). Results The mean (SD) baseline serum 25(OH) D level in control and fortification groups was 11.9 (3.8) and 11.4 (3.6) ng/mL (P=0.23), respectively. The serum 25(OH)D levels did not increase post-intervention with the dose used for fortification, but were significantly higher in intervention group as compared to control group [10.8 (3.4) vs 6.7 (3.5) ng/mL; P<0.001]. A higher proportion of secondary hyperparathyroidism was observed post-intervention in control (39%) than in intervention group (13.3%); P<0.001. Serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide levels were similar in both groups but the serum procollagen type1 N-terminal propeptide levels were higher in the control than intervention group (P<0.007), following supplementation. Conclusion Supplementation of milk fortified with approximately 240 IU vitamin D2 for three months did not achieve sufficient serum 25(OH)D levels in Indian children with vitamin D deficiency during winter.

AB  - Cross-reactive epitopes (CREs) are similar epitopes on viruses that are recognized or neutralized by same antibodies. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and crossreactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. Collectively, our observations suggest that human monoclonal antibodies tolerating extensive epitope variability can be leveraged to neutralize pathogens with related antigenic profile.

TI  - Scaling up Kangaroo Mother Care in Ethiopia and India: a multi-site implementation research study
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
KW  - BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS
AB  - Objectives Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), prolonged skin-to-skin care of the low birth weight baby with the mother plus exclusive breastfeeding reduces neonatal mortality. Global KMC coverage is low. This study was conducted to develop and evaluate context-adapted implementation models to achieve improved coverage.
   Design This study used mixed-methods applying implementation science to develop an adaptable strategy to improve implementation. Formative research informed the initial model which was refined in three iterative cycles. The models included three components: (1) maximising access to KMC-implementing facilities, (2) ensuring KMC initiation and maintenance in facilities and (3) supporting continuation at home postdischarge.
   Participants 3804 infants of birth weight under 2000g who survived the first 3 days, were available in the study area and whose mother resided in the study area.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were coverage of KMC during the 24 hours prior to discharge and at 7days postdischarge.
   Results Key barriers and solutions were identified for scaling up KMC. The resulting implementation model achieved high population-based coverage. KMC initiation reached 68%-86% of infants in Ethiopian sites and 87% in Indian sites. At discharge, KMC was provided to 68% of infants in Ethiopia and 55% in India. At 7days postdischarge, KMC was provided to 53%-65% of infants in all sites, except Oromia (38%) and Karnataka (36%).
   Conclusions This study shows how high coverage of KMC can be achieved using context-adapted models based on implementation science. They were supported by govemment leadership, health workers' conviction that KMC is the standard of care, women's and families' acceptance of KMC, and changes in infrastructure, policy, skills and practice.

AB  - Objective India is experiencing an increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Mobile health technology may be a strategy to reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disorders. This paper reports on the effect of a mobile health intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods The mobile health and diabetes intervention was a 12-week reality television-based mobile health program application delivered via videos, short message service and infographics through a smartphone application followed-up weekly by health coach calls. mobile health and diabetes was conducted in a randomized control trial mode randomized controlled trial methodology in three Indian cities (Chennai, Bengaluru and New Delhi) with participants recruited via community screening events. This paper looks at the pre-post changes in cardiometabolic risks among the participants and the place of demography in influencing these. Results The mobile health and diabetes intervention group experienced a small reduction in waist circumference (1.8 cm) compared to the control group (0.5 cm, p < 0.05) and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure (2.7 mmHg) compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors were more pronounced in individuals with obesity, although overall effects were very modest Conclusions Cardiometabolic risk factors can be reduced with a mobile health application using human coaching, especially in obese individuals, but the improvements are small. To be more effective and clinically meaningful, intensive engagement with the participants is probably required.

AB  - Purpose: The study of papilledema with a novel noninvasive technique such as spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) provides minute and detailed cross-sectional changes thus giving an insight into the application of biomechanical principles and pathophysiology of disc edema. Methods: We measured average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and the retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch's membrane (RPE/BM) angle at the temporal and nasal borders of the neural canal opening (NCO) in 30 eyes with papilledema, 30 eyes with papillitis, and 80 control eyes. The inward angulation was considered as positive and the outward as negative. Follow-up was done at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. The main outcome measures are the average RNFL thickness and the RPE/BM angle. Results: 29 eyes (96.6%) with papilledema had a positive RPE/BM angle (+8.11 +/- 3.13). 29 eyes (96.6%) with papillitis had a negative RPE/BM angle (-1.04 +/- 3.27). On follow-up at 1 month, both RNFL thickness (P = 0.01) and RPE-BM angle (P = 0.001) reduced significantly in eyes with papilledema; in eyes with papillitis, there was a significant reduction in the RNFL thickness (P = 0.02), but not in the RPE-BM angle (P > 0.05). RNFL thickness in papilledema cases normalized at 3 months whereas RPE/BM normalized at 6 months of follow-up. To detect papilledema, OCT has a sensitivity of 96.66% and specificity of 99.09% on both nasal and temporal sides. Conclusion: After appropriate treatment, the RPE/BM angle in papilledema decreased much later than the RNFL thickness. Hence, the RPE/BM angle in papilledema (positive) can be used to differentiate it from papillitis (negative) and also to monitor the activity of the disease.

AB  - During September-December 2020, we conducted a multi-center retrospective study across India to evaluate epidemiology and outcomes among cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Among 287 mucormycosis patients, 187 (65.2%) had CAM; CAM prevalence was 0.27% among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We noted a 2.1-fold rise in mucormycosis during the study period compared with September-December 2019. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among CAM and non-CAM patients. COVID-19 was the only underlying disease in 32.6% of CAM patients. COVID-19-related hypoxemia and improper glucocorticoid use independently were associated with CAM. The mucormycosis case-fatality rate at 12 weeks was 45.7% but was similar for CAM and non-CAM patients. Age, rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement, and intensive care unit admission were associated with increased mortality rates; sequential antifungal drug treatment improved mucormycosis survival. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases in mucormycosis in India, partly from inappropriate glucocorticoid use.

AB  - Over the past few years, there has been remarkable development in the area of optic neuritis. The discovery of new antibodies has improved our understanding of the pathology of the disease. Antiaquaporin4 antibodies and antimyelin oligodendrocytes antibodies are now considered as distinct entities of optic neuritis with their specific clinical presentation, neuroimaging characteristics, treatment options, and course of the disease. Similarly, there has been a substantial change in the treatment of optic neuritis which was earlier limited to steroids and interferons. The development of new immunosuppressant drugs and monoclonal antibodies has reduced the relapses and improved the prognosis of optic neuritis as well as an associated systemic disease. This review article tends to provide an update on the approach and management of optic neuritis.

AB  - With the current pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hand, researchers around the globe are dexterously working to find the best suitable drug candidates and overcome vaccination-related challenges, to achieve efficient control over the second surge of COVID-19. The medical consultants time and again have been reiterating the need to abide by the precautionary steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by maintaining social distancing when outside, sanitizing hands regularly, and wearing masks and gloves. They also suggest taking a good and hygienic meal so as to boost immunity. Indians have an inborn nature of using natural spices, food, and medicines in their daily lives. Indian researchers have paid heed to deploy compounds from natural sources to explore potential antiviral agents against COVID-19 as the chances of acquiring side effects are perceived as less, and the efficacy of phytochemicals from medicinal plants is sometimes greater when compared to their synthetic counterparts. In the present study, we performed an in silico molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation analysis of screened phytochemicals from a comprehensive list of Ayurvedic herbs/functional foods that are present in natural food products against key receptor proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We found that Aegle marmelos, Vetiveria zizanoides, Moringaolifera, and Punica granatum have antiviral potential to prevent coronavirus infection in the populace.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate biocompatibility and safety of plasma-treated poly-epsilon-caprolactone (pPCL) membrane compared to the human amniotic membrane in the healing of corneal epithelial defects in an experimental model. Methods: This is a prospective, randomized animal study including 12 rabbits. Circular epithelial injury measuring 6 mm in diameter was induced over the central cornea of one eye in twelve rabbits. The rabbits were randomized into two groups; in group A, the defect was covered with human amniotic membrane, while in group B, an artificial membrane made of bio-polymer plasma-treated poly-epsilon-caprolactone was grafted. Six rabbits were euthanized after 1 month and the other six after 3 months and the corneal epithelium was evaluated histopathologically and with immunohistochemistry. Results: Light microscopy of the corneal tissue performed after 1 month and 3 months demonstrated similar findings with no significant complications in either group. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CK-3 antibody showed characteristic corneal phenotype in the healed epithelium. In eyes grafted with pPCL membrane, epithelial healing as estimated by a decrease in size of the defect was significantly better than the group treated with the human amniotic membrane at all time periods monitored (P < 0.05), except day 1 (P = 0.83). The percentage reduction in the size of the epithelial defect was also significantly more in the pPCL membrane group as compared to the human amniotic membrane at all time periods (P < 0.05 at all observations) post-implantation except day 1 (P = 0.73). Conclusion: Plasma-treated poly-epsilon-caprolactone membrane is safe, biocompatible, and effective in the healing of corneal epithelial defects in rabbits.

TI  - Impact of Recent SARS-CoV-2 Infection on the Course and Severity of Dengue in Children: A Prospective Observational Study from North India
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
KW  - COVID-19
AB  - In 2020, a considerable overlap occurred between the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal dengue transmission in India. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute or recent infection with SARS-CoV-2 on the course and outcomes of dengue fever in children. We prospectively enrolled 44 children with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of dengue fever. Assessment of acute and recent SARS-CoV-2 infection was done using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and IgG antibody through ELISA. Children were grouped based on evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and clinical severity, and outcomes were compared. The median age of the study cohort was 96 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 69-129 months). Fever (98%), vomiting (78%), abdominal pain (68%), hepatomegaly (68%), and edema (32%) were the common features. About two-thirds (N 5 30) had severe dengue; 20 (45%) had dengue shock. Liver dysfunction (58%) and acute kidney injury (25%) were other major organ dysfunctions. Nineteen (43%) children stayed in the pediatric intensive care unit for a median duration of 5 days (IQR: 2-11 days). None had acute SARS-CoV2 infection; however, IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 15 (34%) cases. Children with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 showed a trend toward a lower incidence of acute kidney injury, fewer organ dysfunctions, and a lower frequency of invasive ventilation. Four children (9%) died; none of the deaths were in the SARS-CoV-2-exposed group. The present study exposes preliminary evidence that dengue fever might follow a less severe course in children with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is pertinent to understand the antigenic similarity and cross-protective antibody response between the two viruses and their clinical relevance.

AB  - With rapid urbanization and the Indian nutrition transition, Indian adolescents face a high risk of developing an energy imbalance. This study aims to assess the prevalence of excessive weight, underweight, and associated knowledge and lifestyle behaviors among private school-going adolescents in Delhi. A cross-sectional study was conducted in students (6th-7th grades) of eight randomly selected private schools in Delhi, India in 2019. A self-administered survey was used to assess students' dietary-and-physical-activity-related knowledge and behavior. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist circumference) were also conducted. Out of 1567 participants, 7.2% were underweight, 61.3% normal, and 31.5% excess in weight. Underweight was associated with significantly more eating whilst studying for exams (relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Excessive weight was associated with less incorrect knowledge on behaviors causing overweight (RRR 0.7 (0.5-0.9)), more often reading nutritional labels of packed food items (RRR 0.6 (0.4-0.9)), and less frequent vegetable-intake (RRR 0.7 (0.4-0.9)). Underweight students showed more suboptimal knowledge and unhealthy behaviors, whilst students with excessive weight showed more correct knowledge and healthy behaviors. This study highlights the immediate need for effective health-promoting interventions focused on the importance of healthy lifestyle at least in underweight adolescents.

AB  - Cannabinoids are chemicals derived naturally from the cannabis plant or are synthetically manufactured. They interact directly with cannabinoid receptors or share chemical similarity with endocannabinoids (or both). Within palliative medicine, cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) may modulate some cancer symptoms: appetite, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and mood, pain and sleep disorders. Opioid and cannabinoid receptors have overlapping neuroanatomical receptor distribution, particularly at the dorsal horn, dorsal striatum and locus coeruleus. They have a favourable safety profile compared with opioids, and cannabis-based medicines help chronic pain. While cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-inflammatory properties, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the psychoactive substance for issues such as mood and sleep. Nabiximols (Sativex), a CBD:THC combination, is Food and Drug Administration approved for some multiple sclerosis symptoms and epilepsy. There has been a swift societal evolution in attitudes about use of cannabis and cannabinoid medicines for chronic pain. In the USA, 33 states have now legalised prescription-based medical cannabis for several medical conditions; Canada has had legislation since 2001 authorising medical use. The European Union (EU) recently declared all EU citizens must have access to medical cannabis over the next 4 years. The integration into medicine and routine clinical use of cannabis is fraught with information gaps, regulatory issues and scarcity of research. Each patient should have a comprehensive assessment and risk-benefit discussion before any cannabis-based intervention to avoid possible complications such as hallucinations, psychosis and potential cardiac harm.

AB  - We present the case of a 33-year-old woman with complaints of headache and palpitations with raised urinary catecholamines. Ultrasound of the abdomen was noncontributory, and the patient was referred for Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT, which revealed tracer accumulation in the thecal sac/spinal canal at D5-D7 level, suggestive of a thoracic paraganglioma. MRI of the spine subsequently confirmed the presence of an extradural mass in the spinal canal extending from D4 to D8.

AB  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed on the endothelial cells of tumor-associated neovasculature of various nonprostatic benign and malignant neoplasms. Positive intense uptake on PET/CT imaging with Ga-68-labeled PSMA is noted in a patient with sinonasal glomangiopericytoma, and the same is noted to be absent following complete surgical excision. Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT may be a useful tool for early recurrence identification, differentiating recurrence from surgical site reparative tissues, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy of residual lesions.

AB  - Justification Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a significant problem in India and other developing countries; however, several aspects of this disease have no clear, practical guidelines. There is a need for pragmatic guidelines, summarizing the available evidence, and filling in the gaps in evidence with expert advice to manage children with neurocysticercosis. Process An expert group (16 members) and a writing group (8 members) was constituted, consisting of members with varied expertise. It included pediatric neurologists (18), neurologist (1), Neuroradiologists (4), and a parasitologist (1). The writing group divided the six topics and reviewed the literature on the topics individually to determine the clinical questions for which no clear guidance was available from the literature. The experts were then contacted and opinions were obtained online. The Delphi consensus method was adopted to arrive at a general consensus regarding various questions, with both the experts and the writing group members contributing. The final guidelines were then drafted by the writing group. Recommendations Diagnosis of NCC should be based on clinical history and neuroimaging. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is the modality of choice. For single enhancing lesion, albendazole therapy for 10-14 days is recommended, and it should be combined with praziquantel for 10-14 days for more than one ring-enhancing lesions. For persistent lesion, the same dose and duration of albendazole or concurrent administration of albendazole and praziquantel should be given. Pulse intravenous steroids should be used to reduce the acute symptomatic edema in children with cysticercal encephalitis. Carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are best suited for seizure prophylaxis for those who present with seizures; phenytoin and levetiracetam are the other alternatives. In the case of NCC presenting with symptoms other than seizures, there appears to be no role for routine anti-seizure medication prophylaxis. For a single ring-enhancing lesion, six months of anti-seizure medication is sufficient if the lesion resolves on follow-up. Those with persistent lesions, calcification, or multiple lesions, require a longer treatment duration of at least 24 months.

KW  - INDIA
AB  - Background: Persons with disability (PwD) are entitled to certain benefits from the State on grounds of being disabled. With the recent enactment of the Rights of PwD Act, 2016, and increased efforts to provide assistance to persons with certifiable disabilities, data pertaining to disability requests can be useful to understand the way in which services are utilized.
   Materials and Methods: This study is an audit of the disability certificates issued to all subjects with age >= 18 years between 2016 and 2019 at a tertiary care general hospital psychiatry unit, and discusses the pattern and profile of the certificates.
   Results: A total of 356 patients were issued disability certificates (2016-2019). The mean age of the subjects was 32.8 (+/- 11.2) years and about 30% of them were females. Intellectual disability (58.3%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by schizophrenia and related disorders (31%), while all other disorders constituted a smaller proportion (11%) of the sample. About 60% of the subjects had moderate disability, 37.4% had severe disability, and 1.7% had profound disability.
   Conclusion: A large majority of the certificates were issued to subjects with intellectual disability. Patients with severe mental illnesses are probably not accessing the disability benefits optimally. This audit also points to under-representation of women as well as an overall underutilization of services by individuals with mental disability.

AB  - Purpose:The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness and perform cost-utility analysis of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) vs. penetrating keratoplasty (PK) in Indian population. Methods:This was an institutional, ambispective, observational study. Patients who underwent PK or DSAEK for endothelial dysfunction were included and followed up for 2 years; those with other ocular comorbidities were excluded. The analysis was performed from the patient's perspective receiving subsidized treatment at a tertiary care hospital. Detailed history, ophthalmic examination, total expenditure by patient, and clinical outcomes were recorded. The main outcome measures were best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), graft survival (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). Utility values were based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with visual acuity outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software package, version 12.1; a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results:A total of 120 patients (PK: 60, DSAEK: 60) were included. At 2 years, for a similar logMAR BSCVA, [PK (0.32 +/- 0.02), DSAEK (0.25 +/- 0.02); P = 0.078], the overall cost for PK (13511.1 +/- 803.3 INR) was significantly more than DSAEK (11092.9 +/- 492.1 INR) (difference = 1952.6 INR; P = 0.01). ICER of DSAEK relative to PK was -39,052 INR for improvement in 1 logMAR unit BSCVA. ICUR of DSAEK relative to PK was -1,95,260 INR for improvement in 1 QALY. Conclusion:DSAEK was more cost-effective than PK in patients with endothelial dysfunction at 2 years.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the physical and microbiological characteristics of McCarey-Kaufman (MK), Cornisol, and Optisol-GS media and evaluate the outcomes of keratoplasty performed using corneas stored in these three media. Methods: The study involved 60 donor corneas which were distributed in 3 groups: MK, Cornisol, and Optisol-GS. Corneas in these groups were further analyzed based on the type of keratoplasty performed (full thickness versus endothelial keratoplasty). At baseline, the endothelial cell density and death to preservation time of donor corneas were recorded. Following keratoplasty, patients were evaluated on day 1, at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-up. Outcomes were assessed in terms of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), endothelial cell density, percentage endothelial cell loss, and corneal thickness. The storage media were also assessed for their physical quality and their microbiological characteristics. Results: Physical characteristics of all three media were found to be within normal limits. Mean CDVA was comparable among the 3 groups at 6-month follow-up. The absolute endothelial cell count values were significantly lower for corneas stored in MK medium (1873.7 +/- 261.1 cells/mm2) compared to the Cornisol (2085.0 +/- 230.3 cells/mm(2)) and Optisol-GS media [(2180.3 +/- 217.2 cells/mm(2)) (P = <0.001)]. Corneas stored in Optisol-GS medium were significantly thinner at 1-month follow-up with no significant difference at 6 months (P = 0.66). Conclusion: Optisol-GS and Cornisol media were found to preserve endothelial cell density better and stabilize corneal thickness earlier as compared to the MK medium. However, the functional outcomes were comparable among the three groups.

AB  - Background: IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD) is a multisystemic progressive fibroinflammatory and lymphoproliferative autoimmune disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis; and its occurrence in intradural extramedullary (IDEM) location is extremely rare.
   Aim and Objective: The aim of this study was to review all IDEM IgG4RD cases described in English literature and to signify the role of surgery in its management at this rare location along with the surgical technique and intraoperative findings.
   Methods: An Internet-based search (PubMed) for the published reports describing spinal cases of IgG4RD with IDEM involvement was done using the keyword: spinal IgG4-related disease. An illustration of a case of cranial IgG4-related disease in a young man who developed metachronous cervical involvement in intradural extramedullary (IDEM) location is also presented.
   Results: Amongst 45 spinal IgG4RD cases reported in English Literature, only 3 cases were IDEM IgG4RD. In the illustrated case, portion of the cervical lesion causing cervical cord encasement was intradural but extraarachnoidal-located between arachnoid and dura, without any pial involvement. All these 4 cases improved following surgery.
   Conclusion: Timely meticulous resection of mass lesion in situations of medical treatment failure or progressive neurological decline can lead to reversibility of mass effect-associated neurological manifestations of IgG4RD.

AB  - Cutaneous signs in dermatology are pathognomonic or diagnostic for certain conditions. A knowledge of these signs is a useful skill, which must not be forgotten in the recent trend towards relying on molecular biology and other investigative tools including histological findings to make a diagnosis. The aim of this review is to summarize all cutaneous signs in dermatology in a systematic way that would benefit dermatologists, trainee or experienced, in identifying diseases and sharpening their clinical skills. A keyword search for the terms "cutaneous signs," "sign" AND "dermatology" was conducted through PUBMED, Google, and the major textbooks in dermatology (i.e., Rooks Textbook of Dermatology; Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine and Dermatology). References were searched thoroughly for all cutaneous signs described. One hundred and nineteen signs were noted and summarized under the following categories: autoimmune, infective, inflammatory, neoplastic, genetic, trauma/miscellaneous. This review would serve as a good reference for those wanting to improve their clinical acumen in diagnosing dermatological disease.

AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals are at an increased risk for coinfections; therefore, physicians need to be cognizant about excluding other treatable respiratory pathogens. Here, we report coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in patients admitted to the coronavirus disease (COVID) care facilities of an Indian tertiary care hospital. From June 2020 through January 2021, we tested 191 patients with SARS-CoV-2 for 33 other respiratory pathogens using an fast track diagnostics respiratory pathogen 33 (FTD-33) assay. Additionally, information regarding other relevant respiratory pathogens was collected by reviewing their laboratory data. Overall, 13 pathogens were identified among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 46.6% (89/191) of patients had coinfection with one or more additional pathogens. Bacterial coinfections (41.4% [79/191]) were frequent, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and Pneumocystis jirovecii or Legionella pneumophila were also identified. The viral coinfection rate was 7.3%, with human adenovirus and human rhinovirus being the most common. Five patients in our cohort had positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii and K. pneumoniae, and two patients had active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In total, 47.1% (90/191) of patients with coinfections were identified. The higher proportion of patients with coinfections in our cohort supports the systemic use of antibiotics in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with rapid de-escalation based on respiratory PCR/culture results. The timely and simultaneous identification of coinfections can contribute to improved health of COVID-19 patients and enhanced antibiotic stewardship during the pandemic.
   IMPORTANCE Coinfections in COVID-19 patients may worsen disease outcomes and need further investigation. We found that a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 were coinfected with one or more additional pathogens. A better understanding of the prevalence of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients and the profile of pathogens can contribute to effective patient management and antibiotic stewardship during the current pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: Genetically defined spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1 and 2 patients have differential clinical profile along with probable distinctive cortical and subcortical neurodegeneration. We compared the degree of brain atrophy in the two subtypes with their phenotypic and genotypic parameters.
   Methods: MRI was performed using a 3T scanner (Philips, Achieva) to obtain 3D T1-weighted scans of the whole brain and analyzed by FreeSurfer (version 5.3 and 6 dev.) software. Genetically proven SCA1 (n = 18) and SCA2 (n = 25) patients with age-matched healthy controls (n = 8) were recruited. Clinical severity was assessed by the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). To know the differential pattern of atrophy, the groups were compared using ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis test and followed by correlation analysis with multiple corrections. Further, machine learning-based classification of SCA subtypes was carried out.
   Result: We found (i) bilateral frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital atrophy in SCA1 and SCA2 patients; (ii) reduced volume of cerebellum, regions of brain stem, basal ganglia along with the certain subcortical areas such as hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, diencephalon, and corpus callosum in SCA1 and SCA2 subtypes; (iii) higher subcortical atrophy SCA2 than SCA1 (iv) correlation between brain atrophy and disease attributes; (v) differential predictive pattern of two SCA subtypes using machine learning approach.
   Conclusion: The present study suggests that SCA1 and SCA2 do not differ in cortical thinning while a characteristic pattern of subcortical atrophy SCA2 > SCA1 is observed along with correlation of brain atrophy and disease attributes. This may provide the diagnostic guidance of MRI to SCA subtypes and differential therapies.

KW  - neurosurgery
KW  - particulate dispersion
AB  - Background: High-speed drilling during neurosurgical procedures lead to aerosol generation. Contaminated particles when dispersed can lead to transmission of disease in healthcare workers via air-borne route. We designed and validated the utility of an innovative microscope drape, in mitigating the dispersion of aerosol, while drilling on an ex-vivo model.
   Methods: Two consecutive high-speed drilling operative simulations were performed using a dry-model under operative-microscope with and without drape, respectively, to demonstrate the degree of particulate dispersion while high-speed drilling using a 10% Povidone-Iodine solution for irrigation.
   Results: There was significantly lower particulate dispersion and soiling of surgeon's gown, mask, and surrounding drapes outside the immediate operative field using the customized microscope mounted drape.
   Conclusions: Customized microscope mounted drape is effective in containing the widespread particulate dispersion associated with high-speed drilling under a microscope. The benefits of this specialized drape can translate into a safer micro-environment for operating surgeons during drilling procedures.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate aqueous pharmacokinetics of topical bromfenac 0.09% and compare clinical outcomes of once- and twice-daily dosing in phacoemulsificatdon.
   Setting: Dr. R.P. Center for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.
   Design: Prospective interventional study.
   Methods: In phase I, single-drop aqueous pharmacokinetics of topical bromfenac was estimated at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in 60 eyes. In phase II, 45 eyes undergoing phacoemuisification were enrolled: group I (control, n = 15), group II (once-daily bromfenac, n = 14), and group III (twice-daily bromfenac, n =16). Intraoperative pupillary miosis, postoperative anterior chamber (AC) flare, Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS), central macular thickness (CM1), and pain scores were assessed. Follow-up was performed at 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, and 90 days postoperatively.
   Results: Half-life of topical bromfenac was 3.6 hours, mean residence time 5.5 hours, and peak concentration (63.73 ng/mL) achieved after 2 hours. Aqueous concentration was more than inhibitory concentration (IC S ) at 12 hours but not at 24 hours. Cumulative effect was observed with repeated dosing with aqueous levels more than IC 50 in once-daily and twice-daily groups at 5 days. Significant intraoperative miosis was observed in group I. Pain score, AC flare, and SOIS were significantly more in group I (P < .001) and comparable in groups II and III at all timepoints. CMT was comparable in all groups; no case developed cystoid macular edema.
   Conclusions: Single-dose topical bromfenac did not maintain therapeutic aqueous concentration over 24 hours; however, cumulative effect was observed with repeated dosing. Clinical efficacy of once-daily and twice-daily dosing was comparable. Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Wolters Kluwer on behalf of ASCRS and ESCRS

TI  - Psychometric analysis and construct validation of Health Professional Education in Patient Safety Survey in the Indian context
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Improving patient safety (PS) is critical to optimizing healthcare delivery. There is a need to develop curricula or incorporate PS concepts in health professionals' (HPs) education, in both theoretical and practical training. Consequently, there is a need to measure the perception of HPs regarding various PS competencies imparted to them during their training. The Health Professional Education in Patient Safety Survey (H-PEPSS) is a tool that measures HPs' self-reported PS competence and was designed to reflect six sociocultural areas central to PS. The tool has been validated in Canada but not in India. We did a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and psychometric validation of the H-PEPSS in the Indian context.
   Methods. The sample comprised 240 HPs. We used the maximum likelihood estimation method on AMOS V20 (SPSS Inc.) to carry out a CFA of the tool. We used the normed fit index, Tucker-Lewis index, comparative fit index, standard root mean square residual, root mean square residual and root mean square error of approximation to evaluate the model fit. Internal consistency and reliability of the six factors of the model were examined using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent validity of the model was examined using average variance extracted and composite reliability. Discriminant validity was examined using the Fornell and Larcker criterion and the heterotrait-monotrait method.
   Results. The results indicate a good fit. The H-PEPSS was found to be reliable and valid for assessing PS competencies among HPs. Comparison of the results with the results of the Canadian setting confirmed external validity.
   Conclusion. The 16-item H-PEPSS has good psychometric properties for use in the Indian context. The 23-item H-PEPSS was found to be reliable and valid for assessing PS.

AB  - The treatment of paediatric mandibular condylar fracture (PMCF) is typically non-operative. The purpose of this study was to determine if non-operative management of PMCF results in a new condylar process of normal morphology to regenerate after closed treatment (restitutional remodelling). The specific aim of the study was to observe restitutional remodelling (RM) in PMCF and review the literature. The investigators designed and implemented a retrospective study on paediatric patients (age < 12) with unilateral or bilateral condyle fractures treated with non-operative treatment between January 2005 and July 2015. Patients with complete records and at least 1-year follow-up were included in the study. Primary outcome variable was RM and secondary outcome variables were occlusion, maximal incisal opening (MIO), displacement, infection, facial asymmetry, and signs of temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA). The study evaluated 41 patients {n = 57 PMCF, (m:f-35:6)} of unilateral (n = 25) and bilateral (n = 16) PMCF. Fractured condyles remodelled to normal morphology in all the cases at follow-up. The Wilcoxon test revealed a statistically significant difference in MIO from the preoperative value to postoperative (p = 0.001). Occlusion (except 1) was satisfactory in all cases, at follow-up with no gross facial asymmetry. There was no sign of infection at the surgical site (anterior mandible). None of the patients showed signs of TMJA at follow-up. The result of the present study demonstrates that RM of condylar fracture occurs with non-operative management. Non-operative management should be the point of care in PMCF, owing to the rapid RM, bone regeneration, and satisfactory outcome. Review of the literature also supports closed treatment.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to define a protocol for the prevention of re-ankylosis after surgical management of temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA). The investigators designed a retrospective study on all TMJA patients treated with different treatment modalities from 2013 to 2019. The investigators observed that complete removal of the ankylotic mass particularly on the medial side; use of a piezoelectric scalpel for a clean and smooth osteotomy with copious irrigation to remove bone chips and slurry; less trauma to the local tissue; osteotomy design parallel and inferior osteotomy at the narrowest part, which mostly corresponds to the condylar neck; performance of a coronoidectomy (if mouth opening is <30 mm), fat interposition; no intraoperative correction of any pre-existing chin deviation when treated with costochondral graft; patient motivation; and aggressive physiotherapy, and use of a vacuum drain are all important to prevent re-ankylosis, irrespective of the treatment modality. A total of 114 patients (n = 152 joints), [bilateral (n = 38), unilateral (n = 76)] were evaluated retrospectively. Interpositional arthroplasty with fat was performed in n = 43, CCG was used for reconstruction in n = 30 and total joint replacement (TJR) was done in n = 41 patients. Re-ankylosis was seen in n = 3 (2.6%) patients (2 in CCG and 1 patient in interpositional arthroplasty). The follow-up ranged from 12-80 months. The results conclude that following the suggested best practice protocol is effective in reducing re-ankylosis. (c) 2021 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Hundreds of tRNA genes and pseudogenes are encoded by the human genome. tRNAs are the second most abundant type of RNA in the cell. Advancement in deep-sequencing technologies have revealed the presence of abundant expression of functional tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs). They are either generated from precursor (pre-)tRNA or mature tRNA. They have been found to play crucial regulatory roles during different pathological conditions. Herein, we briefly summarize the discovery and recent advances in deciphering the regulatory role played by tRFs in the pathophysiology of different human diseases.

AB  - Objectives To assess the impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on migraine patients in India on disease activity, healthcare accessibility, and quality of life (QoL). Materials & Methods This internet-based survey study using a structured questionnaire was conducted from 27th April to 31st July 2020. Previous physician-diagnosed migraine patients or those fulfilling any two of three clinical features (limitation of activities for >1 day, associated nausea or vomiting, and photophobia or phonophobia) were diagnosed as migraine patients. QoL was captured using a Likert scale and determinants of poor QoL were identified by logistic regression. Results A total of 4078 persons completed the full survey out of which 984 (24.1%) had migraine (mean age 35.3 +/- 11.2). Compared to pre-lockdown, 51.3% of migraineurs reported worsening of their headaches in terms of increased attack frequency (95.6%), increased headache days (95%), increased attack duration (89.9%) and increased headache severity (88.1%). The worsening was attributed to anxiety due to the pandemic (79.7%), inability or difficulty to access healthcare (48.4%) and migraine medicines (48.9%), and financial worries (60.9%). 26.8% of migraineurs reported poor QoL compared to 7.37% of non-migraineurs [p<0.0001]. Migraine affected QoL in 61.4% of migraineurs. The predictors of poor QoL on logistic regression included worsening migraine during the lockdown (AOR 4.150; CI 2.704- 6.369) and difficulty accessing migraine medicines (AOR 4.549; CI 3.041- 6.805). Employment as an essential COVID-19 worker (AOR 0.623; CI 0.409- 0.950) protected against poor QoL. Conclusions COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown greatly impacted migraine patients in India which significantly reduced their QoL.

AB  - Introduction: Most findings of forensic pathology examinations are presented as written reports. There are currently no internationally accepted recommendations for writing forensic pathology reports. Existing recommendations are also varied and reflect the differences in the scope and role of forensic medical services and local settings in which they are to be implemented. The legal fact-finder thus faces wide variation in the quality of forensic pathology reports, which poses a threat to the reliability of legal decision-making. To address this issue, the development of the "PERFORM-P (Principles of Evidence-based Reporting in FORensic Medicine Pathology version)" was undertaken. The goal of the PERFORM-P is to provide common practice recommendations adaptable to local requirements to promote evidence-based practice (EBP) in forensic pathology. Methods: An international consensus study was conducted in three phases by (1) developing a long-list of items to be considered in the reporting recommendations, (2) conducting a Delphi process (an iterative survey method to transform individual opinions into group consensus) with international forensic pathologists, and (3) designing the PERFORM-P prototype and its accompanying manual. Results: With assistance from 106 forensic pathologists/forensic medical practitioners from 41 countries, the PERFORM-P was developed. The PERFORM-P consists of a list of 61 items to be included in a forensic pathology report, which is accompanied by its Explanation and Elaboration (E&E) document. Discussion: To prepare forensic pathology (postmortem) reports that incorporate principles of evidence based practice, internationally accepted recommendations might be helpful. The PERFORM-P identifies recommendations for necessary elements to include in a forensic pathology report. PERFORM-P can be applied to a wide range of matters requiring forensic pathological analysis, acceptable to forensic pathologists from a representative selection of jurisdictions and medico-legal systems.

AB  - Studies behind mechanisms of Chlamydia trachomatis-induced recurrent spontaneous abortion is still in its infancy. Possible strategy for preventing recurrent spontaneous abortion at molecular level is needed. Despite its multifactorial aetiology, Chlamydia trachomatis is important cause of RSA. However, mechanism leading to RSA in C. trachomatis-positive patients is not understood and novel strategies are needed. It is hypothesized that microRNAs play important role in RSA regulation during infection. Study aimed to elucidate expression/role of urine-circulating miRs-320b, 221-3p, 146b-5p,-16,-24,-559 in recurrent spontaneous aborters with C. trachomatis infection and to find their target genes by bioinformatic analysis. First-void urine was collected from 30 nonpregnant women with RSA (Group I) and 30 non-pregnant women with >= 2 successful deliveries (Group II; Controls) attending Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College, Safdarjung hospital, New Delhi (India). PCR was performed to detect C. trachomatis. Expression of miRNAs was studied by quantitative real-time PCR while target genes/functional annotations were predicted by GO/KEGG databases. Data was statistically evaluated. 05 RSA patients were C. trachomatis-positive. Group I was subdivided into Group Ia (C. trachomatis-positive RSA; n = 5) and Group Ib (C. trachomatis-negative RSA; internal controls). miR-320b,-221-3p, -146b-5p,-16,-24 were significantly upregulated (miR-16 showed maximum 4.3 fold-change) while miR-559 was downregulated (0.5 fold-change) in Group Ia versus controls ('p'<0.001). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that target genes of miRNAs in RSA are involved in apoptosis and AMPK signalling pathways. Results showed differential expression of miRNAs implyingmiR-16 and miR-559 as potential biomarkers of RSA in infected women. Furthermore, network of genes of differentially expressed miRNAs regulates RSA by targeting gene function in apoptosis, cell adhesion and angiogenesis.

AB  - Exploring and repurposing a drug have become a lower risk alternative. Safinamide, approved for Parkinson's disease, has shown neuroprotection in various animal models of neurological disorders. The present study aimed to explore the potential of safinamide in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke. The effective dose of safinamide was selected based on the results of neurobehavioral parameters and reduction in infarct size assessed 24 h post-reperfusion. For sub-acute study, the treatment with effective dose was extended for 3 days and effects on neurobehavioral parameters, infarct size (TTC staining and MRI), oxidative stress parameters (MDA, GSH, SOD, NOX-2), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10), apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 expression, and TUNEL staining), and autophagy (pAMPK, Beclin-1, LC3-II expression) were studied. The results of dose selection study showed significant reduction (p < 0.05) in infarct size and improvement in neurobehavioral parameters with safinamide (80 mg/kg). In sub-acute study, safinamide showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in motor coordination and infarct size reduction. Additionally, safinamide treatment significantly normalized altered redox homeostasis and inflammatory cytokine levels. However, no change was observed in expression of NOX-2 in I/R or safinamide treatment group when compared with sham. I/R induced deranged expression of apoptotic markers and increased TUNEL positive cells in cortex were significantly normalized with safinamide treatment. Further, safinamide significantly (p < 0.05) induced the expressions of autophagic proteins (Beclin-1 and LC3-II) in cortex. Overall, the results demonstrated neuroprotective potential of safinamide via anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and autophagy inducing properties. Thus, safinamide can be explored for repurposing in ischemic stroke after further exploration.

   The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 (Gly972Arg) and IRS2 (Gly1057Asp) genes with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Asian Indians.
   Method
   A total of 410 overweight/obese subjects (130 with OSA with NAFLD, 100 with OSA without NAFLD, 95 without OSA and with NAFLD and 85 without OSA and without NAFLD) were recruited. Degree of NAFLD was based on liver ultrasound and of OSA on overnight polysomnography. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed by gene sequencing.
   Result
   Mean values of blood pressure, body fat markers, blood glucose, lipids, liver function, and markers of insulin resistance were significantly increased in OSA and NAFLD subjects (p<0.05). In addition, according to age (years) categories, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipids, obesity markers, and markers of insulin resistance were significantly higher in 45-60 years group as compared to 20-45 years group (p<0.05). In IRS1 gene, the genotype frequency (%) of Arg/Arg was significantly higher in NAFLD and OSA subjects. In addition, Gly/Arg genotype of IRS1 gene was associated with significantly higher body mass index, fat mass, %body fat, triglycerides, cholesterol, alkaline phosphate, aspartate transaminase, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR levels in OSA and NAFLD subjects. No significant difference in genotype frequencies of IRS2 was observed between four groups. Further we found that subjects carrying IRS1 Gly/Arg (OR 4.49, 95% C.I. 1.06-12.52, p = 0.002) genotype possess a much higher risk of OSA and NAFLD compared to IRS2 Gly/Asp (OR 1.01, 95% C.I. 0.8-2.56, p = 0.05). In sub group analysis of IRS1 Gly/Arg have significant differences between the mild, moderate and severe group (P<0.05). In addition, patients with the 'Gly' allele were inclined to develop more severe OSA.
   Conclusion
   We concluded that Asian Indian subject carrying the allele Gly972Arg polymorphism of IRS1 is predisposed to develop OSA and NAFLD.

AB  - Background: Given the scarcity of alcohol prevention and use disorder treatments in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the World Health Organization has launched an eHealth portal that includes the web-based self-help program "Alcohol e-Health."
   Objective: We aimed to test the effectiveness of the Alcohol e-Health program in a randomized controlled trial.
   Methods: This was a two-arm, individually randomized, and controlled trial across four LMICs comparing the self-help program and a psychoeducation and internet access as usual waiting list. Participants were broadly recruited from community samples in Belarus, Brazil, India, and Mexico from January 2016 through January 2019. The primary outcome measure was change in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score with a time frame of 6 months between baseline and follow-up. Secondary outcomes included self-reported numbers of standard drinks over the previous week and cessation of harmful or hazardous drinking (AUDIT score <8).
   Results: For this study, we recruited 1400 predominantly male (n=982, 70.1%) at least harmful or hazardous alcohol drinkers. The mean age was 37.6 years (SD 10.5). The participants were recruited from Brazil (n=587), Mexico (n=509), India (n=212), and Belarus (n=92). Overall, complete case analysis identified higher AUDIT changes in the intervention group (B=-4.18, 95% CI -5.42 to -2.93, P<.001, d=0.56) that were mirrored by changes in weekly standard drinks (B=-9.34, 95% CI -15.90 to -2.77, P=.005, d=0.28) and cessation rates for harmful or hazardous drinking (chi(2)(1) = 14.56, N=561, P<.001). The supplementary intention-to-treat analyses largely confirmed these initial results.
   Conclusions: The expansion of the Alcohol e-Health program to other LMICs with underdeveloped alcohol prevention and treatment systems for alcohol use disorders should be considered after successful replication of the present results.

AB  - Background India lacks epidemiological information on the disease burden of pediatric HIV. The National AIDS Control Program (NACP) estimates the numbers of HIV-positive children as a proportion of adult persons living with HIV. A third of HIV-positive children die before their first birthday and a half before they reach their second birthday. The early detection of HIV is crucial for the prevention of morbidities, growth delays, and death among HIV-positive children. Methods The study aimed to estimate the disease burden of pediatric HIV among children in 'A' category district of a high HIV prevalence state. An 'A' category district is defined by the presence of > 1% HIV prevalence among the general population, as estimated by HIV Sentinel Surveillance. The study used an innovative three-pronged strategy combining cross-sectional and longitudinal methods. The overall burden of pediatric HIV was calculated as a product of cases detected multiplied by a net inflation factor, for each of three strategies. Results The existing pool of HIV infection in the district is estimated to be 3266 (95% CI: 2621-4197) HIV positive children < 15 years of age, in a mid-year (2013) projected child population of about 1.4 million, thus giving an HIV prevalence of 0.23% (CI: 0.19-0.30) among children (0-14 years of age). The proportion of children among all people living with HIV in the district works out to 10.4% (CI: 8.6-13.5%). Conclusions The study estimate of 0.23% HIV prevalence among children (0-14 years of age) is higher than the NACP estimates (0.02) and is 2.5 higher than the Karnataka state estimate (0.09)(22). Similarly, the proportion of children among all persons living with HIV in Belgaum district is 10.4% in this study, as against 6.54% for India. The study methodology is replicable for other settings and other diseases.

AB  - Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine having key roles in cell death, differentiation, survival, proliferation, migration and is a modulator of immune system. Therefore, TNF-alpha is an ideal biomarker for several disease diagnosis including cancer. However, out of all the biomarkers of cancer, TNF-alpha) is less explored for cancer detection. Only a few reports are available of developing biosensors for TNF-alpha targeting in human serum samples. Also, Carbon Dots (CDs) remains less explored in biosensor application. In this regard, for the first time, a sensitive and low-cost electrochemical biosensor based on CDs has developed. CDs were synthesized by simple yet facile microwave pyrolysis. Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) was selected as the matrix to hold CDs to fabricate the biosensing platform. This novel CD-PMMA nanocomposite featuring excellent biocompatibility, exceptional electrocatalytic conductivity, and large surface area. CD-PMMA was applied as transducing material to efficiently conjugate antibodies specific towards TNF-alpha and fabricate electrochemical immunosensor for specific detection of TNF-alpha. The fabricated immunosensor was used for the detection of TNF-alpha within a wide dynamic range of 0.05-160 pg mL(-1) with a lower detection limit of 0.05 pg mL(-1) and sensitivity of 5.56 pg mL(-1) cm(-2). Furthermore, this CDs based immunosensor retains high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability. This immunosensor demonstrated a high correlation with the conventional technique, EnzymeLinked Immunosorbent Assay for early screening of cancer patient serum samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Epithelial ovarian cancer has become the most frequent cause of deaths among gynecologic malignancies. Our study elucidates the diagnostic performance of Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA), Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) and cancer antigen (CA125). To compare the diagnostic accuracy of ROMA, HE-4 and CA125 in the early diagnosis and screening of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer. Literature search in electronic databases such as Medicine: MEDLINE (through PUBMED interface), EMBASE, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane library from January 2011 to August 2020. Studies that evaluated the diagnostic measures of ROMA, HE4 and CA125 by using Chemilumincence immunoassay or electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA or ECLIA) as index tests. Using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). We included 32 studies in our meta-analysis. We calculated AUC by SROC, pooled estimated like sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), Tau square, Cochran Q through random effect analysis and meta-regression. Data was retrieved from 32 studies. The number of studies included for HE4, CA125 and ROMA tests was 25, 26 and 22 respectively. The patients with EOC were taken as cases, and women with benign ovarian mass were taken as control, which was 2233/5682, 2315/5875 and 2281/5068 respectively for the markers or algorithm. The pooled estimates of the markers or algorithm were sensitivity: ROMA (postmenopausal) (0.88, 95% CI 0.86-0.89) > ROMA (premenopausal) 0.80, 95% CI 0.78-0.83 > CA-125(0.84, 95% CI 0.82-0.85) > HE4 (0.73, 95% CI 0.71-0.75) specificity: HE4 (0.90, 95% CI 0.89-0.91) > ROMA (postmenopausal) (0.83, 95% CI 0.81-0.84) > ROMA (premenopausal) (0.80, 95% CI 0.79-0.82) > CA125 (0.73, 95%CI 0.72-0.74), Diagnostic odd's ratio ROMA (postmenopausal) 44.04, 95% CI 31.27-62.03, ROMA (premenopausal)-18.93, 95% CI 13.04-27.48, CA-125-13.44, 95% CI 9.97-18.13, HE4-41.03, 95% CI 27.96-60.21 AUC(SE): ROMA (postmenopausal) 0.94(0.01), ROMA (premenopausal)-0.88(0.01), HE4 0.91(0.01), CA125-0.86(0.02) through bivariate random effects model considering the heterogeneity. Our study found ROMA as the best marker to differentiate EOC from benign ovarian masses with greater diagnostic accuracy as compared to HE4 and CA125 in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, HE4 is a promising predictor of Epithelial ovarian cancer; however, its utilisation requires further exploration. Our study elucidates the diagnostic performance of ROMA, HE4 and CA125 in EOC. ROMA is a promising diagnostic marker of Epithelial ovarian cancers in postmenopausal women, while HE4 is the best diagnostic predictor of EOC in the premenopausal group. Our study had only EOC patients as cases and those with benign ovarian masses as controls. Further, we considered the studies estimated using the markers by the same index test: CLIA or ECLIA. The good number of studies with strict inclusion criteria reduced bias because of the pooling of studies with different analytical methods, especially for HE4. We did not consider the studies published in foreign languages. Since a few studies were available for HE4 and CA125 in the premenopausal and postmenopausal group separately, data were inadequate for sub-group analysis. Further, we did not assess these markers' diagnostic efficiency stratified by the stage and type of tumour due to insufficient studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurologic deficits are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Several therapeutic agents have been assessed in randomized controlled trials for their efficacy in reducing the incidence of vasospasm and improving functional outcome. The aim of this network meta-analysis is to compare all these therapeutic agents for their effect on functional outcome and other parameters after aSAH.
   METHODS: A comprehensive search of different databases was performed to retrieve randomized controlled trials describing the effect of various therapeutic approaches on functional outcome and other parameters after aSAH.
   RESULTS: Ninety-two articles were selected for full text review and 57 articles were selected for the final analysis. Nicardipine prolonged-release implants were found to be the best treatment in terms of favorable outcome (odds ratio [OR], 8.55; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.63-56.71), decreasing mortality (OR, 0.08; 95% CrI, 0-0.82), and preventing angiographic vasospasm (OR, 0.018; 95% CrI, 0.00057-0.16). Cilostazol was found to be the second-best treatment in improving favorable outcomes (OR, 3.58; 95% CrI, 1.97-6.57) and decreasing mortality (OR, 0.41; 95% CrI, 0.12-1.15). Fasudil (OR, 0.16; 95% CrI, 0.03-0.78) was found to be the best treatment in decreasing increased vessel velocity and enoxaparin (OR, 0.25; 95% CrI, 0.057-1.0) in preventing delayed ischemic neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that nicardipine prolonged-release implants and cilostazol were associated with the best chance of improving favorable outcome and mortality in patients with aSAH. However, larger multicentric studies from other parts of the world are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - In this contribution, we report the fabrication of multifunctional nanoparticles with gold shell over an iron oxide nanoparticles (INPs) core. The fabricated system combines the magnetic property of INPs and the surface plasmon resonance of gold. The developed nanoparticles are coated with thiolated pectin (TPGINs), which provides stability to the nanoparticles dispersion and allows the loading of hydrophobic anticancer drugs. Curcumin (Cur) is used as the model drug and an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 80% in TPGINs is observed. Cytotoxicity study with HeLa cells shows that Cur-loaded TPGINs have better viability percent (similar to 30%) than Cur alone (similar to 40%) at a dose of 30 mu g of TPGINs. Further, annexin V-PI assay demonstrated the enhanced anticancer activity of Cur-loaded TPGINs via induction of apoptosis. The use of TPGINs leads to a significant enhancement in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HeLa cells through improved radiosensitization by gamma irradiation (0.5 Gy). TPGINs are further evaluated for imparting contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the r(2) relaxivity in the range of 11.06-13.94 s(-1) mu g(-1) mL when measured at 7 Tesla. These exper-imental results indicate the potential of TPGINs for drug delivery and MR imaging.

AB  - Purpose ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin,vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is not a standard regimen in children due to concerns regarding late effects. However, no studies have evaluated long-term toxicities of ABVD in children. Methods Total 154 pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors uniformly treated with ABVD were clinically followed up as per institutional protocol. All participants were evaluated for cardiac, pulmonary, and thyroid function abnormalities by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan, spirometry with diffusion capacity of lung for the uptake of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and thyroid profile test, respectively, at a single time point. Predictors of toxicity were also analyzed. Results The median duration of follow-up of the cohort was 10.3 years (6.04-16.8). No secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN) or symptomatic cardiac/pulmonary toxicities were detected. Nine patients (5.9%) had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <55%. Subclinical and overt hypothyroidism were observed in 78 (50.6%) and 16 (10.4%) survivors, respectively. Abnormal spirometry and reduced DLCO was observed in 43.2% and 42.0% survivors, respectively. Receiving neck radiation was significantly associated with thyroid dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] 16.04, p < .001); age >= 10 years predicted reduced DLCO (OR 4.12, p = .001). Sixty-three and 33 patients had one and two late adverse effects, respectively; receiving neck radiation predicted development of multiple late effects (proportional OR 4.72, p < 0.001). Cumulative dose of chemotherapy did not predict toxicity. Conclusions Overall, ABVD appears safe in children at a relatively short follow-up. Long-term safety data are required before it can be adopted for treating pediatric HL patients. Children receiving neck radiation require close follow-up.

AB  - Background and aims Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a distinct clinical entity with high probability of organ failure and mortality. Since patients generally present late, experimental models are needed to understand the pathophysiology and natural course of the disease.
   Methodology To reproduce the syndrome of ACLF, chronic liver disease was induced in C57BL6 mice (6-8 weeks; approximately 20-24 g weight) by intraperitoneal administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 10 weeks followed by an acute injury with acetaminophen (APAP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Blood, ascitic fluid, and organs were collected to study cell death, regeneration, and fibrosis.
   Results At 24 h post-APAP/LPS infusion, the liver tissue showed increased hepatocyte ballooning and endothelial cell TUNEL positivity. This was followed by progressive hepatocyte necrosis from perivascular region at day 7 to lobular region by day 11. ACLF (day 7 and day 11) animals showed increase in bilirubin (p < 0.05), prothrombin time (p < 0.0001), blood ammonia (p < 0.001), and portal pressure post-acute hepatocellular injury similar to human ACLF. Ascites was noticed by day 11 with median serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.2 (1.1-1.3) g/dL. In comparison to cirrhosis, ACLF group (day 7 and day 11) showed significant decrease in Sirius red (p <= 0.0001), collagen1 (p < 0.0001), and a-SMA proportionate area (p < 0.0001) with loss of hepatocytes regeneration (p < 0.005). At day 11, ACLF animals also showed significant increase in serum creatinine (p < 0.05) and acute tubular necrosis suggestive of organ failure, compared to cirrhotic animals.
   Conclusion The CCL4/APAP/LPS (CALPS) model of ACLF mimics the clinical, biochemical, and histological features of ACLF with demonstrable progressive hepatocellular necrosis, liver failure, impaired regeneration, development of portal hypertension, and organ dysfunction in an animal with chronic liver disease.

AB  - Aim: To differentiate mesenchymal stem cells into functional dopaminergic neurons using an electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) and graphene (G) nanocomposite. Methods: A one-step approach was used to electrospin the PCL nanocomposite, with varying G concentrations, followed by evaluating their biocompatibility and neuronal differentiation. Results: PCL with exiguous graphene demonstrated an ideal nanotopography with an unprecedented combination of guidance stimuli and substrate cues, aiding the enhanced differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into dopaminergic neurons. These newly differentiated neurons were seen to exhibit unique neuronal arborization, enhanced intracellular Ca2+ influx and dopamine secretion. Conclusion: Having cost-effective fabrication and room-temperature storage, the PCL-G nanocomposites could pave the way for enhanced neuronal differentiation, thereby opening a new horizon for an array of applications in neural regenerative medicine.

AB  - Diagnosis of intra-thoracic tuberculosis (ITTB) in children is difficult due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease, the challenge in collecting appropriate specimens, and the low sensitivity of smear microscopy and culture. Culture and Xpert MTB/RIF provide higher diagnostic yield in presumptive TB in adults than in children. Current study was designed to understand poor yield of diagnostic assays in children. Children with presumptive ITTB were subjected to gastric aspirates and induced sputum twice. Samples were tested by Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Xpert MTB/RIF-assay, and MGIT-960 culture. Subjects were grouped as Confirmed, Unconfirmed, and Unlikely TB, and classified as progressive primary disease (PPD, lung parenchymal lesion), and primary pulmonary complex (PPC, hilar lymphadenopathy) on chest X-ray. Of children with culture-positive TB 51/394 (12.9%), culture-negative TB 305 (77.4%), and unlikely TB 38 (9.6%), 9 (2.3%) were smear positive, while 95 (24.1%) were Xpert-MTB/RIF positive. Xpert-MTB/RIF detected 40/51 culture confirmed cases (sensitivity 78.4% and NPV 96.3%). Culture was positive in more children presenting as PPD (p < 0.04). In culture-negative TB group, Xpert positivity was seen in 31% of those with PPD and 11.9% in those with PPC (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Xpert-MTB/RIF improved diagnosis by 2-fold and increased detection of MDR-TB. Both liquid culture and Xpert-MTB/RIF gave higher yield in children with lung parenchymal lesions. Children with hilar lymphadenopathy without active lung parenchymal lesions had poor diagnostic yield even with sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests, due to paucibacillary/localized disease, suggesting possible utility of invasively collected samples in early diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - In early (EB) and late blind (LB) children, vision deprivation produces cross-modal plasticity in the visual cortex. The progression of structural- and tract-based spatial statistics changes in the visual cortex in EB and LB, as well as their impact on global cognition, have yet to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the cortical thickness (CT), gyrification index (GI), and white matter (WM) integrity in EB and LB children, as well as their association to the duration of blindness and education. Structural and diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired in a 3T magnetic resonance imaging in EB and LB children (n = 40 each) and 30 sighted controls (SCs) and processed using CAT12 toolbox and FSL software. Two sample t-test was used for group analyses with P < 0.05 (false discovery rate-corrected). Increased CT in visual, sensory-motor, and auditory areas, and GI in bilateral visual cortex was observed in EB children. In LB children, the right visual cortex, anterior-cingulate, sensorimotor, and auditory areas showed increased GI. Structural- and tract-based spatial statistics changes were observed in anterior visual pathway, thalamocortical, and corticospinal tracts, and were correlated with education onset and global cognition in EB children. Reduced impairment in WM, increased CT and GI and its correlation with global cognitive functions in visually impaired children suggests crossmodal plasticity due to adaptive compensatory mechanism (as compared to SCs). Reduced CT and increased FA in thalamo-cortical areas in EB suggest synaptic pruning and alteration in WM integrity. In the visual cortical pathway, higher education and the development of blindness modify the morphology of brain areas and influence the probabilistic tractography in EB rather than LB.

AB  - We explored the antibacterial potential (alone and combination) against multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates KG-P2 using synthesized thieno[3,2-c]pyran-2-ones in combination with different antibiotics. Out of 14 compounds, two compounds (3g and 3l) abridged the MIC of tetracycline (TET) by 16 folds. Compounds was killing the KG-P2 cells, in time dependent manner, lengthened post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of TET and found decreased the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of TET. In ethidium bromide efflux experiment, two compounds repressed the drug transporter (efflux pumps) which is further supported by molecular docking of these compounds with efflux complex MexAB-OprM. In another study, these compounds inhibited the synthesis of biofilm.

AB  - Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) is an inflammatory condition of the peripheral cornea with hallmark features of epithelial defects and stromal destruction as a result of a complex interplay of factors including host autoimmunity and the peculiar anatomic and physiologic features of the peripheral cornea and environmental factors. PUK may be the result of local or systemic causes and infectious or noninfectious causes. Arriving at a specific etiological diagnosis requires a meticulous clinical workup that may include a battery of laboratory and radiological investigations. Management by a team of internists or rheumatologists and ophthalmologists and judicious use of immunosuppressive agents may yield favorable results minimizing adverse effects. We review current clinical knowledge on the diagnosis and management of PUK. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved..

AB  - Thymomas are the most frequent adult mediastinal cancers. Their etiology is unknown and their pathogenesis poorly understood. Racial, ethnic and environmental factors influence tumorigenesis in many cancers, but their role in thymomas remains unclear to date. In this study that included pretreatment thymoma cases from India and Germany (n = 37 and n = 77, respectively) we compared i) the prevalence of the thymoma-specific chromosome 7 c.74146970T > A mutation of the GTF2I gene in type A and AB thymomas; ii) epidemiological features; and iii) the frequency of myasthenia gravis (MG). Due to a known predominance of GTF2I mutation in A and AB histotypes, we included only a marginal number of type B thymomas as a control group in both cohorts. While the distribution of histological types between the cohorts was similar (p = 0.1622), Indian patients were strikingly younger (p < 0.0001; median age 50 vs. 65 years) and showed significantly lower tumour stage (Masaoka-Koga stage I) at primary diagnosis (p = 0.0005) than the German patients. In patients with known MG status (n = 17 in Indian and n = 25 in German cohort), a clear trend towards more frequent MG was observed in the Indian group (p = 0.0504; 48 vs. 82%). The prevalence of the GTF2I mutation (analysed in n = 34 Indian and n = 77 German patients) was identical in the two cohorts. We conclude that racial-ethnic and environmental factors do not significantly influence the most common molecular feature of thymomas but may have an impact on the timing of clinical presentation.

KW  - PREHOSPITAL TRAUMA CARE
AB  - Background: Most mortality in trauma occurs in prehospital settings when the golden hour is spent accessing healthcare facilities rather than resuscitating and stabilizing. Assessments performed in the rural community of Nanakpur, India demonstrated a significant paucity of, and limited access to healthcare facilities. To address deficiencies in prehospital care, the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) constructed the Basic Emergency Care Course (BECC). This study evaluated the BECCs efficacy in Nanakpur.
   Methods: The first responder courses took place in 2017 in Nanakpur. Local community health workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) were recruited as participants. Participants completed both a pre- and post-course evaluation to assess baseline knowledge and improvement. Participants then took a one-year post-course assessment to evaluate retention.
   Results: The course included 204 individuals, and over half (109/204) were ASHAs. Pre- and post-course test results were available for 70 participants and demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge (P < 0.0001). The one-year knowledge retention assessment was completed by 48.6% (n = 53/109) of the original ASHAs. Comparisons between both the pre- and post-course assessment tests with the 12-mo retention assessment revealed a significant decay in knowledge (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing BECC to train ASHAs in Nanakpur as first responders. Participants demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge immediately after the course. After one year, there was a significant loss in knowledge, highlighting the need for refresher courses. These data suggest potential for the use of BECC for training ASHAs countrywide to strengthen India's prehospital care system. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The route of administration of a therapeutic agent has a substantial impact on its success. Therapeutic antibodies are usually administered systemically, either directly by intravenous route, or indirectly by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. However, treatment of diseases contained within a specific tissue necessitates a better alternate route of administration for targeting localised infections. Inhalation is a promising non-invasive strategy for antibody delivery to treat respiratory maladies because it provides higher concentrations of antibody in the respiratory airways overcoming the constraints of entry through systemic circulation and uncertainity in the amount reaching the target tissue. The nasal drug delivery route is one of the extensively researched modes of administration, and nasal sprays for molecular drugs are deemed successful and are presently commercially marketed. This review highlights the current state and future prospects of inhaled therapies, with an emphasis on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of respiratory infections, as well as an overview of their importance, practical challenges, and clinical trial outcomes.

TI  - Outcomes of Renal Trauma in Indian Urban Tertiary Healthcare Centres: A Multicentre Cohort Study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
KW  - CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT
KW  - INJURY
AB  - Background Renal trauma is present in 0.5-5% of patients admitted for trauma. Advancements in radiologic imaging and minimal-invasive techniques have led to decreased need for surgical intervention. We used a large trauma cohort to characterise renal trauma patients, their management and outcomes. Methods We analysed "Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes in India" cohort from four urban tertiary public hospitals in India between 1st September 2013 and 31st December 2015. The data of patients with renal trauma were extracted using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes and analysed for demographic and clinical details. Results A total of 16,047 trauma patients were included in this cohort. Abdominal trauma comprised 1119 (7%) cases, of which 144 (13%) had renal trauma. Renal trauma was present in 1% of all the patients admitted for trauma. The mean age was 28 years (SD-14.7). A total of 119 (83%) patients were male. Majority (93%) were due to blunt injuries. Road traffic injuries were the most common mechanism (53%) followed by falls (29%). Most renal injuries (89%) were associated with other organ injuries. Seven of the 144 (5%) patients required nephrectomy. Three patients had grade V trauma; all underwent nephrectomy. The 30-day in-hospital mortality, in patients with renal trauma, was 17% (24/144). Conclusion Most renal trauma patients were managed nonoperatively. 89% of patients with renal trauma had concomitant injuries. The renal trauma profile from this large cohort may be generalisable to urban contexts in India and other low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Aim: Diagnosis of osteoarticular tuberculosis (OATB) is quite challenging and there is an urgent need to design a prompt and precise diagnostic test. Methods: We developed a multi-targeted loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay using mpt64 (Rv1980c) and pstS1 (Rv0934) targets for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in OATB patients. Results: The sensitivities of 100 and 82.4% were obtained in confirmed (n = 10) and suspected (n = 57) OATB cases, respectively by multi-targeted LAMP with a specificity of 96.9% (n = 33). Moreover, the sensitivities attained by multi-targeted LAMP in total OATB cases were significantly higher (p < 0.05-0.01) than multiplex-PCR (mpt64 + pstS1) and GeneXpert assay. Conclusion: Our LAMP is simple, reliable and cost-effective method, which may develop into an attractive diagnostic kit for early detection of OATB cases.
   Lay abstract Diagnosis of osteoarticular tuberculosis (OATB) or bone and joint TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is quite difficult owing to the low bacterial load present in OATB specimens, and difficulty of obtaining specimens since Mtb bacilli are only present deep inside the tissues. Mostly, diagnosis of OATB relies on clinical findings and imaging, which often mimic other pus-producing microbial infections and inflammatory arthritis, while the conventional bacteriological tests (smear/culture) almost fail. Therefore, we developed a multi-targeted loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for early detection of OATB cases, which showed superiority over multiplex-PCR and GeneXpert assay. Overall, our LAMP is straightforward, accurate and low-cost assay that may lead to the development of a diagnostic kit for routine use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Management of pediatric odontoid fractures is tricky and controversial. This study will enrich world literature with intricacies of anterior odontoid screw (OS) fixation in the pediatric population learned over the last decade. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients with pediatric odontoid fracture who underwent anterior odontoid screw fixation from January 2010 to December 2019 were included and evaluated for surgical outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included in this study (mean age, 15 years; range, 6-18 years; male/female, 11:2; type II, 10; type IIA, 1; type III, 2). Common causes of injury were motor vehicle accidents (61.5%) followed by fall from height (38.5%) and all were acute fractures (2-30 days). Five patients had neurologic deficits. Accurate placement of screw was achieved in 92.3% of patients, including all 9 patients who used intraoperative O-arm. K wire migration during bicortical drilling resulted in neurovascular injury, with 1 mortality (7.7%). The remaining 12 patients were available for follow-up (mean, 36 months; range, 20-72 months) and all had preservation of neck movements. Successful OS fixation was achieved in 84.6% of patients, including 1 patient (7.7%) who had a fibrous union. One patient (8.3%) had nonunion because of migration of the screw head in the C2 body. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior odontoid screw fixation in the pediatric population provides good functional outcomes with instant fixation by direct osteosynthesis. However, the surgeon should be meticulous in the surgical approach and should achieve a lag effect. The surgeon should stop after engaging the outer cortex of the odontoid peg with K wire to avoid cranial migration. Intraoperative O-arm guidance is useful.

AB  - Diabetic foot problems are widespread globally, resulting in substantial medical, economic, and social challenges for patients and their families. Among diabetic complications, foot ulceration is the most frequent outcome and is more probable to be of neuropathic origin. To date, a plethora of studies has focused on diabetic foot and ulcer prevention. However, limited studies have investigated the biomechanics of diabetic foot post ulceration. In this work, extensive biomechanical modelling of diabetic foot ulcers was attempted. A full-scale foot model was developed using measurements from a human subject, and ulcers of differing sizes and depths were modelled at different plantar sites numerically. Also, the foot model was computationally modified to study the effect of flat foot conditions on the same diabetic ulcers. Standing condition was simulated, and the induced stresses were investigated at the plantar region. The maximum stresses were observed to be similar for all ulcer sizes and depths at the lateral midfoot region of the normal foot. However, the maximum stresses were reported in the lateral heel region for the flat foot, which varied significantly with size and depth. Such results present important information on the foot condition post ulceration and may help identify possibilities of further ulceration in the diabetic foot. These novel findings are anticipated to be indispensable for the development of suitable interventions (e.g., custom orthotics) for diabetic foot ulcer management.

AB  - Introduction: Brachial neuralgia is a dreaded sequelae which substantially impairs the quality of life in patients with brachial plexus avulsion (BPA) injuries. Dorsal Root Entry Zone (DREZ) lesioning of the cervical spinal cord is the most utilized procedure for alleviating this painful condition. In this study, we share a single center experience of surgically managing post BPA neuropathic pain. The efficacy, results and complications of the modified technique of DREZ, called the Microscissor DREZotomy (MDZ) are discussed along with the review of relevant literature. Methods: This retrospective analysis included all the patients undergoing MDZ for post BPA brachialgia over 5 years period (2012-2018) at our institution. The pain was quantified using the Numeric rating Scale (NRS) between 0 and 10 scale and was graded as 'Excellent' in patients with more than 75% pain relief, 'Good' with 50-75% relief, 'Fair' between 25% and 50% and 'Poor' if less than 25%. Results: A total of 56 patients underwent MDZ and a mean follow up of 32 months (range 18-69 months) available for 47 patients. Thirty three patients (70.4%) judged pain relief as Excellent, Five (10.6%) as Good, 3 (7%) as Fair and 6 (12%) having poor pain relief. Overall, in 38 (81%) patients long term analgesic effect (> 50%) was noted and 3 (7%) patients had more than 25% pain relief, making up an overall 41 (87%) of patients with some relief from pain. Conclusion: MDZ is a safe, efficacious technique with good long term pain relief and quality of life. This technique entails utilization of routine surgical instruments and can be performed with ease even in resource limited settings.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the various imaging features and associations on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography in patients with anomalous origin of left main coronary artery (LMCA) from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed multidetector CT angiography studies done for the evaluation of congenital heart diseases at our institution through 2014 to 2021. Cases with ALCAPA were identified and relevant history and imaging findings including the origin of coronary arteries, left ventricular (LV) morphology and functions, intercoronary collaterals, and associated abnormalities were evaluated. Results Twelve patients (eight males, three adults, and nine children; age range: 2 months to 54 years) with ALCAPA were included. Gradually progressive dyspnea and failure to thrive (6/9; 66.67% each) were the most common symptoms among children, whereas adults were commonly asymptomatic (2/3; 66.67%). The LMCA was originating from pulmonary sinus, main, and right pulmonary artery in 6 (50%), 5 (41.66%), and 1 (8.3%) patients, respectively. In adult-type ALCAPA, right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCx) were dilated and tortuous, with the presence of well-developed intercoronary collaterals and preserved LV ejection fractions; these features were not seen in patients of infantile ALCAPA. LV dysfunction with global hypokinesia was the most common wall motion abnormality (7/12; 58.33%). Conclusion Degree of collateralization could be the key factor determining the time of presentation, clinical symptoms, and LV function, thus influencing clinical outcomes. Patients with infantile ALCAPA present with features of heart failure and have dilated and dysfunctional LV consequent to lack of collaterals, unlike adult-type ALCAPA.

AB  - Persistent tachycardia in patients with septic shock predicts poor outcome. This study sought to investigate the effect of the cardiac pacemaker current inhibitor ivabradine on heart rate and cardio-circulatory function in patients with septic shock. After informed consent, 60 patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia (heart rate >95 /minute) were prospectively randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy for septic shock (group S) or standard therapy along with enteral ivabradine (group I) for the initial 96 hours after enrolment. Primary outcome was the difference in heart rate between the two groups during the first 96 hours. Secondary outcomes included the effect of ivabradine on haemodynamic, oxygenation, myocardial function and organ function parameters, incidence of adverse events and 30-day overall survival. Heart rate was lower in group I compared to group S (median difference in area under the curve -25.6 (95% confidence intervals -31.4 to -15.9) /minute; P <0.001). Vasopressor requirements, blood lactate levels, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and E/e ' ratio were lower in group I compared to group S. Stroke volume index and ejection fraction were higher in group I while cardiac index and oxygen delivery parameters were maintained similar to group S. There was no difference in 30-day mortality or in the incidence of serious adverse events. Enteral ivabradine is effective in reducing heart rate, and improving haemodynamic parameters and cardiac function in patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia, without increasing the incidence of adverse events.

AB  - Finding new, safe strategies to prevent and control rheumatoid arthritis is an urgent task. Bioactive peptides and peptide-rich protein hydrolyzate represent a new trend in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals. The resulting tissue hydrolyzate of the chicken embryo (CETH) has been evaluated for acute toxicity and tested against chronic arthritis induced by Freund's full adjuvant (modified Mycobacterium butyricum) in rats. The antiarthritic effect of CETH was studied on the 28th day of the experiment after 2 weeks of oral administration of CETH at doses of 60 and 120 mg/kg body weight. Arthritis was evaluated on the last day of the experiment on the injected animal paw using X-ray computerized microtomography and histopathology analysis methods. The CETH effect was compared with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium (5 mg/kg). Oral administration of CETH was accompanied by effective dose-dependent correction of morphological changes caused by the adjuvant injection. CETH had relatively high recovery effects in terms of parameters for reducing inflammation, inhibition of osteolysis, reduction in the inflammatory reaction of periarticular tissues, and cartilage degeneration. This study presents for the first time that CETH may be a powerful potential nutraceutical agent or bioactive component in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - Objective Sustained pharyngeal inflation (SPI) with pharyngeal oxygen and nose-closure (PhO2-NC) can create positive peak inflation pressure (PIP) inside the pharyngolaryngeal space (PLS). This study measured and compared the effects of four different SPI durations in the PLS. Methods A prospective study, 20 consecutive children aged between 6 months and 3 years old, scheduled for elective flexible bronchoscopy (FB) suspected positive PLS findings were enrolled. SPI was performed twice in four different durations (0, 1, 3, and 5 s) sequentially in each infant. PIP was measured for each SPI in the pharynx, while simultaneously record images at two locations of the oropharynx and supra-larynx. Patient demographic details, PIP levels, lumen expansion scores, and images of PLS were measured and analyzed. Results Twenty patients with 40 measurements were collected. The mean (SD) age and weight were 11.6 (9.1) months and 6.8 (2.4) kg, respectively. The measured mean (SD) pharyngeal PIPs were 4.1 (3.3), 21.9 (7.0), 42.2 (12.3), and 65.5 (18.5) cmH(2)O at SPI duration of 0, 1, 3, and 5 s, respectively, indicating significant (p<.001) positive correlation. At assigned locations, corresponding PLS images also displayed a significant increase in lumen expansion scores and a number of detected lesions with an increase in SPI duration (p < .004). The mean (SD) procedural time was 5.7 (1.2) min. No study-related complication was noted. Conclusions FB utilizing PhO2-NC as SPI of 1-3 s is a simple, less invasive, and valuable ventilation modality. It provides an adequate PIP level to expand the PLS and improve FB performance in children.

AB  - Objectives: This Systematic Review was conducted to evaluate the global status of the knowledge of prevention and emergency management of traumatic dental injuries among non-dental healthcare professionals (NDHCP).
   Methods: The protocol was designed as per PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020192381). A broad-based search using text-words and MeSH terms was performed in established databases as per a predefined strategy without any distinction of language and year of publication. Studies without details of the questionnaire, knowledge score, validity and reliability were excluded. Data extraction was performed and risk of bias assessment was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tool and a meta-analysis was performed.
   Results: The qualitative synthesis included 14 studies between 2009-2020 with nine of them from Asia. Majority of the studies had low risk of bias and reported poor overall level of knowledge. Less than 40% of the NDHCP had received a dental trauma first aid training in six of the 10 studies and majority of the participants (>50%) believed that dental trauma training was required in five studies. Less than 36% of the participants were adequately aware of the correct approach towards management of avulsed permanent tooth in five studies.
   Conclusion: The knowledge of non-dental health care professionals regarding the emergency management of traumatic dental injuries was insufficient or low in the majority of studies and the knowledge about prevention was not evaluated. There was a paucity of studies from the countries of Europe and Australia, with wide variability in the study methods, categories of the participants and questionnaire characteristics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES This study sought to compare the efficacy of ivabradine and amiodarone in the management of postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) after cardiac surgery in children. BACKGROUND JET is a serious arrhythmia occurring in children after cardiac surgery and requires aggressive management. Amiodarone has been conventionally used in its treatment. Recent studies have reported the utility of ivabradine in this regard.
   METHODS In this open-label randomized controlled trial, 94 children (age #18 years) who developed postoperative JET were allocated to receive either amiodarone or ivabradine. The primary endpoint was restoration of normal sinus rhythm.
   RESULTS Sinus rhythm was achieved in 43 out of the 46 patients (93.5%) in the amiodarone group and 46 out of the 48 patients (95.8%) in the ivabradine group (mean difference of treatment effect: 2.3%; 95% confidence interval:-6.7% to 11.5%). The median (interquartile range) time taken to achieve sinus rhythm conversion was similar in both the groups: 21.5 (17-30.2) hours versus 22 (13.4-38.5) hours (p = 0.36)]. The time taken to rate control of JET was significantly less in the amiodarone group: median 7.0 (5.5-9.5) hours versus 8.0 (5.8-10.8) hours (p = 0.02)]. No drug-related adverse events were observed in the ivabradine group.
   CONCLUSIONS Oral ivabradine is not inferior to intravenous amiodarone in converting postoperative JET to sinus rhythm. There was no difference in time taken to sinus rhythm conversion between the groups, although the rate control was earlier in patients who received amiodarone. Monotherapy with ivabradine may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone in the management of postoperative JET.

AB  - Background and Aim We sought to address the varied anatomical details, the diagnostic challenges, associated cardiopulmonary anomalies, the techniques, and outcomes of management, including re-interventions of scimitar syndrome. Methods A total of 92 published investigations of scimitar syndrome were reviewed. Diagnostic information was provided by clinical presentations, radiographic findings, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, computed-tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiocardiography, and ventilation/perfusion scans. These investigations served to elucidate the origin, course, and termination of the scimitar vein, the intracardiac anatomy, the presence of associated defects, and the patterns of any accompanying pulmonary lesions prior to surgical intervention. Results Of the patients described, up to four-fifths presented during infancy, with cardiac failure, increased pulmonary flow, and pulmonary hypertension. Associated cardiac and extracardiac defects, particularly hypoplasia of the right lung, are present in up to three-quarters of cases. Overall operative mortality has been cited between 4.8% and 5.9%. Mortality was highest in patients with preoperative pulmonary hypertension, and those undergoing surgery in infancy. Despite timely surgical intervention, post-repair obstruction of the scimitar vein, intra-atrial baffle obstruction, or stenosis of the inferior caval vein were reported in up to two-thirds of cases. The venous obstruction could not be related to any particular surgical technique. On long term follow-up, one sixth of patients reported persistent dyspnoea and recurrent respiratory infections. Conclusions Any infants presenting with heart failure, right-sided heart, and hypoplastic right lung should be evaluated to exclude the syndrome. An increased appreciation of variables will contribute to improved surgical management.

AB  - Background The impact of radiation-related lymphopenia on clinical outcomes has been reported in various solid malignancies such as high grade gliomas, head and neck cancers, thoracic malignancies and gastro-intestinal malignancies but its impact is not clearly known in the context of common genito-urinary (GU) malignancies. Methodology To better understand the effect of radiation-associated lymphopenia in prostate and bladder cancer, we undertook this systematic review of clinical studies that have studied radiation-related lymphopenia in GU malignancies. A systematic methodology search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library resulted in 2125 abstracts. Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria which included any prospective, retrospective study or cohort study of prostate, urinary bladder, kidney, ureter, urethra, penile cancer in humans, and radiation should be part of treatment and intent has to be in definitive or adjuvant settings. Finally the study should have data on radiation-related lymphopenia. Results Four studies reported on the cancer-specific outcomes related to the lymphopenia. The incidence of low lymphocyte counts were documented in all the studies. Three studies analyzed the factors associated with the Lymphocyte depletion. Pooled incidence of severe lymphopenia was 29.25% and mild to moderate lymphopenia was 60.75%. Bone marrow volume receiving 40 Gy was associated with the incidence of lymphopenia. Conclusion One-third of the patients suffer from severe lymphopenia after radiation in prostate and bladder cancer. There are no clear data to support the correlation between severe lymphopenia and disease outcomes. Bone marrow dosimetry can affect the incidence and severity of lymphopenia. There is need of prospective datasets to identify the impact of radiation-related lymphopenia in GU malignancies focusing on long-term side effects, recurrence rates, and overall survival.

AB  - Objectives: To qualitatively assess the clinical usefulness of patient-specific high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) print model of kidney before partial nephrectomy (PN) and to identify subset domains where it may help in clinical terms. Materials and Methods: Thirteen 3D models were printed for tumors having RENAL nephrometry score of >= 8. Their usage for PN was assessed prospectively using a qualitative questionnaire to be answered on a Likert scale of 1-10. The questions focused on realistic resemblance, preoperative dry surgical run, intertest comparison, surgical impact, and overall beneficence domains as perceived by primary surgeons with respect to surgical conduct during PN. Results: Mean RENAL score was 9.15 (8-11). Models were rated high (9.07 +/- 0.86) for realistic resemblance domain and were rated better than contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) (8.38 +/- 0.87) and intraoperative ultrasonography (8.07 +/- 1.26) for orientation regarding resection margins. A further marginal improvement to 8.2 +/- 0.84 was noted against ultrasound where surgeon did a dry cut preoperatively. Use of superselective arterial approach in four, precise awareness about dissection of a major vessel in four, retroperitoneoscopic approach in one, and surgical margin awareness in three were directly attributed to the model. Overall utility of having a model printed was rated high (8.23 +/- 1.3). Conclusion: The 3D print models of complex renal tumors have high realistic resemblance to actual patient's anatomy. They were rated better than preoperative CECT or intraoperative ultrasonography for orientation regarding surgical resection margins. It may also help change or modify the surgical plan in a subset of patients with a potential to improve overall outcomes in these complex cases.

AB  - Background and Aim Although the retroaortic left brachiocephalic vein in isolation is of no clinical importance, its recognition in the setting of associated lesions is important. We sought to address issues concerning the influence of isomerism, the establishment of diagnosis, and its importance in various surgical and interventional procedures. Methods A total of 80 published clinical and necropsy studies in the setting of a retroaortic left brachiocephalic vein described 250 patients. Clinical presentation, radiographic, ultrasonographic findings, contrast echocardiography, computed-tomographic angiocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiocardiography provided the diagnostic information prior to considering the surgical approach to the associated cardiac anomalies. Results Among 250 reported cases, three-quarters had associated congenitally malformed hearts. Of these 189 patients, all but seven had usual atrial arrangement. Right isomerism was reported in five patients and two patients having left isomerism. Almost two-thirds had tetralogy of Fallot or its variants, over four-fifths had malformations involving the outflow tract, two-thirds had a right aortic arch with two patients having a cervical aortic arch, and onepatient had double aortic arch. Various innovative individualized surgical procedures were employed with an overall perioperative mortality of 3.4%. Conclusions Although the retroaortic left brachiocephalic vein is asymptomatic, its recognition during clinical investigation should raise the possibility of an association with other malformations, especially right aortic arch, ventricular septal defect, and anomalies of the outflow tracts. We submit that an increased appreciation of this venous anomaly may facilitate surgical planning, endovascular procedures, placement of central venous lines, and transvenous pacemakers.

AB  - Background Haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) may act as a source of infection for the recipient due to manipulation at multiple levels from collection to infusion. Due to the high risk of contamination cultures are usually taken during multiple steps. The clinical significance of microbial contamination of HSC on the post-transplant course and the role of prophylactic antibiotics is relatively unknown. Aims and methods The aim of our study is to investigate the incidence of microbial contamination of haematopoietic stem cell and to assess its impact on the post-transplant febrile neutropenia, engraftment kinetics, hospitalisation and day 100 mortality. Details of all patients admitted in the bone marrow transplantation unit of a tertiary care centre in India between January 2014 and December 2018 were collected from case records. Results Of the 1306 stem cell harvests from 503 patients sent for culture, 17 harvests (1.3%) were found to have a culture positive report. Sixteen patients had undergone autologous transplant. Multiple myeloma was most common indication of HSC transplant followed by Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). Twelve of 17 HSC cultures were positive at the time of infusion and five were positive at the time of harvest. The five HSC that were culture positive at the time of harvest were culture negative at the time of infusion. Gram-positive organisms were isolated in six cultures and gram-negative in rest. All patients developed febrile neutropenia post-transplantation between day 1 and day 7. The median time of onset of fever was day +5 (1-7), the median duration of fever was 4 days (2-7), the median duration of antibiotic use was 11 days (9-16). Median day for neutrophil engraftment was 11 days (9-16), the median day for platelet engraftment was 14 days (10-25) and median duration of hospitalisation was 15 days (12-78). All patients were alive at day 100 of transplant. Conclusion This study shows that there appears to be minimal impact of culture positive HSC on transplant related outcomes in terms of engraftment kinetics, duration of hospitalisation and day 100 mortality. Discarding of contaminated HSC may not be required, though on development of febrile neutropenia appropriate antibiotics should be administered based on sensitivity pattern of HSC culture. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical relevance of such contaminations. Emphasis should be laid on better infection control practices to minimise contamination rates.

AB  - Background and Aim The morphological variations when one, or both, of the atrial chambers is subdivided, are many and varied. We sought to address clinical presentations, potentially misdiagnosed cases, diagnostic modalities, surgical approaches, and outcomes of this "family" of uncommon lesions. Methods A total of 193 published investigations were synthesized. Diagnostic information was provided by clinical presentation, and multimodality imaging studies. Results Almost three-quarters of patients with divided atrial chambers present during infancy with severe pulmonary hypertension and cardiac failure. Associated cardiac and extra-cardiac defects are present in between half and nine-tenths of cases. Acquired division of the left atrium has been reported after the Fontan operation, orthotopic cardiac transplantation, and complicated aortic valvar infective endocarditis. Surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass remains the definitive treatment. Balloon dilation may be considered in anatomically compatible variants in the setting of cardiac failure and pregnancy as a bridge todefinitive treatment. Overall, mortality has been cited between nil to 29%. Presentation during infancy, associated congenital anomalies, pulmonary hypertension, and surgery in the previous era, have been the reported causes of death. The operative survivors have long-term favourable outcomes, with near normal cardiac dimensions and low risk of recurrence. While asymptomatic patients with division of the right atrium do not need treatment, surgical resection of the dividing partition under cardiopulmonary bypass is recommended in symptomatic patients with complex anatomy, the spinnaker malformation, or associated cardiac anomalies. Balloon dilation may be considered in uncomplicated patients with less obstructive lesions. Hybrid intervention and endoscopic robotic correction also have been performed. Conclusions Resection of the dividing shelf allows the survivors to regain near normal dimensions with a low risk of recurrence. We submit that an increased appreciation of the anatomic background to division of the atrial chambers will contribute to improved surgical management.

AB  - Cytopathology has emerged as a promising platform in precision oncology especially after the revolutionary change in our understanding of the concept of lung cancer etiopathogenesis. With increasing use of minimally invasive techniques for sample acquisition, it becomes almost mandatory to utilize precious cytology samples maximally and judiciously by appropriate triaging of the specimen and timely action of the cytopathology team. Existing patient management protocols require accurate morphologic and molecular diagnosis of the lung cancer specimens which needs knowledge about evolving techniques related to specimen procurement, updates of genomic variants of lung cancer and recently developed molecular testing platforms and algorithms which are capable enough to use even miniscule amount of diagnostic material. This review provides a brief knowledge about advances in cytology of lung cancer which are helpful for developing correct clinical management strategies.

AB  - Germline inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4) gene encoding for BRG1 (Brahma related gene-1) are the molecular drivers in small cell carcinoma of ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and in malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) that occur in the context of rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome-type 2. Somatic SMARCA4 mutations and/or loss of BRG1 have been identified in a variety of adult-onset epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms. Among thoracic tumors, these include subsets of smoking-related non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and a relatively rare, newly recognised tumor entity: thoracic SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumor (SMARCA4-UT). Less than 100 cases of SMARCA4-UT have been reported to date. They present as large compressive and infiltrative mediastinal, lung and/or pleural masses in middle-aged male smokers. They are undifferentiated tumors composed of sheets of small/epithelioid and/or rhabdoid tumor cells variably expressing epithelial markers and consistently showing loss of BRG1 and the closely related protein, Brahma (BRM). Frequent expression of stem cell markers (SOX2, CD34, SALL4) is noted. Despite gene expression profiles similar to MRTs and SCCOHT, they show striking genomic overlap with SMARCA4-mutant NSCLC with frequent TP53, STK11, KEAP1, and KRAS mutations, high tumor mutation burden (TMB), and presence of smoking related molecular signatures in tumor cells. SMARCA4-UT show uniformly poor survival and are irresponsive to conventional therapies. Immunotherapy responses are variable but promising, although PDL1 expression appears to be of poor predictive value. Drugs exploiting genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of SMARCA4 antagonism hold promise for future targeted therapies.

AB  - Mucormycosis is a deadly infection which is caused by fungi of the order Mucorales including species belonging to the genus Rhizopus, Mucor, Mycocladus, Rhizomucor, Cunninghamella, and Apophysomyces. Despite antifungal therapy and surgical procedures, the mortality rate of this disease is about 90-100% which is exceptionally high. The hypersensitivity of patients with raised available serum iron indicates that the Mucorales are able to use host iron as a critical factor of virulence. This is because iron happens to be a crucial element playing its role in the growth of cells and development. In this review, we have described Lactoferrin (Lf) as a potential iron-chelator. Lf is a naturally occurring glycoprotein which is expressed in most of the biological fluids. Moreover, Lf possesses exclusive anti-inflammatory effects along with several anti-fungal effects that could prove to be helpful to the pathological physiology of inexorable mucormycosis cases. This literature summarises the biological insights into the Lf being considered as a potential fungistatic agent and an immune regulator. The review also proposes that unique potential of Lf as an iron-chelator can be exploited as the adjunct treatment for mucormycosis infection.

AB  - Background Perioperative pulmonary aspiration risk increases with increased preoperative gastric volume; hence traditionally, healthy children are kept fasted overnight before surgery. Current guidelines recommend 2-h clear fluids fasting prior to anesthesia. However, emerging evidence favors allowing 3 ml/kg clear fluids up to 1-h before anesthesia. We compared the gastric volume and gastric emptying time after ingestion of 3 ml/kg and 5 ml/kg of clear fluids. Methods The present study enrolled 44 children, aged between 6 and 14 years. On the day of surgery, baseline gastric volume was estimated using ultrasound and patients were randomly allocated into two groups of equal number, that is, Group 3 and Group 5 (patients received 3 ml/kg and 5 ml/kg 5% Dextrose respectively). Repeated gastric ultrasound was performed at every 5 min until the gastric volume reached baseline levels. The primary objective of the study was to compare gastric emptying time. Secondary objectives included comparison of antral cross-sectional area and gastric volume. Results The demographic profile, preoperative fasting duration for clear fluids, and baseline gastric volume were comparable between groups. In both groups, compared to baseline the antral cross-sectional area and gastric volume increased significantly following fluid ingestion and then decreased exponentially to reach baseline within 1-h. The median (IQR) (range) gastric emptying time (minutes) [35.0 (28.8, 40.0) (20.0-45.0) in group 3 and 40.0 (28.8, 45.0) (20.0-50.0) in group 5] and emptying half-time (minutes) [17.0 (15.7, 21.5) (14.4-24.0) in group 3 and 18.6 (16.0, 22.0) (15.1-23.8) in group 5] were comparable [median difference -5 (95% CI -7.8 to 2.1) and -1.5 (95% CI -2.3 to 1.0), respectively] (p = .16 and p = .44, respectively). Conclusion As the gastric volume returned to baseline within 1-h even after ingesting 5 ml/kg clear fluids, the preoperative fasting time can be reduced to 1-h and healthy children undergoing elective procedure can be safely allowed to drink up to 5 ml/kg clear fluids.

AB  - Urinary ethyl glucuronide (EtG), an alcohol biomarker, plays an essential role in monitoring alcohol abstinence and relapse during treatment for alcohol dependence. Detection of this biomarker has become a routine in many clinical and forensic laboratories over the last few years. Most previously published methods commonly use hyphenated chromatographic techniques along with extensive extraction procedure before analysis. This work aimed to develop and validate an electron impact ionization mode gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method to measure ethyl glucuronide levels in human urine. For its determination, urine samples were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen, derivatized with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide, incubated, and injected into the instrument. The analysis was performed using single quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technology and validation was performed according to the guidelines of the German Society of Toxicology and Forensic Chemistry (GTFCh). The linearity of urinary EtG was obtained in the range of 30-5000 ng/ml with a correlation coefficient (r) above 0.999. The extraction recoveries exceeded 80%, and the obtained inter-day and intra-day precisions were below 15%. The achieved limit of detection was 10 ng/ml and limit of quantification achieved was 30 ng/ml. The electron ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique proves to be a feasible option for determining EtG in human urine when other sophisticated techniques are unapproachable. This method provides a good sensitivity and proves to be cost-effective, robust, and advantageous for both clinical as well as forensic settings.

AB  - The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the foremost target for the designing of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies and also acts as a crucial antigen in the assessment of COVID-19 immune responses. The enveloped viruses; such as SARS-CoV-2, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) and influenza, often hijack host-cell glycosylation pathways and influence pathobiology and immune selection. These glycan motifs can lead to either immune evasion or viral neutralization by the production of cross-reactive antibodies that can lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Potential cross-protection from influenza vaccine has also been reported in COVID-19 infected individuals in several epidemiological studies recently; however, the scientific basis for these observations remains elusive. Herein, we show that the anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies crossreacts with the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein. This phenomenon is common to both the sera from convalescent SARS-CoV-2 donors and spike immunized mice, although these antibodies were unable to cross-neutralize, suggesting the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response. Epitope mapping suggests that the crossreactive antibodies are targeted towards glycan epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and HA. Overall, our findings address the cross-reactive responses, although non-neutralizing, elicited against RNA viruses and warrant further studies to investigate whether such non-neutralizing antibody responses can contribute to effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or ADE.

AB  - We have analyzed the prevalence of IKZF1 deletions in 320 cases of BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and evaluated the clinical outcomes in two subtypes of these deletions. The loss-of-function type of IKZF1 deletion was the predominant subtype and was associated with lower post-induction remission rates, poor event-free survival, and overall survival compared with cases without IKZF1 deletions. There was a similar trend of poor outcomes in the few cases with the dominantnegative type of IKZF1 deletions.
   Background: IKZF1 deletions are associated with adverse outcomes in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We assessed the prevalence and clinical impact of functional subtypes of IKZF1 deletions in pediatric BCR-ABL1negative B-ALL. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study of IKZF1 deletions was done in cases of pediatric BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL. The genomic DNA of cases, over a 53-month period, was analyzed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction. The deletions were divided into functional subgroups: (1) loss-of-function/haploinsufficiency, (2) dominant-negative, and (3) a combination of both types of deletion. The post-induction remission status, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were noted. Results: Out of 320 cases, 47 (14.7%) had IKZF1 deletions. Thirty-six of the 47 (77%) had loss-of-function deletions, 10 (21%) had dominant-negative deletions, and one (2%) had a combination of both types. The post-induction remission rates in cases with loss-of-function deletions (22/30, 73%; P=.060) and dominant-negative deletions (4/5, 80%; P=.517) were lower compared with those without deletions (215/248, 86.7%). These cases also had worse median EFS: 21.1 months (P=.006) for loss-of-function and 15.4 months (P=.156) for dominant-negative deletions, compared with 46.4 months in cases without IKZF1 deletions. They also had worse median OS: 23.4 months (P=.012) for loss-offunction deletions and 15.7 months (P=.233) for dominant-negative deletions, compared with median not reached in cases without IKZF1 deletions. Conclusion: The IKZF1 deletions were seen in 14.7% of BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric B-ALL. Most of these deletions (77%) were loss-of-function type. The cases with loss-of-function deletions had lower remission rates and poor EFS and OS compared with cases without IKZF1 deletions. A similar trend of poor outcome was seen in the few cases with dominant-negative IKZF1 deletions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acanthamoebic encephalitis is a rare and highly fatal disease that has no standard management protocol. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes immune dysfunction and may predispose patients to this infection. The present study describes successful management of acanthamoebic encephalitis in a young male who recently recovered from COVID-19 using a combination of medical and surgical approaches. A combination of miltefosine with other agents with trophicidal and cysticidal activities should be used in the regimen. Surgical excision of the abscess should be undertaken whenever feasible. 0 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

AB  - RUNX1T1 has been found to be mutated in different cancers such as prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancer. A recent computational study involving the TCGA database of glioma patients found RUNX1T1 as one of the down-regulated driver genes associated with poor overall survival of glioma patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) is upregulated in glioma and has been associated with the severity and drug resistance of glioma. Previously, we have shown that RUNX1T3 degrades HIF1 alpha affecting the proliferation of leukemia cells. We hypothesize that RUNXIT1 might be associated with the growth and development of glioma through the regulation of HIF1 alpha. We have evaluated the expression level of RUNX1T1 at different stages of glioma and the effect of RUNX1T1 on the proliferation and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells in vitro. We further looked at the effect of RUNX1T1 on the expression and stability of HIF1 alpha in vitro. Expression of RUNX1T1 was significantly downregulated, both at RNA and protein levels in glioma samples as studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. While expression of HIF1 alpha was higher in glioma tissues compared with its level in the normal brain. In vitro studies demonstrated that RUNXIT1 interacted with HIF1 alpha and recruited HIF1 alpha modification factor such as PHD2 and GSK3 beta causing hydroxylation of HIF1 alpha following ubiquitination by FBW7. RUNX1T1 led to the degradation of HIF1 alpha and decreased proliferation/invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines. Further, RUNX1T1 increased the effectiveness of temozolomide (TMZ), a conventional glioma drug toward glioblastoma cell lines. This study indicates that downregulation of RUNX1T1 might play an important role in the severity and development of glioma.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has posed an unprecedented challenge to the world. Pandemics have been caused previously by viruses of this family like Middle East Respiratory Corona Virus (MERS CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS CoV). Although these viruses are primarily respiratory viruses, but they have been isolated from non-respiratory samples as well. Presently, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from different clinical specimens using Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerized Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) after onset of symptoms is not yet well established. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to establish the profile of detecting SARS-CoV-2, MERS CoV, SARS CoV from different types of clinical specimens other than the respiratory using a standard diagnostic test (qRT-PCR). A total of 3429 non-respiratory specimens were recorded: SARS CoV (total sample-802), MERS CoV (total sample-155), SARS CoV-2 (total sample-2347). Out of all the samples studied high positive rate was seen for saliva with 96.7% (14/14; 95% CI 87.6-100.0%) for SARS CoV and 57.5% (58/250; 95% CI - 1.2 to 116.2%) for SARS CoV-2, while low detection rate in urine samples for SARS CoV-2 with 2.2% (8/318; 95% CI 0.6-3.7%) and 9.6% (12/61; 95% CI - 0.9 to 20.1%) for SARS CoV but there was relatively higher positivity in urine samples for MERS CoV with detection rate of 32.4% (2/38; 95% CI - 37.3 to 102.1%). In Stool sample positivity was 54.9% (396/779; 95% CI 41.0-68.8%), 45.2% (180/430; 95% CI 28.1-62.3%) and 34.7% (4/38; 95% CI - 29.5 to 98.9%) for SARS CoV-2, MERS CoV, and SARS CoV, respectively. In blood sample the positivity was 33.3% (7/21; 95% CI 13.2-53.5%), 23.7% (42/277; 95% CI 10.5-36.9%) and 2.5% (2/81; 95% CI 0.00-5.8%) for MERS CoV, SARS CoV-2 and SARS CoV respectively. SARS-CoV-2 along with previous two pandemic causing viruses from this family, were highly detected stool and saliva. A low positive rate was recorded in blood samples. Viruses were also detected in fluids along with unusual samples like semen and vaginal secretions thus highlighting unique pathogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We aimed to determine the impact of pre-operative isolation on postoperative pulmonary complications after elective surgery during the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We performed an international prospective cohort study including patients undergoing elective surgery in October 2020. Isolation was defined as the period before surgery during which patients did not leave their house or receive visitors from outside their household. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications, adjusted in multivariable models for measured confounders. Pre-defined sub-group analyses were performed for the primary outcome. A total of 96,454 patients from 114 countries were included and overall, 26,948 (27.9%) patients isolated before surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications were recorded in 1947 (2.0%) patients of which 227 (11.7%) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who isolated pre-operatively were older, had more respiratory comorbidities and were more commonly from areas of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence and high-income countries. Although the overall rates of postoperative pulmonary complications were similar in those that isolated and those that did not (2.1% vs 2.0%, respectively), isolation was associated with higher rates of postoperative pulmonary complications after adjustment (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05-1.36, p = 0.005). Sensitivity analyses revealed no further differences when patients were categorised by: pre-operative testing; use of COVID-19-free pathways; or community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. The rate of postoperative pulmonary complications increased with periods of isolation longer than 3 days, with an OR (95%CI) at 4-7 days or >= 8 days of 1.25 (1.04-1.48), p = 0.015 and 1.31 (1.11-1.55), p = 0.001, respectively. Isolation before elective surgery might be associated with a small but clinically important increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Longer periods of isolation showed no reduction in the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. These findings have significant implications for global provision of elective surgical care.

AB  - Background: As the health systems around the world struggled to meet the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, care of many non-COVID emergencies was affected. Aims: The present study examined differences in the diagnosis, evaluation and management of stroke patients during a defined period in the ongoing pandemic in 2020 when compared to a similar epoch in year 2019. Methods: The COVID stroke study group (CSSG) India, included 18 stroke centres spread across the country. Data was collected prospectively between February and July 2020 and retrospectively for the same period in 2019. Details of demographics, stroke evaluation, treatment, in-hospital and three months outcomes were collected and compared between these two time points. Results: A total of 2549 patients were seen in both study periods; 1237 patients (48.53%) in 2019 and 1312 (51.47%) in 2020. Although the overall number of stroke patients and rates of thrombolysis were comparable, a significant decline was observed in the month of April 2020, during the initial period of the pandemic and lockdown. Endovascular treatment reduced significantly and longer door to needle and CT to needle times were observed in 2020. Although mortality was higher in 2020, proportion of patients with good outcome were similar in both the study periods. Conclusions: Although stroke admissions and rates of thrombolysis were comparable, some work flow metrics were delayed, endovascular stroke treatment rates declined and mortality was higher during the pandemic study period. Reorganization of stroke treatment pathways during the pandemic has likely improved the stroke care delivery across the globe.

AB  - Introduction: We propose "MRplus", a molecular genetic risk score and check its clinical application in the riskstratification of pediatric B-ALL. Methods: The genomic DNA of untreated pediatricBCR-ABL1 negative B-ALL patients was analyzed for deletions of IKZF1, PAX5, CDKN2A/B, BTG1, RB1, ETV6, EBF1, ERG, pseudoautosomal region(PAR) genes using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, along with the routine genetic work-up. The patients were assigned an 'M'score- 0 (M0) for low and 1 (M1) for high genetic-risk as per the criteria by Moorman et al., and another score "IKplus"-1 (IKplus1) for IKZF1plus as per the criteria by Stanulla et al., and 0 (IKplus0) for other patients. The final "MRplus" risk-score of 0 (MRplus0), 1 (MRplus1) or 2 (MRplus2) was obtained by adding both these scores. The association of risk scores with overall survival (OS) and event free survival(EFS) was seen using Cox proportion hazard model. The overall goodness of fit of the model was done using Cox-Snell residuals. Results: The median age of 320 patients was 6 years (1-18 years). The patients with score M1 were 139 (43.4 %), M0- 181 (56.6 %); IKplus1- 32 (10 %) and IKplus0- 288 (90 %). The final "MRplus" score of 0,1,or 2 was obtained in 181(56.6 %), 107(33.4 %) and 32(10 %) patients respectively. The post-induction remission rate was 90.7 %, 77.8 %, 73.9 % (p = 0.004); 4-year OS 67 %, 48 %, 27 % (p < 0.001); and 4-year EFS 56 %, 34 %, 19 %(p < 0.001) in patients with "MRplus" score 0,1,and 2 respectively. Conclusions: The proposed "MRplus" scoring at baseline could identify three distinct risk groups-good (MRplus0), intermediate (MRplus1) and poor (MRplus2), with different outcomes; in pediatricBCR-ABL1 negative B-ALL. This may help in better risk-stratification and selection of patients for alternative treatment approaches.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the use of fluorescent carbon dots (C-dots) as an alternative to toxic synthetic organic dyes in live cell imaging, medical diagnostics and other diverse biomedical applications. In the present work, highly fluorescent C-dots have been prepared from commercially available peptic digest of animal tissue, without using any additional chemical reagent for surface functionalization. The synthesized C-dots are monodispersed nanomaterials with hydroxyl, carboxyl and amino surface functionalities and remain stable in high ionic strength media and over a wide range of pH. They exhibit a strong blue fluorescence upon excitation at 350 nm with a high quantum yield of 61%. The potential use of these C-dots as fluorescent nanoprobe for specific metal ions (Cu2+ and Hg2+) detection through chelation, radical scavenging and cellular imaging has been investigated. These highly fluorescent labels show rapid cellular internalization without hampering cellular integrity. Cell proliferation assay demonstrates that these C-dots have minimal cell toxicity even at a high concentration of 3 mg/mL. They show significant quenching on incubation with cells pretreated with Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions. They also show rapid exocytosis from cells showcasing their high potential for chelation therapy. Thus, this study offers a scalable synthesis approach for highly fluorescent and biocompatible C-dots from a cost-effective precursor, which can be used for specific metal ions detection and their removal from cells through chelation via exocytosis. They can also be used as an alternate to synthetic organic dyes for fluorescence-based cell-imaging.

AB  - Background Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an important structural component of human brain and retina. Evidence exists linking nutritional status of pregnant mothers and cognitive functions of their born infants. The DHANI (Maternal DHA Supplementation and Offspring Neurodevelopment in India) trial was implemented to evaluate the effect of maternal supplementation with DHA during pregnancy and for 6 months following delivery on motor and mental development of infants at 1 and 12 months. We describe here the standardization and validation of an assay for measurement of selected omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids from the phospholipid fraction of red blood cells to assess their status in mothers at baseline, delivery and 6 months post-delivery and for infants in cord blood and at 1 and 12 months of age. The validated method has been used for the analysis of samples for DHANI. Methods Lipids were extracted from a pool of red blood cells, separated using thin layer chromatography. The phospholipid fraction was esterified, and fatty acids were separated by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector. Result The method accuracy for DHA was between 97 - 98% and between 91 - 95% for arachidonic acid (AA) at three different concentrations. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation for the fatty acids ranged from 1.19 to 5.7% and 0.78 to 13.0% respectively. Intraclass correlation (ICC), as a measure of reproducibility, ranged between 0.689 and 0.996. A good linearity was observed for all the fatty acids between concentrations of 0.2-4 mu g/ml. Conclusion The standardized and validated method is suitable for implementation in large epidemiological studies for evaluation of fatty acids and in nutritional trials for assessment of fatty acid content of various lipid classes.

AB  - Background Measuring routine childhood vaccination is crucial to inform global vaccine policies and programme implementation, and to track progress towards targets set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and Immunization Agenda 2030. Robust estimates of routine vaccine coverage are needed to identify past successes and persistent vulnerabilities. Drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020, Release 1, we did a systematic analysis of global, regional, and national vaccine coverage trends using a statistical framework, by vaccine and over time.
   Methods For this analysis we collated 55 326 country-specific, cohort-specific, year-specific, vaccine-specific, and dosespecific observations of routine childhood vaccination coverage between 1980 and 2019. Using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, we produced location-specific and year-specific estimates of 11 routine childhood vaccine coverage indicators for 204 countries and territories from 1980 to 2019, adjusting for biases in countryreported data and reflecting reported stockouts and supply disruptions. We analysed global and regional trends in coverage and numbers of zero-dose children (defined as those who never received a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTP] vaccine dose), progress towards GVAP targets, and the relationship between vaccine coverage and sociodemographic development.
   Findings By 2019, global coverage of third-dose DTP (DTP3; 81.6% [95% uncertainty interval 80.4-82 .7]) more than doubled from levels estimated in 1980 (39.9% [37.5-42.1]), as did global coverage of the first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1; from 38.5% [35.4-41.3] in 1980 to 83.6% [82.3-84.8] in 2019). Third- dose polio vaccine (Pol3) coverage also increased, from 42.6% (41.4-44.1) in 1980 to 79.8% (78.4-81.1) in 2019, and global coverage of newer vaccines increased rapidly between 2000 and 2019. The global number of zero-dose children fell by nearly 75% between 1980 and 2019, from 56.8 million (52.6-60. 9) to 14.5 million (13.4-15.9). However, over the past decade, global vaccine coverage broadly plateaued; 94 countries and territories recorded decreasing DTP3 coverage since 2010. Only 11 countries and territories were estimated to have reached the national GVAP target of at least 90% coverage for all assessed vaccines in 2019.
   Interpretation After achieving large gains in childhood vaccine coverage worldwide, in much of the world this progress was stalled or reversed from 2010 to 2019. These findings underscore the importance of revisiting routine immunisation strategies and programmatic approaches, recentring service delivery around equity and underserved populations. Strengthening vaccine data and monitoring systems is crucial to these pursuits, now and through to 2030, to ensure that all children have access to, and can benefit from, lifesaving vaccines.

AB  - Purpose: We aimed to study the long-term efficacy, prognostic factors and complications associated with the GKRS for trigeminal neuralgia. Methods and Materials: Prospectively created database was analyzed for these patients. We created an Artificial neural Network - using Multilayer perceptron model in SPSS 23 by including all variables whose p value were<0.5 in univariate analysis. Results: A total of 36 patients were included in the study. Patients pain free at 6 months were 25(69.44%), which reduced to 6(40 %) at 6 years. Median time to pain relief was 18.5 days. Only 5(13.88%) of them developed new onset or worsened numbness post Gamma Knife radio surgery. Median radiation dose was 80 Gy (prescribed at 100 percent isodose line). 1st GKT (P value < 0.05) and post GKT numbness (P value < 0.05) were the only factors favouring good outcome. Prior history of MVD was associated with poor pain relief post GKRS although p value was not signif-icant (p = 0.136). ANN model could predict with 90.0 percent accuracy the favourable or unfavourable response on 11 Tested cases. In ANN model, a greater number of Pre GKT medications, previous MVD his-tory, V2 dermatome involvement and negative history of post GKT numbness were negative prognostic factors. Conclusions: Lesser number of pre GKRS drugs used, involvement of V1 dermatome, post GKT numbness are favourable prognostic factors. Also, history of failed MVD for trigeminal neuralgia is associated with poor outcome. Repeat GKRS failed to show improvement in BNI grades. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adjusting Reported COVID-19 Deaths for the Prevailing Routine Death Surveillance in India

KW  - missing deaths
AB  - In India, the "low mortality" narrative based on the reported COVID-19 deaths may be causing more harm than benefit. The extent to which COVID-19 deaths get reported depends on the coverage of routine death surveillance [death registration along with medical certification of cause of death (MCCD)] and the errors in MCCD. In India, the coverage of routine death surveillance is 18.1%. This is compounded by the fact that COVID-19 death reporting is focused among reported cases and the case detection ratio is low. To adjust for the coverage of routine death surveillance and errors in MCCD, we calculated a correction (multiplication) factor at national and state level to produce an estimated number of COVID-19 deaths. As on July 31, 2020, we calculated the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for India (0.58:100-1.16:100) using these estimated COVID-19 deaths; this is comparable with the IFR range in countries with near perfect routine death surveillance. We recommend the release of excess deaths data during COVID-19 (at least in states with high death registration) and post-mortem COVID-19 testing as a surveillance activity for a better understanding of under-reporting. In its absence, we should adjust reported COVID-19 deaths for the coverage of routine death surveillance and errors in MCCD. This way we will have a clear idea of the true burden of deaths and our public health response will never be inadequate. We recommend that "reported" or "estimated" is added before the COVID-19 death data and related indicators for better clarity and interpretation.

KW  - SYSTEMS
AB  - A micron scale alginate based 3D platform embedded with a carbon dot pH sensor, that enables continuous growth monitoring of encapsulated cells in real time is reported. The alginate based 3D micro-scaffold closely mimics a tumor microenvironment by providing a spatial demarcation and making it possible to encapsulate different cells in close proximity. The micro-scaffold contains carbon dot based nanosensors that enable real time monitoring of pH change in the tumor microenvironment avoiding the need for end-point assays for studying cellular growth. The micro-scaffolds have heterogeneous architecture and a hypoxic core region can be observed in as less as 96 h of culture. In this completely synthetic platform, there also exist the flexibility of artificially modifying the porosity of the micro-scaffold as per the requirement of the studies where a denser ECM mimic is required. The micro-scaffolds were conducive for cell growth as suggested by the enhanced functional profile of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and positively influence the genetic expression of the cell specific markers. Additionally, similar to a 3D tumor, non-homogeneous diffusion of molecules is also observed making this an ideal platform for cancer modelling and drug screening.

AB  - Background: Corticosteroids have become the mainstay treatment in severe COVID-19. However, its role is mild disease is controversial due to lack of robust scientific evidence. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess effect of steroids in mild COVID-19 patients.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and medRxiv were searched from 31 December 2019 to 14 May 2021 for studies that reported effectiveness of steroids in non-oxygen requiring COVID-19 patients in terms of progressing to severe disease, mortality, duration of fever, duration of viral clearance and length of hospital stay (LOHS). Studies on inhalational steroids, case reports and reviews were excluded. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed by the Cochrane's ROB tool and ROBANS tool. Quantitative data synthesis was done using the generic inverse variance method.
   Results: A total of 6411 studies were identified, 2990 articles were screened after exclusion. Seven studies which fit the criteria (involving 2214 non-oxygen requiring COVID-19 patients) were included and analysed. Overall odds of progression to severe disease among the non-oxygen requiring COVID-19 patients receiving steroids was 5.97 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-27.99, I-2 = 0%] and odds of death (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.01-1.79; I-2 = 0%) as compared to the patients not receiving steroids. Mean duration of fever (7.4 days), duration to viral clearance (18.9 days) and LOHS (20.8 days) were significantly higher in the steroid arm, as compared to that in no-steroid arm (6.7, 16.5 and 15.2 days, respectively).
   Conclusion: Steroids in non-oxygen requiring COVID-19 patients can be more detrimental than beneficial.

AB  - Pathogenic variations in SMPD1 lead to acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), that is, Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A and B (NPA, NPB), which is a recessive lysosomal storage disease. The knowledge of variant spectrum in Indian patients is crucial for early and accurate NPD diagnosis and genetic counseling of families. In this study, we recruited 40 unrelated pediatric patients manifesting symptoms of ASMD and subnormal ASM enzyme activity. Variations in SMPD1 were studied using Sanger sequencing for all exons, followed by interpretation of variants based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics & Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria. We identified 18 previously unreported variants and 21 known variants, including missense, nonsense, deletions, duplications, and splice site variations with disease-causing potential. Eight missense variants were functionally characterized using in silico molecular dynamic simulation and in vitro transient transfection in HEK293T cells, followed by ASM enzyme assay, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence studies. All the variants showed reduced ASM activity in transfected cells confirming their disease-causing potential. The study provides data for efficient prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling of families with NPD type A and B.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an extensively used organophosphate pesticide for crop protection. However, there are concerns of it contaminating the environment and human health with estimated three lakh deaths annually. Detection of CPF in blood samples holds significance to avoid severe health outcomes due to continuous exposure. The most common techniques for CPF detection are Gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). However, these techniques might not be feasible at the community healthcare level due to high-cost instrumentation, time-consuming sample preparation protocol and skilled analysts. Therefore, rapid, effective and economical methods such as immunoassay would be imperative for CPF detection in biological samples. The vital step in immunoassay development is the design of a potent immunogen from non-immunogenic molecules. The molecular modelling protocol could assist in redesigning known CPF linkers and inserting them at different substitutable positions of CPF to get distinctive CPF derivatives. Molecular docking and binding free energy analysis can be used to identify the CPF derivatives having a better binding affinity with carrier protein compared to CPF. The top-ranked CPF derivatives based on docking score and binding energy could be ideal for synthesis and immunogen development. The present review will comprehend technological trends in immunoassay kits for detecting chlorpyrifos from biological samples.

AB  - Objective: Pediatric tracheostomy is a challenge in otolaryngology practice and it is associated with greater morbidity and mortality than in adults; hence, constant vigilance by the designated family caregiver is critical. This study was designed to assess the impact of on quality of life of caregivers in a homecare setting as a result of the presence of child with a tracheostomy. Methods: This was a combined retrospective and prospective cohort study with caregivers of children younger than 16 years who had undergone a tracheostomy, had been discharged home with a tracheostomy tube and completed 6 months of domiciliary tracheostomy care. The consenting primary caregivers were assessed for their quality of life based on the PedsQL v 4.0 questionnaires across various domains. Results: We identified the primary caregivers of 85 children who had undergone a tracheostomy during the study period. The children's median age was 3.5 years (range, 9 months to 14 years). The mean caregiver health related quality of life (HRQOL) score was 59.3, the mean family functioning score was 62.8, and the mean total family impact score was 54.7 with relative deficits seen in caregiver's social functioning (56.9) and emotional functioning (53.2). Good or average quality of physical and social function was seen among 74 % and 65 % of caregivers respectively while only 55 % were reported having good or average emotional function. Emotional disturbance, interfering with everyday family activities, and sleep disturbance were the major concerns among caregivers. Conclusion: The biopsychosocial consequences of caring for a child with a tracheostomy are profound for the family, affecting the quality of life of caregivers and adding to the emotional and social burden of the child's family.

AB  - Introduction Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) has varied etiology. We assessed the etiological spectrum and evaluated the utility of fetal whole exome sequencing (fWES) for the diagnosis of NIHF. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated antenatally diagnosed fetuses with NIHF between July 2018 and December 2019 according to the routine diagnostic algorithm. Fetuses that remained undiagnosed after routine NIHF workup were subjected to fetal chromosomal microarray and/or WES. Pregnancies were followed up for clinical outcomes. Results Of the 45 fetuses, consanguinity and recurrent hydrops fetalis were observed in 13.3% (6/45) and 28.8% (13/45), respectively. Overall, an etiological diagnosis was possible in 75.5% (34/45) of fetuses, while the cause remained unknown in 24.4% (11/45). A genetic etiology was identified in 46.6% (21/45): aneuploidy and monogenic disorders in 28.8% (13/45) and 17.8% (8/45), respectively. fWES on 19 fetuses detected disease-causing variants in 42.1% (8/19). Nine novel variants were detected in RAPSN, ASCC1, NEB, PKD1L1, GUSB, and PIEZO1. Only 8.8% (4/45) of the cohort survived without morbidity. Conclusions This study describes the etiological spectrum and the disease-causing variants in an Indian cohort of hydropic fetuses.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
KW  - large vessel vasculitis
KW  - sinus of valsalva aneurysm
KW  - Takayasu arteritis
AB  - Background: Takayasu arteritis and tuberculous aortitis, both can result in aneurysmal disease of the aorta. The overlapping imaging features in case of large vessel vasculitis can create a diagnostic dilemma.
   Aim: We present a case of large vessel vasculitis and chronic empyema with unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm.
   Methods and Results: A 30-year-old man presented with acute onset shortness of breath, palpitations, and gradually progressing pedal edema. The echocardiography and CT angiogram revealed features of large vessel vasculitis and chronic empyema along with unruptured sinus of valsava aneurysms. Patient underwent emergency Bentall procedure and the histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of takayasu arteritis.
   Discussion: Tuberculosis being an endemic disease with varied presentations should always be considered a differential diagnosis, whenever appropriate. An unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm can be clinically silent or can cause compression symptoms. Although there are no specific guidelines regarding surgical correction, symptomatic and aneurysms of size >5.5cm are usually managed surgically.
   Conclusion: Unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysms can be seen in Takayasu arteritis, which complicates the methodology and timing of the surgical management.

AB  - The role of lipoprotein-A [Lp (a)] as a risk factor for stroke is less well documented than for coronary heart disease. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for the published observational studies in order to investigate the association of Lp (a) levels with the risk of stroke and its subtypes. In our meta-analysis, 41 studies involving 7874 ischemic stroke (IS) patients and 32,138 controls; 13 studies for the IS subtypes based on TOAST classification and 7 studies with 871 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) cases and 2865 control subjects were included. A significant association between increased levels of Lp (a) and risk of IS as compared to control subjects was observed (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CIs) 0.53-0.99). Lp (a) levels were also found to be significantly associated with the risk of large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) subtype of IS (SMD 0.68; 95% CI 0.01-1.34) as well as significantly associated with the risk of ICH (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.13- 1.17) as compared to controls. Increased Lp (a) levels could be considered as a predictive marker for identifying individuals who are at risk of developing IS, LAA and ICH.

AB  - Lateral flow assay (LFA) is a flexible, simple, low-costpoint-of-care platform for rapid detection of disease specific biomarkers. Importantly, the ability of the assay to capture the circulating bio-molecules has gained significant attention, as it offers a potential minimal invasive system for early disease diagnosis and prognosis. In the present article, we review an innovative concept of LFA-based detection of circulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), one of the key regulators of fundamental biological processes. In addition, their disease-specific expression pattern and presence in biological fluids at differential levels make them excellent biomarker candidates for cancer detection. Our article also provides an update on the requirements for developing and improving such systems and discusses the key aspects of material selection, operational concepts, principles and conceptual design. We assume that the reviewed points will be helpful to improve the diagnostic applicability of LFA based lncRNA detection in cancer diagnosis. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this trial was to study the effect on pain and mouth opening of intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin-A into masticatory muscles following surgical intervention in oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) cases. Injections of either botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) (study group) or normal saline (control group) were given 2 weeks prior to surgical intervention in OSMF patients, into the bilateral masseter and temporalis muscles. All patients were evaluated for pain and ease of active physiotherapy at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery using a numerical rating scale and appropriate questionnaires, with comparisons made between the study and control group patients. Electromyographic studies of the masticator muscles were also carried out in all patients before injection, and at 1 month and 6 months after injection. 20 OSMF patients were equally divided into study and control groups (n = 10 each). At 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery, the study group patients showed significantly greater decreases in pain (p-values of 0.007, 0.001, and 0.005, respectively) and greater ease in physiotherapy compared with the control group. EMG recordings of masticator muscles showed a transient drop in microvolt value in the study group 1 month after injection, unlike the control group recordings. It was concluded that preoperative BTX-A injection was a good addition to surgical therapy in the patient group. (C) 2021 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

AB  - Purpose:A survey was conducted by the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) to document the initial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related financial impact on ophthalmology practice in India. It also assessed various measures taken by ophthalmologists and the possible role of AIOS in mitigating the economic crisis. Methods:An online questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among its registered members from July to August 2020. The prevalidated questionnaire contained 25 items related to the impact of COVID-19 on patient volume, the extent of financial distress faced by the ophthalmologists, and various proactive measures taken by them. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results:Out of 1,026 respondents, more than 90% ophthalmologists faced a 25% or more reduction in outpatient and surgical volume. Nearly 59% reported that they can suffer from serious financial distress in near future due to COVID-19 pandemic-related losses. Those who are young (P < 0.0005), salaried (P < 0.0005), and practicing in private sector (P < 0.0005) and Tier 1 cities (P < 0.0005) are reported to be more vulnerable to become financially unstable. The major concerns were revenue losses (70%), preexisting debts (39%), and increased operating costs (27%). The majority (90%) believed that AIOS can help in alleviating the distress. There was also hesitancy regarding the adoption of teleophthalmology and home-based care. Conclusion:COVID-19 has significantly affected the financial sustainability of ophthalmologists practicing in India. Identification of vulnerable groups and timely advocacy efforts by AIOS can help in mitigating this financial crisis.

AB  - Background Left ventricular diastolic dyssynchrony (LVDD) can be assessed by gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (GMP-SPECT). LVDD is an area of interest in subjects who underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The aim of this post hoc analysis was to assess the role of LVDD in subjects with CRT who were followed up at 6-month period. Material & Methods Left ventricular diastolic dyssynchrony was assessed by GMP-SPECT at baseline and after CRT procedure in 160 subjects from 10 different cardiological centers. CRT procedure was performed as per current guidelines. Outcomes were defined as improvement in >= 1 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 5%, and reduction in end-systolic volume (ESV) by 15% and 5% points in Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. LVDD was defined as diastolic phase standard deviation >= 40 +/- 14 degrees. Results Improvement in NYHA functional class occurred in 105 (65.6%), LVEF in 74 (46.3%), decrease in ESV in 86 (53.8%), and Minnesota score in 85 (53.1%) cases. Baseline LV diastolic standard deviation was 53.53 degrees +/- 20.85 and at follow-up 40.44 degrees +/- 26.1283; (P < 0.001). LVDD was not associated with improvement in clinical outcomes at follow-up. Conclusion CRT improves both systolic and diastolic dyssynchrony values at 6-month follow-up. LVDD at baseline is correlated with cardiac functionality at follow-up, but not with overall favorable clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: Traditional open orchiopexy is still a standard of treatment for palpable undescended testicles. Recently several authors reported successful results using a laparoscopic approach in the treatment of palpable cryptorchidism. The present systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the utility of laparoscopic orchiopexy for palpable cryptorchidism. Methods: Scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE) were systematically searched for relevant articles using the following terms: (palpable cryptorchidism or palpable undescended testes) AND (laparoscopic orchiopexy or laparoscopic orchiopexy). The inclusion criteria were all children with unilateral or bilateral palpable undescended testes who underwent laparoscopic orchiopexy (LO) compared to children who underwent conventional open orchiopexy (CO). The main outcomes were the proportion of children requiring redo-orchiopexy and the incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were duration and the cost of surgery. Results: The final meta-analysis included five studies involving 705 children; LO, n = 369 (52.3%) and CO, n = 336 (47.7%). The majority of the included patients had unilateral palpable cryptorchidism. No significant differences were found in regard to average age at the time of surgery and follow-up periods between the investigated groups. No statistically significant differences were found in regard to redo-orchiopexy rates (RR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.03-1.88, p = 0.17), early complications (RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.21-2.08, p = 0.48) and incidence of testicular atrophy (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.03-3.88, p = 0.40). No significant differences in the operative duration were observed among the groups. Laparoscopy was associated with higher costs in most of the studies. Conclusion: LO is safe and effective in children with palpable cryptorchidism. The rates of redo-orchiopexy as well as an incidence of early complications and testicular atrophy rates are comparable to CO.

AB  - Background Skeletal metastases of bone sarcomas are indicators of poor prognosis. Various imaging modalities are available for their identification, which include bone scan, positron emission tomography/CT scan, MRI, and bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. However, there is considerable ambiguity regarding the best imaging modality to detect skeletal metastases. To date, we are not sure which of these investigations is best for screening of skeletal metastasis. Question/purpose Which staging investigation-F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (F-18-FDG PET/CT), whole-body MRI, or Tc-99m-MDP skeletal scintigraphy-is best in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) in detecting skeletal metastases in patients with osteosarcoma and those with Ewing sarcoma? Methods A prospective diagnostic study was performed among 54 of a total 66 consecutive osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma patients who presented between March 2018 and June 2019. The institutional review board approved the use of all three imaging modalities on each patient recruited for the study. Informed consent was obtained after thoroughly explaining the study to the patient or the patient's parent/guardian. The patients were aged between 4 and 37 years, and their diagnoses were proven by histopathology. All patients underwent Tc-99m-MDP skeletal scintigraphy, F-18-FDG PET/CT, and whole-body MRI for the initial staging of skeletal metastases. The number and location of bone and bone marrow lesions diagnosed with each imaging modality were determined and compared with each other. Multidisciplinary team meetings were held to reach a consensus about the total number of metastases present in each patient, and this was considered the gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of each imaging modality, along with their 95% confidence intervals, were generated by the software Stata SE v 15.1. Six of 24 patients in the osteosarcoma group had skeletal metastases, as did 8 of 30 patients in the Ewing sarcoma group. The median (range) follow-up for the study was 17 months (12 to 27 months). Although seven patients died before completing the minimum follow-up, no patients who survived were lost to follow-up. Results With the number of patients available, we found no differences in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV among the three staging investigations in patients with osteosarcoma and in patients with Ewing sarcoma. Sensitivities to detect bone metastases for F-18-FDG PET/CT, whole-body MRI, and Tc-99m-MDP skeletal scintigraphy were 100% (6 of 6 [95% CI 54% to 100%]), 83% (5 of 6 [95% CI 36% to 100%]), and 67% (4 of 6 [95% CI 22% to 96%]) and specificities were 100% (18 of 18 [95% CI 82% to 100%]), 94% (17 of 18 [95% CI 73% to 100%]), and 78% (14 of 18 [95% CI 52% to 94%]), respectively, in patients with osteosarcoma. In patients with Ewing sarcoma, sensitivities to detect bone metastases for F-18-FDG PET/CT, whole-body MRI, and Tc-99m-MDP skeletal scintigraphy were 88% (7 of 8 [95% CI 47% to 100%]), 88% (7 of 8 [95% CI 47% to 100%]), and 50% (4 of 8 [95% CI 16% to 84%]) and specificities were 100% (22 of 22 [95% CI 85% to 100%]), 95% (21 of 22 [95% CI 77% to 100%]), and 95% (21 of 22 [95% CI 77% to 100%]), respectively.
   Further, the PPVs for detecting bone metastases for F-18-FDG PET/CT, whole-body MRI, and Tc-99m-MDP skeletal scintigraphy were 100% (6 of 6 [95% CI 54% to 100%]), 83% (5 of 6 [95% CI 36% to 100%]), and 50% (4 of 8 [95% CI 16% to 84%]) and the NPVs were 100% (18 of 18 [95% CI 82% to 100%]), 94% (17 of 18 [95% CI 73% to 100%]), and 88% (14 of 16 [95% CI 62% to 98%]), respectively, in patients with osteosarcoma. Similarly, the PPVs for detecting bone metastases for F-18-FDG PET/CT, whole-body MRI, and Tc-99m-MDP skeletal scintigraphy were 100% (7 of 7 [95% CI 59% to 100%]), 88% (7 of 8 [95% CI 50% to 98%]), and 80% (4 of 5 [95% CI 28% to 100%]), and the NPVs were 96% (22 of 23 [95% CI 78% to 100%]), 95% (21 of 22 [95% CI 77% to 99%]), and 84% (21 of 25 [95% CI 64% to 96%]), respectively, in patients with Ewing sarcoma. The confidence intervals around these values overlapped with each other, thus indicating no difference between them. Conclusion Based on these results, we could not demonstrate a difference in the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV between F-18-FDG PET/CT, whole-body MRI, and Tc-99m-MDP skeletal scintigraphy for detecting skeletal metastases in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. For proper prognostication, a thorough metastatic workup is essential, which should include a highly sensitive investigation tool to detect skeletal metastases. However, our study findings suggest that there is no difference between these three imaging tools. Since this is a small group of patients in whom it is difficult to make broad recommendations, these findings may be confirmed by larger studies in the future.

AB  - The 2018 revised International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging of cervical cancer has brought about a paradigm shift by offering the option of adding imaging and pathology to clinical staging. This makes it applicable to all types of resource situations across geographies with implications for all stakeholders, including gynaecologists, gynaecologic oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and radiation and medical oncologists. The new staging classification has more granularity, with three sub-stages of stage IB and a new category of stage IIIC for all cases with lymph node (LN) involvement. The major limitations of clinical staging were inaccurate assessment of tumour size and inability to assess pelvic and para-aortic LNs with the limited investigations permitted by FIGO to change the stage. This resulted in understaging of stages IB-III, and overstaging of stage IIIB, which has been largely overcome by incorporating imaging findings. Although any imaging modality can be used, magnetic resonance imaging appears to be the best imaging modality for early-stage disease owing to its better soft-tissue resolution. However, the use of contrast-enhanced computed tomography or ultrasonography are also feasible options, depending on the availability and resources. But wherever pathological evaluation is possible, it supersedes clinical and radiological findings.

AB  - Purpose:The people of Northeast India comprise mostly of Mongoloid descent with characteristic craniofacial features. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the normal orbital structures with MRI and determine normative data in the Northeast Indian pediatric population. Methods:MRI images of the 302 orbits of 151 pediatric patients below 16 years of age were retrospectively evaluated to measure the various orbital structures. Both axial and coronal MRI images were utilized for various orbital measurements. An independent sample t-test was done to compare various orbital data according to the sex and side. Linear regression was also done. Results:The mean age of the pediatric population was 9.64 +/- 1.47 years with a male: Female ratio of 1.13:1. The mean interzygomatic line was 88.4 +/- 9.09 mm and the interorbital line was 22.18 +/- 3.62 mm. The mean thicknesses of medial, lateral, superior, and inferior recti muscles were 2.58 +/- 0.46, 2.34 +/- 0.42, 2.16 +/- 0.40, and 2.53 +/- 0.49 mm in males and 2.41 +/- 0.41, 2.08 +/- 0.34, 2.08 +/- 0.46, and 2.46 +/- 0.49 mm in females. The mean horizontal orbital, vertical orbital diameters, orbital index, mean volume of eyeball, and orbital cavity were 30.27 +/- 2.97,3 7.06 +/- 3.57, 122.58 +/- 7.39, 4.63 +/- 0.84, and 15.29 +/- 3.52 in males, while 29.16 +/- 3.23, 34.96 +/- 3.99,119.96 +/- 7.31, 4.49 +/- 0.87, and 14.65 +/- 3.47 in females, respectively. With an increase in age, the interzygomatic line (r = 0.883, r(2) = 0.780; P < 0.0005), anterior medial interorbital line (r = 0.808, r(2) = 0.652; P < 0.0005), mean volume of eyeball (r = 0.915, r(2) = 0.838; P < 0.0005), orbital cavity (r = 0.924, r(2) = 0.854; P < 0.0005), and distance between the optic nerve entry site (r = 0.829, r(2) = 0.687; P < 0.0005) were increased. Conclusion:This study provides normative data of various orbital structures in a pediatric population and these data likely to be useful for diagnosing various pediatric orbital disorders and helps in the planning of various surgical procedures of orbits.

AB  - Silver oxide Nanoparticles (SO-NP) exhibit excellent light absorbing, semi conducting properties and hence are employed in a wide range of applications such as catalyst, biosensors, and in fuel cells. Green synthesis of nanoparticles using different microorganisms is widely accepted since this method is in expensive and eco-friendly. Nanoparticles synthesized by this route are smaller in size, highly stable, show high reactivity and stability. In this context, biofabrication of Silver Oxide Nanoparticles (SO-NP) by autolysate of Pseudomonas mendocina PM1 has been evaluated. Synthesis of SO-NP was observed, when autolysate of P. mendocina PM1 was incubated with 0.5 mM AgNO3 in dark for 24 h. Synthesis of SO-NP was confirmed by UV-Vis analysis. SO-NP was further confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) which confirmed presence of SO-NP. XRD revealed that SO-NP were of the type Ag3O4. FTIR analysis indicated that peptides were involved in the reduction and stability of SO-NP. SO-NP's showed potent anti-microbial/ anti-biofilm activity against common pathogenic/non-pathogenic bacteria. This is the first report of synthesis of SO-NP by P. mendocina PM1.

AB  - This paper deals with the surface morphology and structure of suctorial mouthparts, expanded paired fins and adhesive organ (AO) in a mountain stream catfish Glyptothorax sinense sikkimensis of India, as studied by scanning electron microscopy. It possesses type I taste buds on its barbels and lips. There are scattered unculiferous plaques on the lower lip and horny tubercles on outer fin rays, and knob like microstructures between fin rays of both paired fins. The thoracic region bears a prominent AO, which has 8-10 unculiferous ridges arranged parallel to the body axis, separated by many non-unculiferous grooves. The latter may act as the major attachment sites and function as a suction cup. A combined action of the adhesive devices with their unique surface specializations enables the fish for better anchorage to sandy-rocky substratum of glacier-fed, rapid mountain streams. The plaques on lower lip and horny tubercles and knob like substructures in fin rays perhaps help in additional anchorage support to the major AO located at the thoracic area.

AB  - Background & objectives: Imaging has been added to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 staging system of cervical carcinoma. This study was performed to assess the impact of imaging in staging and to ascertain the prevalence and pattern of nodal metastasis on contrastenhanced computed tomography (CECT) in patients with cervical carcinoma who were treated based on FIGO 2009 staging system. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate all patients with biopsy-proven cervical carcinoma who underwent CECT of abdomen at a tertiary cancer centre in north India from April 2017 to April 2019 and for whom either baseline or follow up scans were available. In patients with enlarged or necrotic lymph nodes, the location, size and pattern of infiltration of adjacent organs were recorded. Results: A total of 602 patients of cervical carcinoma had undergone CT during the study period, of whom 138 (22.9%) underwent CT at baseline and 464 (77.1%) patients during follow up. The FIGO (2009) stage distribution at the time of presentation was stage IB: 109 (18.1%); stage IIA: 14 (2.3%), stage IIB: 118 (19.6%), stage IIIA: 12 (2%), stage IIIB: 277 (46%), stage IVA: 20 (3.3%) and stage IVB: 52 (8.6%). Ninety of the 138 (65.22%) patients underwent a stage shift according to the FIGO 2018 because of the presence of enlarged lymph nodes at baseline scan. Sixteen (2.7%) patients had infiltrative nodal masses most commonly involving the blood vessels (n=14) followed by ureter (n=8), bones (n=5), muscle and bowel (n=3, each). The majority (14/16) of these patients presented with vague abdominal pain, discomfort and vomiting, while two had bone pain. Interpretation & conclusions: CECT at baseline helps in accurately assessing the stage in cervical carcinoma. It helps in the identification of lymph node metastasis in cervical carcinoma, which is crucial for guiding accurate management.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the income and surgical training opportunities among the ophthalmologists in India and their opinion on salary reduction during this period. Methods: A questionnaire in the form of a Google survey was sent to ophthalmologists across India on May 1, 2021. The data collected until May 11, 2021 was analyzed. Results: A total of 1057 ophthalmologists all over India participated in the survey. Of the respondents, 559 (52.9%) were women and 730 (69.1%) were young ophthalmologists (below the age of 40 years). Salary reduction was reported by 569 (53.8%) of the respondents. The categories suffering the maximum salary reduction were - young ophthalmologists (407, 55.8%) (P < 0.001), women (304, 54.4%) (P < 0.001), and private sector employees (457, 67%) (P < 0.001). More women ophthalmologists (438, 78.4%) felt it was unfair to reduce the salary during the pandemic, as compared to men (330, 66.3%) (P < 0.001). A reduction in surgical training opportunities was reported by 689 (65.2%) of ophthalmologists. The categories who suffered the maximum loss of surgical training opportunities were young ophthalmologists (565, 77.4%) (P < 0.001), women ophthalmologists (415, 74.2%) (P < 0.001), and ophthalmologists in the government sector (147, 82.6%) (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Ophthalmologists in India, especially women and the younger professionals, had to face salary reduction and loss of surgical training opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most ophthalmologists in India do not favor a reduction in salary. There is a need to formulate policies to safeguard ophthalmologists, especially women and younger generation from future crises in training, employment, and income.

AB  - Amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a pH-sensitive imaging technique that can potentially complement existing clinical imaging protocol for the assessment of ischemic stroke. This review aims to summarize the developments in the clinical research of APT imaging of ischemic stroke after 17 years of progress since its first preclinical study in 2003. Three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for articles reporting clinical studies on APT imaging of ischemic stroke. Only articles in English published between 2003 to 2020 that involved patients presenting ischemic stroke-like symptoms that underwent APT MRI were included. Of 1,093 articles screened, 14 articles met the inclusion criteria with a total of 282 patients that had been scanned using APT imaging. Generally, the clinical studies agreed APT effect to be hypointense in ischemic tissue compared to healthy tissue, allowing for the detection of ischemic stroke. Other uses of APT imaging have also been investigated in the studies, including penumbra identification, predicting long term clinical outcome, and serving as a biomarker for supportive treatment monitoring. The published results demonstrated the potential of APT imaging in these applications, but further investigations and larger trials are needed for conclusive evidence. Future studies are recommended to report the result of asymmetry analysis at 3.5 ppm along with the findings of the study to reduce this contribution to the heterogeneity of experimental methods observed and to facilitate effective comparison of results between studies and centers. In addition, it is important to focus on the development of fast 3D imaging for full volumetric ischemic tissue assessment for clinical translation.

AB  - Light induces variable levels of damage to the retina and often, death of the photoreceptor cells. It is reported that chick retina, having abundant melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium, undergoes no or minimal damage from exposure to light. However, the morphology of cone and rod photoreceptor cells after continuous exposure of light has not been studied in detail. The present study investigated the detailed changes of photoreceptor cells, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Domestic chicks (Gallus g. domesticus) from post-hatch day (PH) 1 to 7 were initially reared at 700 lux at 12 h light (L):12 h dark (D). From PH 7 to 18, they were exposed to 12L:12D (control) and 24L:0D (constant light) cycles at 700 lux. At PH18, chicks were sacrificed, their eyes enucleated and preserved in Karnovsky's fixative. The retina was then separated from the adherent choroid, mounted on photoreceptor side up and processed for SEM. There was significant damage to rod and cone outer segments from both dorsal and ventral part of the retina and a decrease in the abundance of cells of the inner nuclear layer in constant light, compared to that found in 12L:12D cycles. It is likely that constant light affects the retinal cells in the vertical pathway, which could alter the phototransduction process.

AB  - There is a substantial burden of chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs have particular challenges in delivering cost-effective prevention, diagnosis, and management of COPD. Optimal care can be supported by effective implementation of guidelines. This American Thoracic Society workshop considered challenges to implementation of COPD guidelines in LMICs. We make 10 specific recommendations: 1) relevant organizations should provide LMIC-specific COPD management guidance; 2) patient and professional organizations must persuade policy-makers of the importance of lung function testing programs in LMICs; 3) healthcare education and training should emphasize the early-life origins of COPD; 4) urgent action is required by governments to reduce airborne exposures, including exposures to tobacco smoke and indoor and outdoor air pollution; 5) guidance for COPD in LMICs should explicitly link across Essential Medicine Lists and the World Health Organization package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings and should consider availability, affordability, sustainability, and cost-effective use of medicines; 6) the pharmaceutical industry should work to make effective COPD and tobacco-dependence medicines globally accessible and affordable; 7) implementation of locally adapted, cost-effective pulmonary rehabilitation programs should be an international priority; 8) the World Health Organization Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases should specify how improvements in respiratory health will be achieved; 9) research funders should increase the proportion of funding allocated to COPD in LMICs; and 10) the respiratory community should leverage the skills and enthusiasm of earlier-career clinicians and researchers to improve global respiratory health.

AB  - Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the tau distribution patterns in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) using PET radiotracer F-18 ML-104. Materials and methods Thirty patients, clinically diagnosed as aMCI [mini mental state evaluation >= 24] in the neurology or geriatric memory clinics, were included in the study. Each aMCI patient underwent F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and F-18 ML-104 tau PET. Standardized uptake value ratios for cortical gray matter regions were evaluated for F-18 ML-104 tau PET and compared with normal controls and with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (used from a previous study). Results aMCI revealed significantly higher standardized uptake value ratios in both medial temporal cortices, precuneus and posterior cingulate cortices in comparison to normal controls and a significantly lesser binding in bilateral medial and lateral temporal, precuneus and posterior cingulate cortices in comparison to early AD. A negative correlation was noted between F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and F-18 ML-104 retention in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortices in aMCI, while F-18 ML-104 retention and mini mental state evaluation scores revealed a moderate negative correlation in the posterior cingulate cortices. Conclusion We could demonstrate a significant increase in cortical tau deposition in aMCI patients in comparison to normal controls, thus providing in vivo evidence of the underlying pathological process in this subgroup of patients with high probability of conversion to AD.

AB  - Purpose:Enucleation performed in children with retinoblastoma is associated with severe postoperative pain. The use of opioids for the pain is associated with numerous complications which demand careful monitoring. Subtenon infiltration and peribulbar block are useful in ameliorating pain perioperatively following various ophthalmic surgeries which are yet to be evaluated in enucleation. Therefore, we designed this study to compare the effects of peribulbar block and subtenon infiltration on postoperative pain with opioids in pediatric enucleation surgeries.Methods:60 children of American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I and II, age ranging from 6 months to 6 years with retinoblastoma undergoing enucleation surgery were included in the study. Group A (n = 20): received peribulbar block (peribulbar group); Group B (n = 20): received subtenon local infiltration (subtenon group); and Group C (n = 20): no block was given.Results:The postoperative fentanyl consumption was lowest with Group B compared to Group A and Group C (P value 0.001). However, the total fentanyl consumption was comparable between groups A and B, while it was significantly higher in the control group. The mean pain score face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scale and mean time to discharge from post anesthesia care unit were lowest in Group B followed by Group A, while Group C had the highest. There was no statistically significant difference among the 3 groups with regards to side effects.Conclusion:Subtenon infiltration showed significantly better outcomes when compared to peribulbar block and intravenous opioids alone without any untoward adverse effects.

AB  - Polymeric nanoparticles have been the focus for nanocarrier preparation in numerous biomedical applications such as cancer treatment, disease diagnosis, vaccination, in the last two decades. They have been variably surface modified using copolymers, Polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran, cyclodextrin, cytokines, small molecules to improve their efficiency and efficacy. The resulting nano-formulations include polymer-protein conjugate, polymeric micelle, polymer-small molecule conjugate, dendrimer, polymeric vesicles, nano-hybrids, hydrogels etc. These may have intrinsic immunogenicity and require accurate characterization in order to improve their pharmacological targeting, pharmacokinetic profiles and to reduce adverse reactions. Therefore, we have reviewed the polymeric nanoparticles and the electron microscopy techniques available for their characterization in the context of their surface modifications and functionalization.

AB  - Background For the response assessment after chemotherapy, gold standard is always the histopathological response. However, metabolic response can also guide further treatment. Herein, this study aimed to evaluate metabolic response assessment to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma esophagus using PET response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST) criteria with taking histopathological response by tumor regression grading as the standard method.
   Methods Total fifty-seven patients with squamous cell carcinoma esophagus were enrolled between April 2017 to December 2018 for this prospective study. All patients were undergone for baseline PET scan before going for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Repeat PET scan was done after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Operable patients were taken for surgery. Final histological response was assessed by Mandard grading. Three metabolic tools [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), tumor regression grading, PERCIST] were compared.
   Results The mean SULpeak of the primary lesion was 11.7 +/- 5.5 (median, 10.2, range 5.5-31.8). The average percentage change (%Delta) in SUVmax was 42.9 +/- 26.3. On histopathology, 5 (13.1%) patients showed complete pathological response, whereas grade II, III, IV and V in 8 (21.1%), 12 (31.6%), 10 (26.3%) and 3 (7.8%) respectively. On comparison of PERCIST with Mandard grading, agreement analysis showed that there was moderate agreement (k, 0.48). %Delta SUV peak change showed a strong correlation with %Delta SUVmax (P = 0.01) and percentage tumor to liver ratio change (P = 0.01). On comparison, these metabolic response tools showed a weak agreement (k, 0.28 with tumor to liver ratio, k, 0.38 with SUVmax).
   Conclusion After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT can help to assess the response and guide the treatment. However, a larger study is warranted to evaluate their correlation with pathological response.

AB  - H2S is a potent gasotransmitter in eukaryotes and bacteria. Host-derived H2S has been shown to profoundly alter M. tuberculosis (Mtb) energy metabolism and growth. However, compelling evidence for endogenous production of H2S and its role in Mtb physiology is lacking. We show that multidrug-resistant and drug-susceptible clinical Mtb strains produce H2S, whereas H2S production in non-pathogenic M. smegmatis is barely detectable. We identified Rv3684 (Cds1) as an H2S-producing enzyme in Mtb and show that cds1 disruption reduces, but does not eliminate, H2S production, suggesting the involvement of multiple genes in H2S production. We identified endogenous H2S to be an effector molecule that maintains bioenergetic homeostasis by stimulating respiration primarily via cytochrome bd. Importantly, H2S plays a key role in central metabolism by modulating the balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, and it functions as a sink to recycle sulfur atoms back to cysteine to maintain sulfur homeostasis. Lastly, Mtb-generated H2S regulates redox homeostasis and susceptibility to anti-TB drugs clofazimine and rifampicin. These findings reveal previously unknown facets of Mtb physiology and have implications for routine laboratory culturing, understanding drug susceptibility, and improved diagnostics.

AB  - (1) Background: Accurate preoperative identification of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is challenging due to a spectrum of cytomorphologic features. However, there is a scarcity of studies describing the cytomorphologic features as seen on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) smears prepared using different staining methods. (2) Methods: We performed a retrospective study on MTC cases with available FNA slides from 13 hospitals distributed across 8 Asia-Pacific countries. The differences in the constitutive cytomorphologic features of MTC with each cytopreparatory method were recorded. A comparative analysis of cytologic characteristics was carried out with appropriate statistical tests. (3) Results: Of a total of 167 MTC samples retrospectively recruited, 148 (88.6%) were interpreted as MTC/suspicious for MTC (S-MTC). The staining methods used were Papanicolaou, hematoxylin-eosin, and Romanowsky stains. Seven out of the eleven cytologic criteria can be readily recognized by all three cytopreparatory methods: high cellularity, cellular pleomorphism, plasmacytoid cells, round cells, dyshesive cells, salt-and-pepper chromatin, and binucleation or multinucleation. An accurate diagnosis was achieved in 125 (84.5%) of the 148 samples whose FNAs exhibited five or more atypical features. Conclusions: The present work is the first study on MTC to compare the morphological differences among the cytologic staining techniques. We investigated the constitutive features and the reliability of diagnostic parameters. A feasible scoring system based upon cytomorphologic data alone is proposed to achieve a high degree of diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Spectrin (alpha and beta) is a tetrameric, key membrane skeletal protein initially reported to be present in erythrocytes. It is also present in other cells, neurones and the retina. This study reports immunoreactivity (IR) to erythroid spectrin in human retina at different ages (56-91 years), as examined by immunohistochemistry and immuno-electron microscopy (IEM). Spectrin IR was localised moderately in ganglion cell layer, inner- and outer plexiform layers and predominantly in photoreceptor inner segments and macular fibres of Henle. As the latter are interleaved by outer processes of Muller cells, IEM was used to see which cellular processes contained spectrin. IEM revealed that gold particles were associated with microtubules of cone inner segments and in fibres of Henle, but were absent in Muller cell processes, supporting immunohistochemical data on the absence of IR in Muller cells (stained with vimentin antibody). In fibres of Henle, a steady expression of spectrin was seen until eighth decade, and then a decreased expression beyond ninth decade, which paralleled with degenerative microtubule changes (seen by transmission electron microscopy) in them. These changes could be responsible for age-related down-regulation of spectrin expression in fibres of Henle. It is likely that one specific role of spectrin in the human retina could be maintenance of the macular fibres of Henle. Its reduction with age may cause alterations in cone membrane, which may be responsible for their vulnerability in ageing.

AB  - Objective: Tumor cells are shed during transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and form the basis for use of single dose immediate chemotherapy instillation to reduce recurrences. Systemic dissemination of these cells along with the irrigation fluid is also possible but not consistently proven. In this study, we evaluated such dissemination of tumor cells into the circulation during TURBT and its clinical impact.
   Methods: Patients with primary presentation of bladder tumor who underwent TURBT were included. Peripheral venous blood samples before and after TURBT were analyzed for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using flow-cytometry. A CD45 negative cell with positive expression of cytokeratin 18, 19, and EpCam was defined as CTC. The CTC counts, pre and post TURBT, were compared and correlated with final histopathology. The patients were also followed up for any local and/or systemic recurrences.
   Results: Nine (16.98%) out of 53 patients developed a measurable rise in CTCs after TURBT. All of these patients had high grade and muscle invasive disease. Overall, a measurable rise in CTCs was seen in 9 out of 17 (52.94%) patients with muscle invasive disease. There was no difference in the clinico-pathological stage or the status of cystectomy and/or chemotherapy between those who did or did not show a rise in CTCs. On follow up, 7 patients with muscle invasive disease developed local and/or systemic recurrences and the rise in CTCs was not found to be associated with adverse oncological outcomes.
   Conclusions: This study confirms the hypothesis of inadvertent dissemination of tumor cells into the circulation during TURBT, especially in patients with high grade and muscle invasive disease. The long-term oncological impact of such dissemination remains to be confirmed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mesenchymal Stem Cells are potent therapeutic candidates in the field of regenerative medicine, owing to their immunomodulatory and differentiation potential. However, several complications come with their translational application like viability, duration, and degree of expansion, long-term storage, and high maintenance cost. Therefore, drawbacks of cell-based therapy can be overcome by a novel therapeutic modality emerging in translational research and application, i.e., exosomes. These small vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells are emerging as new avenues in the field of nano-medicine. These nano-vesicles have caught the attention of researchers with their potency as regenerative medicine both in nanotherapeutics and drug delivery systems. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge in the biology and handling of exosomes, with their limitations and future applications. Additionally, we highlight current perspectives that primarily focus on their effect on various diseases and their potential as a drug delivery vehicle.

AB  - The rapid rise in prevalence of overweight/obesity, as well as high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and other nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases, has led the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to propose a front-of-package labeling (FOPL) regulation. An effective FOPL system applies a nutrient profile model that identifies foods high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat that would receive a warning label for consumers to effectively discern between more and less healthy foods. Previous Nutrition Alchemy data collected by the food industry (n = 1306 products) estimated that approximately 96% of foods in India would have at least one warning label based on the FSSAI proposed FOPL. This near universal coverage of warning labels may be inaccurate and misleading. To address this, the current study compared two nutrient profile models, the WHO South-East Asia Region Organization (SEARO) and the Chilean Warning Octagon (CWO) Phase 3, applied to food products available in the Indian market from 2015-2020, collected through Mintel Global New Products Database (n = 10,501 products). Results suggest that 68% of foods and beverages would have at least one ' high-in' level warning label. This study highlights the need to include a more comprehensive sample of food products for assessing the value of warning labels.

AB  - Introduction The objective of the study was to use fuzzy logic-based moving average filters for reducing noise from Tc-99m-sestamibi parathyroid images and to compare its performance with classical moving average filters. Methods Sixty-eight Tc-99m-sestamibi parathyroid images (33 image zoom 1.0, 35 images zoom 2.0) were filtered using symmetric triangular fuzzy filters with the moving average (TMAV), asymmetric triangular fuzzy filters with the moving average (ATMAV) and classical moving average filter (MAV) with moving average within a square window of dimension N x N pixels (N=3,5,7,9,11). The relative filtering performance was compared both objectively (using Brisque score) and subjectively [by two nuclear medicine physicians on a 4-point scale (1 = nondiagnostic; 2 = diagnostic; 3 = good; and 4 = excellent image quality)]. The nonparametric two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to find the statistically significant difference between the quality of input and their corresponding filtered images. Results The Brisque score assigned to MAV filtered zoom 2.0 images (MAV_3, median = -0.61) were significantly smaller than that of their input images (median = 53.84, at P = 1) and fuzzy filtered images (TMAV_3, median = 0.44, at P = 0.89 and ATMAV_3, median =8.26, at P = 0.97). The sum of average subjective image quality score for input, MAV_3, TMAV_3, TMAV_5, ATMAV_3, and ATMAV_5 were 148, 221, 221.5, 198,171,253 and 237.5, respectively. Conclusion On the basis of subjective assessment, the performance of ATMAV_3 fuzzy filter was found to be better compared to the classical moving average filter in reducing noise from Tc-99m-sestambi parathyroid images.

AB  - Meta-analysis of transcripts in colon adenocarcinoma patient tissues led to the identification of a DNA damage responsive miR signature called DNA damage sensitive miRs (DDSMs). DDSMs were experimentally validated in the cancerous colon tissues obtained from an independent cohort of colon cancer patients and in multiple cellular systems with high levels of endogenous DNA damage. All the tested DDSMs were transcriptionally upregulated by a common intestine-specific transcription factor, CDX2. Reciprocally, DDSMs were repressed via the recruitment of HDAC1/2-containing complexes onto the CDX2 promoter. These miRs downregulated multiple key targets in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, namely BRCA1, ATM, Chk1 (also known as CHEK1) and RNF8. CDX2 directly regulated the DDSMs, which led to increased tumor volume and metastasis in multiple preclinical models. In colon cancer patient tissues, the DDSMs negatively correlated with BRCA1 levels, were associated with decreased probability of survival and thereby could be used as a prognostic biomarker.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compile available evidence to better understand the management of leg ulcers in sickle cell disease (SCD), as well as describe potential therapeutic steps that may be required to improve the quality of life of patients with SCD leg ulcers.
   DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases
   STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search was conducted to retrieve relevant studies using the keywords "sickle cell disease and leg ulcer," "ulcer treatments, diagnosis and sickle cell," and "wound sickle cell." Studies published through July 2020 were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent authors selected all studies that assessed the relationship between leg ulcer and SCD identified from online databases.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: The authors have summarized updated information on pathophysiology (vasculopathy linked to chronic hemolysis and endothelial dysfunction), diagnosis, and available treatment options to unravel the dermohematologic connection between leg ulcers and SCD.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is the authors' hope that this detailed discussion of the information available on leg ulcers and SCD will lead to a better appreciation of this clinical problem by the clinicians and researchers and in turn have a long-term positive effect on the quality of life of patients with SCD. Researchers should design new trials considering these insights and potential therapeutic approaches based on current knowledge.

AB  - Objectives Because prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression is universal in juvenile nasal angiofibroma (JNA), PSMA PET/CT is commonly used in the postoperative setting using the postoperative angiofibroma radionuclide imaging study protocol. Our study aims to illustrate physiological PSMA ligand uptake distribution characteristics in the salivary glands, specifically the tubarial glands with tumor, to aid in accurate PSMA PET/CT analysis. Study Design Forty-three consecutive patients who underwent a dedicated head and neck spot PSMA PET/CT for JNA were evaluated retrospectively. PSMA SUVmax values in the tumor, tubarial, parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands were determined visually and quantitatively. Results All the tumors and the salivary glands showed increased tracer uptake. The median SUVmax +/- SD ratios of the tumor, right and left tubarial gland, right and left parotid gland, right and left submandibular gland, and right and left sublingual gland were 2.7 +/- 0.8 (range, 0.5-7.5), 3.8 +/- 1.9 (range, 0.9-8.1), 4.7 +/- 2.1 (range, 0.8-7.4), 9.5 +/- 4.8 (range, 3.2-21.9), 9.2 +/- 4.7 (range, 2.9-18.9), 10.4 +/- 5.7 (range, 3.5-25.4), 10.4 +/- 5.5 (range, 3.7-26.4), 6 +/- 4.1 (range, 1.3-20.6), and 6.5 +/- 4.2 (range, 1.8-19.7), respectively. The uptake in the tubarial glands was comparable with that of the tumor but less compared with other major salivary glands. Conclusions Ours is the first study demonstrating the quantitative uptake of tubarial salivary glands in detail. Because the tubarial glands uptake and the anatomical location are similar to that of the tumor, these physiological uptakes must be borne in mind to circumvent false-positive interpretations and care must be given during the planning of stereotactic radiotherapy for JNAs.

AB  - Muscle atrophy in humans mainly occurs due to aging, lack of physical activity, and exposure to microgravity leading to decreased muscle volume and power. Several exercises coupled with various bodysuits have been used to cope with muscle atrophy. But, all state of arts failed to provide complete prevention from atrophy. Hence, a new countermeasure gravitational load modulating bodygear (CGLM bodygear) has been developed. Herein, squats exercise coupled with bodygear was used to increase the lower limbs muscle activity and evaluated by electromyography (EMG). The study was conducted by performing the squats by thirty subjects with and without bodygear. The EMG signals from the biceps and rectus femoris muscle were recorded to evaluate the electrical activity produced in both the muscles. The time domain results of EMG analysis revealed that the bodygear has enhanced biceps and rectus femoris muscle activity by 50% and 90% respectively. The frequency domain results revealed that the rate of fatigue was higher when squats was performed with bodygear as compared to without bodygear. Overall, the study has concluded that squats coupled with bodygear can be a promising countermeasure to muscle atrophy by generating higher muscle activity in lower limbs.

AB  - DevR/DosR response regulator is believed to participate in virulence, dormancy adaptation and antibiotic tolerance mechanisms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by regulating the expression of the dormancy regulon. We have previously shown that the interaction of DevR with RNA polymerase is essential for the expression of DevR-regulated genes. Here, we developed a M. tuberculosis-specific in vivo transcription system to enrich our understanding of DevR-RNA polymerase interaction. This in vivo assay involves co-transforming E. coli with two plasmids that express a, 13, 130 and sigma(A) subunits of M. tuberculosis RNA polymerase and a third plasmid that harbors a DevR expression cassette and a GFP reporter gene under the DevR-regulated fdxA promoter. We show that DevR-dependent transcription is sponsored exclusively by M. tuberculosis RNA polymerase and regulated by a and sigma(A) subunits of M. tuberculosis RNA polymerase. Using this E. coli triple plasmid system to express mutant variants of M. tuberculosis RNA polymerase, we identified E280 residue in C-terminal domain of a and K513 and R515 residues of sigma(A) to participate in DevR-dependent transcription. In silico modeling of a ternary complex of DevR, sigma(A) domain 4 and fdxA promoter suggest an interaction of Q505, R515 and K513 residues of sigma(A) with E178 and D172 residues of DevR and E471 of sigma(A), respectively. These findings provide us with new insights into the interactions between DevR and RNA polymerase of M. tuberculosis which can be targeted for intercepting DevR function. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this system for screening of anti-DevR compounds.

AB  - Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term intraocular pressures that provide stabilization/reversal of glaucomatous neuropathy after surgery in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). Methods:Prospective evaluation of consecutive PCG patients who underwent trabeculectomy-trabeculotomy and followed up for >= 2 years. Records of regularly performed examination under anesthesia were maintained to ascertain intraocular pressure, (IOP), fundus, refraction and corneal diameter. Outcomes - Primary: cup: disc ratio and intraocular pressure, Secondary: corneal changes and refractive error Results:A total of 174 eyes of 108 children with PCG had a preoperative IOP of 22.44 +/- 9.5 mm Hg. Postoperative review IOP was 11.8 +/- 4.5 mm Hg, cup-disc-ratio was 0.52 +/- 0.23 and corneal diameter was 12.75 +/- 0.9 mm. Primary outcomes: Linear regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation of review IOP with cup disc ratio, P = 0.004. 67.9%, of eyes at a review IOP range of 6-12 mm Hg showed reversal, 14.1%, were stable, at 6-15 mm Hg, while 3.84% showed an increase in cup: disc ratio 16-22 mm Hg. Patients operated before 6 months of age had a significantly smaller final cup-disc ratio, P = 0.0013. Patients with a final cup: disc ratio of >0.9 were significantly older at surgery, P < 0.001. Secondary outcomes: There was a positive correlation of final myopia with review IOP on linear regression analysis, P = 0.012. The final spherical error in eyes having cup disc ratio of <= 0.5 was -0.96 +/- 4.5 diopters, as against -3.45 +/- 7.7 diopters in eyes having cup-disc ratio of 0.6-0.8 and -3.8 +/- 6.9 diopters in eyes with cup disc ratio of >= 0.9, P = 0.015. There was no significant change in corneal diameter. Conclusion:Patients operated after 6 months of age had a larger final cup: disc ratio, while postoperative review intraocular pressures over 2 years of at least <= 15 mm Hg in primary congenital glaucoma eyes, commonly lead to reversal/stability of the neuropathy, and a lower incidence and degree of myopia.

AB  - Purpose:Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of severe visual impairment of childhood affecting preterm babies. The disease is sensitive to the quality of neonatal nursing care provided to preterm neonates in any neonatal intensive care unit. (NICU). The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge gap among nurses related to ROP and its prevention and management working in NICU in a tertiary care hospital.Methods:In a cross-sectional descriptive survey, 53 nurses working in a selected NICU of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. A pretested and validated self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge of nurses related to ROP. The questionnaire consisted of two main parts namely the demographic information and the knowledge questionnaire related to ROP related to risk factors of ROP, screening procedure, and nursing care to babies with ROP before, during, and after the procedure.Results:The majority of nurses were female with a mean age of 33.48 +/- 5.85 years, having a median of 5 years of experience in NICU. Most of the nurses (38, 68%) had overall poor knowledge, followed by fair knowledge (21%) with the mean knowledge scores of 14.07 +/- 2.06. No significant association between the overall knowledge scores and age, total professional experience in NICU, designation, and educational qualification of the nurses could be observed (P >= 0.05).Conclusion:Most of the nurses working in the NICU had poor knowledge regarding ROP, necessitating the need for updating the knowledge of nurses related to ROP, its prevention, and management by disseminating information about the disease through seminars, and workshops and arranging in-house educational sessions on ROP.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the incidence and morphological charac-teristics of posterior polar cortical disc defect (PPCDD) sign ob-served during phacoemulsification in posterior polar cataract (PPC). Setting: Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Design: Prospective case series. Methods: Sixty-seven eyes of 56 patients with PPC undergoing phacoemulsification were evaluated. Outcome measures were the incidence and characteristics of the intraoperative PPCDD sign, as well as its relation to the intraoperative surgical dynamics and posterior capsule (PC) dehiscence. Results: Of the 67 eyes evaluated, the PPCDD sign was seen in 86.5% of eyes (58/67). Among these, 93.1% of eyes (54/58) showed a complete disc defect, whereas 6.9% of eyes (4/58) had a partial disc defect with incomplete margins. In the majority of cases (89.6%; 52/58), the PPCDD sign was seen after epinuclear plate and plaque aspiration. Among the 9 eyes that did not show the PPCDD sign, en bloc separation of the plaque and cortical matter from the PC was observed in 2 eyes, the plaque remained adherent to the PC till the end of cortical fiber aspiration in 3 eyes, and intraoperative PC rupture (PCR) was observed during the plaque separation in 4 eyes. The incidence of PCR in eyes without PPCDD sign was significantly higher (44.4% vs 0%; P < .001). Conclusions: The visualization of intraoperative PPCDD sign during phacoemulsification in PPC is suggestive of an intact PC and associated with a significantly lower rate of intraoperative PCR as compared with eyes without the PPCDD sign.

AB  - Focal choroidal excavation (FCE) is defined as an area of concavity in choroid detected on optical coherence tomography. These are mostly present in macular region without evidence of accompanying scleral ectasia or posterior staphyloma. Though initially considered to be congenital, increasing number of cases have been identified in association with other choroidal pathologies such as central serous choroidopathy, choroidal neovascularisation, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, choroiditis, choroidal tumours. In this review article, we aim to elaborate on the morphology, pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of FCE and specifically discuss the spectrum of diseases with known association along with the impact of their treatment on FCE

AB  - Background: Celiac plexus block (CPB) is an interventional technique known to be effective in the management of abdominal pain caused by pancreatic cancer.
   Objective: To review the journey of CPB as an interventional analgesic technique from its inception to its current status in the field of cancer pain management.
   Study Design: Descriptive review.
   Methods: PubMed database was searched for celiac plexus block, celiac plexus neurolysis, and pancreatic cancer pain relief. Randomized control trials and case series with more than 10 patients were included. A second search was done from the references of all the included articles to add studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria which were missed in the first broad search.
   Results: A total of 44 studies were included in this literature review. Available evidence through the years was categorized based on the imaging technique used to guide needle insertion and studies were tabulated based on study design, the number of patients included, the technique of CPB, and the conclusions drawn.
   Limitations: Meta- analysis of the available studies was not done because of heterogeneous nature of studies.
   Conclusion: Over the years, the majority of clinical trials have focussed on fluoroscopyguided CPB. Computed tomography-guided blockade of celiac plexus is the next choice among pain physicians and percutaneous ultrasound-guided CPB is a relatively new technique. The data generated over the years does not point to a single technique being the gold standard for CPB and choice of technique may be guided by the individual's preference, familiarity with the technique, and institutional practice.

AB  - Giant cell tumor of the larynx is an uncommon entity with only 44 cases reported in the literature. These tumors occur most commonly in the epiphysis of the long bones of female patients in third decade. Here in we report a case of 23 years old male patient who presented with an anterior neck swelling since past 4 months. Ultrasound and computed tomography of neck revealed a heterogenously enhancing lesion involving posteroinferior half of right thyroid cartilage with extension into the extra laryngeal strap muscle and intralaryngeal right true vocal cord and false vocal cord. The findings were suggestive of a neoplastic cartilagenous lesion. A fine needle aspiration of the right anterior neck mass was performed which showed many mononuclear cells along with multinucleated osteoclast type giant cells. No thyroid follicular cells or inflammatory cells were seen. A diagnosis of giant cell tumor of the thyroid cartilage was rendered on cytology. A biopsy was subsequently performed for the patient which confirmed the same. Hence, although giant cell tumor of the larynx is a rare entity, with very few cases reported in the literature, these tumors should be included in the differential diagnosis of giant cell lesions of the neck and aspiration cytology can offer an accurate and quick diagnosis in such cases.

AB  - Objective Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) is a fine needle aspiration (FNA) technique for ensuring sampling adequacy and triaging samples. The Milan system for reporting salivary gland cytopathology (MSRSGC) is a standardised reporting system which aims to improve risk stratification. There is scant literature on the diagnostic value and agreement of MSRSGC on ROSE with final cytological diagnosis in salivary gland FNAs. We aimed to assess the concordance of MSRSCG categorisation and diagnosis on ROSE with final cytological and histological diagnosis. Methods This prospective study included consecutive salivary gland FNAs for which ROSE was performed over a six-month period. MSRSGC category and diagnosis on ROSE were compared with the final cytological diagnosis and MSRSGC category, and histopathological diagnosis, where available. Results Sixty salivary gland aspirates were included. The adequacy rate with ROSE was 100%. Using the MSRSGC classification during ROSE, 26 (43.2%) samples were categorised as benign neoplasm, 21 (35%) as malignant neoplasm, 9 (15%) as non-neoplastic, and one each (1.7%) belonged to the remaining four categories. MSRSGC categorisation on ROSE concurred with final the cytological diagnosis in 58/60 cases (96.7%). Discrepancies in MSRSGC categories on ROSE included one atypia of undetermined significance with final report as non-neoplastic, and one non-diagnostic as suspicious for malignancy. Good correlation of MSRSGC categories on ROSE with final histopathological diagnosis (88.9% concordance) was also noted. Conclusions MSRSGC on ROSE shows good concordance with final cytology and histopathology diagnosis, indicating that categorisation according to MSRSGC has utility in ensuring that adequate material is obtained and triaged appropriately for the diagnosis of salivary gland aspirates.

AB  - Background The monitoring framework for evaluating health system response to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) include indicators to assess availability of affordable basic technologies and essential medicines to treat them in both public and private primary care facilities. The Government of India launched the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 2010 to strengthen health systems. We assessed availability of trained human resources, essential medicines and technologies for diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases as one of the components of the National Noncommunicable Disease Monitoring Survey (NNMS - 2017-18). Methods NNMS was a cross-sectional survey. Health facility survey component covered three public [Primary health centre (PHC), Community health centre (CHC) and District hospital (DH)] and one private primary in each of the 600 primary sampling units (PSUs) selected by stratified multistage random sampling to be nationally representative. Survey teams interviewed medical officers, laboratory technicians, and pharmacists using an adapted World Health Organization (WHO) - Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool on handhelds with Open Data Kit (ODK) technology. List of essential medicines and technology was according to WHO - Package of Essential Medicines and Technologies for NCDs (PEN) and NPCDCS guidelines for primary and secondary facilities, respectively. Availability was defined as reported to be generally available within facility premises. Results Total of 537 public and 512 private primary facilities, 386 CHCs and 334 DHs across India were covered. NPCDCS was being implemented in 72.8% of CHCs and 86.8% of DHs. All essential technologies and medicines available to manage three NCDs in primary care varied between 1.1% (95% CI; 0.3-3.3) in rural public to 9.0% (95% CI; 6.2-13.0) in urban private facilities. In NPCDCS implementing districts, 0.4% of CHCs and 14.5% of the DHs were fully equipped. DHs were well staffed, CHCs had deficits in physiotherapist and specialist positions, whereas PHCs reported shortage of nurse-midwives and health assistants. Training under NPCDCS was uniformly poor across all facilities. Conclusion Both private and public primary care facilities and public secondary facilities are currently not adequately prepared to comprehensively address the burden of NCDs in India.

AB  - Analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to determine the nature of visual stimuli, being experienced by a person, is an active area of research. It is key to understand the link between human brain and behavior, especially for brain computer interface (BCI) applications and rehabilitation of patients suffering with neurological disorders. In this research, we conducted an experiment comparing two stages of visual processing, determined distinct EEG signals associated with them, and subsequently used a classifier to distinguish the two stages. EEG data was collected using a feature-binding experiment that required subjects to detect changes in color and shape binding after 100 ms and after 1500 ms. The two stages denoted by these study-test intervals were determined using features extracted from both time and frequency domains. These were used to separately train various machine learning classifiers. The time-frequency domain representation of the signal was used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). Promising results were obtained. Thus, the contribution of the paper is two-fold. Firstly, we carry out EEG data analysis using deep learning to classify whether the EEG trial belongs to 100 ms class or 1500 ms class. Secondly, we connect these results to predict different stages of visual processing in human brain and visual feature binding. Thus, deep learning can help us predict the stages of visual processing and, hence, unlock important insights regarding the temporal dynamics of brain functioning. This can help in building relevant tools for BCI applications such as neuro-rehabilitation of subjects suffering impairments in visual feature binding.

AB  - Rationale and objectives: To comprehensively evaluate robustness and variations of DCE-MRI derived generalized-tracer-kinetic-model (GTKM) parameters in healthy and tumor tissues and impact of normalization in mitigating these variations on application to glioma.
   Materials (patients) and methods: A retrospective study included pre-operative 31 high-grade-glioma(HGG), 22 low-grade-glioma(LGG) and 33 follow-up data from 10 patients a prospective study with 4 HGG subjects. Voxel-wise GTKM was fitted to DCE-MRI data to estimate K-trans, v(e), v(b). Simulations were used to evaluate noise sensitivity. Variation of parameters with-respect-to arterial-input-function (AIF) variation and data length were studied. Normalization of parameters with-respect-to mean values in gray-matter (GM) and white-matter (WM) regions (GM-Type-2, WM-Type-2) and mean curves (GM-Type-1, WM-Type-1) were also evaluated. Coefficient-of-variation(CoV), relative-percentage-error (RPE), Box-Whisker plots, bar graphs and t-test were used for comparison.
   Results: GTKM was fitted well in all tissue regions. K-trans and v(e) in contrast-enhancing (CE) has shown improved noise sensitivity in longer data. v(b) was reliable in all tissues. Mean AIF and C(t) peaks showed similar to 38% and similar to 35% variations. During simulation, normalizations have mitigated variations due to changes in AIF amplitude in K-trans and v(b). v(e) was less sensitive to normalizations. CoV of K-trans and v(b) has reduced similar to 70% after GM-Type-1 normalization and similar to 80% after GM-Type-2 normalization, respectively. GM-Type-1 (p = 0.003) and GM-Type-2 (p = 0.006) normalizations have significantly improved differentiation of HGG and LGG using K-trans.
   Conclusion: Ktrans and vb can be reliably estimated in normal-appearing brain tissues and can be used for normalization of corresponding parameters in tumor tissues for mitigating inter-subject variability due to errors in AIF. Normalized Ktrans and vb provided improved differentiation of HGG and LGG.

AB  - Sertoli cell only syndrome (SCOS) is characterized by complete absence of germ cells in seminiferous tubules of testis. SCOS is multifactorial but genetic factors play a major role in pathogenesis of the disorder with idiopathic origin. Genetic factors majorly include sex chromosomal aneuploidy and Yq Microdeletion. But a large number of cases are still idiopathic. The study aimed to evaluate the genomic imbalances (CNVs and LOH) in idiopathic SCOS patients. The study is based on 28 apparent idiopathic SCOS cases and 10 controls. Molecular cytogenetic techniques viz., FISH, STS-Multiplex PCR and Affymetrix cytoscan microarray (750 K) were used. The microarray screened whole genomic imbalances in DNA from peripheral blood of 25 cases (excluded Klinefelter syndrome patients) and testicular FNAC sample of 2 cases. High FSH and low Inhibin B were observed in cases as compared to control controls groups. Four cases of sex chromosomal abnormality (i.e., three non-mosaic 47, XXY males and one non-mosaic 46, XX male) as well as four cases of Yq microdeletion (i.e., three cases with AZFc deletion and one case with complete AZFa, b and c deletion) were identified. Microarray detected unbalanced translocation of two segments of Y-chromosome i.e., Yp11.31-p11.2 (-4.o mb region, involving SRY) and Yp11.2 (-2.5 mb region) on X-chromosome in XX male. Also, loss of segment on same X-chromosome involving PAR1 region was identified. We have identified both autosomal and sex chromosomal CNVs (recurrent as well as private) involving candidate genes like SYCE1, ZFPM2, SRPK1, DAZ1, BPY2, HSFY1, VCY1 etc. All these CNVs are possibly associated with SCOS pathogenesis. CNVs identified in cases were already reported as pathogenic variant in clinical database DECIPHER. Microarray also detected many LOH (all autosomal, >3.0 mb size) that covered genes with spermatogenesis related function. The mechanism of action of LOH in pathogenesis of SCOS still remains unravelled. CNVs and LOH related to spermatogenesis identified from two different sample types (blood vs. testicular tissue) were discordant. This study should be extended for larger cohort of patients.

AB  - Purpose To study the long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual outcomes in treated aniridic glaucoma.
   Methods A retrospective chart review of patients with aniridia and glaucoma, with >= 2-year follow-up, was performed. Eyes in early glaucomatous stages were medically managed, while moderate-severe stage eyes underwent a trabeculectomy with mitomycin-c (MMC). Success was termed 'complete' when average final IOP was <= 18 mmHg without usage of glaucoma medications, and 'qualified' when with/without topical glaucoma therapy. A significant change in vision was defined as > 2-line change on Snellen vision chart or > 0.2 change in logMAR units in in either direction (better or worse).
   Results Thirty-five eyes of 20 patients were included. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.29 +/- 5.75 years. Associated ocular anomalies were present in 19 eyes (54.29%). Twelve eyes (34.28%) were maintained on medical management, while 23 eyes (65.71%) had undergone a trabeculectomy with MMC. The mean baseline IOP was 31.46 +/- 6.34 mmHg, and mean IOP on last follow-up was 13.25 +/- 5.82 mmHg, p < 0.001. Seventy-five percent of the medically managed eyes achieved an IOP <= 18 mmHg. 52.17% and 95.65% of the surgically treated eyes achieved 'complete' and 'qualified' success respectively. The median best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline was 1.48(0.6-2) logMAR units and on final follow-up was 1.3 (0.48-5) logMAR units, p = 0.21. Fifty percent of the eyes remained stable, 35.71% showed an improvement and 14.29% a deterioration of > 0.2 logMAR units. Patients with a longer follow-up (> 10 years) and those who had undergone a trabeculectomy with MMC were more likely to show good IOP control (p = 0.003; p = 0.004 respectively).
   Conclusion Aniridic glaucoma can be managed efficiently by medications in early glaucomatous neuropathy, and with trabeculectomy augmented with mitomycin-C and releasable sutures for more advanced glaucomas, offering favourable long-term IOP control, visual stability and safety.

AB  - Evidences are escalating on the diverse neurological-disorders and asymptomatic cardiovascular-diseases associated with COVID-19 pandemic due to the Sanal-flow-choking. Herein, we established the proof of the concept of nanoscale Sanal-flow-choking in real-world fluid-flow systems using a closed-form-analytical-model. This mathematical-model is capable of predicting exactly the 3D-boundary-layer-blockage factor of nanoscale diabatic-fluid-flow systems (flow involves the transfer of heat) at the Sanal-flow-choking condition. As the pressure of the diabatic nanofluid and/or non-continuum-flows rises, average-mean-free-path diminishes and thus, the Knudsen-number lowers heading to a zero-slip wall-boundary condition with the compressible-viscous-flow regime in the nanoscale-tubes leading to Sanal-flow-choking due to the sonic-fluid-throat effect. At the Sanal-flow-choking condition the total-to-static pressure ratio (ie., systolic-to-diastolic pressure ratio) is a unique function of the heat-capacity-ratio of the real-world flows. The innovation of the nanoscale Sanal-flow-choking model is established herein through the entropy relation, as it satisfies all the conservation-laws of nature. The physical insight of the boundary-layer-blockage persuaded nanoscale Sanal-flow-choking in diabatic flows presented in this article sheds light on finding solutions to numerous unresolved scientific problems in physical, chemical and biological sciences carried forward over the centuries because the mathematical-model describing the phenomenon of Sanal-flow-choking is a unique scientific-language of the real-world-fluid flows. The 3D-boundary-layer-blockage factors presented herein for various gases are universal-benchmark-data for performing high-fidelity in silico, in vitro and in vivo experiments in nanotubes.

AB  - We investigate the association of incremental pulse wave velocity (Delta C; the change in pulse wave velocity over a cardiac cycle) with cardiometabolic risk factors and report the first and (currently) the largest population-level data. In a cross-sectional study performed in a cohort of 1373 general population participants, Delta C was measured using clinically validated ARTSENS devices. There were 455 participants in the metabolic syndrome (MetS) group whose average Delta C was similar to 28.4% higher than that of the non-metabolic syndrome (Non-MetS) group. Females with MetS showed similar to 10.9% elevated average Delta C compared to males of the Non-MetS group. As the number of risk factors increased from 0 to 5, the average Delta C escalated by similar to 55% (1.50 +/- 0.52 m/s to 2.33 +/- 0.91 m/s). A gradual increase in average Delta C was observed across each decade from the younger (Delta C = 1.53 +/- 0.54 m/s) to geriatric (Delta C = 2.34 +/- 0.59 m/s) populations. There was also a significant difference in Delta C among the blood pressure categories. Most importantly, Delta C >= 1.81 m/s predicted a constellation of >= 3 risks with AUC = 0.615, OR = 2.309, and RR = 1.703. All statistical trends remained significant, even after adjusting for covariates. The study provides initial evidence for the potential use of Delta C as a tool for the early detection and screening of vascular dysfunction, which opens up avenues for active clinical and epidemiological studies. Further investigations are encouraged to confirm and establish the causative mechanism for the reported associations.

AB  - Purpose: In today's life, many electronic gadgets have the potential to become invaluable health care devices in future. The gadgets in this category include smartphones, smartwatches, and others. Till now, smartphone role has been highlighted on many occasions in different areas, and they continue to possess immense role in clinical documentation, clinical consultation, and digitalization of ocular care. In last one decade, many treatable conditions including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other pediatric retinal diseases are being imaged using smartphones. Methods: To comprehend this cumulative knowledge, a detailed medical literature search was conducted on PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science till February 2021. Results: The included literature revealed a definitive progress in posterior segment imaging. From simple torch light with smartphone examination to present day compact handy devices with artificial intelligence integrated software's have changed the very perspectives of ocular imaging in ophthalmology. The consistently reproducible results, constantly improving imaging techniques, and most importantly their affordable costs have renegotiated their role as effective screening devices in ophthalmology. Moreover, the obtained field of view, ocular safety, and their key utility in non-ophthalmic specialties are also growing. Conclusions: To conclude, smartphone imaging can now be considered as a quick, cost-effective, and digitalized tool for posterior segment screenings, however, their definite role in routine ophthalmic clinics is yet to be established.

AB  - Background Expected benefits of modified ultrafiltration (MUF) include increased hematocrit, reduction of total body water and inflammatory mediators, improved left ventricular systolic function, and improved systolic blood pressure and cardiac index (CI) following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This prospective randomized trial tested this hypothesis. Methods Seventy-nine patients undergoing intracardiac repair of tetralogy of fallot were randomized to conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) + MUF (n = 39) or only CUF group (n = 40). The primary outcome was a change in hematocrit. Secondary outcomes were changes in peak airway pressures, ventilatory support, blood transfusions, time to peripheral rewarming, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, inotrope score (IS), and CI. Serum inflammatory markers were measured. Results Baseline hematocrit was 50.6 +/- 10.02 in the only CUF group whereas it was 43.9 +/- 5.55 in the CUF + MUF group (p = .36). Following MUF, the CUF + MUF group had higher hematocrit (44.7 +/- 0.50 g/dl) compared to the only CUF group (37.2 +/- 0.49 g/dl), p <= .001 after adjusting for baseline hematocrit. Central venous pressure (mmHg) immediately following sternal closure was 9.27 +/- 3.12 mmHg in the CUF + MUF group and 10.52 +/- 2.2 mmHg in the only CUF group (p = .04). In the intensive care unit (ICU), they were 11.52 +/- 2.20 mmHg in the only CUF group and 10.84 +/- 2.78 mmHg in the CUF + MUF group (p = .02). Time to peripheral rewarming was 6.30 +/- 3.91 h in the CUF + MUF group and 13.67 +/- 3.91 h in the only CUF group (p = .06). Peak airway pressures in ICU were 17 +/- 2 mmHg versus 20.55 +/- 2.97 mmHg in CUF + MUF group & only CUF group, respectively, p < .001). Duration of mechanical ventilation was 6.3 +/- 2.7 h in CUF + MUF group compared to 14.7 +/- 3.5 h in the only CUF group (p = .002). IS was 11.52 +/- 2.20 in the only CUF group compared to 10.84 +/- 2.78 in CUF + MUFs group. Eight of 39 (20.5%) patients in the CUF + MUF group had IS > 10 compared to 22 of 40 (55%) patients in the only CUF group (p = .02). Serum Troponin-T and interleukin-6 levels were lower in the CUF + MUF group; TNF-alpha and CPK-MB were similar. ICU and hospital stay were similar. Conclusion Patients undergoing a combination of CUF and MUF had higher postoperative hematocrit, decreased duration of mechanical ventilation, lower need for inotropes and lower interleukin-6 and Troponin-T levels. This group had better postoperative outcomes. This study was registered with the Clinical trials registry of India (CTRI/2017/11/010512) before commencement.

AB  - Juxtapulmonary receptors (J) lying in the lung parenchyma are stimulated naturally by any condition that produces interstitial oedema, transient increases in interstitial volume and pressure or raised pulmonary capillary pressure. There is no information available about the level of their stimulation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPH) who have high levels of pulmonary artery systolic pressures. The aim of the present study therefore was to find the level of these receptors activity in these patients at their prevailing pulmonary artery systolic pressures. This was done by the established method of determining the dose of i.v. lobeline that gives rise to threshold levels of sensations in the upper chest areas and accelerates respiration. In IPH patients it was found to be as high as 31.6 +/- 5.6 mu g/kg i.e., twice as much as that known for healthy individuals which is 15 mu g/kg. This shows an enhanced stimulation of J receptors in IPH patients. Expectedly when pulmonary artery systolic pressure falls with pulmonary bed vasodilator medication given to IPH patients, a reduction in the natural stimulus of J receptors would also occur leading to a fall in their activity and hence that of the quantum of their reflexes of respiratory acceleration and inhibition of exercise. This finding provides the first insight of a neural mechanism that could be influenced to produce its effects when pulmonary artery systolic pressure falls by pulmonary vasodilator medication.

AB  - Objective: This scoping review aims to identify the various areas and current status of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for aiding individuals with cleft lip and/or palate.
   Introduction: Cleft lip and/or palate contributes significantly toward the global burden on the healthcare system. Artificial intelligence is a technology that can help individuals with cleft lip and/or palate, especially those in areas with limited access to receive adequate care.
   Inclusion Criteria: Studies that used artificial intelligence to aid the diagnosis, treatment, or its planning in individuals with cleft lip and/or palate were included.
   Methodology: A search of the Pubmed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore databases was conducted using search terms artificial intelligence and cleft lip and/or palate. Gray literature was searched using Google Scholar. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines.
   Results: The initial search identified 458 results, which were screened based on title and abstracts. After the screening, removal of duplicates, and a full-text reading of selected articles, 26 publications were included. They explored the use of AI in cleft lip and/or palate to aid in decisions regarding diagnosis, treatment, especially speech therapy, and prediction.
   Conclusion: There is active interest and immense potential for the use of artificial intelligence in cleft lip and/or palate. Most studies currently focus on speech in cleft palate. Multi-center studies that include different populations, with collaboration amongst academicians and researchers, can further develop the technology.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objective We evaluated effect of sequentially introducing four WHO-recommended interventions to promote hand-hygiene compliance in tertiary-care NICU. Study design Four dedicated research nurses directly observed doctors and nurses to record success in hand-hygiene opportunities at randomly selected NICU beds and randomly sampled time-slots in four phases (of 4-weeks each): I-Baseline, II-Self-directed learning; III-Participatory learning; IV-Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV); and V-CCTV-plus (with feedback). Findings Hand-hygiene compliance changed from 61.8% (baseline) to 77% (end) with overall relative change: 24.6% (95% CI 18, 32; p value= 0.003); compared with preceding phase, relative changes of 21% (15, 28; <0.001), 4% (0, 8; 0.008), -10% (-13, -6; <0.001), and 10% (5, 15; <0.001) during phases II, III, IV, and V, respectively were observed. Rise in hand-hygiene compliance was higher for after-WHO-moments (12.7%; upto 2.5-folds for moment 5, <0.001) compared to before-WHO-moments (5.2%). Educational interventions, feedback and monitoring WHO moments can improve hand-hygiene compliance significantly among health-care providers in NICU.

AB  - Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects a large number of couples worldwide, increasing their mental and financial burdens. While female factors that contribute to RPL have been studied extensively, the role of male factors is largely unknown, and approximately 40 % RPL cases remain unexplained despite thorough clinical examinations. These cases are clinically termed as idiopathic RPL (iRPL). Several studies have recently found that spermatozoa play an important role, beyond fertilization, in iRPL, specifically in early embryonic development. Consequently, scientists explored spermatozoa to understand iRPL and revealed that both oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation contribute to RPL. In this study, we analyzed sperm samples from male partners of iRPL patients and fertile men who recently fathered a child by LC- MS/MS to identify proteomic markers of iRPL. A total of 1,988 proteins were quantified by a label-free method, and stringent statistical analysis was performed for the selection of candidate biomarkers of iRPL. Out of 1,647 proteins quantified, only 7 proteins qualified the selection criteria, which are lactotransferrin, ATP synthase subunit beta mitochondrial, fatty acid synthase, anterior gradient protein 2 homolog, hemoglobin subunit beta, short-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase mitochondrial, cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain, and 14-3-3 protein sigma. We then performed gene annotations, pathways, and network analyses to gain more biological insights, identifying an association between oxidative stress and iRPL.

AB  - -OBJECTIVE: We present the unique administrative issues as well as specific patient-related and surgeon-related challenges and solutions implemented while treating neurosurgical patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic vis-a-vis pre-COVID-19 times at our tertiary-care center. -METHODS: This is a retrospective study comparing the outcome of the neurosurgical patients treated from the beginning of lockdown in India on March 25,2020 to November 30, 2020 with that of same period in the previous year, 2019. -RESULTS: There were 687 neurosurgery admissions during the study period compared with 2550 admissions in 2019. The total number of surgeries performed in neurosurgery also showed a similar trend, with only 654 surgeries in 2020 compared with 3165 surgeries in 2019. During COVID-19 times, 474 patients were operated on including both trauma and nontrauma cases. Of the 50 patients with suspected/indeterminate COVID-19 who were operated on, 5 turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Significant differences were seen in the mortality (P < 0.01) and morbidity (P < 0.01) among patients with trauma on comparing COVID and pre-COVID periods. Similarly, a significant difference was observed in the mortality (P < 0.001) and morbidity (P < 0.001) in patients who did not have trauma. -CONCLUSIONS: The higher mortality and morbidity during the COVID pandemic is primarily attributable to poorer baseline clinical status. Our experience from this COVID period might not only help us in tackling subsequent waves but also help other institutions in the developing world to be better prepared for similar circumstances.

AB  - Background Surgery residents often consider learning from the operative videos on YouTube, however, the quality of these videos is questionable. We aim to compare the quality and reliability of operative videos on thoracoscopic lobectomy (TL) in children available on YouTube (YT) and WebSurg (WS). Methods Using a defined search strategy, the most-viewed YT videos and all available WS videos on TL in children were identified. The quality and reliability of the two groups of videos were compared using the video popularity index (VPI), Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, and LAP-VEGaS quality assessment tool. On the basis of the LAP-VEGaS score, the videos were divided into acceptable quality (score >= 11) or poor quality (score < 11). Results Ten most-viewed YT videos were compared with six relevant videos on WS. The median %VPI among the WS and YT videos were 83.3 (range 71.5-404.4) and 49.4 (range 0-270), respectively (p = 0.017). The median JAMA score of the WS videos was also significantly higher than the YT videos (p = 0.0003). In terms of the LAP-VEGaS scores, all WS videos versus only three YT had an acceptable quality. Conclusions As compared to the WS videos, the quality and reliability of the YT videos on TL were significantly poorer.

AB  - Context: Multiple observational studies have reported an inverse relationship between 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations (25(OH)D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the results of short- and long-term interventional trials concerning the relationship between 25(OH)D and T2D risk have beeninconsistent.
   Objectives and methods: To evaluate the causal role of reduced blood25(OH)D in T2D, here we have performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study using 59,890 individuals (5,862 T2D cases and 54,028 controls) from European and Asian Indian ancestries. We used six known SNPs, including threeT2D SNPs and three vitamin D pathway SNPs, as a genetic instrument to evaluatethe causality and direction of the association between T2D and circulating25(OH)D concentration.
   Results: Results of the combined meta-analysis of eightparticipating studies showed that a composite score of three T2D SNPs wouldsignificantly increase T2D risk by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.24, p = 1.82 x-10-32; Z score 11.86, which, however, hadno significant association with 25(OH)D status (Beta -0.02nmol/L +/- SE0.01nmol/L; p = 0.83; Z score -0.21). Likewise, the geneticallyinstrumented composite score of 25(OH)D lowering alleles significantlydecreased 25(OH)D concentrations (-2.1nmol/L +/- SE 0.1nmol/L,p = 7.92 x-10-78; Z score -18.68) but was notassociated with increased risk for T2D (OR 1.00, p = 0.12;Z score 1.54). However, using 25(OH)D synthesis SNP (DHCR7; rs12785878) as anindividual genetic instrument, a per allele reduction of 25(OH)D concentration(-4.2nmol/L +/- SE 0.3nmol/L)was predicted to increase T2D risk by 5%, p = 0.004;Z score 2.84. This effect, however, was not seen in other 25(OH)D SNPs (GCrs2282679, CYP2R1 rs12794714) when used as an individual instrument.
   Conclusion: Our new data on this bidirectional Mendelianran domization study suggests that genetically instrumented T2D risk does notcause changes in 25(OH)D levels. However, genetically regulated 25(OH)Ddeficiency due to vitamin D synthesis gene (DHCR7) may influence the risk ofT2D.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease with the majority of patients experiencing disease relapse despite response to initial therapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and bispecific T-cell engagers are innovative immunotherapeutic approaches currently in development for the treatment of MM. This systematic review summarizes the efficacy and safety of ADCs and bispecific T-cell engagers in relapsed refractory (RR) MM patients from 2010 to date. Comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Wiley Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Clinicaltrials.gov. A total of 13 studies (n = 529) met inclusion eligibility. All studies were prospective in nature investigating ADCs or bispecific T-cell engagers in RR MM; 10 trials were phase 1 and 3 were phase 2. The median age of patients ranged from 24 to 82 years. Among trials with ADC regimens, the overall response (OR) ranged from 34 to 60% and complete response (CR) ranged from 3 to 6%. The most common non-hematologic adverse event (AE) of ADCs was keratopathy, while anemia and thrombocytopenia were the most common hematological AEs. With bispecific T-cell engagers, ORR ranged from 31 to 83%, CR ranged from 7 to 22%, and partial response (PR) ranged from 5 to 16%. The most common non-hematologic AE of bispecific T-cell engagers was cytokine release syndrome (CRS) while the most common hematological AE was neutropenia. Initial data appears to show good clinical activity and tolerable safety profiles, making ADCs and bispecific T-cell engagers promising agents for RRMM. Future studies with newer combinations and a longer follow-up are needed to determine the precise role of these novel therapies in the evolving paradigm of MM treatment.

TI  - Association of SUMOylation Pathway Genes With Stroke in a Genome-Wide Association Study in India
T2  - NEUROLOGY
KW  - ISCHEMIC-STROKE
KW  - CEREBROVASCULAR-DISEASE
AB  - Objective To undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants for stroke in an Indian population. Methods In a hospital-based case-control study, 8 teaching hospitals in India recruited 4,088 participants, including 1,609 stroke cases. Imputed genetic variants were tested for association with stroke subtypes using both single-marker and gene-based tests. Association with vascular risk factors was performed with logistic regression. Various databases were searched for replication, functional annotation, and association with related traits. Status of candidate genes previously reported in the Indian population was also checked. Results Associations of vascular risk factors with stroke were similar to previous reports and show modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and alcohol consumption as having the highest effect. Single-marker-based association revealed 2 loci for cardioembolic stroke (1p21 and 16q24), 2 for small vessel disease stroke (3p26 and 16p13), and 4 for hemorrhagic stroke (3q24, 5q33, 6q13, and 19q13) at p < 5 x 10(-8). The index single nucleotide polymorphism of 1p21 is an expression quantitative trait locus (p(lowest) = 1.74 x 10(-58)) for RWDD3 involved in SUMOylation and is associated with platelet distribution width (1.15 x 10(-9)) and 18-carbon fatty acid metabolism (p = 7.36 x 10(-12)). In gene-based analysis, we identified 3 genes (SLC17A2, FAM73A, and OR52L1) at p < 2.7 x 10(-6). Eleven of 32 candidate gene loci studied in an Indian population replicated (p < 0.05), and 21 of 32 loci identified through previous GWAS replicated according to directionality of effect. Conclusions This GWAS of stroke in an Indian population identified novel loci and replicated previously known loci. Genetic variants in the SUMOylation pathway, which has been implicated in brain ischemia, were identified for association with stroke.

AB  - Dissecting the function(s) of proteins present exclusively in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) will provide important clues regarding the role of these proteins in mycobacterial pathogenesis. Using extensive computational approaches, we shortlisted ORFs/proteins unique to M.tb among 13 different species of mycobacteria and identified a hypothetical protein Rv1509 as a 'signature protein' of M.tb. This unique protein was found to be present only in M.tb and absent in all other mycobacterial species, including BCG. In silico analysis identified numerous putative T cell and B cell epitopes in Rv1509. Initial in vitro experiments using innate immune cells demonstrated Rv1509 to be immunogenic with potential to modulate innate immune responses. Macrophages treated with Rv1509 exhibited higher activation status along with substantial release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Besides, Rv1509 protein boosts dendritic cell maturation by increasing the expression of activation markers such as CD80, HLA-DR and decreasing DC-SIGN expression and this interaction was mediated by innate immune receptor TLR2. Further, in vivo experiments in mice demonstrated that Rv1509 protein promotes the expansion of multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+T cells and induces effector memory response along with evoking a canonical Th1 type of immune response. Rv1509 also induces substantial B cell response as revealed by increased IgG reactivity in sera of immunized animals. This allowed us to demonstrate the diagnostic efficacy of this protein in sera of human TB patients compared to the healthy controls. Taken together, our results reveal that Rv1509 signature protein has immunomodulatory functions evoking immunological memory response with possible implications in serodiagnosis and TB vaccine development.

AB  - Designing 3D constructs with appropriate materials and structural frameworks for complex dental restorative/regenerative procedures has always remained a multi-criteria optimization challenge. In this regard, 3D printing has long been known to be a potent tool for various tissue regenerative applications, however, the preparation of biocompatible, biodegradable, and stable inks is yet to be explored and revolutionized for overall performance improvisation. The review reports the currently employed manufacturing processes for the development of engineered self-supporting, easily processable, and cost-effective 3D constructs with target-specific tuneable mechanics, bioactivity, and degradability aspects in the oral cavity for their potential use in numerous dental applications ranging from soft pulp tissues to hard alveolar bone tissues. A hybrid synergistic approach, comprising of development of multi-layered, structurally stable, composite building blocks with desired physicomechanical performance and bioactivity presents an optimal solution to circumvent the major limitations and develop new-age advanced dental restorations and implants. Further, the review summarizes some manufacturing perspectives which may inspire the readers to design appropriate structures for clinical trials so as to pave the way for their routine applications in dentistry in the near future.

AB  - A 27-year-old man presented with sudden onset chest pain associated with dyspnea for the preceding 1 week. He also reported typical angina for the past 3 months. Clinical examination revealed a continuous murmur in the upper left parasternal region. Echocardiography revealed a ruptured left sinus of Valsalva aneurysm communicating with the left atrium. CT angiogram confirmed a ruptured large aneurysm of the left sinus of Valsalva freely communicating with the left atrium via a long fistulous tract. Additionally, the tract resulted in partial compression of the left main coronary artery. A ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm represents an important differential in young adults presenting with acute onset chest pain and heart failure. Fistulous tracts arising from the left sinus may result in compression of the left coronary system and sudden cardiac death making this a unique entity to recognize.

AB  - Objectives To study the histopathology of patients dying of COVID-19 using post-mortem minimally invasive sampling techniques. Methods This was a single-center observational study conducted at JPNATC, AIIMS. Thirty-seven patients who died of COVID-19 were enrolled. Post-mortem percutaneous biopsies were taken from lung, heart, liver, kidney and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using CD61 and CD163. SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected using IHC with primary antibodies. Results The mean age was 48.7 years and 59.5% were males. Lung histopathology showed diffuse alveolar damage in 78% patients. Associated bronchopneumonia was seen in 37.5% and scattered microthrombi in 21% patients. Immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was observed in Type II pneumocytes. Acute tubular injury with epithelial vacuolization was seen in 46% of renal biopsies. Seventy-one percent of liver biopsies showed Kupffer cell hyperplasia and 27.5% showed submassive hepatic necrosis. Conclusions Predominant finding was diffuse alveolar damage with demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 protein in the acute phase. Microvascular thrombi were rarely identified in any organ. Substantial hepatocyte necrosis, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, microvesicular, and macrovesicular steatosis unrelated to microvascular thrombi suggested that liver might be a primary target of COVID-19.

AB  - Background. Treatment of patients with platinum resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is an unmet need. We evaluated the role of oral metronomic therapy in this setting. Patients and methods. Between October 2017 and September 2019 seventy five patients with platinum resistant/refractory EOC were enrolled. Patients received oral etoposide (50 mg, day 1 to 14, cyclophosphamide 50 mg, day 1 to 28, every 4 weeks (Arm A, n = 38). Patients in Arm-B (n = 37) received Pazopanib (400 mg once daily) in addition to etoposide and cyclophosphamide. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the EORTC questionnaire. Serum VEGF and PDGF were estimated at baseline, after 3rd and 6th cycle. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), toxicity and QoL. Results. Patients characteristics were well matched. Median PFS was higher in arm B, 5.1 months (95% CI 3.13 to10.33) compared to 3.4 months (95% CI 3.0 to 6.53) in arm A, p = 0.045. Median OS has 'not reached' in Arm B compared to 11.2 months (95% CI, 5.66 not reached) in arm A, p = 0.032. Therapy was tolerated well; oral mucositis (p = 0.36) and fatigue (p = 0.08) being more in arm B. QoL assessment revealed modest improvement in 'symptom scales' in Arm B. Serum VEGF and PDGF levels decreased with therapy in both arms (Arm A -p < 0.0001, Arm B -p < 0.016). Conclusion. Addition of pazopanib to etoposide and cyclophosphamide could be a novel oral combination for metronomic therapy for platinum resistant/refractory EOC. Trial registration. CTRI/2017/10/010219.

AB  - Objective To compare intra-operative and postoperative outcomes between the single-puncture and the standard double-puncture techniques of arthrocentesis. Methods PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception up to 31(st) August 2020. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies conducted on patients with temporomandibular joint disorders comparing any type of single-puncture arthrocentesis with standard double-puncture arthrocentesis and reporting intra-operative/postoperative outcomes were included. Assessment of the risk of bias was done with the Cochrane Collaboration risk assessment tool. Results Thirteen studies were included (12 were RCTs). Analysis of a limited number of studies indicated no difference in pain or maximal mouth opening (MMO) between the single-puncture type-1 or type-2 and the double-puncture technique at various follow-up intervals. Pooled analysis (four studies) demonstrated that the single-puncture type-2 technique requires significantly less operating time as compared to the double-puncture method. No such difference was noted between single-puncture type-1 and double-puncture techniques. Analysis of two studies indicated significantly reduced intra-operative needle relocations with the single-puncture techniques. Studies were not of high quality with concerns of bias in randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding. Conclusions Limited data indicate no difference in pain or MMO with single- or double-puncture techniques of arthrocentesis. Amongst the three techniques, the single-puncture type-2 technique has the advantages of significantly lower operating time and reduced intra-operative needle relocations and it may be the preferred method of TMJ arthrocentesis in clinical practice.

AB  - Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a malformation of the cerebral cortex with poorly-defined epileptogenic zones (EZs), and poor surgical outcome in FCD is associated with inaccurate localization of the EZ. Hence, identifying novel epileptogenic markers to aid in the localization of EZ in patients with FCD is very much needed. High-throughput gene expression studies of FCD samples have the potential to uncover molecular changes underlying the epileptogenic process and identify novel markers for delineating the EZ. For this purpose, we, for the first time performed RNA sequencing of surgically resected paired tissue samples obtained from electrocorticographically graded high (MAX) and low spiking (MIN) regions of FCD type II patients and autopsy controls. We identified significant changes in the MAX samples of the FCD type II patients when compared to non-epileptic controls, but not in the case of MIN samples. We found significant enrichment for myelination, oligodendrocyte development and differentiation, neuronal and axon ensheathment, phospholipid metabolism, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton, semaphorins, and ion channels in the MAX region. Through the integration of both MAX vs non-epileptic control and MAX vs MIN RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) data, PLP1, PLLP, UGT8, KLK6, SOX10, MOG, MAG, MOBP, ANLN, ERMN, SPP1, CLDN11, TNC, GPR37, SLC12A2, ABCA2, ABCA8, ASPA, P2RX7, CERS2, MAP4K4, TF, CTGF, Semaphorins, Opalin, FGFs, CALB2, and TNC were identified as potential key regulators of multiple pathways related to FCD type II pathology. We have identified novel epileptogenic marker elements that may contribute to epileptogenicity in patients with FCD and could be possible markers for the localization of EZ.

AB  - Background Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in childhood is an eminently curable disease. Excellent outcomes can be achieved even in resource-limited settings and increasingly, the focus is on limiting long-term toxicity. Contemporary treatment incorporates a risk-stratified, response-adapted approach using multiagent chemotherapy with or without low-dose radiotherapy (RT). Many developing countries continue to use ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastin, and dacarbazine)-based regimen owing to limited acute toxicity, cost, and ease of delivery. We report outcomes of children with early-stage HL using limited cycles of ABVD-based treatment in the first prospective multicentric collaborative study from India InPOG-HL-15-01. Methods Children <18 years with biopsy-proven HL were enrolled. Patients with stages I and IIA with or without bulky disease were classified as having early-stage disease. Patients were planned to receive four cycles of ABVD subject to satisfactory early response assessment (ERA) scheduled after two cycles of chemotherapy. RT was limited to patients with bulky disease or those with suboptimal ERA. Results Four hundred ten patients were enrolled over 30 months from 27 centers. One hundred thirty-four were classified as having early-stage disease. Fifty-three (40%) of these had bulky disease. One hundred ten (83%) of this cohort achieved complete or very good partial ERA. Fifty-four (40%) received RT. At a median of 52 months since diagnosis, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) is 94% and 95.5%, respectively. Treatment-related mortality and abandonment were <1%. Conclusion Limited cycles of ABVD with RT to selected patients is a very effective option for patients with early-stage disease in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Congenital diarrhea and enteropathies (CODEs) are monogenic disorders causing early onset of intractable diarrhea. Their diagnosis and management are challenging. With the availability of commercial next generation genetic testing, we are now better able to classify and manage these disorders. The authors present their experience with 4 cases. Two patients had congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) and 1 case each of microvillous inclusion disease (MVID) and trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES). Age at onset varied from 3 to 38 d of life. Light microscopy and electron microscopy of duodenal and rectal endoscopic biopsies were consistent with the diagnosis. Genetic evaluation was possible in 3 cases indicating causative mutations. Two children (CTE and MVID) were alive at last follow-up. The authors suggest a stepwise approach to the diagnosis and management of these disorders in the Indian context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the efficacy of ATLS in low-and middle-income countries are limited. We followed up ATLS providers certified by the ATLS India program over a decade (2009 to 2019), aiming to measure the benefits in knowledge, skills, attitude and their attrition over time.
   METHODS: The survey instrument was developed taking a cue from published literature on ATLS and improvised using the Delphi method. Randomly selected ATLS providers were sent the survey instrument via email as a Google form, along with a statement of purpose. Results are presented descriptively.
   RESULTS: ATLS India trained 7,847 providers over the study period. 2500 providers were selected for the survery using computer-generated random number table. One thousand and thirty doctors (41.2%) responded. Improvement in knowledge (n = 1,013 [98.3%]), psychomotor skills (n = 986 [95.7%]), organizational skills (n = 998 [96.9%]), overall trauma management (n = 1,013 [98.7%]) and self-confidence (n = 939 [91%]) were reported. Majority (904 [87.8%]) started ATLS promulgation at workplace in personal capacity. These benefits lasted beyond 2 years in majority (>60%) of respondents. More than 40% reported cognitive (n = 492 [47.8%]), psychomotor (n = 433 [42%]), and organizational benefits (n = 499 [48.4%]) lasting beyond 3 years. Improvement in self-confidence, ATLS promulgation at the workplace, and retention of organizational skills were more pronounced in ATLS faculties than providers. All other benefits were found to be comparable in both sub-groups. Lack of trained staff (n = 660 [64.1%]) and attitude issues (n = 495 [48.1%]) were the major impediments in implementing ATLS at the workplace. More than a third of respondents (n = 373 [36.2%]) could enumerate one or more incidents where ATLS principles were life-or limb-saving.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive, psychomotor, organizational, and affective impact of ATLS is overwhelmingly positive in the Indian scenario. Until formal trauma systems are established, ATLS remains the best hope for critically injured patients in resource-contrained settings. (C) 2021 by the American College of Surgeons.

AB  - Introduction: Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily manifests in the form of respiratory symptoms, emerging evidence suggests that the disease is associated with numerous neurological complications, such as stroke and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Hence, further research is necessary to seek possible therapeutic targets in the CNS for effective management of these complications. Areas covered: This review examines the neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and the possible routes of infection. It progresses to illuminate the possible therapeutic targets for effective management of these neuromodulatory effects and the repurposing of drugs that could serve this purpose. To this end, literature from the year 1998-2021 was derived from PubMed. Expert opinion: The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 may be related to poor prognosis and higher comorbidity. Identification of the key molecular targets in the brain that are potential indicators of the observed neuropathology, such as inflammatory mediators and chromatin modifiers, is key. The repurposing of existing drugs to target potential candidates could reduce the mortality attributed to these associated neurological complications.

AB  - Purpose: Female genital Tuberculosis (FGTB) causes infertility and formation of Tubo-ovarian (TO) masses. The study showed treatment response of PET-CT in evaluation of anti-tubercular treatment response in patients of infertility with tuberculous TO masses.
   Method: It's a Prospective study on 47 confirmed cases of FGTB with infertility having TO masses. All patients were subjected to 18F-FDGPET/CT to see the glucose uptake by the TO mass and extent of the disease. Category I treatment under DOTS was given for 6 months. All underwent follow-up of PET/CT to see the response to ATT. Results of pre ATT PET/CT were compared with post ATT PET/CT.
   Results: TO masses was in 42 (89.36%); bilateral in 18 (38.29%) FDG uptake in 14 (29.78%) and without FDG uptake in 4 (8.51%) cases. Right sided mass in 13 (27.65%) FDG uptake in 9 (19.14%) and without FDG uptake in 4 (8.51%) cases. Left sided mass in 11 (23.40%) FDG uptake in 7 (14.89%) and without FDG uptake in 4 (8.51%) cases. Post ATT, there was significant decrease in most parameters. Repeat PET-CT done in 44 cases showed TO mass in 9 (20.45%); bilateral in 4 (9.09%) (FDG uptake in 2.27%) (p < 0.001), right sided in 3 (6.85%) (FDG uptake in 2.27%) (p < 0.002) and left side in 2 (2.27%) FDG uptake in 1 case (p < 0.004). Pelvic and mesenteric lymphadenopathy without FDG uptake was in 1 case (p value = 0.03) while omental and peritoneal deposits without FDG uptake in 1 and 2 cases, respectively.
   Conclusion: PET-CT is useful in treatment response evaluation of tubercular TO masses. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background A systematic understanding of the burden of neurological disorders at the subnational level is not readily available for India. We present a comprehensive analysis of the disease burden and trends of neurological disorders at the state level in India. Methods Using all accessible data from multiple sources, we estimated the prevalence or incidence and disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) for neurological disorders from 1990 to 2019 for all states of India as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019. We assessed the contribution of each neurological disorder to deaths and DALYs in India in 2019, their trends in prevalence or incidence and DALY rates over time, and heterogeneity between the states of India. We also assessed the Pearson correlation coefficient between Sociodemographic Index (SDI) of the states and the prevalence or incidence and DALY rates of each neurological disorder. Additionally, we estimated the contribution of known risk factors to DALYs from neurological disorders. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the mean estimates. Findings The contribution of non-communicable neurological disorders to total DALYs in India doubled from 4middot0% (95% UI 3middot2-5middot0) in 1990 to 8middot2% (6middot6-10middot2) in 2019, and the contribution of injury-related neurological disorders increased from 0middot2% (0middot2-0middot3) to 0middot6% (0middot5-0middot7). Conversely, the contribution of communicable neurological disorders decreased from 4middot1% (3middot5-4middot8) to 1middot1% (0middot9-1middot5) during the same period. In 2019, the largest contributors to the total neurological disorder DALYs in India were stroke (37middot9% [29middot9-46middot1]), headache disorders (17middot5% [3middot6-32middot5]), epilepsy (11middot3% [9middot0-14middot3]), cerebral palsy (5middot7% [4middot2-7middot7]), and encephalitis (5middot3% [3middot7-8middot9]). The crude DALY rate of several neurological disorders had considerable heterogeneity between the states in 2019, with the highest variation for tetanus (93middot2 times), meningitis (8middot3 times), and stroke (5middot5 times). SDI of the states had a moderate significant negative correlation with communicable neurological disorder DALY rate and a moderate significant positive correlation with injury-related neurological disorder DALY rate in 2019. For most of the non communicable neurological disorders, there was an increase in prevalence or incidence from 1990 to 2019. Substantial decreases were evident in the incidence and DALY rates of communicable neurological disorders during the same period. Migraine and multiple sclerosis were more prevalent among females than males and traumatic brain injuries were more common among males than females in 2019. Communicable diseases contributed to the majority of total neurological disorder DALYs in children younger than 5 years, and non-communicable neurological disorders were the highest contributor in all other age groups. In 2019, the leading risk factors contributing to DALYs due to non communicable neurological disorders in India included high systolic blood pressure, air pollution, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. For communicable disorders, the identified risk factors with modest contributions to DALYs were low birthweight and short gestation and air pollution.
   Interpretation The increasing contribution of non-communicable and injury-related neurological disorders to the overall disease burden in India, and the substantial state-level variation in the burden of many neurological disorders highlight the need for state-specific health system responses to address the gaps in neurology services related to awareness, early identification, treatment, and rehabilitation.

AB  - Background Human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) is a common virus in childhood acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI). However, no estimates have been made to quantify the global burden of hPIV in childhood ALRI. We aimed to estimate the global and regional hPIV-associated and hPIV-attributable ALRI incidence, hospital admissions, and mortality for children younger than 5 years and stratified by 0-5 months, 6-11 months, and 12-59 months of age.
   Methods We did a systematic review of hPIV-associated ALRI burden studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2020, found in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Global Health Library, three Chinese databases, and Google search, and also identified a further 41 high-quality unpublished studies through an international research network. We included studies reporting community incidence of ALRI with laboratory-confirmed hPIV; hospital admission rates of ALRI or ALRI with hypoxaemia in children with laboratory-confirmed hPIV; proportions of patients with ALRI admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed hPIV; or in-hospital case-fatality ratios (hCFRs) of ALRI with laboratory-confirmed hPIV. We used a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias. We analysed incidence, hospital admission rates, and hCFRs of hPIV-associated ALRI using a generalised linear mixed model. Adjustment was made to account for the non-detection of hPIV-4. We estimated hPIV-associated ALRI cases, hospital admissions, and in-hospital deaths using adjusted incidence, hospital admission rates, and hCFRs. We estimated the overall hPIV-associated ALRI mortality (both in-hospital and out-hospital mortality) on the basis of the number of in-hospital deaths and care-seeking for child pneumonia. We estimated hPIV-attributable ALRI burden by accounting for attributable fractions for hPIV in laboratory-confirmed hPIV cases and deaths. Sensitivity analyses were done to validate the estimates of overall hPIVassociated ALRI mortality and hPIV-attributable ALRI mortality. The systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019148570).
   Findings 203 studies were identified, including 162 hPIV-associated ALRI burden studies and a further 41 high-quality unpublished studies. Globally in 2018, an estimated 18.8 million (uncertainty range 12.8-28.9) ALRI cases, 725 000 (433 000-1 260 000) ALRI hospital admissions, and 34 400 (16 400-73 800) ALRI deaths were attributable to hPIVs among children younger than 5 years. The age-stratified and region-stratified analyses suggested that about 61% (35% for infants aged 0-5 months and 26% for 6-11 months) of the hospital admissions and 66% (42% for infants aged 0-5 months and 24% for 6-11 months) of the in-hospital deaths were in infants, and 70% of the in hospital deaths were in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Between 73% and 100% (varying by outcome) of the data had a low risk in study design; the proportion was 46-65% for the adjustment for health-care use, 59-77% for patient groups excluded, 54-93% for case definition, 42-93% for sampling strategy, and 67-77% for test methods. Heterogeneity in estimates was found between studies for each outcome. Interpretation We report the first global burden estimates of hPIV-associated and hPIV-attributable ALRI in young children. Globally, approximately 13% of ALRI cases, 4-14% of ALRI hospital admissions, and 4% of childhood ALRI mortality were attributable to hPIV. These numbers indicate a potentially notable burden of hPIV in ALRI morbidity and mortality in young children.
   These estimates should encourage and inform investment to accelerate the development of targeted interventions. Funding Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Results: According to Barcelona proposal for PP, 20.6% of the patients belonged to depressive PP, 45.8% belonged to manic PP and 33.6% belonged to indeterminate polarity. According to Harvard index of PP, 31.6% of the patients belonged to depressive PP, 56.1% belonged to manic polarity and 12.3% of the patients could not be categorized into any of these categories and hence, were considered to have indeterminate polarity. Those with depressive PP were more often having BD-II, had later age of onset, spent more time in episodes, had higher residual depressive symptoms, had lower residual manic symptoms, more often had depression as the first lifetime episode, and less often had at least one psychotic episode.
   Conclusion: In the Indian subcontinent, although the prevalence of PP is influenced by the definition used, the most common PP is that of mania. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of cognitive impairment with sleep quality, depression, and cardiometabolic risk factors among participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Subjects underwent clinical interview to capture socio-demographic details, medical history, sleep quality, presence of depression, along with anthropometric and biochemical measurements. A detailed neuropsychological assessment [Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA), Trail making A and B, Digit span, Spatial span, Letter Number Sequencing] was done. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA score of <23. Results: Participants (n = 250, 50% women, 63.6% middle-age) had a mean (+/- SD) age of 53.6 (+/- 9.1) years and HbA1c of 55.1 +/- 6.8 mmol/mol (7.2 +/- 0.6%). Cognitive impairment was present in 57 (22.8%) participants. In the middle-age subgroup, cognitive impairment was higher (23.9%) than those in the fourth decade (6.3%), but comparable (24.0%) to the older age (60-70 years) individuals. Diabetes-related vascular complications [Odds ratio (95% CI) 2.03 (1.05, 3.94)]; hypertension [2.00 (1.04, 3.84)], depression [2.37 (1.24, 4.55)] and lower education [2.73 (1.42, 5.23)] had a significant association with cognitive impairment on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: The high burden of cognitive impairment calls for an urgent need to establish longitudinal cohorts in midlife to understand this population's cognitive trajectories and see the influence of various bio-psychosocial variables.

AB  - Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia-2 is one of the most prevalent SCA type across the world and one of the commonest in India. We aimed to characterize SCA2 patients both clinically and genetically (ATXN2-CAG repeats and its haplotypic background). Methods: A total of 436 SCA2 patients were recruited consecutively comprising individuals of multiple ethnicities and two large multigenerational families. A detailed clinical evaluation and genetic analysis for CAG repeat length estimation and two marker based haplotype analysis [rs695871 and rs695872 located 177 bp and 106 bp upstream of CAG sequence in Exon 1 of ATXN2] was performed. Results: Generalized limb ataxia and slow saccades were prevalent features in majority of our patients, while hyporeflexia and extrapyramidal features were less commonly observed manifestations. Slow ocular saccades, upper limb ataxia and tremor showed significant associations with age of onset, CAG repeat length and disease duration. We observed a 100% association of C-C haplotype with the expanded ATXN2 repeats. Conclusion: This study represents the largest study of SCA2 Indian patients that highlights the clinico-genetic manifestations and haplotype analysis. A significant proportion of patients have not shown the characteristic slow saccades and hyporeflexia thus indicating the influences of other factors in modulation of the disease which warrants further investigations. The observation of CC haplotype in all our SCA2 patients indicates a common origin across all Indian sub populations and that also indicate a common global founder event in the past.

AB  - BackgroundAppropriate structural and material properties are essential for finite-element-modeling (FEM). In knee FEM, structural information could extract through 3D-imaging, but the individual subject's tissue material properties are inaccessible.PurposeThe current study's purpose was to develop a methodology to estimate the subject-specific stiffness of the tibiofemoral joint using finite-element-analysis (FEA) and MRI data of knee joint with and without load.MethodsIn this study, six Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets were acquired from 3 healthy volunteers with axially loaded and unloaded knee joint. The strain was computed from the tibiofemoral bone gap difference (Delta mBGFT) using the knee MR images with and without load. The knee FEM study was conducted using a subject-specific knee joint 3D-model and various soft-tissue stiffness values (1 to 50 MPa) to develop subject-specific stiffness versus strain models.ResultsLess than 1.02% absolute convergence error was observed during the simulation. Subject-specific combined stiffness of weight-bearing tibiofemoral soft-tissue was estimated with mean values as 2.400.17 MPa. Intra-subject variability has been observed during the repeat scan in 3 subjects as 0.27, 0.12, and 0.15 MPa, respectively. All subject-specific stiffness-strain relationship data was fitted well with power function (R-2=0.997).ConclusionThe current study proposed a generalized mathematical model and a methodology to estimate subject-specific stiffness of the tibiofemoral joint for FEM analysis. Such a method might enhance the efficacy of FEM in implant design optimization and biomechanics for subject-specific studies.Trial registration The institutional ethics committee (IEC), Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India, approved the study on 20th September 2017, with reference number P-019; it was a pilot study, no clinical trail registration was recommended.

AB  - Background Based on recent research reports, dysbiosis and improper concentrations of microbial metabolites in the gut may result into the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent advancement also highlights the involvement of bacteria and their secreted metabolites in the cancer causation. Gut microbial metabolites are functional output of the host-microbiota interactions and produced by anaerobic fermentation of food components in the diet. They contribute to influence variety of biological mechanisms including inflammation, cell signaling, cell-cycle disruption which are majorly disrupted in carcinogenic activities. Purpose In this review, we intend to discuss recent updates and possible molecular mechanisms to provide the role of bacterial metabolites, gut bacteria and diet in the colorectal carcinogenesis. Recent evidences have proposed the role of bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleaturm, Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium septicum, in the carcinogenesis of CRC. Metagenomic study confirmed that these bacteria are in increased abundance in CRC patient as compared to healthy individuals and can cause inflammation and DNA damage which can lead to development of cancer. These bacteria produce metabolites, such as secondary bile salts from primary bile salts, hydrogen sulfide, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which are likely to promote inflammation and subsequently cancer development. Conclusion Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota-derived metabolites have a role in CRC progression and causation and hence, could be implicated in CRC diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

AB  - Background/Purpose Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) is designed to asses patient recovery post Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) in a new dimension. It assess the ability to forget the operated joint as artificial during activities of daily living. New Knee Society Score (NKSS) is developed to encompass objective and subjective outcome as well as an assessment of patient expectation and satisfaction. Our purpose was (1) to determine FJS at 1 year post TKA in Indian Patients, and (2) to assess convergent validity between FJS and the NKSS. We hypothesised that FJS should strongly correlate with the Satisfaction (SS) and Knee perception(KPS) sub-component of NKSS Methods We enrolled 181 patients who underwent primary TKA during an 8-month duration. They were prospectively followed up at 1-year review clinic when FJS and NKSS were administered. 169 patients completed the assessment forms and 13 patients were lost to follow-up. Statistical evaluation was done with Spearman correlation test. Results Mean FJS at 1 year was 66.6 +/- 25.9 with 14% ceiling and 1% floor effects. There was a mild to moderate correlation of FJS with NKSS (p < 0.001, r = 0.47) and its sub-scores (p < 0.001; r = 0.43 and r = 0.44). There was a weak correlation of FJS with NKSS sub-components of SS and KPS (p < 0.001; r = 0.37 and 0.25, respectively). Conclusion Mean FJS at 1 year post TKA showed convergent validity with NKSS; however, the correlation was not strong enough to use them interchangeably. Hypothesis that FJS should strongly correlate with the NKSS sub-components of satisfaction and joint perception was refuted. We conclude, FJS provides unique evaluation in recovery post TKA, different from NKSS.

AB  - Background Members of genus Rhodotorula are widely distributed in nature and have been traditionally considered non-pathogenic. Last few decades have seen the yeast as an emerging pathogen. We observed increase in numbers of Rhodotorula isolates from ocular infections in last few years, thus this prospective study was planned. Objectives To identify the species of Rhodotorula isolates from ocular infections. To know the antifungal susceptibilities and study the biofilm formation attributes of the isolates. Materials and Methods Rhodotorula isolates were speciated using conventional methods, Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption and Ionisation - Time of Flight (MALDI- TOF) and sequencing of ITS region of ribosomal DNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) was done using disc diffusion and E-test. Biofilm formation was studied using XTT [2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-phenyl)-2H-tetra-zolium-5-carboxanilide] assay. Results Twenty four isolates (92.3%) were identified as R. mucilaginosa and two as R. Minuta. AFST showed high MICs against Fluconazole, Amphotericin-B, Caspofungin, Micafungin and Flucytosine; MIC distribution from low to very high against Voriconazole, Itraconazole and Natamycin; and very low MICs against Posaconazole 57.7% of isolates were strong biofilm producers, 23.1% were moderate, and 19.2% were non producers. Conclusions This is the first prospective study on species distribution, antifungal susceptibility and biofilm production attributes of Rhodotorula isolates from ocular infections; also first time demonstrating the utility of proteomics based MALDI-TOF in diagnosing Rhodotorula up to species level. The study has shown high MICs against the conventional azoles, Amphotericin-B and Flucytosine. However, low MICs against Posaconazole and Natamycin give a hope for their possible therapeutic use.

AB  - Background Various anatomical and physiological factors make intubation in infants challenging. C-MAC videolaryngoscope shows better results as compared to the conventional direct laryngoscopy for intubation in infants. McGrath MAC size-1 with a disposable Macintosh type blade has recently been introduced for use in infants and has not been formally evaluated in this population. Aims This study aims to evaluate the intubation characteristics of C-MAC Miller and McGrath MAC in neonates and infants with the primary objective to compare the time with the two devices. Methods After informed consent from the parents, 140 neonates and infants scheduled for surgical procedures were randomized to undergo intubation with either C-MAC Miller or McGrath MAC after standard general anesthesia. The two devices were compared in terms of total intubation time, Percent of Glottic Opening score, Cormack Lehane grades, time to glottis view, intubation difficulty score, overall success rate, first attempt success rate, and complications. Results The median glottic view time (6 s [4-9] vs. 6 s [4-9]; p = .40) and intubation time (27 s [25.5-28] vs. 27 s [24.5-29.5]; p = .87) were similar. The mean difference (95% CI) in time to tracheal intubation and time to glottic view was 0.49 s [-3.1 to 2.1] and -1.7 s [-3.8 to 0.47], respectively. However, the Percent of Glottic Opening score, Cormack Lehane grades, and subjective intubation difficulty were significantly better with C-MAC. The first attempt success rates, overall success rates (100% vs. 97.5%), and intubation difficulty scores were comparable. There were two failed intubations with McGrath which were successfully intubated with C-MAC. Conclusion The C-MAC Miller blade showed similar intubation timings, success rates, and intubation difficulty score as compared to McGrath MAC in neonates and infants, though the former provided superior glottic views. Both the videolaryngoscopes may be safely used in infants and neonates for routine intubation scenarios.

AB  - Decentralized response has been the hallmark of the National AIDS Control Programme in India. District-level HIV burden estimates quantifying the distribution of the epidemics are needed to enhance this decentralized response further to monitor the progress on prevention, testing, and treatment interventions. In this paper, we describe the methodology and results of district-level estimates using the Spectrum model piloted in 5 states of India under National AIDS Control Programme. Using state spectrum model for HIV estimations 2017, we disaggregated state results by the district in pilot states. Each district was considered a subepidemic and HIV epidemic configuration was carried out in its general population as well as in key population. We used HIV surveillance data from antenatal clinics and routine pregnant women testing to model the general population's epidemic curve. We used HIV prevalence data available from HIV sentinel surveillance and integrated biological and behavioral surveys to inform the epidemic curve for key population. Estimation and projection packgage classic platform was used for the curve fitting. District-wide estimates extracted from subpopulation summary in Spectrum results section were used to calculate relative burden for each district and applied to approved State HIV Estimations 2017 estimates. No district in Tamil Nadu had an adult HIV prevalence of higher than 0.5% except for one, and the epidemic seems to be declining. In Maharashtra, the epidemic has shown a decline, with all except 5 districts showing an adult prevalence of less than 0.50%. In Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, few districts showed rising HIV prevalence. However, none had an adult prevalence of higher than 0.50%. In Mizoram, 6 of 8 districts showed a rising HIV trend with an adult prevalence of 1% or more in 5 districts. Disaggregation of state-level estimates by districts provided insights on epidemic diversity within the analyzed states. It also provided baseline evidence to measure the progress toward the goal of end of AIDS by 2030.

AB  - Patients with RR DLBCL who have received >= 2 lines of therapy have limited treatment options and an expected overall survival (OS) of < 6 months. The SADAL study evaluated single-agent oral selinexor in patients with RR DLBCL and demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 29.1% with median duration of response (DOR) of 9.3 months. The analyses described here evaluated a number of subpopulations in order to understand how response correlates with survival outcomes in order to identify patients who could most optimally benefit from selinexor treatment. Median age was 67 years; 44.8% of patients were >= 70 years of age. The median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI 6.2, 13.7) at a median follow-up of 14.8 months. The median OS was not reached in patients with a CR or PR, while patients who did not respond have a median OS of 4.9 months (p < 0.0001). Patients < 70 years had an OS of 11.1 months compared with 7.8 months in patients >= 70 years. Among patients with or without prior ASCT, the median OS was 10.9 and 7.8 months, respectively. Among patients with disease refractory to the most recent DLBCL treatment regimen, the median OS was 7.0 months compared with 11.1 months for disease not refractory to the most recent treatment. In a patient population in which survival is expected to be < 6 months, treatment with single-agent oral selinexor was associated with a median survival of 9 months. Increased median OS observed in patients responding to selinexor was consistent across subgroups regardless of age, prior ASCT therapy, or refractory status. Randomized studies of selinexor in combination with a variety of other anti-DLBCL agents are planned.

AB  - Background: Trend analysis in cancer quantifies the incidence rate and explains the trend and pattern. Breast and cervical cancers are the two most common cancers among Indian women which contributed 39.4 % to the total cancer in India for the year 2020. This study aimed to report the time trends in cancer incidence of breast and cervical cancer using Age-Period-Cohort (APC) model from five Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) in India for the period of 1985-2014. Method: Age-Period-Cohort model was fitted to five PBCRs of Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Bhopal and Barshi rural for breast and cervical cancer for 25-74 age-groups. The Estimated Annual Percent Change (EAPC) was calculated. Rate Ratio (RR) of cohort effects were estimated with a constraint of period slope to be zero (p = 0) since cohort has a stronger association with incidence than period. Result: A significant increase was noted in breast cancer in all PBCRs (EAPC, Range: Delhi, 1.2 % to Bangalore, 2.7 %) while significant decrease in cervical cancer (EAPC, Range: Bangalore -2.5 % to Chennai, -4.6 %) from all the PBCRs including Barshi rural during the period. RR estimates for breast cancer showed increasing trend whereas cervical cancer showed decreasing trend in successive birth cohorts across all five PBCRs. Conclusion: In both breast and cervical cancers, a significant age, cohort and period effect was noted in Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. Despite period effect, the cohort effect was predominant and it may be attributed to the generational changes in risk factors among cancer breast and cervix.

AB  - Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) constitutes about 15%-20% of all TB patients, but accounts for 50% among HIV-coinfected. Confirmation of microbial diagnosis of EPTB is usually challenging. Areas covered: Availability of newer imaging modalities like (18)FDG-PET-CT and PET-MRI has facilitated precise anatomical localization of the lesions and mapping the extent of EPTB. The use of image- and endoscopy-guided invasive diagnostic methods has made procurement of tissue/body fluids for diagnostic testing possible. With the advent of universal drug-susceptibility testing, a rapid diagnosis of drug-resistance is now possible in EPTB. Drug-susceptible EPTB usually responds well to first-line anti-TB treatment; TB meningitis, bone and joint TB and lymph node TB requires longer durations of treatment. Expert opinion: Adjunctive use of corticosteroids in the initial period is recommended in the central nervous system and pericardial TB. Surgical intervention is helpful to obtain tissue samples for diagnosis. Adjunctive surgical treatment along with medical treatment is useful in treating complications like hydrocephalus, Pott's spine. Follow-up of EPTB patients is crucial as treatment period is usually prolonged, requires recognition of development of immune reconstitution and inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), monitoring of adverse events, serious adverse events like anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity, organ-related complications, and treatment adherence.

AB  - Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocamapal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is the most common form of drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). MTLE-HS is a distributed network disorder comprising of not only the hippocampus, but other anatomically related extrahippocampal regions. Excitatory synaptic transmission is differentially regulated in the hippocampal and extra-hippocampal regions of patients with MTLE-HS, but its mechanism not understood. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is known to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity through upregulation of NMDA receptors by phosphorylating NR2Asubunits. The present study is designed to investigate whether Cdk5 differentially regulates the excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and anterior temporal lobe (ATL) samples obtained from patients of MTLE-HS. We have measured the Cdk5 kinase activity and the protein levels of Cdk5, p-Cdk5, p35/p25, NR2A, pNR2A in the hippocampal and ATL samples obtained from patients with MTLE-HS. We have also determined the effect of roscovitine, a Cdk5 antagonist, on spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded from the hippocampal and ATL using patch-clamp technique. We observed significant increase in the expression of Cdk5, p-Cdk5, p35/p25, NR2A, pNR2A in the ATL samples as compared to the hippocampal samples. Cdk5 activity was significantly higher in ATL samples as compared to the hippocampal samples. Magnitude of reduction in the frequency of EPSCs by roscovitine in the ATL samples was higher than that in the hippocampal samples. Our studies suggest that Cdk5 differentially regulates excitatory synaptic activity in the hippocampal and ATL region of patients with MTLE-HS.

AB  - In cases of ovarian carcinoma, primary cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the standard treatment up to stage IIIB, but patient selection for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in selected cases is controversial. A total of 200 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were analyzed retrospectively, according to specific selection criteria. Primary CRS was performed in 95 patients (47.5%) and interval CRS after 3-6 cycles of NACT was performed in 105 patients (52.5%). After median follow-up of 35 months, 5-year overall survival was 53.7% in the upfront CRS group and 42.2% in the NACT group. Primary CRS is the standard in advanced stages of ovarian carcinoma, but in certain subset of patients, NACT is preferred. Identifying that group is challenging but feasible. Proper selection of patients is key to successful outcomes.

AB  - Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an effective tool for early and quick diagnosis of malignant and metastatic liver masses. However, diagnosing a benign liver tumor on cytology is a challenging task as they are rarely assessed on cytology and also due to the limitations of the procedure. Mesenchymal hamartoma is an uncommon benign pediatric liver tumor and difficult to diagnose on cytology. We describe here a case of a child who presented with a huge liver mass and clinical suspicion of hepatoblastoma. The child underwent blind FNA, and was diagnosed as mesenchymal hamartoma based on the cytological features. A biopsy was performed subsequently which confirmed the same and then he underwent surgical resection of the tumor. The patient had an uneventful recovery and is disease free on follow up.

AB  - Background Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients face disadvantages with higher risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, atypical manifestations, and associated multiple comorbidities. We describe patients' outcomes with symptomatic COVID-19 on MHD in a large cohort of patients from India. Methods Data were collected prospectively from hemodialysis units in 11 public and private hospitals between March 15, 2020, and July 31, 2020. The survival determinants were analyzed using stepwise backward elimination cox-regression analysis. Results Of the 263 total patients (mean age 51.76 +/- 13.63 years and males 173) on MHD with symptomatic COVID-19, 35 (13.3%) died. Those who died were older (p = 0.01), had higher frequency of diabetic kidney disease (p = 0.001), comorbidities (p = 0.04), and severe COVID-19 (p = 0.001). Mortality was higher among patients on twice-weekly MHD than thrice-weekly (p = 0.001) and dialysis through central venous catheter (CVC) as compared to arteriovenous fistula (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, CVC use (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.26-5.07, p = 0.009), disease severity (HR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.52-8.26, p = 0.003), and noninvasive ventilatory support (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25-0.99, p = 0.049) had significant effect on mortality. Conclusion The adjusted mortality risk of COVID-19 in MHD patients is high in patients associated with severe COVID-19 and patients having CVC as vascular access.

AB  - Objectives: Stroke constitutes a significant public health problem in developing countries. Caregivers provide an important support system for patient care but usually lack knowledge and skill to attend their stroke patients. We assessed whether a caregiverdirected educational intervention would reduce hospital-acquired complications and improve stroke patients' outcomes. Materials and methods: We randomly assigned two Neurology inpatient wards to receive either standard care or an educational intervention. The coprimary outcomes included incidence of hospital-acquired complications and inhospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the modified Rankin Scale and mortality at three months. Results: Among 164 patients recruited, 82 received intervention, and standard care each. The mean (Standard deviation) Glasgow coma scale of patients was 11.01 (3.4), and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale was 19.17 (8.54). The incidence of complications (72 in the intervention versus 81 in the control group; p=0.56) was not different. Ten patients (12.2%) in the intervention group and 16 (19.5%) in the control group (p=0.20) died in-hospital. Twenty patients (27.8%) in the intervention and twelve (18.2%) in the control group attained modified Rankin Scale 0-2 at three months (p=0.12). The mortality at three months (20 [24.4%] in the intervention versus 25 [30.5%] in the control group) was not different (p=0.38). The intervention group had fewer complications (42 versus 68 in the control group; p=0.01) during the initial ten days of hospital stay, but adjusted analysis revealed no difference. Conclusion: A structured educational intervention did not reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired complications, mortality, or morbidity. However, there was a trend towards fewer complications in the initial days of hospital stay. Extended hospital stay, caregiver fatigue, and dilution of the intervention over time might be reasons for the apparent lack of effect. Clinical trial registration-URL: http://www.ctri.nic.in.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to describe the lung sonographic findings of COVID-19 patients prospec-tively and investigate its association with disease severity. Methods: This study was conducted in an emergency department and included consecutively enrolled laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients. Lung sonography findings were described in all the included patients and analysed with respect to the clinical severity of the patients. Results: 106 patients were included in the study. Common sonographic findings in COVID-19 patients were pleu-ral line irregularity or shredding (70% of patients), followed by B - profile (59%), pleural line thickening (33%), occasional B - lines (26%), sub-pleural consolidations (35%), deep consolidations (6%), spared areas (13%), con-fluent B - lines or waterfall sign (14%) and pleural effusion (9%). These findings tended to be present more bilat-erally and in lower lung zones. Sonographic characteristics like bilateral lung involvement, B - profile, spared areas and confluent B - lines or waterfall sign were significantly associated (p < 0.01) with clinical severity (more frequent with increasing disease severity). Conclusion: The lung sonographic findings of COVID-19 were found more bilaterally and in lower lung zones, and specific findings like B - profile, pleural thickening, spared areas and confluent B - lines or waterfall sign were associated with severe COVID-19.

KW  - RHINOCEREBRAL MUCORMYCOSIS
KW  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Mucormycosis (MM) is a deadly opportunistic fungal infection and a large surge in COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) is occurring in India.
   Aim: Our aim was to delineate the clinico-epidemiological profile and identify risk factors of CAM patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED).
   Design: This was a retrospective, single-centre, observational study.
   Methods: We included patients who presented with clinical features or diagnosed MM and who were previously treated for COVID-19 in last 3 months of presentation (recent COVID-19) or currently being treated for COVID-19 (active COVID-19). Information regarding clinical features of CAM, possible risk factors, examination findings, diagnostic workup including imaging and treatment details were collected.
   Results: Seventy CAM patients (median age: 44.5 years, 60% males) with active (75.7%) or recent COVID-19 (24.3%) who presented to the ED in between 6 May 2021 and 1 June 2021, were included. A median duration of 20 days (interquartile range: 13.5-25) was present between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of CAM symptoms. Ninety-three percent patients had at least one risk factor. Most common risk factors were diabetes mellitus (70%) and steroid use for COVID-19 disease (70%). After clinical, microbiological and radiological workup, final diagnosis of rhino-orbital CAM was made in most patients (68.6%). Systemic antifungals were started in the ED and urgent surgical debridement was planned.
   Conclusion: COVID-19 infection along with its medical management have increased patient susceptibility to MM.

AB  - Background: In this study, a novel electromechanical robotic exoskeleton was developed for the rehabilitation of distal joints. The objective was to explore the functional MRI and the neurophysiological changes in cortical-excitability in response to exoskeleton training for a 9-year chronic stroke patient.
   Case-Report: The study involved a 52-year old female patient with a 9-year chronic stroke of the right hemisphere, who underwent 20 therapy sessions of 45 min each. Cortical-excitability and clinical-scales: Fugl-Mayer (FM), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Brunnstrom-Stage (BS), Barthel-Index (BI), Range of Motion (ROM), were assessed pre-and post-therapy to quantitatively assess the motor recovery.
   Clinical Rehabilitation Impact: Increase in FM wrist/hand by 6, BI by 10, and decrease in MAS by 1 were reported. Ipsilesional Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) (obtained using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) was increased by 98 mu V with a decrease in RMT by 6% and contralesional MEP was increased by 43 mu V with a decrease in RMT by 4%. Laterality Index of Sensorimotor Cortex (SMC) reduced in precentral- gyrus (from 0.152 to -0.707) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.203 to -0.632).
   Conclusion: The novel exoskeleton-based training showed improved motor outcomes, cortical excitability, and neuronal activation. The research encourages the further investigation of the potential of exoskeleton training.

AB  - Aim To assess the influence of occlusal and proximal deep carious lesions on the outcome of full pulpotomy performed in mandibular teeth with pulpal diagnosis of symptomatic partial irreversible pulpitis. Methodology Eighty deep carious mandibular molar teeth with clinical and radiographic diagnosis of symptomatic partial irreversible pulpitis without periapical rarefaction from patients of either gender between the age of 16-35 years were included. Depending upon the location of deep carious lesion, the teeth were distributed equally into occlusal (n = 40) and proximal caries groups (n = 40). Full pulpotomy was performed under local anaesthesia and aseptic conditions. The pulp tissue was removed until the root canal orifices, and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was applied to arrest pulpal bleeding. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was compacted over the radicular pulp. Teeth were restored with resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) and bulk-fill composite resin. Pre- and post-operative pain was assessed at 24, 48 and 72 h using a 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Patients were followed at 6 and 12 months for clinical and radiographic evaluation. Asymptomatic teeth without any radiographic evidence of periapical rarefaction were considered successful. The data were analysed using the Shapiro-Wilk W test, two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Pearson chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Kappa coefficient. The significance level was predetermined at p An intergroup comparison revealed that the pre- and post-operative pain scores at 24, 48 and 72 h were not significantly different (p > .05). At the end of follow-up period (12 months), success of full pulpotomy in occlusal and proximal caries group was 95% and 92.5%, respectively (p = .644). For both groups, the combined success rate of full pulpotomy was 93.75%. Conclusion The site of carious lesions (i.e., occlusal or proximal) did not affect the clinical and radiographic outcome of full pulpotomy performed in mature permanent mandibular teeth with symptomatic partial irreversible pulpitis.

AB  - Background and purpose In presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery, information is sourced from various imaging modalities to accurately localize the epileptogenic zone. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a newer noninvasive technique for localization. However, there is limited literature to evaluate if MEG provides additional advantage over the conventional imaging modalities in clinical decision making. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic added value of MEG in decision making before epilepsy surgery. Method This was a prospective observational study. Patients underwent 3 h of recording in a MEG scanner, and the resulting localizations were compared with other complimentary investigations. Added value of MEG (considered separately from high-density electroencephalography) was defined as the frequency of cases in which (i) the information provided by magnetic source imaging (MSI) avoided implantation of intracranial electrodes and the patient was directly cleared for surgery, and (ii) MSI indicated additional substrates for implantation of intracranial electrodes. Postoperative seizure freedom was used as the diagnostic reference by which to measure the localizing accuracy of MSI. Results A total of 102 patients underwent epilepsy surgery. MEG provided nonredundant information, which contributed to deciding the course of surgery in 33% of the patients, and prevented intracranial recordings in 19%. A total of 76% of the patients underwent surgical resection in sublobes concordant with MSI localization, and the diagnostic odds ratio for good (Engel I) outcome in these patients was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 0.68, 7.86; p = 0.183) after long-term follow-up of 36 months. Conclusion Magnetic source imaging yields additional useful information which can significantly alter as well as improve the surgical strategy for persons with epilepsy.

AB  - The peptide loading complex (PLC) is a multi-protein complex of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which optimizes major histocompatibility I (MHC1)-mediated export of intracellular high-affinity peptides. Whilst, the molecular biology of MHC1-mediated export is well supported by empirical data, the stoichiometry, kinetics and spatio-temporal profile of the participating molecular entities are a matter of considerable debate. Here, a low-affinity peptide-driven (LAPD)-model of MHC1-mediated high-affinity peptide export is formulated, implemented, analyzed and simulated. The model is parameterized in terms of the contribution of the shunt reaction to the concentration of exportable MHC1. Theoretical analyses and simulation studies of the model suggest that low-affinity peptides can bisect MHC1-mediated export of high-affinity peptides into time-dependent distinct "early"-and "late"-phases. The net exportable MHC1 (eM1 beta(t)) is a function of the retrograde (rM1 beta(t))-and anterograde (aM1 beta(t))-derived fractions. The "early"-phase is dominated by the contribution of the retrograde/recyclable (rM1 beta approximate to 61%, aM1 beta approximate to 39%) pathway to exportable MHC1, is characterized by Tapasin-mediated peptide-editing and is ATP- independent. The "late"-phase on the other hand, is characterized by de novo PLC-assembly, rapid disassembly and a significant contribution of the anterograde pathway to exportable MHC1 (rM1 beta approximate to 21%, aM1 beta approximate to 79%). The shunt reaction is rate limiting and may integrate peptide translocation with PLC-assembly/disassembly thereby, regulating peptide export under physiological and pathological (viral infections, dysplastic alterations) conditions.

AB  - Measurable residual disease (MRD) is an important parameter to predict outcome in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Two different approaches have been used for the assessment of MRD by multiparametric flow cytometry that include the "Leukemia Associated Aberrant Immunophenotype (LAIP)" and "Difference from Normal (DFN)" approach. In this retrospective study, we analyzed 539 samples obtained from 281 patients of which 258 were paired samples and the remaining 23 samples were from post-induction time point only, to explore the utility of baseline immunophenotype (IPT) for MRD assessment. Single-tube 10-color panel was used both at diagnosis and MRD time points. Out of 281 patients, 31.67% (n = 89) were positive and 68.32% (n = 192) were negative for MRD. Among 258 paired diagnostic and follow-up samples, baseline IPT was required in only 9.31% (24/258) cases which included cases with hematogone pattern and isolated dim to negative CD10 expression patterns. Comparison of baseline IPT with post-induction MRD positive samples showed a change in expression of at least one antigen in 94.04% cases. Although the immunophenotypic change in expression of various antigens is frequent in post-induction samples of B-ALL, it does not adversely impact the MRD assessment. In conclusion, the baseline IPT is required in less than 10% of B-ALL, specifically those with hematogone pattern and/or dim to negative expression of CD10. Hence, a combination of DFN and LAIP approach is recommended for reliable MRD assessment.

AB  - Introduction: : An efficient readily employable risk prognostication method is desirable for MM in settings where genomics tests cannot be performed owing to geographical/economical constraints. In this work, a new Modified Risk Staging (MRS) has been proposed for newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM) that exploits six easy-toacquire clinical parameters i.e. age, albumin, 132-microglobulin (132M), calcium, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hemoglobin. Materials and Methods: : MRS was designed using a training cohort of 716 NDMM patients of our inhouse MM Indian (MMIn) cohort and validated on MMIn (n=354) cohort and MMRF (n=900) cohort. K-adaptive partitioning (KAP) was used to find new thresholds for the parameters. Risk staging rules, obtained via training a J48 classifier, were used to build MRS. Results: : New thresholds were identified for albumin (3.6 g/dL), 132M (4.8 mg/L), calcium (11.13 mg/dL), eGFR (48.1 mL/min), and hemoglobin (12.3 g/dL) using KAP on the MMIn dataset. On the MMIn dataset, MRS outperformed ISS for OS prediction in terms of C-index, hazard ratios, and its corresponding p-values, but performs comparable in prediction of PFS. On both MMIn and MMRF datasets, MRS performed better than RISS in terms of C-index and p-values. A simple online tool was also designed to allow automated calculation of MRS based on the values of the parameters. Discussion: : Our proposed ML-derived yet simple staging system, MRS, although does not employ genetic features, outperforms RISS as confirmed by better separability in KM survival curves and higher values of C-index on both MMIn and MMRF datasets.

AB  - Giant left atrium is extremely rare in pediatric population. We hereby report a case of 4-year-old child with giant left atrium (LA) due to "non-rheumatic" mitral regurgitation (MR). The giant LA caused dextro-rotation of the heart, which immediately reverted to normal cardiac position after surgical repair. The case is reported for the unusual manifestation of giant LA as dextroversion.

AB  - A novel process design methodology for mitigating notch sensitivity in CNT/epoxy nanocomposite plates containing rectangular filleted notches has been presented in this work. Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs) were selectively oriented in target zones around the notch using a controlled transient non-uniform electric field to alleviate stress concentration effects during tensile loading. The improvement in overall tensile strength of the notched nanocomposite plates with three different orientations (0 degrees, 45 degrees and 90 degrees) with respect to the loading direction is demonstrated. A maximum improvement in tensile strength of similar to 55% in comparison to neat epoxy resin was observed in case of 45 degrees notch orientation by employing this technique. Full-field strains obtained using digital image correlation (DIC) during testing provide a detailed look at the deformation progression around the notch. Fractography analysis was performed to identify the mechanisms in support of the observations made. This study has wide ranging applications to polymer matrix composite laminates with notches.

AB  - Objective: The proportion of elderly patients with intracranial meningiomas is increasing as the life expectancy has improved. Increasing age is classically believed to be associated with higher perioperative morbidity and mortality in neurosurgical patients. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in 'PUBMED' and 'EMBASE' databases and reviewed all the studies comparing outcomes of surgery between young and elderly patients with intracranial meningiomas (IM). Data related to 3-month mortality rates, length of hospital stay and complications, preoperative status and comorbidity, meningioma size, location, histology, peritumoral edema, and grade of excision were extracted and analyzed. Results: Thirteen retrospective studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria out of the 893 reviewed articles. Pooled analysis showed that the 3-month mortality rate (4.65% versus 1.42%) and length of stay (10d versus 6.8d) for elderly patients were significantly higher as compared to the young population. The rates of cardio-respiratory complications (16.3% v/s 8.3%), intracranial hemorrhage (10.2% v/s 4.2%) and new-onset neurologic deficit (20.7% v/s 10.1%) were also significantly high in the elderly group as compared to the young patients. Moreover, a higher prevalence of associated comorbidities and poor performance score was noted in the elderly patients of IM. Conclusions: The overall mortality rate and rates of perioperative complications (cardio-respiratory, neurologic, intracranial hemorrhage) after surgery in elderly patients with IM patients are higher as compared to young patients and should be kept in mind when formulating treatment strategy for IM in this patient population.

AB  - The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of neurosurgery education, and it is now challenging to conduct routine sessions. Maintenance of essential standard education among novice neurosurgeons during the pandemic is of paramount importance. The aim of this study was the development of virtual modules and validation of its role to supplement the neurosurgery education program. We developed the virtual modules relevant to neuro-anatomy, neurosurgical procedures, instrumentation, and neurosurgical planning. These modules were virtually demonstrated to twenty-seven resident neurosurgeons through Cisco Webex online platform. They provided their rating on the aptness of virtual modules for different neurosurgery applications on various parameters using 10 points Likert scale. The parameters included quality, learning, confidence building capacity, usefulness, and overall satisfaction. The results obtained for each module were analysed and the average score was used for the comparison. The highest rating on quality was obtained by the neurosurgical instrumentation module. The highest rating for learning and confidence building capacity was given to neurosurgical procedure animation. The usefulness and overall satisfaction were highly rated for neurosurgical planning module. The results show that developed virtual modules provide an effective method to supplement the neurosurgery education program in the current scenario involving physical distancing and shift rearrangements. These virtual modules help in limiting the visits to operation room, anatomy and surgical training labs, and allow residents to learn online at their pace. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Lyme disease is endemic to parts of the Americas, Europe and Asia. However, only a handful of sporadic cases have been reported from India. In this study, we systematically evaluated the clinical and epidemiological features of Lyme disease in North India. Method: All samples were tested by using the standard two-tiered testing algorithm (STTA). Paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were used for demonstrating Borrelia burgdorferi specific intrathecal IgG antibody synthesis (AI). In addition, a commercial tick-borne bacterial flow chip (TBFC) system and a real-time PCR were also used to detect Borrelia species and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in patients who were positive by STTA. Results: The diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed in 18 (7.14%) of the 252 clinically suspected cases by STTA. Neurological involvement was reported in 14 (77.78%) patients, whereas joint and heart involvement was reported in five (27.78%) and three (16.67%) patients, respectively. Lymphocytic pleocytosis (median 37.5 cells/ mm3; range 12-175 cells/mm3) in the CSF was seen in 11 of 14 Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) patients. Intrathecal production of Borrelia specific IgG antibodies was demonstrated in 9 (64.28%, n = 14) patients, a highly specific finding for neuroborreliosis. Two patients (11.11%) were also found to be co-infected with human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Conclusions: The results of this study show clinical and laboratory evidence of endemic Lyme disease in North India and thus, highlight the importance for travel medicine practitioners and physicians to evaluate for Lyme disease in patients with compatible symptoms and a history of travel to tick risk areas.

AB  - Objective: Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) and delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) are a common cause of morbidity following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Statins have been shown to decrease CVS. The objective of this article was to ascertain the effect of statins on functional outcome and mortality following aneurysmal SAH by performing meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of different databases was performed to retrieve randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis with subgroup analysis and metaregression was done. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to determine if the cumulative sample size was appropriately powered for the obtained pooled effect values and to avoid random error. Results: Twelve articles were selected for meta-analysis. Pooled OR for the change in favorable outcome, mortality, CVS, DIND and elevated transaminases was 1.07 (p = 0.55), 0.78 (p = 0.17), 0.58 (p = 0.0004), 0.54 (p = 0.0293) and 0.68 (p = 0.1774) respectively. Further, subgroup analysis and metaregression showed that the use of different statin or dose did not result in significant variation in results in the parameters studied. TSA showed that more trials and patients are required to reach to a definitive conclusion regarding any effect on statins on functional outcome and mortality as the current studies neither reached the level of confidence nor crossed the futility boundary. Conclusion: Use of statins in patients with aneurysmal SAH resulted in marginal but non-significant favorable impact on functional outcome and mortality. TSA showed that more studies are required to get conclusive evidence in this regard.

AB  - Central airway obstruction presents as an emergency with dyspnea and stridor. Anesthetic management of rigid bronchoscopy-guided tracheal stenting is highly stimulating procedure requiring general anesthesia. But it may lead to life threatening airway obstruction and cardiovascular collapse after induction. Total intravenous anesthesia based on propofol-remifentanil is an optimal anesthetic technique, but remifentanil is not available in many countries. Although dexmedetomidine-ketamine has been used for procedural sedation, its use for rigid bronchoscopy in the setting of central airway obstruction has not been described in literature. We describe near ideal anesthetic technique for management of central airway obstruction using dexmedetomidine-ketamine combination. (C) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia.

AB  - Introduction: Assessment of myelodysplasia (MDS) by flow cytometry (FCM) includes elaborate panels, and interpretation is observer-dependent. This study evaluates single tube 10-color FCM in a test cohort of clinically suspected MDS patients. Methods: We analyzed fifty-six bone marrow (BM) samples from clinically suspected MDS patients in a morphology-blinded manner along with controls using a 10-color single tube flow cytometry. We analyzed the reproducibility of Ogata score and modified FCM scores, additionally incorporating the proportion of CD15, CD11b, CD56, and CD38MFI on CD34+CD19-cluster for each patient. Patients were grouped as proven-MDS, suspected-MDS, and non-MDS groups based on morphology and cytogenetics. Optimized multi-axial radarplots were also used to analyze maturation patterns in the granulocytic, monocytic, and blast progenitor compartments of proven-MDS cases and controls. Results: Flow cytometric abnormalities >3 were present in proven-MDS (n = 23) with a sensitivity and specificity of 78 % and 94 %, respectively, as per Ogata score. The addition of CD38 MFI to the score yielded sensitivity and specificity of 82 % and 88 %, respectively. Additional analysis of aberrant expression of CD15, CD11b, and CD56 increased the diagnostic power of the FCM score. A qualitative analysis of data also showed differences in maturation patterns in proven-MDS compared to the control group. Conclusion: Single tube 10-color FCM scoring, including Ogata score, modified-FCM scores, and radar plots pattern analysis, showed significant abnormalities in proven-MDS cases in this pilot study. Large databases, including FCM-scoring and pattern-based analysis for normal BM maturation, could be further validated and standardized for screening MDS.

AB  - Introduction: Stroke is the most common cause of epilepsy in the adult population. Post-stroke seizures (PSSs) are classified into early-onset seizures (ES) and late-onset (LS). ES can significantly affect the clinical outcome and occurrence of LS. Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of acute ischemic stroke patients between June 2018 and May 2020 in a neurology unit at a tertiary hospital. We screened all acute stroke patients and included consecutive patients older than 18 years of age, presenting with acute, first-ever neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. We excluded patients with a previous stroke, transient ischemic attacks, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, prior history of seizures, or any other epileptogenic comorbidity. ES were classified as spontaneous seizures occurring within 1 week of the stroke. The main outcome assessed was the occurrence of ES. The secondary outcome was to determine predictors of ES and create an ES prediction score. Results: We screened 432 patients; of them, 291 were enrolled. ES occurred in 37 patients (12.7%). Cortical location (OR: 4.2), large artery disease subtype (OR: 2.9), mRS at presentation (OR: 1.4), use of anticoagulants (OR: 2.6), and hypertension (OR: 0.3) were significantly associated with the occurrence of ES. Patients with ES had a statistically significant worse clinical outcome at 3 months follow-up (P = 0.0072). Conclusion: We could formulate an ES prediction tool using the following components: (a) cortical location, (b) large vessel stroke, (c) mRS at admission, (d) anticoagulant use, and (e) presence of hypertension. This tool might help in treating patients at high risk for ES with prophylactic ASD, thereby preventing seizures and their complications.

AB  - Background: Screw diameters are currently available based on the literature available for the Western population. No data are available in such a large number of patients for the Indian population.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to define the average pedicle size available and to determine the angulation for placement of screws for C2 pedicle in the Indian population. We also try to determine the pedicle screw diameter which can be used universally in most Indian patients, considering the pedicle dimensions.
   Material and Methods: Retrospective morphometric analysis of CT scans of 247 patients (152 M, 95 F) was done to calculate the C2 pedicle width (PW), pedicle height (PH), pedicle length (PL), pedicle transverse angle (PTA) and the craniocaudal angulation (CCA) of the C2 pedicle.
   Results: Mean PW in females was 5.3 mm and in males it was 5.9 mm. This difference was statistically significant. The mean PH in the study population was 8.9 mm, while the mean PL was 29.7 mm. The mean PTA was 40.0 degrees and the CCA was 28.4 degrees.
   Conclusion: This is a morphometric analysis of the C2 pedicle which provides information for the surgeons to determine the safe site of entry and trajectory for the screw implantation. We conclude that a screw diameter of 2.7 mm can be safely implanted in a vast majority of the patient population.

AB  - Purpose: Lamellar corneal grafts have revolutionized the management of corneal blindness by replacing only the disease specific corneal layers. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study in literature describing the outcomes of bilateral lamellar keratoplasty in the Indian population. The aim of this work was to study the demographic profile, surgical outcomes, and quality of life in patients who underwent bilateral lamellar keratoplasty and to assess the correlation between these three. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 47 patients who underwent bilateral deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) (n = 31) or descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) (n = 16) with a minimum follow-up of 6 months after the second surgery. Demographic parameters were collected by interview, surgical outcomes by clinical examination, and quality of life by a questionnaire. Results: A total of 47 patients were evaluated, women 42.56%, (n = 20) and men 57.44% (n = 27) with 38.3% being in 18-30 years age group and 23.4% above 60 years; 17.02% patients had a good socioeconomic status (score >60) and 61.70% had poorer socioeconomic status (score <50). Quality of life score (VR-QoL) was >= 50 in 82.9% patients and >= 70 in 14.89%. No significant association existed between VR-QoL scores and demographic factors. However, statistically significant association existed between VR-QoL and age of patient (P < 0.05), postoperative vision (P <= 0.05), and contrast sensitivity (P <= 0.01). Conclusion: Bilateral lamellar corneal grafts provide satisfactory visual outcomes compatible with day-to-day functioning. VR-QoL has a direct correlation to the age, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and inverse correlation with lenticule thickness in DSAEK and residual bed thickness in DALK.

AB  - The Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) undertook a critical review of the recent advances in bladder neoplasia with a focus on issues relevant to the practicing surgical pathologist for the understanding and effective reporting of bladder cancer, emphasizing particularly on the newly accumulated evidence post-2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The work is presented in 2 manuscripts. Here, in the first, we revisit the nomenclature and classification system used for grading flat and papillary urothelial lesions centering on clinical relevance, and on dilemmas related to application in routine reporting. As patients of noninvasive bladder cancer frequently undergo cystoscopy and biopsy in their typically prolonged clinical course and for surveillance of disease, we discuss morphologies presented in these scenarios which may not have readily applicable diagnostic terms in the WHO classification. The topic of inverted patterns in urothelial neoplasia, particularly when prominent or exclusive, and beyond inverted papilloma has not been addressed formally in the WHO classification. Herein we provide a through review and suggest guidelines for when and how to report such lesions. In promulgating these GUPS recommendations, we aim to provide clarity on the clinical application of these not so uncommon diagnostically challenging situations encountered in routine practice, while also importantly advocating consistent terminology which would inform future work.

AB  - Background Near-patient access to appropriate tests is a major obstacle for the efficient diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and associated drug resistance.
   Methods We recently developed the "TB Concentration & Transport" kit for bio-safe, ambient-temperature transportation of dried sputum on Trans-Filter, and the "TB DNA Extraction" kit for DNA extraction from Trans-Filter for determining drug resistance by DNA sequencing. In the present study, we evaluated the compatibility of Kit-extracted DNA with Hain's line probe assays (LPAs), which are endorsed by National TB programmes for the detection of drug resistance in sputum collected from presumptive multidrug-resistant TB patients (n=207).
   Results Trans-Filter-extracted DNA was seamlessly integrated with the LPA protocol (Kit-LPA). The sensitivity of Kit-LPA for determining drug resistance was 83.3% for rifampicin (95% CI 52-98%), 77.7% for isoniazid (95% CI 52-94%), 85.7% for fluoroquinolones (95% CI 42-100%) and 66.6% for aminoglycosides (95% CI 9-99%), with a specificity range of 93.7% (95% CI 87-97) to 99.1% (95% CI 95-100) using phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) as a reference standard. A high degree of concordance was noted between results obtained from Kit-LPA and LPA (99% to 100% (. value: 0.83-1.0)).
   Conclusions This study demonstrates successful integration of our developed kits with LPA. The adoption of these kits across Designated Microscopy Centres in India can potentially overcome the existing challenge of transporting infectious sputum at controlled temperature to centralised testing laboratories and can provide rapid near-patient cost-effective "Universal DST" services to TB subjects residing in remote areas.

AB  - Aim: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive neoplasms of the central nervous system with dismal survival. In recent years, different variants of GBM have been described in the literature. GBM with areas of neuroectodermal differentiation (GBM-PNET) is a relatively new entity in GBM. Presence of the neuroectodermal component increases the propensity of systemic dissemination as with other intracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). The optimal treatment for these patients remains a controversy, with authors reporting local radiotherapy to craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapy. We intend to analyze the pattern of care for GBM with neuroectodermal component.
   Materials and Methods: We retrieved data of four patients with GBM-PNET treated in our institute; data were also retrieved from published series to derive treatment and outcome results.
   Results: In this series, we report the outcome of a series of four patients of GBM-PNET treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide. All but one patient underwent gross total resection of the tumor. Adjuvant hypofractionated radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide was used in all cases. The median follow-up was 12.9 months in the present series. One patient experienced local recurrence 18 months after the treatment. A review of published literature on GBM-PNET was done; studies with details of patient outcome were used for an independent analysis. Twenty-three patients were identified, and the pooled analysis revealed a median progression free and overall survival of 10 and 25, months respectively. Extent of surgery, local radiation vs. craniospinal irradiation, and age at presentation had no impact on the survival.
   Conclusion: GBM PNET is a new entity with only few cases reported so far. Clinical behavior and treatment outcome of these tumors are not different from conventional GBM. However, these patients are at higher risk of CSF dissemination. Hence, an individualized treatment approach is best suited.

AB  - Introduction: There is a strong association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and morbid obesity. Methods: Two hundred and eleven morbidly obese patients operated between September 2007 and June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent pre-operative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and assessment by reflux symptomatic score questionnaire. Results: Of the total 211 patients, 156 (73.94%) were females; mean body mass index of the cohort was 46.23 +/- 3.1 kg/m2. There was no evidence of Barrett's oesophagus or malignancy on pre-operative endoscopy. 63.04% of the patients (n = 133) in the study cohort had normal endoscopy. Pre-operative evaluation by reflux symptom score (RSS) questionnaire revealed no evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in 61.13% of patients (n = 129). The total number of patients with symptoms was 82 (38.86%). They were further divided into two categories based on severity of symptoms, namely, mild + moderate 60 (73.17%) and severe + very severe 22 (26.83%). From the cohort of symptomatic patients, the sub-cohort of 60 mild + moderate symptomatic patients had equal number of patients with normal 30 (50%) and abnormal endoscopy 30 (50%). In the sub-cohort of patients with severe + very severe symptoms (n = 22; 26.83%), endoscopy was abnormal in 6 (27.7%) patients. Whereas, out of 129 (61.13%) asymptomatic patients, one-third (n = 42) had abnormal endoscopy. The weighted kappa score was used between pre-operative endoscopic findings and RSS was statistically not significant (k - 0.0986). Conclusion: Pre-operative endoscopy is a must in all bariatric patients as significant percentage of asymptomatic patients can have abnormal endoscopy and vice versa.

AB  - Formal brainstem reflex testing remains one of the most important procedures in identification and evaluation of patients who meet clinical criteria for brainstem death. Early identification of such patients is critical since willing donors may contribute to the organ donation process. During the first two waves of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, organ transplantation from brainstem dead donors has declined significantly due to several reasons, including perceived increased risk of virus transmission to both physicians as well as patients as well as lack of awareness regarding donor workup in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose
   Development of a novel theranostic radiopharmaceutical for estrogen receptor, expressing unresectable primary and metastatic breast cancers.
   Methods
   Tamoxifen was radiolabeled with Rhenium-188 (Re-188) through tricarbonyl core. Radiolabeled complex was characterized by (1)proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Various quality control tests such as sterility, apyrogenicity, and radiochemical purity (RCP) were performed to assess the suitability of the radiopharmaceutical for intravenous administration. In-vitro cell culture studies were performed for cytotoxic assessment. In addition to this, exposure due to different doses of Re-188-tricarbonyl tamoxifen was also calculated.
   Results
   Re-188-tricarbonyl and Re-188-tricarbonyl tamoxifen showed more than 99% RCP. Sample was found to be sterile and pyrogens levels were within the permissible limit. Re-188-tricarbonyl tamoxifen was successfully characterized by MALDI-TOF and H-1-NMR spectroscopy. Re-188 (1.480 MBq) and tamoxifen (0.027 or 0.054 mu M) individually showed 36 and 70% cell death, respectively. However, radiolabeled complex (Re-188-tricarbonyl tamoxifen) with the same amount of radioactivity (1.480 MBq) increased the cell death to more than 90% with one-fifth to one-tenth molar concentration of tamoxifen (0.0054 mu M).
   Conclusion
   Re-188-tricarbonyl tamoxifen can be synthesized in-house in radiopharmacy lab. Radionuclide therapy with Re-188-tricarbonyl tamoxifen can be given using 10 times less amount of tamoxifen as compared to cold tamoxifen.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Janus kinase-1-preferential inhibitor filgotinib versus placebo or tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite ongoing treatment with methotrexate (MTX).
   Methods This 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled phase III trial evaluated once-daily oral filgotinib in patients with RA randomised 3:3:2:3 to filgotinib 200 mg (FIL200) or filgotinib 100 mg (FIL100), subcutaneous adalimumab 40 mg biweekly, or placebo (through week 24), all with stable weekly background MTX. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) at week 12. Additional efficacy outcomes were assessed sequentially. Safety was assessed from adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.
   Results The proportion of patients (n=1755 randomised and treated) achieving ACR20 at week 12 was significantly higher for FIL200 (76.6%) and FIL100 (69.8%) versus placebo (49.9%; treatment difference (95% CI), 26.7% (20.6% to 32.8%) and 19.9% (13.6% to 26.2%), respectively; both p<0.001). Filgotinib was superior to placebo in key secondary endpoints assessing RA signs and symptoms, physical function and structural damage. FIL200 was non-inferior to adalimumab in terms of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with C reactive protein <= 3.2 at week 12 (p<0.001); FIL100 did not achieve non-inferiority. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were comparable among active treatment arms.
   Conclusions Filgotinib improved RA signs and symptoms, improved physical function, inhibited radiographic progression and was well tolerated in patients with RA with inadequate response to MTX. FIL200 was non-inferior to adalimumab.

AB  - The Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) undertook a critical review of the recent advances in bladder cancer focusing on important topics of high interest for the practicing surgical pathologist and urologist. This review represents the second of 2 manuscripts ensuing from this effort. Herein, we address the effective reporting of bladder cancer, focusing particularly on newly published data since the last 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. In addition, this review focuses on the importance of reporting bladder cancer with divergent differentiation and variant (subtypes of urothelial carcinoma) histologies and the potential impact on patient care. We provide new recommendations for reporting pT1 staging in diagnostic pathology. Furthermore, we explore molecular evolution and classification, emphasizing aspects that impact the understanding of important concepts relevant to reporting and management of patients.

KW  - Haemorrhage
KW  - Facial Fracture
KW  - Embolisation
KW  - INJURIES
AB  - Maxillofacial injuries are usually not life-threatening and do not get priority over other associated injuries. However, some maxillofacial injuries with active oral or nasal bleeding need immediate management due to threatened airway and blood loss. In the case of major active vascular bleeding, measures such as local pressure, anterior nasal packing, posterior nasal packing, and balloon tamponade are ineffective. In these cases, angiography and transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) are used to treat life-threatening haemorrhage caused by maxillofacial trauma. We analysed the medical records of 39 patients with severe maxillofacial trauma and life-threatening haemorrhage that was a result of intractable oral or nasal bleeding. These patients were considered for TAE from January 2010 to December 2019. A total of 1668 patients was admitted, out of which 39 (2.3%) had severe maxillofacial injuries with life-threatening oral or nasal bleeding and underwent TAE. Out of a total of 39 patients, 38 were male and one female. Ages ranged from 16 to 65 years. Road traffic injury was the most common cause of injury (79.5%), Lefort I and II were the most common facial fractures, and traumatic brain injury was the most common associated injury. Embolisation and bleeding control were done successfully in all 39 patients with no procedure-related complications. A total of 17 deaths during the study period were due to severe traumatic brain injuries or haemorrhagic shock. (c) 2020 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses specific components of a person's immune system to fight diseases. This is usually done by stimulating or assisting one's immune system is attacking the offending agent - for instance, in the case of cancer - the target of immunotherapy will be cancer cells. Some types of immunotherapy are also called biologic therapy or biotherapy. One of the fundamental challenges that a living cell encounters are to accurately copy its genetic material to daughter cells during every single cell cycle. When this process goes haywire, genomic instability ensues, and genetic alterations ranging from nucleotide changes to chromosomal translocations and aneuploidy occur. Genomic instability arising out of DNA structural changes (indels, rearrangements, etc.,) can give rise to mutations predisposing to cancer. Cancer prevention refers to actions taken to mitigate the risk of getting cancer. The past decade has encountered an explosive rate of development of anticancer therapy ranging from standard chemotherapy to novel targeted small molecules that are nearly cancer specific, thereby reducing collateral damage. However, a new class of emerging therapy aims to train the body's defense system to fight against cancer. Termed as "cancer immunotherapy" is the new approach that has gained worldwide acceptance. It includes using antibodies that bind to and inhibit the function of proteins expressed by cancer cells or engineering and boosting the person's own T lymphocytes to target cancer. In this review, we summarized the recent advances and developments in cancer immunotherapy along with their shortcoming and challenges.

KW  - SURGERY
AB  - Background: Hemispheric disconnection represents a challenging and major epilepsy surgical procedure. This procedure in experienced hands offers excellent results in terms of seizure outcomes, especially for hemispheric pathologies such as Rasmussen's encephalitis, hemispheric dysplasias, hemimegalencephaly. The technique of hemispherotomy has witnessed various modifications over the years, beginning from anatomical hemispherectomy to the current era of minimally invasive functional hemispheric disconnections.
   Objective: This study aimed to describe the technique of performing endoscopic vertical hemispherotomy using interhemispheric corridor developed by the senior author.
   Materials and Methods: A 12-year-old girl with seizure onset at the age of 10 years presented with an aura of fear and nausea followed by tonic deviation of eyes to the right and blinking with speech arrest. There were tonicclonic movements of the right-sided limbs along with ictal spitting and occasional deviation of the angle of mouth to the right. The patient had loss of awareness for the event along with postictal confusion lasting few minutes.
   Results: Video electroencephalography (VEEG) revealed left parietocentral and left temporal localization. Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain over 3 years revealed progressive left hemispheric changes suggestive of Rasmussen's encephalitis. The patient underwent left-sided endoscopic hemispherotomy. At 2 years follow-up, the patient is seizure-free (ILAE [International League Against Epilepsy] Class 1).
   Conclusion: Endoscopic hemispherotomy using the interhemispheric approach is an elegant, minimally invasive, reproducible, safe, and efficacious technique.

AB  - An extensive knowledge of the origin and course of testicular arteries (TAs) is indispensable during various surgical procedures such as renal transplant, intra-abdominal surgeries, and even in orthopedic surgeries such as spine surgery. With the advent of new intra-abdominal therapeutic and diagnostic techniques, the anatomy of TAs has assumed much more significance. Although the variations of the testicular vein are well documented, the variations of the TA are not so frequent in incidence. We report a rare case of bilateral aberrant origin of the TA from polar renal arteries. Though anomalies of the polar arteries supplying the kidney are common, bilateral origin of TAs from them is a rare presentation. We also discuss its developmental basis. Such anomalies if left unnoticed will lead to serious intraoperative complications during procedures on retroperitoneal organs. Any damage to the TAs will compromise the function of the gonads.

AB  - Aims
   To describe the clinical, radiological, and functional outcomes in patients with isolated congenital thoracolumbar kyphosis who were treated with three-column osteotomy by posterior-only approach.
   Methods
   Hospital records of 27 patients with isolated congenital thoracolumbar kyphosis undergoing surgery at a single centre were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent deformity correction which involved a three-column osteotomy by single-stage posterior-only approach. Radiological parameters (local kyphosis angle (KA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), C7 sagittal vertical axis (C7 SVA), T1 slope, and pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis (PI-LL)), functional scores, and clinical details of complications were recorded.
   Results
   The mean age of the study population was 13.9 years (SD 6.4). The apex of deformity was in thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar spine in five, 14, and eight patients, respectively. The mean operating time was 178.4 minutes (SD 38.5) and the mean operative blood loss was 701.8 ml (SD 194.4). KA (preoperative mean 70.8 degrees (SD 21.6 degrees) vs final follow-up mean 24.7 degrees (SD 18.9 degrees); p < 0.001) and TK (preoperative mean -1.48 degrees (SD 41.23 degrees) vs final follow-up mean 24.28 degrees (SD 17.29 degrees); p = 0.005) underwent a significant change with surgery. Mean Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-22r) score improved after surgical correction (preoperative mean 3.24 (SD 0.37) vs final follow-up mean 4.28 (SD 0.47); p < 0.001) with maximum improvement in self-image and mental health domains. The overall complication rate was 26%, including two neurological and five non-neurological complications. Permanent neurological deficit was noted in one patient.
   Conclusion
   Deformity correction employing three-column osteotomies by a single-stage posterior-only approach is safe and effective in treating isolated congenital thoracolumbar kyphosis.

AB  - The anterior approach to cervical spine is a common surgical approach used in spinal surgeries, usually done under fluoroscopic guidance. However, in certain situations like in patients where the area of interest is lower cervical spine, it is not possible to visualize the area of interest with fluoroscopy. The use of intraoperative navigation is very helpful in these scenarios. However, intraoperative navigation is used very sparingly in the anterior approaches to cervical spine. This might be due to the lack of a proper place to fix the reference frame on the anterior aspect of cervical spine. We present our way of using intraoperative navigation during anterior approach to cervical spine.

AB  - Background: The Literature is Limited on staphylococcal infection in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) from tropical countries. We aimed to study the risk factors and clinical course of children with CF infected with Staphylococcus aureus.
   Methods: In this chart review we compared demographic, clinical and spirometry characteristics in CF children with S. aureus alone (group A), both S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (group B) and P. aeruginosa alone (group C) colonization.
   Results: We included 79 cases (group A, 22; group B, 19; group C, 38). There was no difference in age of onset of symptoms, age of diagnosis, age of first isolation and spirometry parameters before colonization between the groups. The median duration of follow-up was shorter in group A. After colonization, children in group A and group B had significantly Lower mean Shwachman and Kulczycki (SK) scores (44.7 +/- 5.4 and 40.8 +/- 5.8, respectively) compared with group C (49.9 +/- 6.8). Pulmonary exacerbations and hospitalizations were significantly greater in the combined group. After colonization, group A had a significant deterioration in SK score and forced vital capacity (FVC).
   Conclusions: S. aureus colonization, especially in combination with P. aeruginosa, in children with CF was associated with worsening of FVC and clinical severity score and increased pulmonary exacerbations.

AB  - PURPOSE
   We have described unidentified bright objects of spleen (UBOS), a hitherto undescribed entity, as hyperdense areas on arterial phase (AP) computed tomography (CT) seen in relation to splenic lacerations and are isodense to the normal parenchyma on portal venous phase with no correlate on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). UBOS mimic splenic vascular injuries like active contrast extravasation and pseudoaneurysm and need to be differentiated from them as it would have implications on patient management. We undertook this study to identify CT features of UBOS that can differentiate them from splenic vascular injuries and to calculate their diagnostic accuracy.
   METHODS
   This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethical committee and the need for informed consent was waived. Patients with splenic injury who had undergone dual-phase CT and DSA were included. All the lesions that were hyperdense on AP were evaluated for their outline, their relation to the adjacent/parallel margins of a laceration (margin sign), string of beads appearance, and the presence of adjacent normal parenchyma (adjacent parenchyma sign). The Hounsfield unit (HU) of the lesion and the aorta on the AP were also noted. The diagnostic accuracy of various signs for distinguishing UBOS from splenic vascular injuries was calculated using DSA as the reference standard.
   RESULTS
   Of 48 patients, 5 were excluded due to suboptimal quality of the examination or a time difference of more than 6 hours between the CT and DSA. A total of 54 hyperdense lesions were detected on AP in 43 patients. These were classified as vascular injuries (pseudoaneurysm, n=11; active contrast extravasation, n=11) and UBOS (n=32) based on DSA. The margin sign, string of beads appearance, and ill-defined outline had high specificity (95%, 86%, and 82%, respectively) but low sensitivity (50%, 65%, and 63%, respectively). The adjacent parenchyma sign had a moderate sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 77%, respectively. ROC analysis showed that a difference of 50 HU between the aorta and the lesion had a high sensitivity and specificity of 88.9% and 90.6%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.90.
   CONCLUSION
   An attenuation difference of over 50 HU between the aorta and the lesion and the presence of normal adjacent parenchyma had the highest diagnostic accuracy, while an ill-defined outline, string of beads appearance, and margin sign had high specificity but low sensitivity for differentiating UBOS from splenic vascular injuries.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed to evaluate serum otolin-1 levels in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and to compare these levels with healthy individuals. Method This was a case-control study. After obtaining institutional ethical committee clearance, the serum level of otolin-1 was calculated in adult individuals (18-75 years old) who were divided into group 1 (patients presenting with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) and group 2 (healthy patients without benign paroxysmal positional vertigo as the control group). Data analysis was carried out to compare the serum levels in the cases and controls. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 70 age-matched individuals (cases, n = 40; controls, n = 30) were included in the study. The mean serum level of otolin-1 was 636.8 pg/ml (range, 259-981 pg/ml) in the group of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and 236.2 pg/ml (range, 189-370 pg/ml) in the control group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0000). Conclusion The serum levels of otolin-1 in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are significantly higher compared with individuals without benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

AB  - Background In the early 1980s, a preservative containing a mixture of methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI) and methylisothiazolinone (MI) in a ratio of 3:1 was introduced. This mixture (mix) has been patch tested at 100 ppm (0.01%) worldwide and at 200 ppm (0.02%) in Sweden since 1986 and also in the European baseline series since 2014. Objective A new aqueous mix of MCI 0.015% and MI 0.2% was compared with patch testing with the 2 aqueous baseline preparations of MCI/MI 0.02% and MI 0.2%. Methods Four thousand three hundred ninety-seven patients with dermatitis in 12 International Contact Dermatitis Research Group dermatology departments from 3 continents were patch tested simultaneously with the 3 preparations. Results The frequency of positive patch tests to the allergens varied between 0% and 26.7% in the 12 test centers. The new mixture MCI/MI 0.215% in aqua (aq) detected significantly more patients with MCI/MI allergy than both MCI/MI 0.02% aq (P < 0.001) and MI 0.2% aq (P < 0.001) alone and combined. Conclusions The results favor replacing the preparations MCI/MI 0.02% aq and MI 0.2% aq with the mixture MCI/MI 0.215% aq in the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group baseline series.

AB  - Objective
   Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Higher disease activity has been associated with increased rates of mortality in PsA. The objectives of the study were to describe the trends for hospitalisations from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) amongst patients with underlying PsA.
   Methods
   All adult hospitalisations for AMI with and without PsA from 2004-2014 in the nationwide in-patient sample (NIS) database were captured. A propensity score-matching model was also developed for comparative outcome analysis and reduce the potential of selection bias.
   Results
   From 2004 to 2014, 4778 unmatched weighted hospitalisations were estimated for AMI with underlying PsA. Mean age for hospitalisations with AMI and PsA was lower (average age in years: 63.1 +/- 115 vs. 675 +/- 14.4; p-value <0.05), with a higher percentage being males (62.7% vs. 60.4%, p-value <0.05). When adjusted for confounding factors, overall mortality was found to be significantly lower in hospitalisations with PsA (2 21% vs. 5.8%, p-value <0.05). After propensity matching analyses, in-hospital mortality in PsA cohort continued to be significantly lower when compared to the matched cohort without PsA (1.79% vs. 5.71%, Odds ratio=0.3, p-value 0.002).
   Conclusion
   The study suggests that overall rates of mortality in AMI with underlying PsA are lower compared to those without PsA. A decrease in cardiovascular mortality from AMI in PsA reflects that even though PsA is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, the trends in mortality are similar or even better than those for the general population.

AB  - Introduction: Endoscopic thyroidectomy is an advanced procedure and has a long learning curve. Most commonly employed approach is combined axillary-breast approach (ABA). Recently, transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) is being popularised as a scarless procedure. However, it is not established whether TOETVA or ABA approach is better to begin with. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the initial experience of TOETVA and ABA with respect to difficulties and outcomes. Methodology: A prospective non-randomised interventional study was conducted including the initial ten patients in each group who underwent hemithyroidectomy for benign solitary thyroid nodule. Sigma plot version 12.3 was used for the statistical analysis. Results: All the patients were female and comparable with respect to age (33.2 vs. 28.2 years) and size of nodule (2.7 vs. 3 cm) (TOETVA vs. ABA). The operative time (121 vs. 138.5 min, P = 0.34) and blood loss (50 vs. 60 ml, P = 0.9) were similar in both the groups. Even though the flap raising time was significantly less with TOETVA group (29.3 vs. 47.2 min, P < 0.001), it was associated with more difficulty in approaching upper pole (P = 0.02) and lower pole (P < 0.001), more intra-operative events (30% vs. 10%, P = 0.58) and conversions to open (20% vs. 10%, P = 1). Similarly, post-operative pain scoring was more with TOETVA (3 vs. 2, P = 0.04). Hospital stay was similar in both the groups (2.5 vs. 3 days, P = 1). Patients in both the groups had both overall and cosmetic satisfaction. Conclusions: Axillary-breast approach should be preferred to start learning the endoscopic thyroidectomy, as it is easier and safer than transoral endoscopic vestibular approach.

AB  - Purpose: While two-thirds of epilepsy patients can become seizure free on medical treatment, poor adherence to medication is a major problem to sustained remission and functional restoration. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of antiepileptic drug (AED) non-adherence. Methods: We conducted a subgroup analysis based on results that emerged from a single center, cross-sectional study. Patients who were 18 years or older were included. The 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used to measure adherence to AED (s). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict factors associated with AED non-adherence. Results: A total of 268 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and were included in this subgroup analysis. Among the participants, 81 (30%) were non-adherent to medication. Three factors associated with non-adherence were AED polytherapy [OR: 4.5 (2.1-9.5) P = 0.001], drug related adverse events [OR: 3.9 (2.1-7.3) P = 0.001], and treatment duration exceeding 3 years [OR: 2.6 (1.3-5.0) P = 0.003]. Conclusion: About one-third patients were not compliant with their medication. If the treatment of patients is restricted to monotherapy as far as possible and patients are educated about duration of treatment and possible adverse effects of AEDs, non-adherence may be reduced.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated special considerations in the management of diseases. The way presence of pre-existing diseases or treatment for it predisposes to, alters course of, and changes the management of COVID-19, is of relevance and is being extensively studied. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is unique in that it is an autoimmune disease mandating treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, as well as a liver disease with potential for varying degrees of underlying fibrosis. The use of immunosuppressive drugs could alter the risk of acquiring COVID-19, the clinical course and severity of COVID-19 and the degree of underlying liver fibrosis could alter the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. In this review, we try to summarize key areas relevant in understanding and improving the clinical care of patients with AIH in the current pandemic. Special considerations required in the management of patients with AIH in COVID-19 hotspots have been outlined based on the current evidence.

AB  - Aims To evaluate incidence of toxic optic neuropathy in patients receiving ethambutol (EMB) for 6 months and to identify its early indicators. Methods We included 50 patients on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) including EMB (HRE regimen) based on total body weight for 6 months. Best-corrected visual acuity (ETDRS), colour vision (Ishihara pseudo-isochromatic plates), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson chart), Humphrey visual field analysis (HVF 30-2 SITA FAST), pattern visual evoked response (VER) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) for ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) analysis were assessed at baseline and at 2, 4 and 6 months after starting ATT. Results Mean age of the patients was 36.5 +/- 14.7 years with male:female ratio of 2.5:1. Mean daily dosage of EMB was 17.5 +/- 1.3 mg/kg/day. No significant change was observed in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision and mean or pattern SD on HVF at 6 months. Significant increase in VER latency of >2 SD (>125 ms) was observed in 46% eyes on follow-up indicating subclinical toxicity. Significant loss of mean RNFL (from 100.79 +/- 16.05 mu m to 89.96 +/- 13.79 mu m) and GCIPL thickness (from 83.1 +/- 5.60 mu m to 79.85 +/- 6.45 mu m) was observed at 6 months (p=0.001 for both). Patients with subclinical toxicity had significantly greater damage in temporal RNFL quadrant, supero-nasal and infero-nasal GCIPL sectors compared with others. Conclusion The incidence of clinical EMB optic neuropathy was <2%, though subclinical damage in the form of increase in VER latency, and decrease in RNFL and GCIPL on OCT was seen in 46% eyes.

AB  - Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare neurometabolic condition characterized by progressive choreoathetosis, intellectual disability, and peculiar manifestations like self-mutilation. Occasional case reports in adults have suggested an association between Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and hypercoagulability; however, no such report of either a venous or arterial stroke in children with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome exists in literature. We present a 3-year-old boy with global developmental delay, dystonic posturing, choreoathetoid movements, and self-mutilation involving fingers and lips. He had acute worsening of sensorium, recurrent seizures, and opisthotonous posturing. A diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome was confirmed by extremely low hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme levels. In view of an acute neurological deterioration, magnetic resonance imaging brain and magnetic resonance venogram were done that showed sagittal and left transverse venous sinus thrombosis. This case is the first case report of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in a child with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome. It further strengthens the association between hypercoagulability and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

AB  - Celiac disease (CeD) is a systemic, immune-mediated enteropathy, which is triggered by gluten protein in genetically susceptible individuals. CeD, once thought to be an uncommon disease, is now recognized to affect approximately 40-60 million people globally. While CeD is now well reported from a few Asian countries such as India, China, Pakistan, and Middle Eastern countries; it is still believed to be uncommon in the rest of Asia. Gluten-related diseases other than CeD, like non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are also emerging globally. CeD and NCGS may present with either intestinal or extra-intestinal symptoms, and a proportion of them have overlapping symptoms with irritable bowel syndrome. Hence, many of them are misdiagnosed as having irritable bowel syndrome in clinical practice. In this review, we discuss the emergence of CeD and other gluten-related disorders, both globally and in Asia, the overlapping manifestations between gluten-related disorders and irritable bowel syndrome, and the challenges associated with diagnosis and management of CeD in Asia.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the individual susceptibility of four different types of OXIS contact areas (open [O], point [X], straight [I], and curved [S]) to approximal caries in children. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using clinical photographs and cone-beam computed tomography images of children, available from January 1, 2014, to August 31, 2015, showing the presence of at least one caries-free contact area between the primary molars. A single calibrated examiner scored 1,102 selected contacts using OXIS criteria from the occlusal view and subsequently evaluated the same contacts with a minimum follow-up period of one year for the presence of approximal caries. Results: Of the 1,102 contacts, 259 (23.5 percent) were found to be carious or restored due to approximal caries. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the type of contact played a significant role in caries prevalence (P<0.05). The odds ratios of OXIS contacts for the development of approximal caries were: S contact-147.4 (95 percent confidence interval [95% CI] equals 19.7 to 1101.7); I contact-24.5 (95% CI equals 3.4 to 177.9); X contact-1.1 (95% CI equals 1.0 to 12.5); and O contact-1.00 (reference). Conclusions: Among the OXIS contacts, the S type was most susceptible to approximal caries due to its complex morphology. The broad contact areas, namely, I and S types, are at greater risk for approximal caries in primary molars than O and X contacts.

AB  - Primary intracardiac teratoma is a rare cardiac tumor with few cases reports in neonates and children. The authors present a case of an 8-year-old boy diagnosed with a cystic mass within the heart. The mass lesion was originating from the interventricular septum and was obliterating the ventricular chambers. Clinically, the mass was suspected to be a hydatid cyst. Surgical excision of the cyst was done that was confirmed histopathologically as mature teratoma. Although rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions of heart when evaluating mass lesions in the pediatric age group.

KW  - distant metastasis

KW  - ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY
KW  - TRIAL
AB  - Context: While analyzing locoregional recurrences (LRRs), it is necessary to consider distant metastasis as a competing event. Because, later one is more fatal than LRR. It may change ongoing treatment of breast cancer and may alter the chance of LRR. Although some earlier studies assessed the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on LRR, they did not use competing risk regression model for it.
   Aims: To identify the risk factors and predict LRR using competing risk hazard model and to compare them with those using conventional hazard model.
   Settings and Design: This was a retrospective study from a tertiary care cancer hospital in India.
   Subjects and Methods: Data of 2114 breast cancer patients undergoing surgery were used from patient's record files (1993-2014).
   Statistical Analysis: Fine and Gray competing risk regression was used to model time from surgery to LRR, considering distant metastasis and death as the competing events. Further, cause-specific Cox regression was used to model time from surgery to LRR without considering competing risk.
   Results: Greater than ten positive nodes (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.19 [1.18-4.03]), skin involvement (HR [95% CI]: 2.75 [1.50-5.05]), NACT (HR [95% CI]: 1.90 [1.06-3.40]), invasive tumor in inner quadrant (HR [95% CI]: 1.78 [0.98-3.24]), and postoperative radiotherapy (HR [95% CI]: 0.52 [0.29-0.94]) were found to be significantly associated with LRR. However, conventional survival analysis ignoring competing risk overestimated cumulative incidence function and underestimated survival. Competing risk regression provided relatively more precise CI.
   Conclusions: Competing risks, if any, need to be incorporated in the survival analysis. NACT was found to be associated with higher risk for LRR, which may be because of administering it mainly to patients with bad prognosis. Conclusions: Competing risks, if any, need to be incorporated in the survival analysis. NACT was found to be associated with higher risk for LRR, which may be because of administering it mainly to patients with bad prognosis.

TI  - Effectiveness of a web-based learning module on oral health promotion for nursing and allied health professionals
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Nursing and allied health professionals are helping hands for healthcare and are important in the training cascade. We aimed to develop and validate the effectiveness of a web-based learning module on oral health promotion among nursing and allied health professionals.
   Methods. We developed and validated an oral health module focused on prevention and promotion for a webbased intervention among nurses and allied health professionals. Pre- and post-test assessment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme.
   Results. Of a total of 347 participants, 170 (48.9%) had a good knowledge score in the pre-test, and after attending the oral health module their number increased to 267 (76.9%). The mean difference between the pre-test and post-test scores was statistically significant (p<0.005).
   Conclusions. Training of nurses and allied health professionals on oral health through a web-based module showed improvement in oral health literacy.

AB  - Context: Appropriate mitochondrial function and oxidative balance are critical to neuronal survival. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species leads to oxidative stress that can cause free radical damage to biomolecules of the cell components and the molecules in the cellular milieu that eventually lead to a variety of chronic diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. Mitochondrial dysfunction initiates neuronal apoptosis thereby leading to neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Aim: To evaluate oxidative stress vis-a-vis mitochondrial function (Cytochrome C oxidase activity) in PD patients, Parkinson plus syndrome (PPS) patients in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). Settings and Design: Cross-sectional Study Methods: We assessed oxidative stress by chemiluminescence using luminol, and cytochrome c oxidase activity (CCO) by CCO kit using spectrophotometry in PD patients (n = 80), PPS patients (n = 40), and HCs (n = 40). Statistical Analysis: Data were presented as number (%) or mean +/- SD/median as approximate. Quantitative baseline variables were compared among the groups using one-way ANOVA and qualitative variables were compared using Chi-square test. The difference in median was compared using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Post-hoc Bonferronni correction. Results: Compared to HCs (Median 7.53 +/- 15.58 RLU/ sec/cell), ROS level in PD (14.13 +/- 29.5), and PPS (17.43 +/- 15.91) patients was significantly higher (P = 0.0029: HC vs, PD & P = 0.0500: HC vs. PPS). Also, ROS in PD patients (14.13 +/- 29.5) was higher that PPS patients (17. 43 +/- 15.91) but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.84). The CCO activity was found to be diminished in PD (Median: 0.025 +/- 0.013 units/ml) and PPS patients (0.027 +/- 0.008) in comparison to HCs (0.117 +/- 0.049). Conclusion: Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress is associated with PD and PPS and may play an important role in etiopathogenesis. Though the cause-effect conundrum has not been comprehensively probed but addressing oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage may serve as an adjunctive therapy for PD and PPS. Iron metabolism as reflected in the red cell indices may aid in differentiating PD from PPS.

AB  - Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is one of the most commonly performed kerato-refractive surgery globally. Since its introduction in 1990, there has been a constant evolution in its technology to improve the visual outcome. The safety, efficacy, and predictability of LASIK are well known, but complications with this procedure, although rare, are not unknown. Literature review suggests that intraoperative complications include suction loss, free cap, flap tear, buttonhole flap, decentered ablation, central island, interface debris, femtosecond laser-related complications, and others. The postoperative complications include flap striae, flap dislocation, residual refractive error, diffuse lamellar keratitis, microbial keratitis, epithelial ingrowth, refractive regression, corneal ectasia, and others. This review aims to provide a comprehensive knowledge of risk factors, clinical features, and management protocol of all the reported complications of LASIK. This knowledge will help in prevention as well as early identification and timely intervention with the appropriate strategy for achieving optimal visual outcome even in the face of complications.

AB  - Renal lymphangiectasia characterised by either unilocular or multilocular cystic lesion in and around the kidney is an uncommon condition. Presentation of these lesions is quite varied, which along with its uncommon occurrence adds to the challenges in the management of this condition. Most of these cases are managed conservatively and very rarely need any intervention. We present an unusual complication of refractory lymphatic ascites following laparoscopic deroofing of a unilocular renal lymphangiectasia in a 21-year-old gentleman who presented with left flank pain. The ascitic fluid analysis suggested non-chylous lymphatic ascites. The surgical outcome was rather exasperating for the patient than the disease itself. Hence, in the interest of the patient with minimal symptoms, if the imaging is highly suggestive of renal lymphangiectasia, either no intervention or the least invasive procedures should be attempted, whenever possible.

AB  - Somatostatin cell surface receptors are expressed in many different benign and malignant tumors and are often exploited for imaging and therapy of neuroendocrine tumors. A 17-year-old adolescent boy with clinicoradiologically diagnosed JNA (juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma) also underwent Ga-68-DOTANOC PET to explore somatostatin cell surface receptors' expression and its theranostic potential. Fusion PET/MRI, a novel imaging technology, exactly depicted the anatomical extensions of the tumor with avid DOTANOC uptake. This software-based fusion technique is advantageous for easy early recurrence identification, better delineation from postoperative scar tissue, for planning the exact target volumes for stereotactic radiotherapy therapy of inoperable/residual/recurrent JNAs in the future.

AB  - Background and Aims: Sexual dysfunction is often associated with substance use disorders. This study aimed to synthesize Indian literature on sexual dysfunction among patients with substance use disorders.
   Materials and Methods: Electronic search engines were used to identify studies of the last 20 years that reported sexual dysfunction with different substance use disorders. Information was extracted using a predefined template. Quality appraisal of the included studies was carried out using Joanna Briggs Institute checklist.
   Results: Twenty-seven relevant papers were identified that pertained to 24 distinct studies. Most of them were in patients with alcohol dependence, and fewer were in patients with opioid dependence. The study designs were primarily single-group cross-sectional, though many case-control, cross-sectional studies were also identified. The proportion of participants with sexual dysfunction ranged from 22.2% to 76% for studies related to alcohol dependence and 40% to 90% for studies pertaining to opioid dependence. Varied types of sexual dysfunctions were identified, including poor satisfaction, lack of desire, premature ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction. Efforts to address bias and confounders were not reported in most studies.
   Conclusion: Sexual dysfunction affects a substantial proportion of patients with substance use disorders. Clinicians can make an effort to ascertain and address sexual dysfunction in their routine clinical practice while dealing with patients with substance use disorders.

AB  - Background. The use of complementary and alternative medicine, particularly yoga is increasing in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We assessed the overall awareness regarding yoga among patients and their opinion about it as an adjunct therapy for NCDs.
   Methods. We included 384 patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics at a tertiary care centre in northern India. A questionnaire was developed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of yoga as a therapy.
   Results. Ninety per cent of patients were aware of yoga, mainly through print and electronic media. Of the surveyed patients, 22% practised yoga. Lack of time and knowledge were cited as the main reasons for non-practice among the non-practising patients (88%), of which 82% believed that yoga could be practised along with modern medicine. In addition, 61% were ready to accept treatment if offered at the surveyed tertiary care centre.
   Conclusions. Adequate knowledge, awareness and attitude towards yoga appears to be present in contrast to the low practice among the patient population surveyed. If implemented in an integrated fashion, the patients were willing to accept yoga as an adjunct therapy for their cardiac and neurological disorders-an encouraging sign given the burden of NCDs in India.

AB  - Aim: We aimed to examine and interpret the changes in internet search volumes for keywords representing different drug use-related themes before and after the drug use started being discussed in the Indian news media during recent celebrity drug trials.
   Materials and Methods: Data were extracted using Google Trends framework in health-related research. Search keywords were prepared under four broad themes: General interest in cannabis use, drug use being a criminal/unlawful act, help seeking for cannabis use, and help-seeking for drug-related problems. The mean relative search volume was analyzed and compared pre- and post-media discussion about celebrity drug use using SPSS V23.0.
   Results: A significant increase was noted in online search interest for keywords related to themes of general interest in cannabis use and drug use being a criminal/unlawful act once the media discussion on the celebrity drug use started. However, no corresponding increase was noted in online search interest for themes of help seeking for drug-related problems in general and cannabis use in particular.
   Conclusion: Media discussions on celebrity drug use may impact the online search behavior of the general public adversely. There is an need to develop and adhere to drug use reporting guidelines by media professionals.

AB  - Objective
   This study evaluated the utility of 18F-fluorodexoyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in staging, grading, and prognostication of Stage III and IV soft tissue sarcomas (STSs).
   Methods
   Forty patients (Median age = 32.5 years; 25 men) with histologically proven STSs, prospectively underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CTs at baseline. Three-dimensional region of interests were drawn encompassing the lesions to calculate standardized uptake values (SUVs) and metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs). After segmentation, Haralick statistical texture analysis was performed. Follow-up was available for 35 patients. Survival at 6 months was 71.4% and at 1 year was 57.1%.
   Results
   American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage III was seen in 23 and Stage IV in 17 patients. None of the baseline quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters could predict response or progression. Only reduction in SUVmax in interim PET/CT correlated with baseline SUVmax (Spearman's Rho = 0.533; P = 0.019). Textural parameters namely 'contrast' in CT (P = 0.039) and 'difference entropy' in PET/CT (P = 0.051) could differentiate intermediate from high-grade lesions, with corresponding area under curves being 0.736 (0.533-0.889) and 0.700 (0.518-0.882). M1 disease [Hazard ratio (HR): 3.184 (1.179-8.595); P = 0.022], absence of surgical treatment [HR 0.305 (0.106-0.873), P = 0.027 with surgery], lower MTV/total tumor volume (TTV) [HR: 0.975 (0.953-0.997; P = 0.028] and progressive disease in interim PET/CT [3.483 (0.898-13.515); P = 0.056] were predictors of lower survival in univariate analysis. Only M1 disease was found to be reaching significance in multivariate analysis [HR = 2.683 (0.949-7.580); P = 0.063]. Baseline PET/CT changed management in 12.5% of patients [compared to local-imaging and high-resolution CT chest]; with detection of extra-pulmonary metastases. Though, interim and end of treatment PET/CTs detected more metastatic lesions, management was not impacted.
   Conclusion
   18F-FDG-PET/CT allows for more accurate M-staging in late-stage STSs, which in turn influences the option of curative surgical resection and thus impacts patient prognosis. Lower baseline MTV/TTV and progression in interim PET/CT are also associated with lower survival. Textural analysis may have a role in noninvasive grading.

AB  - Background and Introduction: Unlocking of the frontotemporal dural fold (FTDF) and extradural removal of the anterior clinoid process (EACP) are challenging but mandatory skills for micro-neurosurgeons. Despite the presence of an extensive body of literature on this subject, the translation of this cadaveric and 3D simulation to a real patient turns out to be a very demanding and difficult task.
   Objective: This video is aimed to address the surgical nuances and major adjustments necessary in the unlocking of the FTDF and extradural ACP removal in an actual case for an early-career neurosurgeon.
   Surgical Technique: A 40-year lady presented with features of acromegaly with radiological evidence of significant component of the tumor in the right cavernous sinus along with sellar suprasellar component. To achieve a good hormonal control, a complete tumor excision was required, which was achieved with FTDF and EACP removal. The cavernous sinus was approached through the Parkinson's triangle.
   Results: The patient had uneventful recovery and good hormonal control at the 3-month follow-up.
   Conclusion: FTDF unlocking and EACP are elegant procedures and need to be learned by all neurosurgeons. This article will provide excellent teaching material for young neurosurgeons.

AB  - Albuminuria is an excellent marker for early diagnosis of kidney and cardiovascular disease. Urine dipsticks that are widely used for rapid screening of albumin, lack sensitivity and specificity in lower concentrations (<300 mg/dL) which is clinically very significant for early diagnosis and often provide qualitative or semi-quantitative results. Precise quantification of lower concentrations is based on urinary analyzers that are not portable and cannot be used in point-of-care (PoC) settings. Here, the feasibility of an accessory free analytical device has been demonstrated using a smartphone. Amalgamation of a smartphone with a dipstick enables rapid and inexpensive diagnosis. It estimates not only the standard five concentrations used in dipstick method, but ten different concentrations. This enables accurate detection and quantification of albumin at lower concentration, clinically significant in the early diagnosis of kidney disease. In order to mitigate ambient light conditions and shadow of the smartphone, images of strips were taken in a smartphone camera with "Flash ON" mode. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify ten different albumin concentrations, corresponding to normal, micro albuminuria and macro albuminuria conditions. The study was performed under varying illumination conditions using multiple smartphones. Random Forest algorithm yields an accuracy of 92% in constant illumination and variable smartphone conditions. In variable smartphone and illumination condition, it yields 82% accuracy on the test data. The detection limit of the proposed method is 7.8125 mg / dL.

AB  - Justification The management of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is challenging. These guidelines update existing 2009 Indian Society of Pediatric Nephrology recommendations on its management. Objective To frame revised guidelines on diagnosis and evaluation, treatment and follow up, and supportive care of patients with the illness. Process The guidelines combine evidence-based recommendations and expert opinion. Formulation of key questions was followed by systematic review of literature, evaluation of evidence by experts and two face-to-face meetings. Recommendations Fourteen statements provide updated advice for managing steroid resistance, and underscore the importance of estimating proteinuria and baseline kidney function, and the need for kidney biopsy and genetic screening. Calcineurin inhibitors are recommended as most effective in inducing remission of proteinuria, the chief factor associated with long-term renal survival. Advice on managing allograft recurrence, congenital nephrotic syndrome, and monitoring and supportive care, including transition of care, are described. This revised practice guideline is intended to improve management and patient outcomes, and provide direction for future research.

AB  - Background: Methotrexate is the most commonly used drug in the treatment of psoriasis with good efficacy and safety. Recently, weekly azathioprine pulse has been shown to be effective in this disease.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of weekly pulse doses of azathioprine and methotrexate for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.
   Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 80 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were recruited. After detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation, patients were randomized to 2 groups to receive either weekly 300 mg azathioprine (n = 40) or 15 mg methotrexate every week (n = 40) for 20 weeks, following which the response to treatment and adverse effects were assessed. The patients were then followed up every 4 weeks for 3 months to determine any relapse.
   Results: Overall, 48 (60%) patients achieved PASI 75, while 36 (45%) and 59 (73.8%) patients achieved PASI 100 and 50, respectively. On intention to treat analysis, PASI >= 75 was achieved in 47.5% (19/40) patients in group 1 compared to 85% (34/40) patients in group 2 (p < 0.001). However, on per protocol analysis, PASI >= 75 was achieved in 86% (19/22) patients in group 1 and 92% (34/37) patients in group 2 (p = 0.497). Minor clinical and biochemical adverse effects were noted in both the groups, which were comparable. One (7.7%) patient in group 1 and 4 (17.4%) in group 2 relapsed during follow-up.
   Limitations: Limitations of study include small sample size and short follow-up.
   Conclusion: Weekly azathioprine pulse appears to be beneficial in the management of chronic plaque psoriasis. However, it is less effective than weekly methotrexate. It can thus be of use as a therapeutic option in patients with contraindication to methotrexate or other similar agents in this disease.

AB  - Background. Despite abundant literature, a clear and coherent understanding of hearing loss (HL) in India is limited by the wide disparity in studies.
   Methods. We did a review of published peer-reviewed journal articles. Studies reporting the prevalence and degree of HL in India from 1980 to 2020 were included. Information was gathered on the population characteristics, methodology applied and the prevalence of hearing impairment. The data were analysed to identify trends and at-risk sections of population in various categories.
   Results. Four hundred and forty studies were identified after a database search; 29 full-length articles were selected for final analysis. Using a 3-step screening protocol, hearing impairment (abnormal auditory brainstem response/auditory steady state response) in neonates ranged between 1.59 and 8.8 per 1000 births. Among 'at risk' neonates, it ranged from 7 to 49.18 per 1000 births. In children the prevalence of HL was 6.6% to 16.47%. Otitis media was the most common cause of HL in children. Community-based studies (all ages) reported prevalence of HL between 6% and 26.9% and prevalence of disabling HL between 4.5% and 18.3%. Rural areas and elderly showed a higher prevalence of hearing impairment.
   Conclusion. Despite India's improving health indices, hearing disability remains persistently high. It is a major contributor to the loss of personal potential and a financial strain for the individual and the country. A large-scale multicentric study to identify the degree and type of HL, social awareness campaigns, widespread neonatal screening, strengthening treatment facilities and well-funded rehabilitation programmes can counter the rising prevalence of hearing impairment.

AB  - Micro-textured surfaces have improved the tribological performance of contact surfaces under lubricated conditions; however, not practiced due to manufacturing challenges. In addition to simpler micro-pits or straight-trench type textures, sophisticated bioinspired textures on commercial radial ball bearings have been scarcely studied. In this work, Dendroaspis polylepis (Mamba snake) skin-type textures were fabricated on the inner race of FAG radial ball bearings using a nanosecond fiber laser machine. Though the snake textures were primarily meant to enhance friction, the dimensions of the texture have been carefully chosen to improve the tribological performance under lubricated condition. The textured bearings were assembled and experimented at various rotational speeds and lightly loaded conditions to measure vibrational amplitude, frictional torque, and temperature rise. Compared to untextured (conventional) bearing, the snake-skin type textured bearings resulted in improved tribo-dynamic performance.

AB  - Machine learning (ML), a form of artificial intelligence (AI), is being increasingly employed in neurology. Reported performance metrics often match or exceed the efficiency of average clinicians. The neurologist is easily baffled by the underlying concepts and terminologies associated with ML studies. The superlative performance metrics of ML algorithms often hide the opaque nature of its inner workings. Questions regarding ML model's interpretability and reproducibility of its results in real-world scenarios, need emphasis. Given an abundance of time and information, the expert clinician should be able to deliver comparable predictions to ML models, a useful benchmark while evaluating its performance. Predictive performance metrics of ML models should not be confused with causal inference between its input and output. ML and clinical gestalt should compete in a randomized controlled trial before they can complement each other for screening, triaging, providing second opinions and modifying treatment.

AB  - Damaged or degenerative joints are treated with total joint replacement, however, despite many successful outcomes, significant problems such as implant loosening, and failure occur. These problems occur due to the inability of the implant to support bone cell attachment, delaying the cell-implant interaction affecting bone regeneration. Hence it is recommended to develop and modify implants to induce bone cell proliferation. Herein, we report a self-aligned titania nanotubes-reduced graphene oxide (TiNT-reduced GO) hybrid surface for growth and proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The hybrid surface is characterised using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell proliferation was studied using standard MTT and fluorescence assays. TiNT-reduced GO hybrid surface, with TiO2 nanotube of diameter 80 - 110 nm and length similar to 500 mu m with uniform deposition of reduced GO all over the surface, demonstrated about 50% increased cell growth compared to TiO2 nanotubes surface. The osteoinductive behaviour of TiNT-reduced GO is observed as these hybrid films support the proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hence promising to be a potential implant material for bone regeneration.

AB  - Robotics applied to cranial surgery is a fast-moving and fascinating field, which is transforming the practice of neurosurgery. With exponential increases in computing power, improvements in connectivity, artificial intelligence, and enhanced precision of accessing target structures, robots are likely to be incorporated into more areas of neurosurgery in the future-making procedures safer and more efficient. Overall, improved efficiency can offset upfront costs and potentially prove cost-effective. In this narrative review, we aim to translate a broad clinical experience into practical information for the incorporation of robotics into neurosurgical practice. We begin with procedures where robotics take the role of a stereotactic frame and guide instruments along a linear trajectory. Next, we discuss robotics in endoscopic surgery, where the robot functions similar to a surgical assistant by holding the endoscope and providing retraction, supplemental lighting, and correlation of the surgical field with navigation. Then, we look at early experience with endovascular robots, where robots carry out tasks of the primary surgeon while the surgeon directs these movements remotely. We briefly discuss a novel microsurgical robot that can perform many of the critical operative steps (with potential for fine motor augmentation) remotely. Finally, we highlight 2 innovative technologies that allow instruments to take nonlinear, predetermined paths to an intracranial destination and allow magnetic control of instruments for real-time adjustment of trajectories. We believe that robots will play an increasingly important role in the future of neurosurgery and aim to cover some of the aspects that this field holds for neurosurgical innovation.

AB  - Increasing evidence in recent years has suggested that regulatory B cells (Bregs) are one of the crucial modulators in various inflammatory disease conditions. However, no study to date has investigated the significance of Bregs in modulating osteoclastogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, in the present study, we for the first time examined the anti-osteoclastogenic potential of Bregs under in vitro conditions and observed that Bregs suppress RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. We further elucidated the mechanism behind the observed suppression of osteoclasts differentiation via Bregs. Our results clearly suggested that the observed anti-osteoclastogenic property of Bregs is mediated via the production of IL-10 cytokine. Next, we explored whether Bregs have any role in mediating inflammatory bone loss under post-menopausal osteoporotic conditions in ovx mice. Remarkably, our in vivo data clearly suggest that the frequencies of both CD19(+)IL-10(+) Bregs and CD19(+)CD1d(hi)CD5(+)IL-10(+) "B10" Bregs were significantly reduced in case of osteoporotic mice model. Moreover, we also found a significant reduction in serum IL-10 cytokine levels in osteoporotic mice, thereby further supporting our observations. Taken together, the present study for the first time establishes the direct role of regulatory B cells in modulating osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Further, our in vivo data suggest that modulations in the percentage of Bregs population along with its reduced potential to produce IL-10 might further exacerbate the observed bone loss in ovx mice.

AB  - Statement of problem. Clinical studies on the wear properties of different zirconia surfaces are lacking. Selecting a surface that causes and undergoes minimal wear will help improve clinical outcomes.
   Purpose. The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate and compare the wear over 1 year use of glazed zirconia (GZ) and polished zirconia (PZ) crowns opposing natural enamel and the wear of natural enamel opposing PZ and GZ crowns.
   Material and methods. This prospective, split mouth, randomized clinical trial included 14 participants requiring complete coverage crowns on first molars, bilaterally, in a completely dentate mandibular arch. GZ and PZ crowns were cemented according to a randomization chart. Polyvinyl siloxane impressions were made immediately and 1 year after the cementation of the crowns. The respective casts were scanned by using a 3D scanner and a software program to measure the amount of linear wear of zirconia crowns and opposing natural teeth. Wear was observed in 8 groups: PZ crowns, GZ crowns, natural enamel opposing natural enamel in the molar and premolar regions (NE-M and NE-PM), natural enamel opposing PZ crowns in the molar region (NE-PZ-M), natural enamel opposing GZ crowns in the molar region (NE-GZ-M), natural enamel opposing PZ crowns in the premolar region (NE-PZ-PM), and natural enamel opposing GZ crowns in the premolar region (NE-GZ-PM). A descriptive analysis was followed by comparison between groups by using a repeated-measure ANOVA with post hoc adjustments (alpha=.05).
   Results. The mean wear (mm) observed was as follows (in ascending order): PZ crowns (13 +/- 3), NE-PM (13 +/- 1), GZ crowns (27 +/- 9), NE-M (34 +/- 3), NE-PZ-PM (44 +/- 18), NE-PZ-M (63 +/- 22), NE-GZ-PM (69 +/- 21), NE-GZ-M (113 +/- 33). Wear of GZ and PZ crowns was less than wear of NE-M. The difference was statistically significant when comparing PZ with NE-M (P<.001, CI=-17 to -24). Wear of NE-GZ-M and NE-PZ-M was higher than wear of NE-M, with a statistically significant difference (P<.001, CI=-49 to -107 and P =.004, CI=-8 to -49, respectively). Wear of NE-GZ-M was more than that of NE-PZ-M, and the difference was statistically significant (P<.001, CI=-68 to -32). Wear of NE-PZ-PM and NE-GZ-PM was also more than the wear of NE-PM, and the difference was statistically significant (P<.001, CI=-17 to -43 and P<.001, CI=-39 to -70).
   Conclusions. PZ and GZ crowns wear substantially with time, with lesser wear observed in PZ crowns. PZ and GZ crowns also cause more wear in opposing natural enamel than natural enamel antagonists, with the highest wear caused by GZ crowns.

AB  - Objectives: Bee-Humming Breathing (BHB) exercise is a simple yogic practice recommended for its favorable effect on cardiac physiology, including blood pressure (BP) and autonomic nervous system. However, strong evidence supporting its effectiveness is lacking. The present study was designed to evaluate the immediate effect of BHB exercise on blood pressure parameters and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with essen-tial hypertension. Study methods: We conducted a randomized control trial including 70 patients with essential hypertension, randomly allocated to perform either BHB exercise (n=35) or placebo slow breathing exercise (n = 35) for 5-minutes duration. Blood pressure and HRV were measured before, during, and after the practice. Results: There was no significant decrease in systolic [effect size (95% CI): 2.22 (-13.20, 17.64); p 0.77], dia-stolic [4.54 (-17.40, 26.48); p 0.68] and mean blood pressures [1.37 (-8.78, 11.52); p 0.78] after BHB exercise in comparison to the control group in our study. The HRV analysis showed a significant increase in the HF power [6.8 (1.47, 12.12); p 0.01], and decrease in the LF power [-26.47 (-34.25,-18.68); p < 0.01] during the recovery phase of the 5-minute BHB exercise in comparison to the control group. Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that though a single short session of BHB exercise in hypertensive patients does not significantly reduce BP, it significantly augments the parasympa-thetic tone as indicated by a significant improvement in HRV parameters.

AB  - Purpose: Perioperative systemic corticosteroids arewidely used inmaxillofacial trauma surgery to prevent postoperative complications, but potentially perceived benefits are speculative rather than evidence-based. The purpose of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of perioperative systemic corticosteroids on clinically significant outcomes in patients undergoing maxillofacial trauma surgery.
   Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, Clinical trial registry, and grey literature as well as references of included trials. Our primary outcomes were facial edema and pain after the surgery. Our secondary outcomes were postoperative nausea and vomiting, neurosensory disturbance, functional recovery, wound infections, and other adverse events.
   Results: Of the 94 trials retrieved, 13 were included (n = 652). Perioperative steroid use was associated with reduced pain and facial edema. We observed a decrease in postoperative nausea and vomiting with the use of systemic corticosteroids (n = 184, OR = 0.53, [0.28, 1.02], I-2 = 0%). Four trials reported infections and impaired wound healing associated with steroids (n = 160. OR = 3.37, [1.43. 7.94], I-2 = 2%). The 13 trials had an unclear risk of bias.
   Conclusions: Systemic corticosteroids reduced facial edema and postoperative pain, but impaired wound healing was also reported. The use of systemic steroids in maxillofacial trauma surgery is thus supported only by weak evidence and further research is advocated.

AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the structural organization of tissue and delivery of external cues to the cell. Biglycan, a class I small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRP), is a key component of the ECM that participates in scaffolding the collagen fibrils and mediates cell signaling. Dysregulation of biglycan expression can result in wide range of clinical conditions such as metabolic disorder, inflammatory disorder, musculoskeletal defects and malignancies. In this review, we aim to update our current understanding regarding the link between altered expression of biglycan and different clinicopathological states. Biglycan interacts with toll like receptors (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 on the immune cells which initiates inflammation and aggravates inflammatory disorders. ECM unbound soluble biglycan acts as a DAMP (danger associated molecular pattern) resulting in sterile inflammation. Dysregulation of biglycan expression is also observed in inflammatory metabolic conditions such as atherosclerosis and obesity. In cancer, high-biglycan expression facilitates tumor growth, invasion and metastasis which is associated with poor clinical outcome. As a pivotal structural component of the ECM, biglycan strengthens the musculoskeletal system and its absence is associated with musculoskeletal defects. Thus, SLRP biglycan is a potential marker which is significantly altered in different clinicopathological states.

AB  - The peritumoral regions of WHO grade II gliomas, like astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, have been reported to show epileptiform activities. An imbalance of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms is primarily responsible for the generation of epileptiform activities. Here we have compared the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons in intraoperative peritumoral specimens obtained from glioma patients with (GS) and without (GN) a history of seizures at presentation. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the infiltration of proliferating cells at the peritumoral tissues. Whole-cell patch clamp technique was performed to measure the spontaneous glutamatergic and GABAergic activity onto pyramidal neurons in the peritumoral samples of GS (n = 11) and GN (n = 15) patients. The cytoarchitecture of the peritumoral tissues was devoid of Ki67 immuno-positive cells. We observed a higher frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic and GABAergic activities onto pyramidal neurons of the peritumoral samples of GS patients. Our findings suggest that, in spite of similar histopathological features, the pyramidal neurons in the peritumoral samples of GS and GN patients showed differences in spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic neurotransmission. An alteration in postsynaptic currents may contribute to the spontaneous epileptiform activity in GS patients.

AB  - The present study aimed at investigating the 4G/5G and -844G/A polymorphisms and plasma concentration of PAI-1 in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic stable angina (CSA) in Indian population. It included 100 patients with AMI and stable angina and 100 healthy controls. All study subjects were typed for two PAI polymorphisms (4G/5G and -844G/A) through PCR-RFLP and level of PAI through ELISA. The comparison of AMI and CSA independently with control in terms of PAI-1 level was statistically significant but not between AMI and CSA. The frequency of 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotype and 4G allele was significantly higher in AMI cases than in control and was found to increase the risk of AMI. There was a significant relationship between 4G/5G polymorphism and AMI risk under the dominant and codominant genotype. The frequency of 4G/4G genotype and 4G allele was significantly higher in CSA cases than in control group and increases the risk of CSA. There was no significant association between 4G/5G polymorphism and CSA risk under recessive, dominant, and codominant models. The genotype and allelic frequencies difference between the cases (AMI and CSA) and control with regard to -844G/A polymorphisms were statistically nonsignificant. Also, we did not detect any significant association of -844G/A polymorphism with AMI and CSA in recessive, dominant, and codominant models. Along with the traditional risk factors, the 4G/5G allele polymorphism is an independent risk factor for the development of AMI. The detection of 4G/5G allele may therefore be helpful in primary prevention. Patients who carry the 4G/5G allele polymorphism have high concentrations of PAI-1, which might be involved in incidents leading to AMI. The present study for the first time revealed significant association of 4G/5G allele polymorphism with high risk of AMI in Indian population and will be helpful in identifying the genetic risk factors associated with AMI and CSA and for better management of diagnostic measures.

AB  - Introduction Interventions based on Yogic Breathing Practices (IB-YBP) have shown promising results for substance use disorders (SUD). Research in this area is methodologically heterogeneous and only a few, but restricted, systematic reviews are available. The current systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of IB-YBP for SUD. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Cochrane's Library, EBSCO-Medline, and Google Scholar databases were searched for the randomized- (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials. Research involving participants with SUD, of either gender or any age, assessing the effectiveness of the IB-YBP either as a standalone intervention or as an adjuvant to standard treatment versus standard pharmacological/non-pharmacological treatment or no-intervention control were included. Studies having participants with co-morbid psychiatric illness and interventions not having IB-YBP as the predominant component were excluded. Results: The initial literature search yielded 396 articles and upon screening, only 14 studies were found eligible for this review. Most studies have researched IB-YBP as an adjunct to the standard treatment for SUD. Evidence for the effectiveness of IB-YBP is mostly available for tobacco and opioid use disorders, though only for short-term outcomes; however, literature is scarce for alcohol- and cocaine-use disorders. This review documented the effectiveness of the IB-YBP for substance use-related outcome parameters such as abstinence, quality of life (QoL), mood, craving, and withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion: IB-YBP may be an effective adjuvant to standard treatment for various SUD. However, more research is required to compare its effectiveness with standard treatment, and assessing its long-term efficacy, for it to be strongly recommended as a treatment strategy.

AB  - Y Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to study the prevalence and pattern of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for original studies describing sleep abnormalities in children and adolescents with or without pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pooled estimates for various sleep abnormalities were calculated using a random-effect model.
   Results: Of 371 articles screened, 16 studies were included. Among these, five studies were in preschool children, two were in children with pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders and the remaining were in school going children and adolescents. The outcome measures used for sleep were markedly hetero-geneous across the studies. The pooled prevalence of any sleep disturbance in children during the pandemic was 54%(95%CI:50-57%). Interestingly, the prevalence in pre-school children was lower than pre-pandemic times (RR = 0.87; 95% CI:0.58-1.30) but this was not statistically significant. The pooled prevalence of children not meeting sleep recommendation was 49% (95%CI: 39-58%).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of sleep problems in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic is alarming. Pre-school children had a trend towards relatively fewer sleep disturbances due to home confinement measures in comparison with pre-pandemic times. Sleep duration recommendations were not met in nearly half of healthy children. However, these conclusions need to be seen in light of limited literature on the topic, few included studies done in heterogenous populations, and dubious quality of inferences drawn from these studies which were predominantly online surveys.(C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study aimed at optimizing the parameters for increasing vitamin D2 content along with other nutraceutical properties (8-glucans, antioxidants, total phenols, flavonoids, and amino acid contents) in dried mushroom Lentinula edodes (L. edodes) powder using ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation. The dried mushroom powder was irradiated for different time durations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h). HPLC studies indicated a significant (p < 0.05) increase in vitamin D2 (24.94-49.31 mu g/g) content in 2 h irradiated sample. An elevated level of total phenols (6.57-8.84 mg GAE/g), total flavonoids (1.55-2.89 mgQE/g), and 8-glucan content (41.20-47.74%) along with improved antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP) in the 2 h UVB treated sample was also observed. GCMS profiling revealed the presence of bioactives reported to have medicinal potential. Additionally, the study also targets the alterations made by irradiation in amino acid and color profile. The present study provides a sustainable strategy to improve the nutraceutical potential of dried edible mushroom powder, in terms of antioxidant activities, bioactive constituents, etc., particularly vitamin D2, which holds a significant place in the diet.

AB  - G12 strains are now considered to be the sixth most prevalent human rotaviruses globally. India has introduced rotavirus vaccine Rotavac (R) into the national immunization program in 2016 and Himachal Pradesh (HP) is the first state to launch it. During epidemiological rotavirus surveillance in HP, predominance of G12 rotaviruses was observed. This study investigated the genetic variability and evolution of HP G12 strains (n = 15) associated with P-genotypes P[6], P[4], and P[8] identified between 2013 and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of VP7 gene revealed that all characterized G12 strains clustered in lineage-III and diversified into three subclusters indicating that these strains may have originated from three different ancestral G12 strains. The comparative sequence analysis of HP strains with Rotavac (R) and Rotarix (R) vaccine strains revealed various amino acid substitutions in epitope regions of VP7 and VP4 proteins especially at the antibody neutralization sites. Only 12/29 VP7 epitope residues and 2/25 VP4 epitope residues were found to be conserved between HP rotavirus strains and vaccine strains. Both long and short electropherotypes were observed in G12P[4] strains, while a single long electropherotype was observed in G12P[6] strains. Children of <= 11 months were significantly infected with G12 rotaviruses. The frequency of vomiting episodes (>= 5/day) was significantly higher in children infected with G12 rotavirus strains as compared to non-G12 rotaviruses (p = 0.0405). Our study provides the comprehensive data on clinical characteristics and evolutionary pattern of the G12 rotavirus, the most prevalent strain in HP and emphasizes the need to monitor these strains for inclusion in future vaccine.

AB  - Interpretation Chewing tobacco remains a substantial public health problem in several regions of the world, and predominantly in south Asia. We found little change in the prevalence of chewing tobacco use between 1990 and 2019, and that control efforts have had much larger effects on the prevalence of smoking tobacco use than on chewing tobacco use in some countries. Mitigating the health effects of chewing tobacco requires stronger regulations and policies that specifically target use of chewing tobacco, especially in countries with high prevalence.
   Findings In 2019, 273 center dot 9 million (95% uncertainty interval 258 center dot 5 to 290 center dot 9) people aged 15 years and older used chewing tobacco, and the global age-standardised prevalence of chewing tobacco use was 4 center dot 72% (4 center dot 46 to 5 center dot 01). 228 center dot 2 million (213 center dot 6 to 244 center dot 7; 83 center dot 29% [82 center dot 15 to 84 center dot 42]) chewing tobacco users lived in the south Asia region. Prevalence among young people aged 15-19 years was over 10% in seven locations in 2019. Although global agestandardised prevalence of smoking tobacco use decreased significantly between 1990 and 2019 (annualised rate of change: -1 center dot 21% [-1 center dot 26 to -1 center dot 16]), similar progress was not observed for chewing tobacco (0 center dot 46% [0 center dot 13 to 0 center dot 79]). Among the 12 highest prevalence countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Madagascar, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Sri Lanka, and Yemen), only Yemen had a significant decrease in the prevalence of chewing tobacco use, which was among males between 1990 and 2019 (-0 center dot 94% [-1 center dot 72 to -0 center dot 14]), compared with nine of 12 countries that had significant decreases in the prevalence of smoking tobacco. Among females, none of these 12 countries had significant decreases in prevalence of chewing tobacco use, whereas seven of 12 countries had a significant decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking use for the period.
   Summary Background Chewing tobacco and other types of smokeless tobacco use have had less attention from the global health community than smoked tobacco use. However, the practice is popular in many parts of the world and has been linked to several adverse health outcomes. Understanding trends in prevalence with age, over time, and by location and sex is important for policy setting and in relation to monitoring and assessing commitment to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Methods We estimated prevalence of chewing tobacco use as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 using a modelling strategy that used information on multiple types of smokeless tobacco products. We generated a time series of prevalence of chewing tobacco use among individuals aged 15 years and older from 1990 to 2019 in 204 countries and territories, including age-sex specific estimates. We also compared these trends to those of smoked tobacco over the same time period. Findings In 2019, 273 & middot;9 million (95% uncertainty interval 258 & middot;5 to 290 & middot;9) people aged 15 years and older used chewing tobacco, and the global age-standardised prevalence of chewing tobacco use was 4 & middot;72% (4 & middot;46 to 5 & middot;01). 228 & middot;2 million (213 & middot;6 to 244 & middot;7; 83 & middot;29% [82 & middot;15 to 84 & middot;42]) chewing tobacco users lived in the south Asia region. Prevalence among young people aged 15-19 years was over 10% in seven locations in 2019. Although global age standardised prevalence of smoking tobacco use decreased significantly between 1990 and 2019 (annualised rate of change: -1 & middot;21% [-1 & middot;26 to -1 & middot;16]), similar progress was not observed for chewing tobacco (0 & middot;46% [0 & middot;13 to 0 & middot;79]). Among the 12 highest prevalence countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Madagascar, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Sri Lanka, and Yemen), only Yemen had a significant decrease in the prevalence of chewing tobacco use, which was among males between 1990 and 2019 (-0 & middot;94% [-1 & middot;72 to -0 & middot;14]), compared with nine of 12 countries that had significant decreases in the prevalence of smoking tobacco. Among females, none of these 12 countries had significant decreases in prevalence of chewing tobacco use, whereas seven of 12 countries had a significant decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking use for the period. Interpretation Chewing tobacco remains a substantial public health problem in several regions of the world, and predominantly in south Asia. We found little change in the prevalence of chewing tobacco use between 1990 and 2019, and that control efforts have had much larger effects on the prevalence of smoking tobacco use than on chewing tobacco use in some countries.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies have reported alterations in cortical activity indicating glaucoma as a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Hence the current study aimed to assess the cortical activity using highdensity EEG in patients with mild glaucoma during resting state. Treatment-naive 37 patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), 34 patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), and 32 healthy controls were included in the study. Resting state EEG i.e., eyes closed (EC) and eyes open conditions (EO) were acquired using 128-channel for 3 min. After preprocessing, the current density of 6239 voxels of the data was estimated using sLORETA. In comparison to healthy controls, PACG had higher activity at cingulate gyri, medial and superior frontal gyri during EO only. POAG had significantly higher activity at precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus during EC, whereas at cingulate gyri, frontal gyri, precentral gyri, paracentral lobule, sub-gyral region, postcentral gyrus, and precuneus during EO. POAG had significantly higher activity at precuneus and cuneus compared to PACG during EO. Intraocular pressure and mean-deviation of visual fields had a positive correlation with cortical activity. Results of the study indicate physiological alterations not only at the level of retina but also at brain even in the early stages of the disease. These alterations in the cortical activity were more in POAG than PACG. Controlling the IOP alone might be insufficient in glaucoma because of widespread alterations in cortical activity. These findings might enhance the current understanding of cortical involvement in glaucoma.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152: interim results from a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 trial, and 3-month follow-up of a double-blind, randomised phase 1 trial
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 mu g or 6 mu g) formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule (IMDG) adsorbed to alum (Algel). We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 mu g with Algel-IMDG, 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG, or 6 mu g with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 mu g and 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28.
   Methods We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG or 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04471519.
   Findings Between Sept 5 and 12, 2020, 921 participants were screened, of whom 380 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group (n=190) or 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group (n=190). Geometric mean titres (GMTs; PRNT50) at day 56 were significantly higher in the 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group (197.0 [95% CI 155.6-249.4]) than the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group (100.9 [74.1-137.4]; p=0.0041). Seroconversion based on PRNT50 at day 56 was reported in 171 (92.9% [95% CI 88.2-96.2] of 184 participants in the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group and 174 (98.3% [95.1-99.6]) of 177 participants in the 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group. GMTs (MNT50) at day 56 were 92.5 (95% CI 77.7-110.2) in the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group and 160.1 (135.8-188.8) in the 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group. Seroconversion based on MNT50 at day 56 was reported in 162 (88.0% [95% CI 82.4-92.3]) of 184 participants in the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group and 171 (96.6% [92.8-98.8]) of 177 participants in the 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group. The 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG and 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG formulations elicited T-cell responses that were biased to a Th1 phenotype at day 42. No significant difference in the proportion of participants who had a solicited local or systemic adverse reaction in the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group (38 [20.0%; 95% CI 14.7-26.5] of 190) and the 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group (40 [21.1%; 15.5-27.5] of 190) was observed on days 0-7 and days 28-35; no serious adverse events were reported in the study. From the phase 1 trial, 3-month post-second-dose GMTs (MNT50) were 39.9 (95% CI 32.0-49.9) in the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group, 69.5 (53.7-89.9) in the 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group, 53.3 (40.1-71.0) in the 6 mu g with Algel group, and 20.7 (14.5-29.5) in the Algel alone group.
   Interpretation In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seroprevalence of SARS-Coronavirus 2 among asymptomatic healthy blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare settings: Implications for safety of blood donors and blood collection staff during blood donation
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
KW  - COVID-19 seroprevalence
KW  - Blood donation
KW  - Donor safety
AB  - Introduction: SARS-Coronavirus-2 pandemic has adversely affected blood supply as potential blood donors were afraid of acquiring infection in hospital settings. We aimed to compare COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare setting to analyse the difference in exposure level of each group as well as the risk of acquiring infection during the process of blood donation. Material and Methods: Analysis of whole blood donors tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was carried out after categorizing them into healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). NHCW were further categorized into residents of containment and non-containment zones and seroprevalence analyzed. Seroprevalence among different ABO blood groups was also analyzed. Results: 1191 blood donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 9.5 % seropositivity. Significantly lower seropositivity of 3.2 % (p < 0.001) was observed among HCW as compared to 10.9 % seropositivity in NHCW. Among NHCW no difference in seropositivity was observed based on residence in containment or noncontainment zone. Significantly higher (p = 0.012) seroprevalence was observed among A blood group donors (12.5 %) as compared to O blood group donors (6.8 %). Conclusion: Results suggests that a blood donor, in a hospital setting is less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 disease than when participating in activities of daily living. It is postulated that the lower seroprevalence among HCW as compared to NHCW reflects differences in knowledge and practice of preventive measures among these groups. The findings should instil confidence among blood donors and motivate them to donate blood without fear.

AB  - The accumulation of massive data in the plethora of Cheminformatics databases has made the role of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) indispensable in drug design. This has necessitated the development of newer algorithms and architectures to mine these databases and fulfil the specific needs of various drug discovery processes such as virtual drug screening, de novo molecule design and discovery in this big data era. The development of deep learning neural networks and their variants with the corresponding increase in chemical data has resulted in a paradigm shift in information mining pertaining to the chemical space. The present review summarizes the role of big data and AI techniques currently being implemented to satisfy the ever-increasing research demands in drug discovery pipelines.

AB  - Aberrant inflammation, such as that associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is fueled by the inordinate activity of RelA/NF-kappa B factors. As such, the canonical NF-KB module mediates controlled nuclear activation of RelA dimers from the latent cytoplasmic complexes. What provokes pathological RelA activity in the colitogenic gut remains unclear. The noncanonical NF-kappa B pathway typically promotes immune organogenesis involving Nfkb2 gene products. Because NF-kappa B pathways are intertwined, we asked whether noncanonical signaling aggravated inflammatory RelA activity. Our investigation revealed frequent engagement of the noncanonical pathway in human IBD. In a mouse model of experimental colitis, we established that Nfkb2-mediated regulations escalated the RelA-driven proinflammatory gene response in intestinal epithelial cells, exacerbating the infiltration of inflammatory cells and colon pathologies. Our mechanistic studies clarified that cell-autonomous Nfkb2 signaling supplemented latent NF-kappa B dimers, leading to a hyperactive canonical RelA response in the inflamed colon. In sum, the regulation of latent NF-kappa B dimers appears to link noncanonical Nfkb2 signaling to RelA-driven inflammatory pathologies and may provide for therapeutic targets.

AB  - Background and Purpose Glutamate receptor-mediated enhanced excitatory neurotransmission is typically associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). Kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid are two important tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites that modulate glutamate receptor activity. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that alteration in metabolism of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites in the hippocampus of patients with MTLE-HS contributes to abnormal glutamatergic transmission. Experimental Approach Levels of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites were determined using HPLC and LC-MS/MS in hippocampal samples from patients with MTLE-HS, compared with autopsy and non-seizure control samples. mRNA and protein expressions of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway enzymes were determined by qPCR and Western blot. Spontaneous glutamatergic activities were recorded from pyramidal neurons in the presence of kynurenine and kynurenic acid, using whole-cell patch clamp. Key Results Levels of kynurenic acid were reduced and quinolinic acid levels were raised in hippocampal samples from MTLE-HS patients, whereas kynurenine levels remained unaltered, compared with levels in non-seizure controls. Spontaneous glutamatergic activity in MTLE-HS hippocampal samples was higher than that in non-seizure controls. Treatment with kynurenine inhibited glutamatergic activity in non-seizure control samples but not in MTLE-HS samples. However, exogenously applied kynurenic acid inhibited glutamatergic activity in both non-seizure control and MTLE-HS hippocampal samples. Also, levels of kynurenine aminotransferase II and its cofactor pyridoxal phosphate were reduced in MTLE-HS samples. Conclusion and Implications Our findings indicate that altered metabolism of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites in hippocampus could contribute to hyperglutamatergic tone in patients with MTLE-HS.

AB  - Objective: To study the mRNA and protein expression of GRP78 in tumor and serum of the RCC patients and compare with the controls and to correlate the expression with the grade and stage of RCC.
   Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study involving 60 patients planned for radical/partial nephrectomy for primary RCC between July 2017 to June 2019. The RCC and adjacent non-tumorous renal tissues (Control) along with serum samples of patients were collected. Control for the serum samples is from the patients undergoing simple nephrectomy for non-functioning kidney due to benign etiology. The GRP78 expression was studied using RT-PCR for mRNA expression, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for protein expression and using ELISA in serum for both the subjects and controls.
   Results: Mean age of patients was 50.3 years. The mRNA and protein expression of GRP78 in tissue samples were significantly higher in RCC patients as compared to controls (p < 0.001). IHC also demonstrated significantly higher expression in tumour samples as compared to controls (p < 0.001). Circulatory levels of GRP78 in serum samples were also significantly increased (p < 0.0001) in RCC patients in comparison to control subjects. The expression of GRP78 in circulation significantly correlated with the pathological tumor stage (p = 0.03), grade of disease (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The GRP78 in RCC is significantly upregulated both at molecular and protein level expression. The overexpression of GRP78 correlates with the stage and grade of disease, thereby, highlighting its prognostic ability.

AB  - A considerable proportion of children experience a recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) following the first episode. While low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis has been the mainstay for the prevention of UTI, recent evidence raised concerns over their efficacy and safety. Hence, we aim to systematically synthesize evidence on the efficacy and safety of non-antibiotic prophylactic interventions for UTI. Using keywords related to study population (children) and intervention (non-antibiotic), we searched CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until August 2020. RCTs comparing any non-antibiotic interventions with placebo/antibiotics for prevention of UTIs in children were considered eligible. We used a random-effect model to provide pooled estimates. Sixteen trials evaluating 1426 participants were included. Cranberry was as effective as antibiotic prophylaxis (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.56-1.50) but better than placebo/no therapy (RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28-0.80) in reducing UTI recurrence. Probiotic therapy was more effective in reducing UTI recurrence (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29-0.94) when compared with placebo. While probiotic therapy was not better than antibiotics prophylaxis in preventing UTI (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.56-1.21), they have a lower risk of antibiotic resistance (RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21-0.69).
   Conclusion: Cranberry products and probiotics are the two non-antibiotic interventions that have been chiefly evaluated, reduce the risk of UTI recurrence when compared with placebo in children with a normal urinary tract. The findings from this systematic review suggest that while cranberry and probiotics may be used, there is a definite need to identify better and more acceptable non-antibiotic interventions.

AB  - Introduction: There is a lack of large multicentric studies in children with COVID-19 from developing countries. We aimed to describe the clinical profile and risk factors for severe disease in children hospitalized with COVID-19 from India.
   Methods: In this multicentric retrospective study, we retrieved data related to demographic details, clinical features, including the severity of disease, laboratory investigations and outcome.
   Results: We included 402 children with a median (IQR) age of 7 (2-11) years. Fever was the most common symptom, present in 38.2% of children. About 44% had underlying comorbidity. The majority were asymptomatic (144, 35.8%) or mildly symptomatic (219, 54.5%). There were 39 (9.7%) moderate-severe cases and 13 (3.2%) deaths. The laboratory abnormalities included lymphopenia 25.4%, thrombocytopenia 22.1%, transaminitis 26.4%, low total serum protein 34.7%, low serum albumin 37.9% and low alkaline phosphatase 40%. Out of those who were tested, raised inflammatory markers were ferritin 58.9% (56/95), c-reactive protein 33.3% (41/123), procalcitonin 53.5% (46/ 86) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) 76%. The presence of fever, rash, vomiting, underlying comorbidity, increased total leucocyte count, thrombocytopenia, high urea, low total serum protein and raised creactive protein was factors associated with moderate to severe disease.
   Conclusion: Fever was the commonest symptom. We identified additional laboratory abnormalities, namely lymphopenia, low total serum protein and albumin and low alkaline phosphatase. The majority of the children were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. We found high urea and low total serum protein as risk factors for moderate to severe disease for the first time.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy with a high rate of mortality. Multiple studies have individually recognized members of RAP gene family as critical regulators of tumor progression in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. These studies suffer numerous limitations including a small sample size and lack of analysis of various clinicopathological and molecular features. In the current study, we utilized authoritative multi-omics databases to determine the association of RAP gene family expression and detailed molecular and clinicopathological features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All five RAP genes were observed to harbor dysregulated expression in HCC compared to normal liver tissues. RAP2A exhibited strongest ability to differentiate tumors from the normal tissues. RAP2A expression was associated with progressive tumor grade, TP53 and CTNNB1 mutation status. Additionally, RAP2A expression was associated with the alteration of its copy numbers and DNA methylation. RAP2A also emerged as an independent marker for patient prognosis. Further, pathway analysis revealed that RAP2A expression is correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cell composition and oncogenic molecular pathways, such as cell cycle and cellular metabolism.

AB  - Aim: To explore the prevalence of residual symptoms (both depressive and manic) and their correlates in subjects with bipolar disorder in clinical remission. Methodology: This multicentric cross-sectional study included patients in clinical remission recruited across the 14 centers. The patients were evaluated on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) for the prevalence of residual symptoms. A score of <= 7 on both scales defined the presence of residual symptoms. Results: Four-fifth (79.8%) of the participants had residual symptoms, with 130 (16.8%) having only residual depressive symptoms, 74 (9.6%) having only residual manic symptoms, and 413 (53.4%) having both depressive and manic residual symptoms, on HDRS and YMRS. The residual symptoms were related to the polarity of the most recent episode and the lifetime predominant polarity. Higher numbers of lifetime depressive episodes are associated with higher residual depressive symptoms, and higher numbers of lifetime manic episodes are associated with higher chances of having residual manic symptoms. Conclusions: A large proportion of patients with bipolar disorder have residual symptoms during the remission phase. Clinicians need to make efforts to identify and address the same to improve the treatment outcome.

AB  - Background Pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) is a common complication seen in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae. Antifungal therapy, including oral azoles, is commonly used though only surgical resection offers curative benefit. Local administration of amphotericin B, like intracavitary instillation, has been effective in aspergilloma patients though nebulised amphotericin B (nAB) has never been formally assessed.
   Objective The aim of this prospective, non-inferior, open-label, randomised control trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nebulised amphotericin B compared to oral itraconazole therapy in the treatment of PA.
   Patients/Methods Diagnosed cases of PA (n=33) were randomised into the control group receiving oral itraconazole (n=18) and intervention group receiving nebulised amphotericin B (n = 15). Response to treatment was assessed both clinically and radiologically at the end 6 months.
   Results and Conclusion The number of patients showing overall improvement at the end of 6 months in the control arm(oral itraconazole) vs intervention arm(nebulised amphotericin B) was 65% (95% CI 38.3-85.8) and 67%(95% CI 38.4%-88.2%), respectively, in the intention-to-treat and 79% (95% CI 49.2%-95.3%), and 65% (95% CI 38.4%-88.2%), respectively, in the per-protocol analysis. While there was no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control arm in both the analyses, non-inferiority was shown in the per-protocol but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. No major adverse events were noted in either group; however, a significant proportion of patients receiving nAB reported minor cough (40%), which, however, did not lead to discontinuation of therapy in any patients. Nebulised amphotericin B can be an effective therapeutic option for pulmonary aspergilloma patients.

AB  - The primary goal of the unrelated population HLA diversity (UPHD) component of the 17th International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshop was to characterize HLA alleles at maximum allelic-resolution in worldwide populations and re-evaluate patterns of HLA diversity across populations. The UPHD project included HLA genotype and sequence data, generated by various next-generation sequencing methods, from 4,240 individuals collated from 12 different countries. Population data included well-defined large datasets from the USA and smaller samples from Europe, Australia, and Western Asia. Allele and haplotype frequencies varied across populations from distant geographical regions. HLA genetic diversity estimated at 2- and 4-field allelic resolution revealed that diversity at the majority of loci, particularly for European-descent populations, was lower at the 2-field resolution. Several common alleles with identical protein sequences differing only by intronic substitutions were found in distinct haplotypes, revealing a more detailed characterization of linkage between variants within the HLA region. The examination of coding and non-coding nucleotide variation revealed many examples in which almost complete biunivocal relations between common alleles at different loci were observed resulting in higher linkage disequilibrium. Our reference data of HLA profiles characterized at maximum resolution from many populations is useful for anthropological studies, unrelated donor searches, transplantation, and disease association studies.

AB  - The problem of antibiotic resistance has prompted researchers around the globe to search for new antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides are naturally secreted by almost all the living organisms to fight infections and can be safer alternatives to chemical antibiotics. Lactoferrin (LF) is a known antimicrobial protein present in all body secretions. In this study, LF was digested by trypsin, and the resulting hydrolysates were studied with respect to their antimicrobial properties. Among the hydrolysates, a 21-kDa basic fragment of LF (termed lactosmart) showed promise as a new potent antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial studies were performed on various microorganisms including Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as well as fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata. In addition, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding properties of lactosmart were studied using surface plasmon resonance technique in vitro, along with docking of LPS and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The results showed that lactosmart had better inhibitory effects against pathogenic microorganisms compared to LF. The results of docking and MD simulation studies further validated the tighter binding of LPS to lactosmart compared to LF. The two LPS-binding sites have been characterized structurally in detail. Through these studies, it has been demonstrated that in native LF, only one LPS-binding site remains exposed due to its location being on the surface of the molecule. However, due to the generation of the lactosmart molecule, the second LPS-binding site gets exposed too. Since LPS is an essential and conserved part of the bacterial cell wall, the pro-inflammatory response in the human body caused by LPS can be targeted using the newly identified lactosmart. These findings highlight the immense potential of lactosmart in comparison to native LF in antimicrobial defense. We propose that lactosmart can be further developed as an antibacterial, antifungal, and antibiofilm agent.

AB  - Van Esch-O'Driscoll syndrome (VEODS) is a rare cause of syndromic X-linked intellectual disability characterised by short stature, microcephaly, variable degree of intellectual disability, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. To date, heterozygous hypomorphic variants in the gene encoding the DNA Polymerase alpha subunit, POLA1, have been observed in nine patients from five unrelated families with VEODS. We report a three-year-old child with VEODS having borderline intellectual disability due to a novel splice site variant causing exon 6 skipping and reduced POLA1 expression.

AB  - Climate change poses severe threats to the social, cultural, and economic integrity of indigenous smallholder subsistence farmers, who are intricately linked with their natural ecosystems. Sauria Paharia, a vulnerable indigenous community of Jharkhand, India, are smallholder farmers facing food and nutrition insecurity and have limited resources to cope with climate change. Eighteen villages of Godda district of Jharkhand inhabited by Sauria Paharia community were randomly selected to conduct a mixed methods study. In 11 out of 18 study villages, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) to examine the perception of this indigenous community regarding climate change and its impact on agroforestry and dietary diversity. In all 18 villages, household and agricultural surveys were conducted to derive quantitative estimates of household food consumption patterns and agroforestry diversity, which were triangulated with the qualitative data collected through the FGDs. The FGD data revealed that the community attributed local climatic variability in the form of low and erratic rainfall with long dry spells, to reduced crop productivity, diversity and food availability from forests and waterbodies. Declining agroforestry-produce and diversity were reported to cause reduced household income and shifts from subsistence agricultural economy to migratory unskilled wage laboring leading to household food insecurity. These perceptions were supported by quantitative estimates of habitual food consumption patterns which revealed a predominance of cereals over other food items and low agroforestry diversity (Food Accessed Diversity Index of 0.21 +/- 0.15). The adaptation strategies to cope with climate variability included use of climate-resilient indigenous crop varieties for farming, seed conservation and access to indigenous forest foods and weeds for consumption during adverse situations and lean periods. There were mixed views on cultivation of hybrid crops as an adaptation strategy which could impact the sustained utilization of indigenous food systems. Promoting sustainable adaptation strategies, with adequate knowledge and technology, have the potential to improve farmresilience, income, household food security and dietary diversity in this population.

AB  - Background Ending the global tobacco epidemic is a defining challenge in global health. Timely and comprehensive estimates of the prevalence of smoking tobacco use and attributable disease burden are needed to guide tobacco control efforts nationally and globally.
   Methods We estimated the prevalence of smoking tobacco use and attributable disease burden for 204 countries and territories, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2019 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We modelled multiple smoking-related indicators from 3625 nationally representative surveys. We completed systematic reviews and did Bayesian meta-regressions for 36 causally linked health outcomes to estimate non-linear dose-response risk curves for current and former smokers. We used a direct estimation approach to estimate attributable burden, providing more comprehensive estimates of the health effects of smoking than previously available.
   Findings Globally in 2019, 1.14 billion (95% uncertainty interval 1.13-1.16) individuals were current smokers, who consumed 7.41 trillion (7.11-7.74) cigarette-equivalents of tobacco in 2019. Although prevalence of smoking had decreased significantly since 1990 among both males (27.5% [26. 5-28.5] reduction) and females (37.7% [35.4-39.9] reduction) aged 15 years and older, population growth has led to a significant increase in the total number of smokers from 0.99 billion (0.98-1.00) in 1990. Globally in 2019, smoking tobacco use accounted for 7.69 million (7.16-8.20) deaths and 200 million (185-214) disability-adjusted life-years, and was the leading risk factor for death among males (20.2% [19.3-21.1] of male deaths). 6.68 million [86.9%] of 7.69 million deaths attributable to smoking tobacco use were among current smokers.
   Interpretation In the absence of intervention, the annual toll of 7.69 million deaths and 200 million disability-adjusted life-years attributable to smoking will increase over the coming decades. Substantial progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking tobacco use has been observed in countries from all regions and at all stages of development, but a large implementation gap remains for tobacco control. Countries have a dear and urgent opportunity to pass strong, evidence-based policies to accelerate reductions in the prevalence of smoking and reap massive health benefits for their citizens.

AB  - Purpose: We evaluated respiratory triggered unidirectional single-shot echo-planar imaging (u-SSEPI) as a timesaving measure in diffusion imaging of the upper abdomen. Specifically, we compared the ADC values obtained from unidirectional DWI (u-SSEPI) and routine DWI (4t-SSEPI) and also the diagnostic accuracies of unidirectional and routine DWI sequences in the identification of focal liver lesions in the setting of chronic liver disease (CLD). Materials and methods: This prospective, IRB approved study, included 48 patients of CLD who underwent-DCEMRI on a 1.5 T scanner for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) workup. In addition to 4t-SSEPI, u-SSEPI was acquired with the diffusion sensitising gradient being applied in only one direction; keeping all other parameters same as 4t-SSEPI. Two blinded radiologists evaluated the DWI studies for image quality and detection of liver lesions. A composite gold standard was established using DCE-MRI, follow-up imaging and patient clinical details. The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the liver, spleen and the lesions were compared between the two sequences. ROC analysis evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ADC from both the sequences in identifying HCC. Results: Eighty-eight lesions were identified using the composite gold standard. u-SSEPI resulted in 3 times faster image acquisition. No statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the unidirectional and routine DWI sequences for image quality parameters and lesion detection rates. Lesion wise comparison of the ADC values from both the sequences was not statistically different (p = 0.8) with a coefficient of variation = 12-14 %. The Bland- Altman plots and the Passing-Bablock regression analysis demonstrated a systematic and proportional bias between the ADC values obtained. The AUC of the ROC curve, however, was 0.63-observer1; 0.62-oobserver2 for routine DWI and 0.65; 0.62 for unidirectional DWI when ADC was used to identify HCC (the AUCs were not statistically different (p = 0.6-0.8)). Conclusion: No significant differences were demonstrated in the diagnostic accuracies of unidirectional and routine DWI in the diagnosis of HCC. Unidirectional diffusion may be further evaluated in other organs where diffusion is isotropic, especially in respiratory triggered sequences where the imaging time dividend is significant.

AB  - Background: As respiratory system compliances are heterogenous, we hypothesized that individualized intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure titration on the basis of lowest driving pressure can reduce postoperative atelectasis and improve intraoperative oxygenation and postoperative lung functions.
   Methods: Eighty-two adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were recruited in this randomized trial. In the titrated positive end-expiratory pressure group, positive end-expiratory pressure was titrated incrementally until lowest driving pressure was achieved, and the same procedure was repeated in every 2 hours. In the fixed positive end-expiratory pressure group, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH(2)O was used throughout the surgery. The primary objective of this study was lung ultrasound score noted at the completion of surgery and 5 minutes after extubation at 12 lung areas bilaterally.
   Results: Mean (standard deviation) age of the recruited patients were 43.8 (17.3) years, and 50% of all patients (41 of 82) were women. Lung ultrasound aeration scores were significantly higher in the fixed positive end-expiratory pressure group both before and after extubation (median [interquartile range] 7 [5-8] vs 4 [2-6] before extubation and 8 [6-9] vs 5 [3-7] after extubation; P = .0004 and P = .0011, respectively). Incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was significantly lower in the titrated positive end-expiratory pressure group (absolute risk difference [95% CI] 17.1% [32.5%-1.7%]; P = .034). The number of patients requiring postoperative supplemental oxygen therapy to maintain SpO(2) >95%, the requirement of intraoperative rescue therapy, and the duration of hospital stay were similar in both of the groups.
   Conclusion: Intraoperative titrated positive end-expiratory pressure reduced postoperative lung atelectasis in adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Further large clinical trials are required to know its effect on postoperative pulmonary complications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: BRASH syndrome, a relatively new entity, has been described in the recent literature. It is defined as a combination of bradycardia, renal failure, atrioventricular nodal blockade, shock, and hyperkalemia. Although it is apparent that clinical symptomatology includes shock, it is still unclear whether all patients will initially present with all five components mentioned in the BRASH acronym. Case Report: An elderly woman presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis with bradycardia, which was refractory to antikalemic measures and atropine. The montage of clinical features put together showed a clear picture of BRASH syndrome, which helped us to streamline the management and achieve a better patient outcome. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Renal failure with various metabolic derangements is commonly seen in the ED. We should be aware of this new clinical entity, as its incidence will certainly increase, and the management is a bit different. Prognosis is excellent with timely recognition and management of this rare clinical entity. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Study Design. Retrospective, comparative.
   Objective. The aim of this study was to design an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol for elective lumbar spine fusion by posterior approach, and to compare the results after ERAS implementation in patients undergoing elective lumbar spine fusion with conventional perioperative care.
   Summary of Background Data. Despite wide adoption in other surgical disciplines, ERAS has only been recently implemented in spine surgery. The integrated multidisciplinary approach of ERAS aims to reduce surgical stress to achieve better outcomes.
   Methods. Hospital records of adult patients who underwent one- to three-level elective lumbar spine fusion by posterior approach at a single center were retrospectively studied. An ERAS protocol was designed based on the prevalent hospital practices, local resources and supportive evidence from literature. The ERAS protocol was implemented at our institute in December 2016-dividing patients into pre-ERAS and post-ERAS groups. The outcome measures for comparison were: length of hospital stay (LOS), postoperative complications, 60-day readmission rate, 60-day reoperation rate, and patient-reported outcome measures (visual analogue scale [VAS] and Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] score) at stipulated time intervals.
   Results. A total of 812 patients were included - 496 in the pre-ERAS group and 316 in the post-ERAS group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in baseline demographic, clinical, and surgery-related variables. Patients in the post-ERAS group had a significantly shorter LOS (2.94 vs. 3.68 days). The rate of postoperative complications (13.5% vs. 11.7%), 60-day readmission (1.8% vs. 2.2%), and 60-day reoperation (1.2% vs. 1.3%) did not differ significantly between the pre-ERAS and post-ERAS groups. The VAS and ODI scores, similar at baseline, were significantly lower in the post-ERAS group (VAS: 49.8 +/- 12.0 vs. 44 +/- 10.8, ODI: 31.6 +/- 14.2 vs. 28 +/- 12.8) at 4 weeks after surgery. This difference however was not significant at intermediate-term follow-up (6 months and 12 months).
   Conclusion. Implementation of an ERAS protocol is feasible for elective lumbar spine fusion, and leads to shorter LOS and improved early pain and functional outcome scores.

AB  - Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the largest environmental health risk in India. All previous studies in India focused on PM10 exposure for acute impact assessment; even the single study examining the PM2.5 acute exposure impact used data from a single site. Here we estimated the impact of acute PM2.5 exposure on non-trauma all-cause mortality in the megacity Delhi using a quasi-Poisson regression model and satellitederived high-resolution (1-km) exposure data. Our satellite-PM2.5 dataset was calibrated and validated against coincident measurements from ground-based reference-grade monitors. This allowed us to minimize exposure misclassification, which otherwise would have happened due to reliance on limited ground-based monitoring sites with a large spatial gap. The annual average (median) PM2.5 exposure (with interquartile range) during this period was 108.5 (63.5-133.6) mu g/m3. We found a 0.52% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.42-0.62%) increase in non-trauma all-cause mortality for every 10 mu g/m3 increase in 6-days cumulative PM2.5 exposure with a relatively higher impact on men (0.57%, 95% CI: 0.46-0.69%) than on women (0.52%, 0.38-0.65%). The impact of PM2.5 was almost two-fold higher in winter (0.55%, 0.45-0.66%) per 10 mu g/m3 increase in PM2.5 than in summer (0.29%, 0.14-0.45%). The district-level aggregated 6-days cumulative PM2.5 exposure had the largest impact on mortality (1.10%, 0.84-1.35%). The impact of acute exposure to PM2.5 on all-cause mortality was larger than that of PM10 exposure (from previous studies). Our study adds to the global evidence pool, fills the critical gap of evidence of acute PM2.5 exposure impact on mortality in India, and most importantly, demonstrates the significance of disaggregated exposure assessment using satellite data to reduce exposure misclassification in health impact studies, particularly in data-poor regions. Main finding: We estimate a 0.52% increase in all-cause mortality for every 10 mu g/m3 rise in short-term PM2.5 exposure with a two-fold higher impact in the winter than in the summer and a higher impact on male (0.57%) than on female (0.52%) in the megacity Delhi.

AB  - Background Ga-68-DOTA-NaI-octreotide (DOTANOC) is a promising new alternative to F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for imaging inflammation in cardiac sarcoidosis. The aim of the study was to compare Ga-68-DOTANOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in patients with clinical suspicion of cardiac sarcoidosis. Methods and results Patients with extracardiac sarcoidosis and clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement underwent Ga-68-DOTANOC cardiac PET/CT, myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (MPS) and CMR (T2-weighted and delayed gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images). The patients were screened using revised criteria of Japanese circulation society. Presence of perfusion defects on MPS, abnormal myocardial uptake on Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT and characteristic pattern of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with or without T2 hyperintensity on CMR was considered positive. Results Seventeen patients (13 male and 4 female) were included in the study. Out of the 17 patients, both CMR and PET were positive in 11 and both were negative in 2. In the remaining 4 patients, CMR was positive but PET was normal. Thus, PET and CMR were concordant in 13 (76.5%) patients and discordant in 4 (23.5%). Intermodality agreement was fair (Cohen's kappa = 0.39). Conclusion LGE on CMR is superior to Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT for detecting cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis and there is fair concordance between the two. However, since LGE does not specifically differentiate between inflammation and fibrosis, Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT may be better than CMR in identifying patients with active inflammation, since it directly targets inflammatory cells and can have a complementary role to CMR.

AB  - Objective Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) during the first few months of life is challenging and necessitates aggressive treatment, including surgery. Because the most common causes of DRE in infancy are related to extensive developmental anomalies, surgery often entails extensive tissue resections or disconnection. The literature on "ultra-early" epilepsy surgery is sparse, with limited data concerning efficacy controlling the seizures, and safety. The current study's goal is to review the safety and efficacy of ultra-early epilepsy surgery performed before the age of 3 months.
   Methods To achieve a large sample size and external validity, a multinational, multicenter retrospective study was performed, focusing on epilepsy surgery for infants younger than 3 months of age. Collected data included epilepsy characteristics, surgical details, epilepsy outcome, and complications.
   Results Sixty-four patients underwent 69 surgeries before the age of 3 months. The most common pathologies were cortical dysplasia (28), hemimegalencephaly (17), and tubers (5). The most common procedures were hemispheric surgeries (48 procedures). Two cases were intentionally staged, and one was unexpectedly aborted. Nearly all patients received blood products. There were no perioperative deaths and no major unexpected permanent morbidities. Twenty-five percent of patients undergoing hemispheric surgeries developed hydrocephalus. Excellent epilepsy outcome (International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE] grade I) was achieved in 66% of cases over a median follow-up of 41 months (19-104 interquartile range [IQR]). The number of antiseizure medications was significantly reduced (median 2 drugs, 1-3 IQR, p < .0001). Outcome was not significantly associated with the type of surgery (hemispheric or more limited resections).
   Significance Epilepsy surgery during the first few months of life is associated with excellent seizure control, and when performed by highly experienced teams, is not associated with more permanent morbidity than surgery in older infants. Thus surgical treatment should not be postponed to treat DRE in very young infants based on their age.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Clinical care quality improvement (QI) strategies are critical to prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is limited evidence regarding which components of the health system-, clinician-, and patient-based QI strategies contribute to their impact on CVD.
   OBJECTIVES To identify, map, and organize evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of cardiovascular QI strategies that seek to improve outcomes in patients with CVD.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Eight electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, ProQuest, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched for studies published between January 1, 2009, and October 25, 2019. Eligible study designs included randomized trials and preintervention and postintervention evaluations. Descriptive findings of included studies were reported using several frameworks to map the intervention components stratified by target population, setting, outcomes, and overall results.
   FINDINGS From 8066 screened titles and abstracts, 456 unique studies with 150 148 unique patients (38.1% women and 61.9% men; mean [SD] age, 64.6 [7.1] years) were identified, including 427 randomized trials, 21 quasi-randomized studies, and 8 preintervention and postintervention studies. Of 336 studies from 45 countries that were classified, 255 (75.9%) were from high-income countries; 68 (20.2%), upper-middle-income countries; 13 (3.9%), lower-middle-income countries; and 0, low-income countries, with diverse clinical settings and target patient populations (post-myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure). Patient support (311 studies), information communication technology (ICT) for health (78 studies), community support (18 studies), supervision (15 studies), and high-intensity training (14 studies) were the most commonly evaluated QI strategies. Other strategies were group problem-solving (7 studies), printed information (5 studies), strengthening infrastructure (4 studies), and financial incentives (3 studies). Patient support, ICT for health, training, and community support were strategies that had been evaluated the most for clinical end points and showed modest associations with several clinical outcomes. The other strategies did not have outcome-driven evaluations reported. Group problem-solving was associated with improved patient self-care and quality of life. Strengthening infrastructure was associated with improved treatment satisfaction. Printed information and financial incentives showed no meaningful effect.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This systematic review found that substantial variations exist in the types, effectiveness, and implementation of QI strategies for patients with CVD. A comprehensive map of QI strategies created by this study would be useful for researchers to identify where new knowledge is needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Outcome-driven evaluations and long-term studies are needed, particularly in low-income settings, to better understand the effects of QI strategies on prevention and control of CVD.

AB  - Background and Aim Risk stratification beyond the endoscopic classification of esophageal varices (EVs) to predict first episode of variceal bleeding (VB) is currently limited in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD). We aimed to assess if machine learning (ML) could be used for predicting future VB more accurately.
   Methods In this retrospective analysis, data from patients of cACLD with EVs, laboratory parameters and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) were used to generate an extreme-gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to predict the risk of VB. The performance characteristics of ML and endoscopic classification were compared in internal and external validation cohorts. Bleeding rates were estimated in subgroups identified upon risk stratification with combination of model and endoscopic classification.
   Results Eight hundred twenty-eight patients of cACLD with EVs, predominantly related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (28.6%), alcohol (23.7%) and hepatitis B (23.1%) were included, with 455 (55%) having the high-risk varices. Over a median follow-up of 24 (12-43) months, 163 patients developed VB. The accuracy of machine learning (ML) based model to predict future VB was 98.7 (97.4-99.5)%, 93.7 (88.8-97.2)%, and 85.7 (82.1-90.5)% in derivation (n = 497), internal validation (n = 149), and external validation (n = 182) cohorts, respectively, which was better than endoscopic classification [58.9 (55.5-62.3)%] alone. Patients stratified high risk on both endoscopy and model had 1-year and 3-year bleeding rates of 31-43% and 64-85%, respectively, whereas those stratified as low risk on both had 1-year and 3-year bleeding rates of 0-1.6% and 0-3.4%, respectively. Endoscopic classification and LSM were the major determinants of model's performance.
   Conclusion Application of ML model improved the performance of endoscopic stratification to predict VB in patients with cACLD with EVs.

AB  - Transcutaneous measurement of bilirubin is being used for neonatal jaundice. Its utility during phototherapy in preterm babies is not established. The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy of transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurement in comparison to total serum bilirubin in preterm newborns at admission and during phototherapy at the covered skin area (glabella). It was a prospective observational study and conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital from January 2017 to January 2019. One hundred eligible preterm neonates were enrolled. Babies who were very sick, with poor peripheral circulation, edematous, having conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with major congenital malformations, already received phototherapy or exchange transfusion were excluded. Paired total serum bilirubin and transcutaneous bilirubin were measured at admission and 6 h and 24 h during phototherapy. TcB was measured from the area (glabella) covered by an eye protector during phototherapy. The sample for TsB was taken within 10 min of TcB measurement. The mean differences between TsB and TcB values at admission and 6 h and 24 h of phototherapywere - 0.005 (0.353) mg/dl, - 0.350 (0.611) mg/dl, and - 0.592 (0.353) mg/ dl, respectively. At admission or before starting of phototherapy, the difference (TsB-TcB) was statistically not significant (p = .125), while the difference in these values was statistically significant at 6 h and 24 h of phototherapy.
   Conclusion: TcB measurements from the covered skin area in jaundiced preterm infants during phototherapy were not correlated with TsB and cannot be used as an alternate of serum bilirubin testing.

AB  - Background: Management of acute pulmonary hypertension in the Emergency Department(ED) can be challenging. The treatment is specialised, requires rapid identification and correction of the precipitating cause; failing which the patient enters a vortex of deterioration. We describe a lesser-known cause for the same, Thiamine responsive acute pulmonary hypertension (TRAPH) syndrome where timely appropriate treatment can result in dramatic improvement.
   Methodology: Medical records with ICD code E51.12 (Wet Beriberi) from Mar 2018 to Mar 2020 were screened. The data regarding presenting symptoms, initial vitals, lab and radiological investigations, and treatment received were retrieved from patient files and the Hospital Informatics System, entered into an MS Excel sheet and compared.
   Results: The study includes eight cases, which we believe to be TRAPH syndrome. Majority were young adult males, ethanol users. All patients presented with acute shortness of breath with tachypnea and shock index more than 0.9. Gross right atrioventricular dilatation, tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension was identified in echocardiography. The initial blood gas revealed median pH 6.98 (IQR 6.81-7.09), Bicarbonate 3.4 meq/L (IQR 2.5-5) and lactate 172 mg/dL (IQR 132-200) which improved within 12-16 h of admission. Patients received median 400 mg IV Thiamine. The mean duration of ICU stay was 2.5 days and total hospital stay was 7 days.
   Conclusion: Thiamine Responsive Acute Pulmonary Hypertension (TRAPH) Syndrome is an under-recognised entity which should be included in differentials for acute right ventricular dysfunction in the ED. Early diagnosis and rapid protocolised management of the same can cause quick recovery of patients. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To determine the demographic profile, clinical features and surgical outcomes of giant retinal tear (GRT) related retinal detachments (RD) in children. Methods In this retrospective study, medical records of children aged 14 years and below, who underwent surgery for RD at our centre in the last 5 years were reviewed. Among these, we selected medical records of children with RDs with GRT, and examined the coloured retinal drawings, ultrawidefield photographs and/or surgical videos. Results Out of 1536 medical records, 91 eyes of 87 children (5.6% of all RDs) were included. Mean age was 10.21 +/- 3.08 years with male:female ratio of 8.6:1. The most common aetiologies for GRTs were high myopia (28 cases-32.18%) and trauma (25 cases-28.73%). Bilateral RD were possibly present in 29/87 (33.3%) cases. Six months follow up data was available for 82/91 eyes. Overall retinal re-attachment was achieved in 52/82 (63.41%) eyes; in 33/82 (40.24%) eyes retinal attachment could be achieved by a single surgery. Absence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) (OR: 2.44, p-value:0.03, 95%CI: 1.21-5.08) or PVR-A (OR: 3.62, p-value: 0.03, 95%CI: 1.52-12.26) and presence of preexisting posterior vitreous detachment (OR: 7.14, p-value: 0.02, 95%CI: 1.31-38.73) were associated with successful retinal re-attachment after single surgery. Median time to presentation of cases succeeding after 1 surgery was 10 days. Ambulatory vision (1/60 and better) at final followup could be achieved in 45/82 (54.88%) eyes. Conclusion GRT relatedRDs constitute a significant proportion of paediatric RDs. Anatomical success can currently be achieved in a large number of cases. Early surgery, absence of PVR and presence of PVD are associated with higher surgical success.

AB  - Aims: Between 2006 and 2015, the trends in prevalence of Hyperglycemia in pregnancy (HIP); Gestational diabetes (GDM), Diabetes in Pregnancy (DIP), Pre existing diabetes (PDM) and GDM risk factors were studied in 30,692 pregnancies among Asian Indian women.
   Methods: GDM (n = 4089) and DIP (n = 259) diagnoses were by 75 g OGTT, while PDM (n = 103) was identified by ICD code O24. Women with DIP and PDM were grouped together as pre-gestational diabetes (PGDM n = 362). Crude and age-adjusted prevalence trend analysis by Poisson and Jointpoint regression models respectively, were done in GDM and PGDM groups.
   Results: During study years, the GDM prevalence by WHO 1999 and modified IADPSG criteria, showed decreasing and static trends respectively, while PGDM prevalence remained static. In a subgroup of 2560 women, mean BMI increased from 24.12 +/- 4.16 in year 2011 to 25.18 +/- 4.7 Kg/m(2) in 2015 (p < 0.014), but this rise had no impact on GDM prevalence. GDM risk factors; maternal age, gravidity >= 3, previous GDM and abortion, high income, diabetes and hypertension in family, were higher in 2011-2015 than in 2006-2010 period. On multi-variate analysis, BMI was not an independent GDM risk factor.
   Conclusion: Despite rise in conventional GDM risk factors, HIP prevalence was static for a decade among pregnant Asian Indian women. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) has been employed in multiple countermeasure protocols against post spaceflight orthostatic hypotension. However, protocols utilizing oscillatory LBNP (oLBNP) have not been explored in this regard. oLBNP has shown promise in few studies to have good tolerance in conditions of hypovolemic stress and since the negative suction is only phasic, the extravascular fluid shifts associated with negative suction are also hypothesized to be less. Our study addressed the paucity of information on oLBNP by investigating the cardiovascular and neurohormonal effects of oLBNP of -15 and -45 mm Hg in 40 healthy adult males (mean age = 29.6 +/- 4.7 years, BMI = 25.1 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2)). After supine rest of 10 min (baseline), oLBNP was applied at -15 mm Hg and -45 mm Hg for 10 min each with a gap of 10 min. Blood sample for neurohormonal analysis was collected at the end of baseline and after each oLBNP exposure. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and end tidal CO2 (EtCO2) were recorded for the entire duration. Serum angiotensin II (ATII), antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were analyzed using ELISA. On comparison with the baseline [SBP: 114 +/- 2.38, MBP: 75.8 +/- 2.16 mm Hg] there was a significant fall in SBP on application of -15 mm Hg as well as -45 mm Hg oLBNP [-15 oLBNP: 107.4 +/- 2.34 mm Hg; -45 oLBNP: 105.3 +/- 2.28 mm Hg], while there was no significant difference observed in the DBP. There was a significant increase in the heart rate at both -15 [77.29(72.75-85.65) BPM] and -45 mm Hg [81.29 (73.93-86.09) BPM] oLBNP as compared to the baseline [70.41(64.32-79.80) BPM]. No significant difference in the serum ATII, ADH and ANP after 10 min of application of -15 or -45 mm Hg oLBNP as compared to baseline was observed. In conclusion, oLBNP induced legward pooling of blood causes a fall in the blood pressure which initiates the neural reflex mechanisms, most important being the baroreflex and the cardiopulmonary reflex. However, since there was no significant difference in the serum ATII, ADH and ANP from baseline, this suggests that 10 min oLBNP up to -45 mm Hg results in recruitment of cardiovascular neural reflex response but it does not evoke neurohormonal responses which mediate long term volume changes.

AB  - Stroke is one of the world's leading causes of disability and death. Antiplatelet agents are administered to acute ischemic stroke patients as secondary prevention. Clopidogrel involves biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes into an active metabolite, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can influence the efficacy of this biotransformation. Despite the therapeutic advantages of aspirin, there is significant inter-individual heterogeneity in response to this antiplatelet drug. In this clinical review, the recent advances in the biomarkers of antiplatelet agents in acute ischemic stroke are discussed. The studies reviewed herein highlight the clinical relevance of antiplatelet resistance, pharmacotherapy of antiplatelet agents predicting drug response, strategies for identifying aspirin resistance, pharmacogenetic variants of antiplatelet agents, miRNAs, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers toward the personalized approach in the management of acute ischemic stroke. The precise pathways contributing to antiplatelet resistance are not very well known but are presumably multi-factorial. It is essential to understand the clinical relevance of clopidogrel and aspirin-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Prasugrel is a next-generation antiplatelet agent that prevents ADP-platelet activation by binding irreversibly to P2Y12 receptor. There are sporadic reports of prasugrel resistance and polymorphisms in the Platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1 (PEAR1) that may contribute to a change in the pharmacodynamics response. Ticagrelor, a direct-acting P2Y12-receptor antagonist, is easily absorbed and partly metabolized to major AR-C124910XX metabolite (ARC). Ticagrelor's primary active metabolite, ARC124910XX (ARC), is formed via the most abundant hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. The integration of specific biomarkers, genotype as well as phenotype-related data in antiplatelet therapy stratification in patients with acute ischemic stroke will be of great clinical significance and could be used as a guiding tool for more effective, personalized therapy.

AB  - Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative storage disorders associated with devastating visual prognosis, with an incidence of 1/1,000,000 in the United States and comparatively higher incidence in European countries. The pathophysiological mechanisms causing NCLs occur due to enzymatic or transmembrane defects in various sub-cellular organelles including lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytoplasmic vesicles. NCLs are categorized into different types depending upon the underlying cause i.e., soluble lysosomal enzyme deficiencies or non-enzymatic deficiencies (functions of identified proteins), which are sub-divided based on an axial classification system. In this review, we have evaluated the current evidence in the literature and reported the incidence rates, underlying mechanisms and currently available management protocols for these rare set of neuroophthalmological disorders. Additionally, we also highlighted the potential therapies under development that can expand the treatment of these rare disorders beyond symptomatic relief.

AB  - Head and Neck tumors are metabolically highly altered solid tumors. Head and Neck cancer cells may utilise different metabolic pathways for energy production. Whereas, glycolysis is the major source coupled with oxidative phosphorylation in a metabolic symbiosis manner that results in the proliferation and metastasis in Head and Neck Cancer. The monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) constitute a family of 14 members among which MCT1-4 are responsible for transporting monocarboxylates such as L-lactate and pyruvate, and ketone bodies across the plasma membrane. Additionally, MCTs mediate absorption and distribution of monocarboxylates across the cell membrane. Head and Neck cancer cells are highly glycolytic in nature and generate significant amount of lactic acid in the extracellular environment. In such condition, MCTs play a critical role in the regulation of pH, and lactate shuttle maintenance. The intracellular lactate accumulation is harmful for the cells since it drastically lowers the intracellular pH. MCTs facilitate the export of lactate out of the cell. The lactate export mediated by MCTs is crucial for the cancer cells survival. Therefore, targeting MCTs is important and could be a potential therapeutic approach to control growth of the tumor.

AB  - Data on genetic characteristics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates exhibiting decreased susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in India is deficient. In this study, we have sequenced penA, porB, mtrR and ponA and blaTEM genes in 70 clinical isolates of NG with varying ceftriaxone MICs. Amongst these, 22 (31.4%) were PPNG. Additionally, N. gonorrheae Multiantigen Sequence Typing was performed. Fisher exact and x2 were used to evaluate significance of mutations with MICs. A total of six non-mosaic penA (Penicillin binding protein 2 [PBP2]) amino acid patterns were seen (II, IV, IX, XII, XIX, XXII) of which, pattern IX was significantly associated with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone. Other significant associations were noted in porB & mtrR genes. There were no mutations in blaTEM gene. ST6069 was significantly associated with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone. To conclude, development of decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone in gonococci involves cumulation of different mutations in the four chromosomal genes investigated. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is first-line therapy for IgA nephropathy (IgAN). There is a paucity of information on the predictors and magnitude of response to this treatment.
   Methods: In a prospective study, treatment-naive patients with IgAN with urinary protein >= 1 g/d and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) received supportive treatment including ACEi (ramipril) or ARB (losartan) in patients intolerant to ACEi, and optimal blood pressure (BP) control to <= 130/80 mm Hg, with a follow-up of 6 months. The primary outcome was remission of proteinuria. Complete remission (CR) was defined as proteinuria < 0.5 g/d and partial remission (PR) as proteinuria < 1g/d with at least a 50% decline from the baseline with stable renal function (<= 25% reduction in eGFR).
   Results: A total of 96 patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 33.3 +/- 10.2 years, baseline eGFR 74.0 +/- 30.9 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and urinary protein 2.6 +/- 1.2 g/d. In all, 71.9% patients received >= 75% of the maximum approved dose of ACEi/ARB. Remission was observed in 36.5% (CR, 6.3%) patients at 3 months and in 55.2% (CR, 31.3%) at 6 months. Patients who failed to achieve remission had lower baseline eGFR (P = 0.002) and serum albumin levels (P< 0.001), asymptomatic hyperuricemia (P < 0.001), and higher proteinuria (P = 0.076). E1 (P= 0.053) and T1/T2 (P = 0.009) lesions were more frequent on histology. The ACEi/ARB had to be discontinued in 17 (17.7%) patients. These patients were older (P= 0.085) with lower eGFR (P < 0.002) and serum albumin levels (P = 0.001) and more E1 (P = 0.012) and T1/T2 (P = 0.001) lesions on histology.
   Conclusion: Meticulous supportive therapy with optimal use of ACEi/ARB achieved remission in half of IgAN patients in this study. Increasing the treatment duration to 6 months improved remission rates. Patients with severe clinical and histological disease were less likely to tolerate and respond to treatment with RAS blockade.

AB  - BackgroundCytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has recently emerged as a viable management option for peritoneal surface malignancy (PSM). CRS and HIPEC is a complex, multidisciplinary and resource-intensive surgical procedure. It has a steep learning curve and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The expertise is mostly limited to few dedicated high-volume centers located in developed countries. We present a single institutional experience of 232 cases of CRS and HIPEC performed at a tertiary care cancer center in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC).MethodsA multidisciplinary PSM program was initiated in 2015 at a high-volume public-sector tertiary care cancer center in North India catering largely to patients belonging to low- and middle-income groups. Perioperative protocols were developed, and a prospective structured database was created to capture data. All patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC between January 2015 and December 2020 were identified, and the data was retrospectively analyzed for clinical spectrum, surgical details, and perioperative morbidity and mortality.ResultsTwo hundred and thirty-two patients underwent CRS and HIPEC during the study period. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (56.5%) was the most common malignancy treated, followed by pseudomyxoma peritonei (18.5%), colorectal carcinoma (13.4%), and malignant mesothelioma (5.6%). Optimal CRS could be achieved in 94.4% of patients. Cisplatin and mitomycin were the most common drugs used for HIPEC. A total of 28.0% of patients had morbidity including deep vein thrombosis, subacute intestinal obstruction, sepsis, burst abdomen, lymphocele, urinoma, acute renal failure, and enterocutaneous fistula. The overall treatment-related mortality was 3.5%.ConclusionsResults of the current study indicate that it is feasible to establish a successful CRS and HIPEC program for PSM in government-funded hospitals in LMIC facing resource constraints. The most common indication for CRS and HIPEC were carcinoma of the ovary followed by pseudomyxoma peritonei and colorectal carcinoma. Overall morbidity and mortality in the current series are comparable to global standards, reported from high-income countries. A protocol-based multidisciplinary team approach, optimal patient selection, and surgical expertise can help achieve optimal outcomes in government-funded hospitals in LMIC.

AB  - Fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been considered appropriate for the management of aplastic anemia owing to their proliferative potential. Bone marrow recovery was possible in some cases; the engraftment potential of these cells, however was unsatisfactory, possibly due to the availability of a smaller number of these cells from a single fetus. The present study explores how we can expand fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells under in vitro conditions. We isolated mononuclear cells from fetal liver and hematopoietic stem cells were identified and analyzed by cell surface marker CD34. CD34(+) fetal liver HSPCs cells were separated by magnetic cell sorting positive selection method. HSPCs (CD34(+)) were cultured by using 5 cytokines, stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte macrophages-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) and erythropoietin (EPO), in 4 different combinations along with supplements, in serum-free culture media for 21 days. Cell viability continued to be greater than 90% throughout 21 days of culture. The cells expanded best in a combination of media, supplements and 5 cytokines, namely SCF, FLT-3, IL6, EPO and GM-CSF to yield a large number of total (CD34(+) & CD34(-)) cells. Even though the total number of nucleated cells increased in culture significantly, levels of CD34 antigen expression declined steadily over this period.

AB  - Aim and objective Systemic inflammation has been documented in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However studies on childhood OSA and systemic inflammation are limited. This study aimed to determine the relation between OSA in overweight/obese children and various inflammatory markers.
   Material and methods In this cross sectional study, we enrolled 247 overweight/ obese children from pediatric outpatient services. We evaluated demographic and clinical details, anthropometric parameters, body composition and estimation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, IL-23, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), high sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and leptin levels. Overnight polysomnography was performed.
   Findings A total of 247 children (190 with OSA and 57 without OSA) were enrolled. OSA was documented on polysomnography in 40% of patients. We observed significantly high values body mass index, waist circumference (WC), % body fat, fasting blood glucose (FBG), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphate, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in children with OSA. Inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-18, MIF, Hs CRP, TNF- alpha, PAI-1, and leptin levels were significantly higher in OSA patients (p<0.05). There was strong positive correlation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-23, MIF, Hs CRP, TNF-A, PAI-1 and leptin with BMI, % body fat, AHI, fasting Insulin, triglyceride, FBG, WC, HOMA-IR, AST and ALT.
   Conclusion Children with OSA have increased obesity, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. Further studies are require to confirm our findings and evaluate their utility in diagnosis of OSAs, assessing severity and possible interventions.

AB  - Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells. Similar to other forms of cancer, it demands prompt diagnosis for reducing the risk of mortality. The conventional diagnostic tools are resource-intense and hence, these solutions are not easily scalable for extending their reach to the masses. Advancements in deep learning have led to rapid developments in affordable, resource optimized, easily deployable computer-assisted solutions. This work proposes a unified framework for MM diagnosis using microscopic blood cell imaging data that addresses the key challenges of inter-class visual similarity of healthy versus cancer cells and that of the label noise of the dataset. To extract class distinctive features, we propose projection loss to maximize the projection of a sample's activation on the respective class vector besides imposing orthogonality constraints on the class vectors. This projection loss is used along with the cross-entropy loss to design a dual branch architecture that helps achieve improved performance and provides scope for targeting the label noise problem. Based on this architecture, two methodologies have been proposed to correct the noisy labels. A coupling classifier has also been proposed to resolve the conflicts in the dual-branch architecture's predictions. We have utilized a large dataset of 72 subjects (26 healthy and 46 MM cancer) containing a total of 74996 images (including 34555 training cell images and 40441 test cell images). This is so far the most extensive dataset on Multiple Myeloma cancer ever reported in the literature. An ablation study has also been carried out. The proposed architecture performs best with a balanced accuracy of 94 . 17% on binary cell classification of healthy versus cancer in the comparative performance with ten state-of-the-art architectures. Extensive experiments on two additional publicly available datasets of two different modalities have also been utilized for analyzing the label noise handling capability of the proposed methodology.

AB  - COVID-19 is the newly born pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the recently emerged betacoronavirus that crosses the species barrier. It predominantly infects pneumocytes of the respiratory tract, but due to the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) on other cells like surface enterocytes of the upper esophagus and colon, these are also considered as the primary sites of infection. ACE2 receptor served as a cellular entry point for SARS-CoV-2. The expression of the ACE2 receptors is regulated by several factors such as age, tobacco smoking, inflammatory signaling, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes). Therefore, scientists are trying to explore the in-depth knowledge of ACE2 and considered it as a potential indirect target for COVID-19 therapeutics. In this focused review, we discussed in detail ACE2 expressions and regulation by different factors in the primary or vulnerable sites of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Clinical trials of rhACE2 in COVID-19 patients are ongoing, and if the outcome of the trials proves positive, it will be a breakthrough for the management of COVID-19. Finally, we suggest that targeting the ACE2 (a master regulator) in a balanced way could serve as a potential option against the management of COVID-19.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is often complicated by strictures and associated with increased risk for surgery. Inflammatory strictures respond to medical therapy, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is often used after the failure of steroids. However, data on efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in stricturing CD is limited. We retrospectively analysed the records of patients with stricturing CD who were treated with anti-TNF therapy and were prospectively followed from January 2005 to July 2020. Treatment success was defined as continuation of anti-TNF without the requirement for steroids or parenteral nutrition, switch to other anti-TNF, endoscopic dilation, surgery and severe adverse events leading to the withdrawal of anti-TNF. Fifty-nine patients were included [50-infliximab, 9-adalimumab; mean age-30.1 +/- 15 years; males-69.5%; median disease duration-124 (range 30-396) months; median follow-up duration-42 (range 8-180) months]. Ileum was the most common site of stricture (69.5%), 20.3% of patients had colonic strictures, and 64.4% had multiple strictures. 55.9% of patients were steroid dependent and 37.3% were steroid refractory. The median duration of anti-TNF therapy was 14 (range 2-96) months, and 54.2% (n=32) patients received concomitant immunomodulators. 88% improved with induction (11.8% primary non-response), secondary loss of response was seen in 52.2%, and the cumulative probability of treatment success at 1, 2 and 5 years was 69%, 51%, and 28% respectively. Anaemia at presentation predicted poor response. Only 30% of patients retained biologics on long-term (lack of response, cost, adverse events). 16.9% had adverse events, the commonest being reactivation of tuberculosis (5.1%). Anti-TNF therapy is associated with good short-term treatment success with modest long-term response in stricturing CD.

AB  - We describe the epidemiological characteristics and associated risk factors of those presenting at a large testing centre for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is a retrospective record review of individuals who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a high-throughput national-level government facility located in the north of India. Samples collected from 6 April to 31 December 2020 are included in this work and represent four highly populous regions. Additionally, there was a prospective follow-up of 1729 cases through telephone interviews from 25 May 2020 to 20 June 2020. Descriptive analysis has been performed for profiling clinic-epidemiological aspects of suspect cases. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and symptom status. A total of 125 600 participants' details have been included in this report. The mean (s.d.) age of the participants was 33.1 (+/- 15.3) years and 66% were male. Among these tested, 9515 (7.6%) were positive for COVID-19. A large proportion of positive cases were asymptomatic. In symptomatic positive cases, the commonest symptoms were cough and fever. Increasing age (groups 20-59 and >= 60 years compared to age group less than 5 years), male sex, history of international travel, symptoms for SARS-CoV-2, and participants from Delhi and Madhya Pradesh were positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Having co-morbidity, risk behaviours and intra-familial positivity were associated with a positive odds ratio for exhibiting SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Intensified testing and isolation of cases, identification of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals and additional care of those with co-morbidities and risk behaviours will all be collectively important for disease containment in India. Reasons for differentials in testing between men and women remain an important area for in-depth study. The increased deployment of vaccines is likely to impact the trajectory of COVID-19 in the coming time, and therefore our data will serve as a comparative resource as India experiences the second wave of infection in light of newer variants that are likely to accelerate disease spread.

AB  - In human retina, photoreceptor cell death (PCD) is a slow but conspicuous event, which continues with aging. Rods die earlier than cones, the latter continue to alter in a subtle manner until advanced aging. This review summarizes the existing information on age-related changes in photoreceptor cells, especially cones and analyses the possible associated factors. Oxidative and nitrosative stress are involved in photoreceptor alterations, which may stem from light and iron toxicity and other sources. Lipid peroxidation in macular photoreceptor outer segments and mitochondrial aberrations are prominent in aging. It is important to understand how those changes ultimately trigger PCD. The redistribution of calbindin D-28K and long/middle-wavelength-sensitive opsin in the parafoveal and perifoveal cones, anomalies in their somata and axons are strong predictors of their increasing vulnerability with aging. Signs of reduced autophagy, with autophagosomes containing organelle remnants are seen in aging photoreceptor cells. Currently, mechanisms that lead to human PCD are unknown; some observations favour apoptosis as a pathway. Since cones appear to change slowly, there is an opportunity to reverse those changes before they die. Therefore, a full understanding of how cones alter and the molecular pathways they utilize for survival must be the future research goal. Recent approaches to prevent PCD in aging and diseases are highlighted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Global use of telemedicine has increased rapidly during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to bridge the gap in existing health care services. Intercontinental trends in neurosurgeons' perception and practices of telemedicine have been sparingly reported.
   METHODS: We conducted an online anonymized and validated survey using a structured questionnaire to gain insight into neurosurgeons' experience with telemedicine across various continents and rated its usefulness on a 5-point Likert scale.
   RESULTS: We received 286 responses across 5 continents. There was a trend to support a major paradigm shift favoring teleconsultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in respondents from North America (P = 0.06). Signed prescriptions were e-mailed along with video-based teleconsultations preferentially in Europe and North America. In comparison, audio- or text-based teleconsultations along with unsigned prescriptions were prevalent in Asia and Africa (P = 0.0005). Acceptability and perceived usefulness for telemedicine during the pandemic were similar across the globe, regardless of neurosurgeons' experience (mean satisfaction score 3.72 +/- 1.09; P = 0.62). A majority of neurosurgeons from Asia and South America complained of difficulties during teleconsultations owing to lack of appropriate infrastructure, internet connectivity/prescription-related issues, and potential risk of litigation (P = 0.0005). Approximately 46% of neurosurgeons, predominantly from Europe and North America, thought that telemedicine could play a vital role in clinical practice even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides (mean satisfaction score 3.26 +/- 1.16; P = 0.007).
   CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine in neurosurgery is a viable alternative to physical outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially play a vital role after the pandemic.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that threatens >10 million people annually. Despite advances in TB diagnostics, patients continue to receive an insufficient diagnosis as TB symptoms are not specific. Many existing biodiagnostic tests are slow, have low clinical performance, and can be unsuitable for resource-limited settings. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a rapid, sputum-free, and cost-effective triage test for real-time detection of TB is urgently needed. This article reports on a new diagnostic pathway enabling a noninvasive, fast, and highly accurate way of detecting TB. The approach relies on TB-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are detected and quantified from the skin headspace. A specifically designed nanomaterial-based sensors array translates these findings into a point-of-care diagnosis by discriminating between active pulmonary TB patients and controls with sensitivity above 90%. This fulfills the WHO's triage test requirements and poses the potential to become a TB triage test.

AB  - Subcondylar fracture of the mandible accounts for 25-35% of all mandibular fractures. In the past, most subcondylar fractures were managed non surgically. The traditional method of fixation for subcondylar fractures uses two miniplates; however some bench studies have reported that trapezoidal plates are superior. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of subcondylar fractures fixed either with two non-parallel straight miniplates or with one trapezoidal plate. A randomized clinical trial was designed and implemented. Fiftytwo consecutive patients with subcondylar fractures were recruited. All patients underwent surgery via a retromandibular approach. The time taken for fixation of the plate after fracture reduction and postoperative outcomes and complications were compared between the groups. The trapezoidal plates were superior in terms of ease of adaptation and time taken for fixation (P = 0.0001). Plate fracture was observed only in the two miniplates group, in four (16%) patients. Outcomes were similar in the two groups in terms of occlusion, mouth opening, protrusion, and lateral excursion. In conclusion, both systems - two miniplates and the trapezoidal plate - provide functionally stable fixation. The outcome was significantly better for the trapezoidal plate than for two miniplates regarding the time taken for insertion and ease of adaptation, but not for other parameters.

AB  - In this analysis, we describe population-based outcomes for first-line treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) combined with an aromatase inhibitor (AI). All patients who were prescribed CDK4/6i + AI from January 2016 through June 2019 were included. Patient demographics, tumour and treatment characteristics were collected and described. Survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was constructed to examine associations between potentially prognostic clinical variables and progression-free survival (PFS). In total, 316 patients were included. The median age was 61 years. After a median follow-up of 28.1 months, the median PFS was 37.9 months (95% CI, 26.7-NR). In the MVA, PR-negative tumour (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.45-3.88; p = 0.001) and CDK4/6i dose reduction (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.06-2.16; p = 0.022) predicted worse PFS. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. The 30-month and 36-month OS rates were 74% and 68%, respectively. Of patients who progressed, 89% received second-line treatment. Median time to progression on second-line chemotherapy was 9.0 (5.8-17.6) months, and median time to progression on second-line hormonal therapy +/- targeted agent was 4.0 (3.4-8.6) months (p = 0.012). CDK4/6i + AI as first-line treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC in Alberta is justified based on favourable PFS and early OS outcomes.

AB  - Introduction:
   With various studies in the literature showing laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) exploration to have equal or similar results when compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) clearance, decision-making in regard to the treatment modality to be used may become debatable. Thus, quality of life (QoL) data may assist both the patient and the clinician in deciding the management of the disease. The present prospective randomized trial was undertaken to compare QoL of patients undergoing treatment with these 2 approaches.
   Methodology:
   The study was conducted March 1, 2013, to September 31, 2016. Consecutive patients with CBD stones were randomized to either laparoscopic CBD exploration with cholecystectomy (group I) and EST followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (group II). Diagnosis was confirmed preoperatively using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasound. QoL scores were assessed by World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires.
   Results:
   A total of 77 patients with concomitant gallstones and CBD stones were finally recruited (38 patients in group I and 39 patients in group II). The demographic and clinical profiles were similar in both the groups. On EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, there was significant improvement in physical, emotional, and role functioning in both the groups (P<0.01) with no intergroup variation preprocedure or postprocedure. Patients in both the groups reported similar WHOQOL scores with significant improvement postprocedure and minimal intergroup variation. Both the depression and anxiety scores on HADS were comparable between the 2 groups preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively.
   Conclusion:
   Single-stage management of patients with gallbladder and CBD stones and EST followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy were similar in terms of improvement in QoL.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors present a new "bloodless" technique for minimally invasive robotic thermocoagulative hemispherotomy (ROTCH). Such a method is being described in the literature for the first time.
   METHODS A robotic system was used to plan five sets of different trajectories: anterior disconnection, middle disconnection, posterior disconnection, corpus callosotomy, and temporal stem and amygdalar disconnection. A special technique, called the "X" technique, allowed planar disconnection. Registration was performed with surface landmarks (n = 5) and bone fiducials (n = 1). Coregistration with O-arm images was performed one or two times to confirm the trajectories (once for middle disconnection, and once for disconnection of the temporal stem and amygdala or body of the corpus callosum). Impedance measured before ablation allowed for minor adjustments. Radiofrequency ablation was performed at 75 degrees C-80 degrees C for 60 seconds. Surgical procedures were performed with multiple twist drills. After removal of the electrode, glue was used to prevent CSF leak, and a single stitch was applied. Follow-up CT and MRI were immediately performed.
   RESULTS The pathologies included Rasmussen's encephalitis (n = 2), hemispheric cortical dysplasia (n = 2), posttraumatic encephalomalacia (n = 1), and perinatal insult (n = 1). The mean +/- SD (range) age was 6.7 +/- 3.6 years (5 months to 10.2 years), and the right side was affected in 4 patients. The mean +/- SD seizure frequency was 7.4 +/- 5.6 seizures per day (1 patient had epilepsia partialis continua). The mean +/- SD number of trajectories was 15.3 +/- 2.5, and the mean +/- SD number of lesions was 108 +/- 25.8. The mean +/- SD maximum numbers of trajectories and lesions required for middle disconnection were 7.1 +/- 1.7 and 57.5 +/- 18.4, respectively. All but 1 patient had class 1 outcomes according to the International League Against Epilepsy Outcome Scale at a mean +/- SD (range) follow-up of 13.5 +/- 1.6 (12-16) months; the remaining patient had a class 2 outcome. The estimated blood loss was < 5 ml for all patients. Complications included repeat surgery (after 2 weeks) for a "skip" area (n = 1) and a small temporal hematoma (n = 1), which resolved.
   CONCLUSIONS ROTCH seems to be a safe, feasible, and bloodless procedure, with a very low morbidity rate and promising outcomes.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has been a global health emergency due to its association with severe pneumonia and high rate of mortality. In the current study, we reported the direct evidence for the variable level of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection on several types of oral epithelial cells isolated from the aspirated oropharyngeal and bronchoalveolar secretions of severely infected and intubated patients using cytology, confocal based immunofluorescence imaging (IF), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies. Cytological analysis showed the presence of keratinised and non-keratinised oral epithelial cells with viral inclusion bodies in stratum granulosum and intermedium cells. IF imaging using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific antibody confirmed the presence of virus inside the stratum spinosum/granulosum (keratinised) and stratum intermedium/superficial cells (non-keratinised). No SARS-CoV-2 viruses were seen in stratum corneum cells. SEM analysis also confirms the absence of virus like structure on stratum corneum surface while viruses like structure were seen on the stratum spinosum/granulosum/stratum/intermedium and stratum superficial cells. This advanced microscopic study confirms directly that the virus tends to infect and multiply in the metabolically active or sub-basal cells of oral epithelium and absent in the inactive keratinised stratum corneum from shedding zones of oral mucosa.

AB  - Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for < 1% of all breast cancers. The available data on male breast cancer is mainly retrospective institution-based studies. Due to the scarcity of the disease, randomized controlled trials have not been feasible. Conducting a multicenter study is the next best option to assess the effectiveness of the treatment which is currently followed as per the guidelines on female breast cancer (FBC). Under the aegis of Delhi Breast Oncology Group (DBOG), data of 106 MBC patients was collected from 11 leading hospitals of Delhi and analyzed from January 2010 to April 2017. The age of the patients ranged from 35 to 82 years with a median of 59 years. The commonest presentation was a lump in the breast (98%). There was a delay in presentation of 1-6 months in the majority (86%) of cases. of the total number of patients, 51% had Stage II, 25% Stage III, 18% Stage I, 4% Stage 0, and 2% Stage IV breast cancer at the time of presentation. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the commonest histopathological finding. IHC receptor studies revealed ER positivity in 81% and PR positivity in 76%. HER2 neu positivity was seen in 25% of cases. Modified radical mastectomy was the commonest (92%) surgical procedure. Of the total number of cases, 18% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 35% received adjuvant chemotherapy, 32% underwent radiotherapy, and 74% received hormonal therapy. The 5-year cumulative disease-free survival was 60.7%. MBC is rare and unique. There are differences from FBC with respect to time of presentation, aggressiveness, histopathology, IHC markers, and response to treatment with a poorer outcome. Multicentric prospective studies are recommended for future research.

AB  - The luminal gastrointestinal tract carcinomas are one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths. To improve overall survival, the current trend is to combine targeted therapeutic agents with conventional chemotherapies. Major trials have shown survival benefits with this approach and many more trials are being undertaken. However, pathologists often get perplexed by different methods of interpretation and reporting of these stains, vital for deciding therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The Indian Association of Pathologists and Microbiologists (IAPM) and Indian Society of Gastroenterology (ISG) decided to make a joint consensus recommendation for handling, processing, and interpretation of SI biopsies for the diagnosis and management of celiac disease (CD) recognizing the inhomogeneous practice of biopsy sampling, orientation, processing, and interpretation. A modified Delphi process was used to develop this consensus document containing a total of 42 statements and recommendations, which were generated by sharing the document draft, incorporating expert's opinion, followed by three cycles of electronic voting as well as a full-day face-to-face virtual ZOOM meeting and review of supporting literature. Of the 42 statements, 7 statements are on small intestinal (SI) biopsy in suspected patients of CD, site and the number of biopsies; 7 on handling, fixative, orientation, processing, and sectioning in pathology laboratories; 2 on histological orientation; 13 statements on histological interpretation and histological grading; 3 on the assessment of follow-up biopsies; 2 statements on gluten-free diet (GFD)-nonresponsive CD; 4 on challenges in the diagnosis of CD; 2 statements each on pathology reporting protocol and training and infrastructure in this area. The goal of this guideline document is to formulate a uniform protocol agreed upon both by the experienced pathologists and gastroenterologists to standardize the practice, improve the yield of small bowel biopsy interpretation, patients' compliance, overall management in CD, and generate unified data for patient care and research in the related field.

AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been shown to affect people all over the world. While life expectancy for people with CF has increased substantially, CF is still associated with death in infants and young children in many regions, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). These countries face significant challenges to promote CF diagnosis and improvements to CF care due to financial constraints and a significant burden of other diseases. In this review, we describe the status of CF diagnosis and care in different LMIC settings, from four different parts of the world (Brazil, South Africa, Israel and India). We highlight challenges and opportunities for CF practitioners in LMIC to improve CF care and outcomes. While early CF diagnosis is the key to optimising outcomes, newborn screening may not be feasible for countries with lower CF incidence and higher birth rates, such as India or South Africa. CF therapies and care in LMIC need to be adapted to available resources of these countries. Collaboration initiatives of the global CF community with LMIC may improve CF care in these countries. Most individuals with CF in LMIC are not benefiting from CFTR modulator treatments due to the prohibitive cost of these drugs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose:This study aimed to assess the preferred surgical technique and outcome of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) among corneal surgeons in India. Methods:An online questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among members of the Cornea Society of India (CSI) with experience of performing >10 DALK procedure. The responses pertaining to their surgical experience, preferred technique, complications, and outcome of DALK were collected and analyzed. Results:A total of 156 responses were received. In total, 35.9% of participants reported annual keratoplasty of >50, and DALK constituted >25% surgeries for 25% of participants. Ectatic corneal disorder was reported as the most common indication for DALK by 71.6% of the respondents. Big-bubble (BB) DALK (WA-1.82) was the most preferred technique, along with suction trephine (50%) for partial trephination and bottom port cannula (45.5%) for BB formation. On statistical analysis, no difference was observed in the surgeon reported success rate of BB formation with or without anterior lamellar keratectomy (ALK) (Chi 2 (1,156) = 3.1498, P = 0.08) or paracentesis (Chi 2 (1,156) = 0.2737, P = 0.60) before stromal air injection, and method of stromal air injection (Chi 2 (1,156) = 4.7325, P = 0.09). Conversion to penetrating keratoplasty was reported by 16% of participants in >25% cases, while 66.7% reported in <10% cases. Cataract and double anterior chamber were the most common complications. 50% of participants suggested that >20 procedures are required to overcome the learning curve. Conclusion:BB DALK is the most commonly practiced DALK technique, and its success is independent of ALK and paracentesis being performed prior to air injection and method of air injection (cannula/needle).

AB  - Recent advancements in spine surgery anesthesia techniques and pain management has led to a paradigm shift from conventional open spinal procedures to minimally invasive spine surgeries performed on an outpatient basis. Spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia alone or in combination with spinal are common regional anesthesia modalities used in spine surgeries. New modalities of regional analgesia have emerged recently including erector spinae and thoracolumbar interfascial plane block, aimed at decreasing perioperative pain and enhancing early recovery in patients undergoing spine surgery. In this narrative review we discuss the characteristics of regional anesthesia including its types, indications, contraindications, benefits, and potential complications along with new modalities of regional analgesia.

AB  - Aims
   The aim of this study was to explore the utility of F-18-FDG PET/CT in the assessment of response to antitubercular treatment (ATT) and identification of treatment endpoint. Patients and Methods
   Forty patients (mean age, 35.3 years; 27 men) with clinically, radiologically, and histopathologically proven joint tuberculosis prospectively underwent clinical, biochemical, and PET/CT evaluation at baseline and after similar to 6, 12, and 18 months of ATT. Two patients were lost to follow-up, and 1 defaulted treatment. The remaining 37 were followed up until complete response (CR) was achieved. Images were visually and quantitatively (SUVmax ratio and metabolically active disease volume [MV]) evaluated by 2 experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Results
   Knee (n = 18) and ankle (n = 7) were the most frequently involved sites. The median MV and SUVmax ratio at baseline were 85.10 mL and 7.21, respectively. Five patients had noncontiguous vertebral involvement, 12 had pulmonary lesions, 2 had abscesses, 6 had mediastinal, and 30 had local lymph nodal involvement. Complete response was seen in 1/39, 11/37, and 30/37 patients after 6, 12, and 18 months of ATT. Significant reductions in visual analog scale score, tenderness, joint swelling, SUVmax ratios, and MVs (Friedman test, P < 0.001) were seen after each follow-up. The median time-to-CR in skeletal lesions was significantly longer than extraskeletal lesions (591 vs 409 days; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001). Time-to-CR in joint lesions positively correlated with MV at first follow-up (Pearson = 0.452, P = 0.005) and negatively correlated with percentage change in MV (first follow-up from baseline) (Pearson = -0.620, P < 0.001). ROC analysis yielded a cutoff of <= 71% reduction in MV at first follow-up (80.8% sensitivity, 81.8% specificity) to predict extension of ATT beyond 12 months. Using ROC analysis at second follow-up, a cutoff of <= 12.67 mL (for CR) was derived and was validated in patients at the third follow-up, with an accuracy of 84.4%. Patients with CR in PET/CT maintained disease-free state during a mean follow-up of 271 days. Conclusions
   F-18-FDG PET/CT is an excellent tool in estimating total disease burden, assessing response to ATT and identification of treatment endpoint in joint tuberculosis.

AB  - Trauma remains a major public health problem worldwide, marked as the fourth leading cause of death among all diseases. Trauma patients who survived at initial stages in the Emergency Department (ED), have significantly higher chances of mortality due to sepsis associated complications in the ICU at the later stage. There is paucity of literature regarding the role of circulating monocytes subsets and development of sepsis complications following trauma haemorrhagic shock (THS). The study was conducted to investigate the circulating level of monocyte subsets (Classical, Inflammatory, and Patrolling) and its functions in patients with acute post-traumatic sepsis. A total 72, THS patients and 30 age matched healthy controls were recruited. Blood samples were collected at different time points on days 1, 7, and 14 to measure the serum levels of cytokines by Cytometric bead assay (CBA), for the immunophenotyping of monocytes subsets, and also for the cell sorting of monocytes subsets for the functional studies. The circulating levels of monocytes subsets were found to be significantly differs among THS patients, who developed sepsis when compared with others who did not. The levels of patrolling monocytes were elevated in THS patients who developed sepsis and showed negative correlation with Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on days 7 and 14. Classical monocytes responded strongly to bacterial TLR-agonist (LPS) and produced anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas patrolling monocytes responded with viral TLR agonist TLR-7/8 (R848) and produced inflammatory cytokines in post-traumatic sepsis patients. In conclusion, this study shows disparity in the behaviour of monocytes subsets in patients with acute post-traumatic sepsis.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension is not the only cause of arterial desaturation in patients with atrial septal defect. Arterial desaturation can also occur with normal pulmonary artery pressure making it mandatory to understand the mechanism to avoid erroneous diagnosis. In this report, for the first time, we demonstrate atrial flutter as the cause of arterial desaturation in a patient with large atrial septal defect despite normal pulmonary artery pressure, which was normalised following successful radiofrequency ablation.

AB  - Background: Aggressive pancreatobiliary tumors often require oxaliplatin-based therapies, instead of standard gemcitabine-based therapy and biomarker studies at diagnosis to decide the appropriate therapeutic regimen. The ribonucleotide Reductase catalytic subunit M1 (RRM1) and excision repair cross-complementing gene-1 (ERCC1) are related to DNA synthesis and repair and essential in this regard. However, apart from the therapeutic benefit, their prognostic implication is controversial. Methods: In this retrospective study, paraffin-embedded tissue from 51 cases of pancreatic cancer and 29 cases of cholangiocarcinoma were evaluated for RRM1 and ERCC1 expression by immunohistochemical technique along with 18 control pancreatic and biliary tissues. The semiquantitatively H score was calculated based on stain distribution and stain intensities. Results: Both RRM1 and ERCC1 expression were high in tumor epithelium than in controls (RRM1: the difference was statistically significant in cholangiocarcinoma (P = 0.008); ERCC1: the difference was statistically significant both in pancreatic and cholangiocarcinoma (P < 0.05)]. However, no correlation was noted between RRM1 and ERCC1-low and high tumors with histological markers of prognosis and overall survival in these patients. Conclusions: The present study adds further evidence against the controversy that if RRM1 and ERCC1 expression in pancreatic and biliary carcinomas have any prognostic significance apart from their proven therapeutic benefits in these tumors.

AB  - Background: The majority of the children with SARS-CoV-2 infection present with respiratory symptoms, hence various chest imaging modalities have been used in the management. Knowledge about the radiological findings of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children is limited. Hence, we systematically synthesized the available data that will help in better management of COVID-19 in children.
   Methods: Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CENTRAL) were searched for articles reporting radiological findings in children with COVID-19. Studies reporting thoracic radiological findings of COVID-19 in patients aged <19 years were included. A random-effect meta-analysis (wherever feasible) was performed to provide pooled estimates of various findings.
   Results: A total of 1984 records were screened of which forty-six studies (923 patients) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan was the most frequently used imaging modality. While one-third of the patients had normal scans, a significant proportion (19%) of clinically asymptomatic children had radiological abnormalities too. Unilateral lung involvement (55%) was frequent when compared with bilateral and ground-glass opacities were the most frequent (40%) definitive radiological findings. Other common radiological findings were non-specific patchy shadows (44%), consolidation (23%), halo sign (26%), pulmonary nodules and prominent bronchovascular marking. Interstitial infiltration being the most frequent lung ultrasound finding.
   Conclusion: CT scan is the most frequently used imaging modality for COVID-19 in children and can detect pneumonia before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Undefined patchy shadows, grand-glass opacities and consolidation are commonly observed imaging findings in COVID-19 pneumonia.

Fundus autofluorescence, fundus fluorescein angiography, and OCT angiography were performed wherever required.Results:Twenty consecutive TDS cases (36 eyes) were included. OCT showed inferior depression of all layers in specific scans and macular pathologies seen included lamellar macular hole, full-thickness macular hole, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, acute and resolved subretinal fluid, central serous chorioretinopathy, and choroidal neovascular membrane. Macular involvement was seen in 13 eyes (36.11%) while in the remaining 23 eyes, outer retinal changes were seen on OCT in 9 eyes and normal retinal layers in 14 eyes (38.89%).Conclusion:Various macular pathologies associated with TDS are described using multimodality imaging. These provide understanding of changes which can occur with TDS. It also highlights the need for recognition, differentiation from similar confusing entities, and the necessity to follow-up of these cases carefully to detect the macular changes earlier.

AB  - Dome-shaped macula is a convex retinochoroidal elevation within the region of a posterior staphyloma seen commonly in high myopia on optical coherence tomography. With growing awareness of the condition facilitated by inclusion of optical coherence tomography in routine retinal practice, coupled with evolution of enhanced depth optical coherence tomography imaging, multiple studies have attempted to shed light on pathogenesis of this complex pathology, its clinical implications, and treatment of associated complications such as serous macular detachment and choroidal neovascularization with variable success. Our review aims to assimilate, scrutinize, and discuss the available literature for a comprehensive insight into dome-shaped macula.

AB  - Background: India is endemic for dengue. The present formative study reports awareness and practices of people regarding dengue and its prevention, personal protection behaviours and peoples' exposure to dengue-related health promotion activities.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 1194 households randomly selected from 20 slum clusters in Delhi. Data were collected from an adult member of the household through an interviewer-administered, pre-tested questionnaire. An observation checklist was used to identify potential breeding sources.
   Results: People were aware that dengue is transmitted through mosquitoes and sources of breeding (clean, stagnant water -60.1%, domestic water containers -18.7%, coolers -15.0%). Each house had at least one potential source of mosquito breeding. Using mosquito repellents (83.3%) was the most common personal protection behaviour. Peoples' participation is limited in the mosquito prevention and health promotion activities carried out by the local municipality. Still, participation resulted in positive behavioural change.
   Conclusions: While people were aware of dengue transmission, preventive measures against mosquito breeding were not satisfactory. People could not relate their existing knowledge on dengue to their household surroundings, and their awareness had not been translated to behavioural change. Community participation is limited, but is significant in the prevention and control of dengue.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
KW  - GERM-CELL CANCER
KW  - DEVELOPMENT DSD
KW  - DISORDERS
KW  - RISK
AB  - Objectives: To determine trends in clinical practice for individuals with DSD requiring gonadectomy.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Methods: Information regarding age at gonadectomy according to diagnosis; reported sex; time of presentation to specialist centre; and location of centre from cases reported to the International DSD Registry and who were over 16 years old in January 2019.
   Results: Data regarding gonadectomy were available in 668 (88%) individuals from 44 centres. Of these, 248 (37%) (median age (range) 24 (17, 75) years) were male and 420 (63%) (median age (range) 26 (16, 86) years) were female. Gonadectomy was reported from 36 centres in 351/668 cases (53%). Females were more likely to undergo gonadectomy (n = 311, P < 0.0001). The indication for gonadectomy was reported in 268 (7 6%). The most common indication was mitigation of tumour risk in 172 (64%). Variations in the practice of gonadectomy were observed; of the 351 cases from 36 centres, 17 (5%) at 9 centres had undergo ne gonadectomy before their first presentation to the specialist centre. Median age at gonadectomy of cases from high-income countries and low-/middle-income countries (LMIC) was 13.0 years (0.1, 68) years and 16.5 years (1, 28), respectively (P < 0.0001) with the likelihood of long-term retention of gonads being higher in LMIC countries.
   Conclusions: The likelihood of gonadectomy depends on the underlying diagnosis, sex of rearing and the geographical setting. Clinical benchmarks, which can be studied across all forms of DSD will allow a better understanding of the variation in the practice of gonadectomy.

AB  - Background Limited evidence exists on perinatal transmission and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in neonates. Objective To describe clinical outcomes and risk factors for transmission in neonates born to mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Prospective cohort of suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected neonates entered in National Neonatology Forum (NNF) of India registry. Subjects Neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection within two weeks before or two days after birth and neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes Incidence and risk factors of perinatal transmission. Results Among 1713 neonates, SARS-CoV-2 infection status was available for 1330 intramural and 104 extramural neonates. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was reported in 144 intramural and 39 extramural neonates. Perinatal transmission occurred in 106 (8%) and horizontal transmission in 21 (1.5%) intramural neonates. Neonates roomed-in with mother had higher transmission risk (RR1.16, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4; P=0.01). No association was noted with the mode of delivery or type of feeding. The majority of neonates positive for SARS-CoV2 were asymptomatic. Intramural SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates were more likely to be symptomatic (RR 5, 95%CI 3.3 to 7.7; P<0.0001) and need resuscitation (RR 2, 95%CI 1.0 to 3.9; P=0.05) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative neonates. Amongst symptomatic neonates, most morbidities were related to prematurity and perinatal events. Conclusion Data from a large cohort suggests perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased morbidity in infected infants.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed several challenges to clinical laboratories across the globe. Amidst the outbreak, errors occurring in the preanalytical phase of sample collection, transport and processing, can further lead to undesirable clinical consequences. Thus, this study was designed with the following objectives: (i) to determine and compare the blood specimen rejection rate of a clinical laboratory and (ii) to characterise and compare the types of preanalytical errors between the pre-pandemic and the pandemic phases.
   Materials and methods: This retrospective study was carried out in a trauma-care hospital, presently converted to COVID-19 care centre. Data was collected from (i) pre-pandemic phase: 1st October 2019 to 23rd March 2020 and (ii) pandemic phase: 24th March to 31st October 2020. Blood specimen rejection rate was calculated as the proportion of blood collection tubes with preanalytical errors out of the total number received, expressed as percentage.
   Results: Total of 107,716 blood specimens were screened of which 43,396 (40.3%) were received during the pandemic. The blood specimen rejection rate during the pandemic was significantly higher than the pre-pandemic phase (3.0% versus 1.1%; P < 0.001). Clotted samples were the commonest source of preanalytical errors in both phases. There was a significant increase in the improperly labelled samples (P < 0.001) and samples with insufficient volume (P < 0.001), whereas, a significant decline in samples with inadequate sample-anticoagulant ratio and haemolysed samples (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: In the ongoing pandemic, preanalytical errors and resultant blood specimen rejection rate in the clinical laboratory have significantly increased due to changed logistics. The study highlights the need for corrective steps at various levels to reduce preanalytical errors in order to optimise patient care and resource utilisation.

AB  - Newer molecular diagnostics and improved understanding of cancer pathogenesis have identified multiple pathways that can be potentially targeted with the use of novel therapeutics in development. These developments have ushered cancer therapeutics in newer era of personalized medicine. Same is reflected on current management strategies for advanced gastrointestinal malignancies. Molecular profiling for BRAF and RAS is standard for colorectal cancer while Her2 and PDL1 status is needed for planning therapy of advanced gastroesophageal cancers. Tissue agnostic markers like MSI, TMB and NTRK are making headways in therapeutic armamentarium. While newer targeted therapies against FGFR, EGFR, PI3K-AKT, DDR pathways are showing promising results in initial studies. Here we review traditional as well as upcoming molecular markers in field of GI malignancies, methods of testing and evidence for rational use in clinical practice.

KW  - OPIOID SUBSTITUTION THERAPY

KW  - DEPENDENCE
AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the implementation of a mobile dispensing service to improve opioid users'access to methadone maintenance therapy.
   Methods In March 2019, we started mobile methadone dispensing in an urban underprivileged locality in Delhi, India. The doctor was available only at the main community drug treatment clinic for clinical services, while the nurse dispensed methadone from a converted ambulance. We involved patients in identifying community leaders for sensitization and in deciding the location and timings for dispensing. We conducted a retrospective chart review of the programme data collected during delivery of clinical services. We compared the numbers of patients registered for methadone therapy and their retention and adherence to therapy in the 12-month periods before and after implementation of the mobile service.
   FindingsThe number of patients registered for therapy at the clinic increased from 167 in the year before implementation to 671 in the year after. A significantly higher proportion of patients were retained in therapy at 3, 6 and 9 months after enrolment; 9-month retention rates were 19% (32/167 patients) and 45% (44/97 patients) in the year before and after implementation, respectively. There was no significant difference in patients'adherence to therapy between the two periods. Challenges included providing suitable dispensing hours for patients in employment and concerns of local community near to the dispensing sites.
   Conclusion It is feasible to dispense methadone by a mobile team in an urban setting, with better retention rates in therapy compared with dispensing through a stationary clinic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:
   To examine if the use of honey (medicated) for dressing is superior to standard care in terms of time to complete wound healing in stages 1-3 of pressure injuries in children admitted to the PICU.
   DESIGN:
   Multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized trial.
   SETTING:
   Tertiary-care PICU from August 2017 to January 2019.
   PATIENTS:
   Critically ill children, 2 months to 17 years old, who developed pressure injury (stages 1-3) were included; those on more than two inotropes or with signs of acute wound infection or wounds with greater than 5 cm diameter or known allergy to honey were excluded.
   INTERVENTIONS:
   Children were randomized to receive either medicated honey dressing or standard (routine) wound care for the management of their pressure injury.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
   The primary outcome was the time to complete wound healing. Manuka or active Leptospermum honey dressing/gel was used in the intervention group. Enrolled children were followed up until death or discharge from the hospital. A total of 99 children were enrolled: 51 in the intervention group and 48 in the standard care group. Baseline characteristics, including the nutritional status, were comparable between the groups. The most common sites of injury were bony prominences at face mask contact points. The median time to complete healing was 7 days (95% CI, 6-7 d) versus 9 days (7-10 d) in the intervention and standard care groups, respectively (p = 0.002; log-rank test). At any random time, children in the intervention group were about 1.9-fold more likely to have their pressure injury completely healed than those in the standard care group (hazard ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-2.87). There were no allergic reactions or secondary wound infections in the intervention group.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   The use of medicated honey dressings decreased the time to wound healing in critically ill children with pressure injuries. There were no allergic reactions or secondary bacterial infections in any of these children.

TI  - Subnational mapping of HIV incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15-49 years in sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-18: a modelling study
T2  - LANCET HIV
AB  - Background High-resolution estimates of HIV burden across space and time provide an important tool for tracking and monitoring the progress of prevention and control efforts and assist with improving the precision and efficiency of targeting efforts. We aimed to assess HIV incidence and HIV mortality for all second-level administrative units across sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods In this modelling study, we developed a framework that used the geographically specific HIV prevalence data collected in seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care clinics to train a model that estimates HIV incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15-49 years. We used a model-based geostatistical framework to estimate HIV prevalence at the second administrative level in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2000-18 and sought data on the number of individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by second-level administrative unit. We then modified the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to use these HIV prevalence and treatment estimates to estimate HIV incidence and mortality by second-level administrative unit.
   Findings The estimates suggest substantial variation in HIV incidence and mortality rates both between and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 15 countries having a ten-times or greater difference in estimated HIV incidence between the second- level administrative units with the lowest and highest estimated incidence levels. Across all 44 countries in 2018, HIV incidence ranged from 2.8 (95% uncertainty interval 2.1-3.8) in Mauritania to 1585.9 (1369.4-1824.8) cases per 100 000 people in Lesotho and HIV mortality ranged from 0.8 (0.7-0.9) in Mauritania to 676.5 (513.6-888.0) deaths per 100 000 people in Lesotho. Variation in both incidence and mortality was substantially greater at the subnational level than at the national level and the highest estimated rates were accordingly higher. Among second-level administrative units, Guija District, Gaza Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV incidence (4661.7 [2544.8-8120.3]) cases per 100 000 people in 2018 and Inhassunge District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV mortality rate (1163.0 [679.0-1866.8]) deaths per 100 000 people. Further, the rate of reduction in HIV incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2018, as well as the ratio of new infections to the number of people living with HIV was highly variable. Although most second-level administrative units had declines in the number of new cases (3316 [81.1%] of 4087 units) and number of deaths (3325 [81.4%]), nearly all appeared well short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths between 2010 and 2020.
   Interpretation Our estimates suggest that most second-level administrative units in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths by 2020, which is further compounded by substantial within-country variability. These estimates will help decision makers and programme implementers expand access to ART and better target health resources to higher burden subnational areas. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Interpretation of gastrointestinal PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) is often complicated by anatomy including bowel folds, flexures, variant redundancy, decompressed bowel segments and physiological uptake. This makes it very difficult to identify both true positives and true negatives, compromising both sensitivity and specificity. CT enterography is increasingly being integrated into the field of nuclear medicine to address these issues. This technique uses the combination of negative/neutral contrast to distend the lumen of the gut and iodinated contrast to enhance the gastrointestinal wall and pathological findings. Apart from augmentation in the diagnostic performance, the technique also improves the quality of the imaging, confidence of the reporting physician and inter-rater agreement. Therefore, this technique has found favor among nuclear medicine physicians, in the imaging of chronic inflammatory disorders and malignancies in and of the gut. It is a feasible and easily executable procedure with minimal and manageable side-effects and should be routinely recommended in cases where interference from physiologic findings is expected.

AB  - Benzodiazepines are the first choice of anti-epileptic drugs used to treat seizures. However, it has been seen that their efficacy decreases with time leading to drug insensitivity, plausibly caused by an alteration in the expression of the benzodiazepine biding site on GABA(A) receptors. This study was designed to investigate if the differential expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha 1/alpha 4/gamma 2/delta across the postsynaptic sites could contribute to benzodiazepine resistance in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), the most common cause of drug resistant epilepsy in pediatric population. Differential gene and cellular expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha 1, alpha 4, gamma 2 and delta were evaluated and validated using qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Whole cell patch clamp studies were performed on pyramidal neurons of resected cortical FCD samples to measure the spontaneous GABA(A) receptor activity. Upregulation of alpha 4-and gamma 2-subunits containing GABA(A) receptors were observed at both mRNA and protein level. alpha 1-and delta-subunits containing GABA(A) receptors did not show any significant changes. Flumazenil treatment did not affect the kinetics of GABAergic events in FCD; however, it significantly reduced the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic activity in non-seizure control samples. Our results demonstrate the enhanced expression of alpha 4-containing GABA(A) receptors and GABAergic activity in pyramidal neurons which in turn may contribute to benzodiazepine resistance in FCD patients.

AB  - Purpose: Purpose of the current study was to assess the presence and functionality of the nucleoside transporters in the lacrimal gland for the tear disposition of its substrate given intravenously in rabbits. Materials and Methods: Rabbits were divided into two groups - control and blocker pretreated. The blocker pretreated group received 5 mg/kg of dipyridamole 30 min before ribavirin (substrate), which was given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. All the treatments were given intravenously. Blood and tear samples were collected at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min (n = 4; each time point) after substrate administration. Tear samples were collected on Schirmer's strips, and plasma was separated immediately after blood collection. All the samples were stored at -80 degrees C until analysis by LC-MS/MS. Results: Plasma ribavirin concentration for blocker pretreated group showed significantly (p < .05) higher levels at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 300 min as compared to the control group. Similarly, tear ribavirin concentration for blocker pretreated group also showed a significant (p < .05) increase at 5, 15, 60, 90, 180, 240 and 300 min compared to the control group. Plasma and tear AUC((0-6)) for blocker pretreated group was 1.7 (p < .001) and 2.42 (p < .001) folds higher in a significant manner as compared to the control group, respectively. Percentage penetration of ribavirin from plasma to tears was also different between control and blocker pretreated group. Permeation ratio of ribavirin from plasma to tear for blocker pretreated group was found to be 1.4-folds higher in a significant (p < .05) manner. Conclusion: It is evident from the results that nucleoside transporters are present in lacrimal gland. The blocker treatment induced increase in tear transport of ribavirin indicates the possibility of the presence of nucleoside transporters on the apical side of lacrimal acinar cells in the uptake position.

AB  - Infectious keratitis after lamellar keratoplasty is a potentially devastating complication that may severely limit the visual and anatomical outcomes. The deep-seated location of the infiltrates, sequestration of the pathogenic microorganisms and limited penetration of the currently available antimicrobial agents often results in delayed diagnosis that may jeopardize the management in these cases. Fungal keratitis is more common as compared with bacterial or viral keratitis and classically presents as white interface infiltrates that may not be associated with significant inflammation. Confocal microscopy may help to establish a rapid diagnosis in such cases, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography may be used to determine the extent of infection and monitor its progression. Conservative measures such as topical antimicrobials and interface irrigation with antimicrobial agents may be done. Surgical intervention in the form of partial excision/removal of the graft in endothelial keratoplasty or a full-thickness keratoplasty is often required for the effective management of deep-seated infections. Timely diagnosis and intervention may result in complete resolution of infection in both anterior lamellar and endothelial keratoplasty. Infections after anterior lamellar keratoplasty have a fair prognosis, and a clear graft with functional visual acuity may be achieved in most cases. By contrast, infections after endothelial keratoplasty have a guarded prognosis, and the presence of concomitant endophthalmitis may further complicate the graft survival and visual outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of Descemet-stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) with intrascleral haptic- fixated intraocular lens (IOL) in a sequential and simultaneous approach.
   Setting: Tertiary eyecare center.
   Design: Prospective randomized comparative study.
   Methods: Patients with aphakic or complicated pseudophakic bullous keratopathy visiting a tertiary eyecare center were included in the study. A total of 40 patients were randomized into 2 groups of 20 each. Group 1 had subjects who underwent scleral-fixated IOL (SF IOL) implantation by intrascleral haptic fixation technique, followed by DSAEK (sequential procedure) with an interval of at least 3 months. Group 2 (simultaneous) had subjects who underwent DSAEK with SF IOL as a combined procedure. Graft survival, endothelial cell loss (ECL), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and need for any interventionsuch as rebubbling were evaluated for both the groups at the end of 6 months.
   Results: At 6 months, the sequential group had significantly better CDVA of 0.62 +/- 0.17 logMAR compared with 0.87 +/- 0.19 logMAR in the simultaneous group (P = .002). Group 1 had significantly better overall cumulative graft survival (100% vs 60%, P = .002), significantly lower ECL (P = .006), lesser mean central corneal thickness (P = .03), and significantly thinner donor lenticule (P = .009). Rebubbling rate was significantly higher in Group 2 (P = .025). The mean hyperopic shift was significantly more in Group 2 (P = .02).
   Conclusion: The sequential procedure of SF IOL followed by DSAEK has better visual outcomes and graft survival when compared with simultaneous procedure in cases of aphakic or complicated pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.

AB  - Background: Both noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) are important causes of noncirrhotic portal hypertension (PH) in the Asian region. In this study, we analyzed the histopathological changes of liver needle-core biopsies from patients with NCPF and EHPVO. Patients and Methods: The patients were diagnosed as per the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver (APASL) criteria. Minimum adequacy criteria for liver core biopsies were defined, and finally, 69 liver biopsies from patients with NCPF and 100 liver biopsies from patients with EHPVO were analyzed. All histological parameters were predefined, and three experienced pathologists analyzed the biopsies after reaching consensus. Institute ethics committee clearance was taken. Results: Although some histological features were overlapping, phlebosclerosis of intra-hepatic branches of the portal vein (PV), periportal aberrant vascular channels, remnant portal tracts, and hepatic fibrosis beyond the portal tracts without the formation of complete hepatic nodules (P < 0.001 for all) were common histological characteristics of NCPF on core-needle liver biopsies; while maintained lobular architecture, nonspecific dilatation of PV branches, absence of intra-hepatic PV phlebosclerosis, aberrant vascular channels, and significant fibrosis were characteristics of EHPVO. Conclusions: Despite the considerable histological overlap between NCPF and EHPVO, careful histological evaluation, supplemented by clinical features, radiological and biochemical findings can help in making a conclusive diagnosis. Patients with NCPF and EHPVO with clinical jaundice show transaminitis, high serum alkaline phosphatase level, more variceal bleed, and histological evidences of nodular regenerative hyperplasia.

AB  - Purpose:Drawing differential diagnoses to a Neuro-ophthalmology clinical scenario is a difficult task for a neurology trainee. The authors conducted a study to determine if a mobile application specialized in suggesting differential diagnoses from clinical scenarios can complement clinical reasoning of a neurologist in training. Methods:A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted to compare the accuracy of neurology residents versus a mobile medical app (Neurology Dx) in drawing a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses from Neuro-ophthalmology clinical vignettes. The differentials generated by residents and the App were compared with the Gold standard differential diagnoses adjudicated by experts. The prespecified primary outcome was the proportion of correctly identified high likely gold standard differential diagnosis by residents and App. Results:Neurology residents (n = 100) attempted 1500 Neuro-ophthalmology clinical vignettes. Frequency of correctly identified high likely differential diagnosis by residents was 19.42% versus 53.71% by the App (P < 0.0001). The first listed differential diagnosis by the residents matched with that of the first differential diagnosis adjudicated by experts (gold standard differential diagnosis) with a frequency of 26.5% versus 28.3% by the App, whereas the combined output of residents and App scored a frequency of 41.2% in identifying the first gold standard differential correctly. The residents correctly identified the first three and first five gold standard differential diagnosis with a frequency of 17.83% and 19.2%, respectively, as against 22.26% and 30.39% (P < 0.0001) by the App. Conclusion:A ruled based app in Neuro-ophthalmology has the potential to complement a neurology resident in drawing a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses.

AB  - Purpose: This was a population-based study to determine the prevalence and causes of visual impairment in children less than 16 years in Urban North India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 40 clusters of urban Delhi. 20,955 children aged less than 16 years underwent visual acuity screening using age-appropriate visual acuity charts. Unaided visual acuity of enumerated children aged over 2 years was assessed by using Lea symbols chart in 3-5 years age group and logMAR tumbling E charts for the 6-15 years age group. For children aged 0-2 years, fixation and following to torch light was assessed. All the children with unaided visual acuity of <6/12 in any eye in age group 3-15 years and inability to follow the light in age <3 years were referred for detailed ophthalmic examination. Results: Amongst 20,955 children examined for visual acuity a total of 789 children were referred to the central clinic for detailed ophthalmic examination. Of these referred children, a total of 124 had presenting visual acuity <6/18 in the better eye. The prevalence of visual impairment (VI) was 5.92 per thousand (95% CI: 4.96-7.05). The prevalence of moderate to severe visual impairment was maximum in the age group of 11 to 15 years. The main cause of avoidable VI in these children was a refractive error (75.7%). The prevalence of blindness was 0.42 per thousand. Conclusion: Optic nerve abnormalities were the most important cause of blindness in children. Refractive error is the most important cause of visual impairment amongst children and needs to be addressed.

AB  - The object-context associations and the valence are two important stimulus attributes that influence visual perception. The current study investigates the neural sources associated with schema congruent and incongruent object-context associations within positive, negative, and neutral valence during an intermittent binocular rivalry task with simultaneous high-density EEG recording. Cortical sources were calculated using the sLORETA algorithm in 150 ms after stimulus onset (Stim + 150) and 400 ms before response (Resp-400) time windows. No significant difference in source activity was found between congruent and incongruent associations in any of the valence categories in the Stim + 150 ms window indicating that immediately after stimulus presentation the basic visual processing remains the same for both. In the Resp-400 ms window, different frontal regions showed higher activity for incongruent associations with different valence such as the superior frontal gyrus showed significantly higher activations for negative while the middle and medial frontal gyrus showed higher activations for neutral and finally, the inferior frontal gyrus showed higher activations for positive valence. Besides replicating the previous knowledge of frontal activations in response to context congruity, the current study provides further evidence for the sensitivity of the frontal lobe to the valence associated with the incongruent stimuli.

AB  - Long-standing moderate to marked splenomegaly suggests several differential diagnoses, both haematological and infectious, particularly leishmaniasis and malaria in endemic areas. Non-infectious causes may be missed in these regions, especially if pitfalls of serological testing are not considered. Careful patient evaluation is necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We report a case of a young male whose hereditary spherocytosis was initially missed because of RK-39 positivity, splenomegaly and the fact that he hailed from an endemic region.

AB  - Purpose: This study was designed to identify mitochondrial (mt) DNA variations in primary and metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) cell lines and their relation with cell metabolism to gain insight into metastatic progression.
   Method: The entire mtDNA genomes were sequenced using Sanger sequencing from two primary UM cell lines (92.1 and MEL270) and two cell lines (OMM2.3 and OMM2.5) derived from liver metastases of the MEL270 patient. The mtDNA copy numbers determined by the ratio of nDNA versus mtDNA. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis genes.
   Results: Sequencing showed that cell line MEL270 and metastases-derived OMM2.3 and OMM2.5 cell lines had homoplasmic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representing J1c7a haplogroup, whereas 92.1 cells had mtDNA H31a haplogroup. mtDNA copy numbers were significantly higher in primary cell lines. The metastatic UM cells showed down-regulation of POLG, TFAM, NRF-1 and SIRT1 compared to their primary MEL270 cells. PGC-1 alpha was downregulated in 92.1 and upregulated in MEL270, OMM2.3 and OMM2.5.
   Conclusions: Our finding suggests that within metastatic cells, the heteroplasmic SNPs, copy numbers and mitochondrial biogenesis genes are modulated differentially compared to their primary UM cells. Therefore, investigating pathogenic mtDNA variants associated with cancer metabolic susceptibility may provide future therapeutic strategies in metastatic UM. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In industrial foundries, raw metal is heated almost up to its melting point and then passed through the rolling mill to mould it into a desired shape. Contact with hot machinery or the hot metal can cause severe deep burns. When such thermal injury involves the abdominal wall, complex bowel injury can occur, leading to life-threatening abdominal sepsis. We report successful management of a patient with abdominal wall defect and multiple open fistulae. Severe thermal injury of the anterior abdominal wall may be associated with latent bowel injuries and abdominal compartment syndrome. A low threshold for surgery and re-look surgery may prevent complications.

AB  - Background With the termination of RTOG 1221, there remains a lacuna regarding the optimal treatment for human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
   Methods Matched pair analysis with propensity score matching (PSM) between Arm I (transoral surgery [TOS] + risk-stratified adjuvant treatment) and Arm II (nonsurgical treatment - radiation/chemoradiation) in HPV(-) OPSCC.
   Results Unmatched comparison of Arm I (n = 57) and Arm II (n = 89) indicated significantly better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for Arm I. PSM by matched pairs (n = 48, 24 each arm) indicated 5-year OS at 80% and 72.1%, respectively, for Arm I and II (p > 0.05) and corresponding DFS at 65.3% and 33.4% (p > 0.05). Subgroup analysis did not demonstrate statistical difference in outcomes in stage II and III, but stage IV tumors had significantly better outcomes in Arm I than Arm II (4-year OS: 100% vs. 21%, p = 0.04; DFS: 75% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.04).
   Conclusions TOS +/- adjuvant was found to have oncological outcomes at par with nonsurgical modalities in stage I-III OPSCC, whereas a distinct survival advantage was noted in case of stage IV tumors.

AB  - Pulsed laser-based micro-texturing induces topographical and chemical modifications on surfaces that yield beneficial properties such as anti-microbial effect, micro-hydrodynamic bearing, and surface hardening. These properties find a multitude of applications in surface treatment and tribology. However, laser texturing of free form surfaces is a cost and effort-intensive process, specifically medical implants or ergonomically designed tools/devices. Such components often require numerically controlled 3 or 5 axes machines and sophisticated computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software for precise tool movement. In this manuscript, the authors have designed, fabricated, and validated a jerk-free, cost-effective Stewart platform that works in tandem with an existing laser machining setup. A microcontroller and stepper motor based linear actuators were used to orient and translate the six degrees-of-freedom (DoF) platform. A customized computer program helped maneuver the workpieces (medical implants) for the micro texturing of the 3D surface profiles. As laser irradiation demands a time-invariant focal length for effective ablation, the platform maintains the focal length from the galvo-scanner of the laser machine to the workpiece while maneuvering the workpiece throughout the texture trajectory. To estimate the smoothness of the platform during motion, vibrational parameters were also measured and analyzed. Such cost-effective platforms may find applications in free form texturing in non-contact mode of machining as well as in metrology. Texturing was performed successfully on implants freeform surface with an average diameter of similar to 35-40 mu m and depth of similar to 15-20 mu m.

AB  - Early visual deprivation is known to have profound consequences on the subsequent development of spatial visual processing. However, its impact on temporal processing is not well characterized. We have examined spatial and temporal contrast sensitivity functions following treatment for early and extended bilateral visual deprivation in fifteen children born with congenital cataracts in rural India. The results reveal a marked difference in post-treatment spatial and temporal sensitivities. Whereas spatial processing in newly sighted children is significantly impaired relative to age-matched controls, temporal processing exhibits remarkable resilience and is comparable to that in the control group. This difference in spatial and temporal outcomes is especially surprising given our computational analyses of video sequences which indicate a strong linkage between the spatial and temporal spectral content of natural visual inputs. We consider possible explanations for this discrepancy.

TI  - Does Bilateral Gap Arthroplasty Increase the Severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients With Temporomandibular Joint Ankylosis?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
KW  - OXYGEN-SATURATION
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in patients with bilateral temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA). The purpose of this study was to compare the preoperative and postoperative apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with TMJA undergoing bilateral gap arthroplasty (BGA).
   Methods: The investigators implemented a prospective cohort study on patients with bilateral TMJA treated with BGA. The primary predictor variable was time (before and after BGA). The primary outcome variable was AHI and secondary outcome variable included posterior airway space, skeletal changes, Epworth sleepiness scale, minimum oxygen, average oxygen saturation, and maximal incisal opening at preoperative time (T0), 1 month (T1), and at 6 months (T2). The statistical test used were Greenhouse-Geisser test, repeated measure ANOVA (1 way), followed by post hoc Bonferroni test. The P-value was taken significant when <0.05 at a confidence interval of 95%.
   Results: The study sample included 12 (m:f = 1:2) patients of bilateral TMJA with a mean age of 14.9 +/- 4.8 years and mean follow-up of 6 months. Mean duration of ankylosis was 10.5 +/- 6.9 years (median = 12). Trauma was the main etiological factor in 11 (91.7%) patients followed by infection in 1 (8.3%) patient. The mean increase in AHI was 8.6 (T0 to T1) with P-value = .002 and 23.4 (T1 to T2) and was statistically significant (P = .001). The mean decrease in posterior airway space was 4.5 +/- 1.0 to 3.5 +/- 0.5 (T0 to T2) and was statistically significant (P = .02). Mean difference in minimum oxygen was 6.8 (P-value = .015). Skeletal changes are consistent with clockwise rotation of the mandible and statistically significant changes in horizontal and vertical dimension. The mean change in average oxygen was statistically insignificant (P = 1.0).
   Conclusions: The present study concludes that gap arthroplasty in patients with bilateral TMJA can lead to development or worsening of pre-existing mild to moderate OSA. Ramus-condyle reconstruction should be performed to prevent the retropositioning of mandible and worsening of OSA. (C) 2021 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Among breast cancer subtypes, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis. In absence of any permitted targeted therapy, standard chemotherapy is the mainstay for TNBC treatment. Hence, there is a crucial need to identify potential druggable targets in TNBCs for its effective treatment. In recent times, metabolic reprogramming has emerged as cancer cells hallmark, wherein cancer cells display discrete metabolic phenotypes to fuel cell progression and metastasis. Altered glycolysis is one such phenotype, in which even in oxygen abundance majority of cancer cells harvest considerable amount of energy through elevated glycolytic-flux. In the present review, we attempt to summarize the role of key glycolytic enzymes i.e. HK, Hexokinase; PFK, Phosphofructokinase; PKM2, Pyruvate kinase isozyme type 2; and LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase in TNBCs, and possible therapeutic options presently available.

AB  - Background: Anemia control programs in India focus mainly on the measurement of hemoglobin in response to iron-folic acid supplementation. However, representative national estimates of iron deficiency (ID) are not available.
   Objectives: The objective of the present study was to evaluate ID prevalence among children and adolescents (1-19 y) using nationally representative data and to examine the sociodemographic patterning of ID.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey in children (1-4 y: n = 9635; 5-9 y: n = 11,938) and adolescents (10-19 y; n = 11,507) on serum ferritin (SF) and other biomarkers were analyzed to determine inflammation-adjusted ID prevalence [SF (mu g/L): <12 in 1-4 y and <15 in 5-19 y] and its relation to sociodemographic indicators. Multiple-regression analyses were conducted to identify the exposure associations of iron status. In addition, the relation between SF and hemoglobin was assessed as an indicator of iron utilization in different wealth quintiles.
   Results: ID prevalence was higher in 1- to 4-y-old children (31.9%; 95% CI: 31.0%, 32.8%) and adolescent girls (30.4%; 95% CI: 29.3%, 31.5%) but lower in adolescent boys and 5- to 9-y-old children (11%-15%). In all age groups, ID prevalence was higher in urban than in rural participants (1-4 y: 41% compared with 29%) and in those from richer quintiles (1-4 y: 44% in richest compared with 22% in poorest), despite adjustment for relevant confounders. SF significantly interacted with the wealth index, with declining trends in the strength of association between hemoglobin and SF from the richest to the poorest groups suggesting impaired iron utilization for hemoglobin synthesis in poorer wealth quintiles.
   Conclusions: ID prevalence was indicative of moderate (in preschool children and adolescent girls) or mild (in 5-to 9-yold children and adolescent boys) public health problem with significant variation by state and age. Focusing on increasing iron intake alone, without addressing the multiple environmental constraints related to poverty, may not result in intended benefits.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of dual-time-point-PET/CT, CECT and EUS + FNA in diagnosing pancreatic-ductal-adenocarcinomas (PDAC), in context of concomitant Chronic Pancreatitis (CP). Methods: 18F-FDG-PET/CTs were prospectively acquired in 22 confirmed CP and 23 confirmed PDAC patients (calculated for 90% power); and cut-offs of 2.2 for early-SUV(-1hr), 2.4 for delayed-SUV(-3hr) and 1.36 for Retention-index (RI), were derived. These cut-offs were validated in PET/CTs of 75 patients (51.9 +/- 13.3years; 54 men) with pancreatic masses of unknown nature. Comparisons were made with triple-phase-CECT (73 patients) and EUS + FNA (54 patients). Histopathology was obtained in 68 patients (including all PDACs) and 7 were followed up for minimum of 2 years. Results: In patients without concomitant CP, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for diagnosing malignancy in standard-acquisition-PET/CT, dual-time-point-PET/CT, CECT and EUS + FNA were 97.4%, 83.3%, 94.0%; 97.4%, 75.0%, 92%; 94.6%, 66.7%, 87.8% and 92.6%, 88.9%, 91.7% respectively. Corresponding values in patients with concomitant CP were 88.9%, 57.1%, 80.0%; 100%, 57.1%, 88%; 82.4%, 57.1%, 75% and 100%, 100%, 100% respectively. In lesions <2 cm (AJCC-T1), dual-time-point-PET/CT was the most sensitive (95.8%). ROC-analysis revealed significantly higher area-under-the-curve for RI over early-SUV (p = 0.002) in cases with concomitant CP only. In patients with confirmed liver-metastases, PET/CT and CECT identified 15/16 and 13/16 lesions. PET/CT identified additional lung-metastases in 3 and bonemetastasis in one patient. Conclusion: In patients without concomitant CP and with larger lesions, PET/CT and CECT are equivocal as screening modalities, with no benefit of dual-time-point-PET/CT acquisitions. However, in patients with concomitant CP and smaller lesions, dual-time-point PET/CT is better; with sensitivity comparable to EUS + FNA. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of IAP and EPC.

AB  - Background Chronic inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure induces deleterious effects on CNS including oxidative stress, cognitive deficits and altered brain neurochemistry. Little is known about the association between iAs and estrogen receptor expression in brain regions.
   Aims and objectives Owing to the neuroprotective and estrogenic activities of resveratrol (RES), we examined the combined effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and RES on neurobehavioural functions, estrogen signalling and associated neurochemical changes in mouse hippocampus.
   Materials and methods As2O3 alone (2 and 4 mg/kg bw) or along with RES (40 mg/kg bw) was administered orally for 45 days to adult female mice. From days 33 to 45, open field, elevated plus maze and Morris water maze tests were conducted to evaluate locomotion, anxiety and learning and memory. On day 46, animals were euthanized and brain tissue and hippocampi obtained therefrom were processed for atomic absorption spectrophotometry and western blotting respectively.
   Results As2O3 alone exposure resulted in enhanced anxiety levels, reduced locomotion and impaired learning and memory. As2O3-induced behavioural deficits were accompanied by downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER alpha) expression with a concomitant reduction of BDNF and NMDAR 2B levels in the hippocampus. However, the behavioural alterations and expression of these markers were restored in RES-supplemented mice. Moreover, a dose-dependent iAs accumulation was observed in serum and brain tissues of mice receiving As2O3 alone whereas simultaneous administration of As2O3 with RES facilitated iAs efflux.
   Conclusions These results suggest that reduced ER alpha expression with associated downregulation of BDNF and NMDAR 2B levels could be a mechanism by which iAs induces cognitive impairment; hence, the modulation of estrogen-NMDAR-BDNF pathway by RES represents a potential avenue to recover behavioural deficits induced by this neurotoxin.

AB  - Purpose: In residual deformity cases, it is difficult to reposition the zygomaticomaxillary-complex (ZMC) intraoperatively, due to resorbed fracture edges, and lack of zygoma analysis to 3-dimensionally quantify the deformity. Instability after zygomatic osteotomy and miniplate fixation (ZOMF) due to the gap between osteotomized segments, scar tissue, muscle pull, and other factors is also unknown. The study aims to evaluate symmetry and stability after ZOMF.
   Materials and methods: In this prospective study, a ZMC analysis was designed and patients with unilateral post-traumatic residual deformity (>10 weeks) of ZMC were treated with ZOMF. Measurements were evaluated on affected and unaffected sides at preoperatively, immediately, and 6 months postoperatively using MIMICS software. The primary outcome variable was the symmetry and stability of ZMC. Secondary parameters were changes in orbital volume, diplopia, ocular motility, mouth opening, and patient satisfaction. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. The continuous variables were compared by paired t-test. The change within the continuous variable with time was assessed by repeated measure ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni test. The changes within the categorical variable were assessed by the McNemar test.
   Results: Ten patients were enrolled (mean age = 29.2 +/- 9.97 years; male:female = 9:1; right:left = 4:6). The mean duration from trauma to surgery was 34.84 +/- 31.35 weeks. There was an improvement in the symmetry in anteroposteriorly (P = .005), mediolaterally (P = .001), and at the arch (P = .011) postoperatively. All parameters remained stable at 6 months postoperatively (difference not significant, P > .05); with the median satisfaction score of 4 of 5. Significant improvement in mouth opening (P = .014) and orbital volume (P = .001) was noted.
   Conclusions: Virtual measurements as per the proposed protocol helped in communication and quantifying ZMC. Four-point fixation with miniplates provided enough stability over the 6-month follow-up period. (C) 2021 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Background No data exist for the long-term outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) from the Southern part of Asia. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the survival outcome of mCRC from an Indian tertiary care center. The study also aims to highlight the treatment pattern practiced and the unique clinico-pathologic characteristics. Methods This is a single-center retrospective observational study done at a large referral tertiary care center in North India. All patients with synchronous or metachronous mCRC who received at least one dose of chemotherapy for metastatic disease, registered between 2003 to 2017 were included. Primary outcome measures were overall survival and progression-free survival and prognostic factors of overall survival. Descriptive analysis was done for the clinicopathological characteristics and treatment patterns. Kaplan Meier method for overall survival and progression-free survival. Cox regression analysis was performed for the determination of the prognostic factors for overall survival. Result Out of 377 eligible patients, 256 patients (68%) had de novo metastatic disease and the remaining 121 (32%) progressed to metastatic disease after initial treatment. The cohort was young (median age, 46 years) with the most common primary site being the rectum. A higher proportion of signet (9%) and mucinous histology (24%). The three common sites of metastasis were the liver, peritoneum, and lung. In the first line, most patients received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (70%). Only 12.5% of patients received biologicals in the first-line setting. The median follow-up and median overall survival of study cohort were 17 months and 18.5 months. The factors associated with poor outcome for overall survival on multivariate analysis were ECOG performance status of > 1, high CEA, low albumin, and the number of lines of chemotherapy received (< 2). Conclusion The outcome of mCRC is inferior to the published literature. We found a relatively higher proportion of patients with the following characteristics; younger, rectum as primary tumor location, the signet, and mucinous histology, higher incidence of peritoneum involvement. The routine use of targeted therapies is limited. Government schemes (inclusion of targeted therapies in the Ayushman scheme), NGO assistance, and availability of generic low-cost targeted drugs may increase the availability.

AB  - Background "Kangaroo mother care," a type of newborn care involving skin-to-skin contact with the mother or other caregiver, reduces mortality in infants with low birth weight (<2.0 kg) when initiated after stabilization, but the majority of deaths occur before stabilization. The safety and efficacy of kangaroo mother care initiated soon after birth among infants with low birth weight are uncertain.
   Methods We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in five hospitals in Ghana, India, Malawi, Nigeria, and Tanzania involving infants with a birth weight between 1.0 and 1.799 kg who were assigned to receive immediate kangaroo mother care (intervention) or conventional care in an incubator or a radiant warmer until their condition stabilized and kangaroo mother care thereafter (control). The primary outcomes were death in the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life) and in the first 72 hours of life.
   Results A total of 3211 infants and their mothers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (1609 infants with their mothers) or the control group (1602 infants with their mothers). The median daily duration of skin-to-skin contact in the neonatal intensive care unit was 16.9 hours (interquartile range, 13.0 to 19.7) in the intervention group and 1.5 hours (interquartile range, 0.3 to 3.3) in the control group. Neonatal death occurred in the first 28 days in 191 infants in the intervention group (12.0%) and in 249 infants in the control group (15.7%) (relative risk of death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P=0.001); neonatal death in the first 72 hours of life occurred in 74 infants in the intervention group (4.6%) and in 92 infants in the control group (5.8%) (relative risk of death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.04; P=0.09). The trial was stopped early on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board owing to the finding of reduced mortality among infants receiving immediate kangaroo mother care.
   Conclusions Among infants with a birth weight between 1.0 and 1.799 kg, those who received immediate kangaroo mother care had lower mortality at 28 days than those who received conventional care with kangaroo mother care initiated after stabilization; the between-group difference favoring immediate kangaroo mother care at 72 hours was not significant.

   Immediate "Kangaroo Mother Care" of Low-Birth-Weight Infants In this randomized, controlled trial conducted in hospitals with limited resources and involving infants who weighed between 1.0 and 1.799 kg at birth, mortality was lower among those assigned to immediate "kangaroo mother care" (skin-to-skin contact) than among those assigned to conventional care until stabilization and to kangaroo mother care thereafter.

AB  - Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the performance of the 'TBDetect' kit-based bio-safe fluorescent microscopy filter (BioFM-Filter) microscopy in comparison with direct smear microscopy and culture for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a multi-centric setting in India.
   Methods: The TBDetect kit enables sputum concentration through filtration using the BioFM-Filter for improved and bio-safe smear microscopy. We evaluated the performance of the TBDetect kit in a six-site multi-centric validation study on sputum collected from 2086 presumptive TB patients.
   Results: The combined positivity of TBDetect microscopy performed on these sputum samples was 20% (n = 417/2086) vs 16.1% of light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy (LED-FM, n = 337/2086) and 16% of Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) smear microscopy (n = 333/2086). The increment in positivity of TBDetect over both LED-FM and ZN smears was significant (p < 0.001). The overall sensitivity of TBDetect for six sites was similar to 55% (202/367, 95% confidence interval (CI): 50, 60%) vs 52% (191/367, 95% CI: 47, 57%) for LED-FM (p 0.14) and 50.9% (187/367, 95% CI: 46, 56%) for ZN smear (p < 0.05), using Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube culture (MGIT, n = 1949, culture positive, n = 367) as the reference standard. A bio-safety evaluation at six sites confirmed efficient sputum disinfection by TBDetect; 99.95% samples (1873/1874) were sterile after 42 days of incubation. Scientists and technicians at the study sites indicated the ease of use and convenience of TBDetect microscopy during feedback.
   Conclusions: TBDetect added value to the smear microscopy test due to its improved performance, convenience and user safety. These findings indicate that equipment-free TBDetect technology has the potential to improve TB diagnosis in basic laboratory settings by leveraging on the existing nationwide network of designated microscopy centres and primary healthcare centres.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has been associated with the global pandemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome. First reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan province of China, this new RNA virus has several folds higher transmission among humans than its other family member (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). The SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the region mediating the binding of the virus to host cells via Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical step of viral. Here in this study, we have utilized in silico approach for the virtual screening of antiviral library extracted from the Asinex database against the Receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Further, the molecules were ranked based on their binding affinity against RBD, and the top 15 molecules were selected. The affinity of these selected molecules to interrupt the ACE2-Spike interaction was also studied. It was found that the chosen molecules were demonstrating excellent binding affinity against spike protein, and these molecules were also very effectively interrupting the ACE2-RBD interaction.
   Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were utilized to investigate the top 3 selected molecules' stability in the ACE2-RBD complexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where molecules' inhibitory potential against the Receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and their inhibitory potential against the ACE2-Spike has been studied. We believe that these compounds can be further tested as a potential therapeutic option against COVID-19.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy with diverse clinical phenotypes and molecular heterogeneity not completely understood. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) in MM may influence disease pathogenesis, clinical presentation / drug sensitivities. But these signatures overlap meagrely plausibly due to complexity of myeloma genome, diversity in primary cells studied, molecular technologies/ analytical tools utilized. This warrants further investigations since DEGs/DEMs can impact clinical outcomes and guide personalized therapy. We have conducted genome-wide meta-analysis of DEGs/DEMs in MM versus Normal Plasma Cells (NPCs) and derived unified putative signatures for MM. 100 DEMs and 1,362 DEGs were found deranged between MM and NPCs. Signatures of 37 DEMs ('Union 37') and 154 DEGs ('Union 154') were deduced that shared 17 DEMs and 22 DEGs with published prognostic signatures, respectively. Two miRs (miR-16-2-3p, 30d-2-3p) correlated with survival outcomes. PPI analysis identified 5 topmost functionally connected hub genes (UBC, ITGA4, HSP90AB1, VCAM1, VCP). Transcription factor regulatory networks were determined for five seed DEGs with >= 4 biomarker applications (CDKN1A, CDKN2A, MMP9, IGF1, MKI67) and three topmost up/ down regulated DEMs (miR-23b, 195, let7b/ miR-20a, 155, 92a). Further studies are warranted to establish and translate prognostic potential of these signatures for MM.

AB  - The southernmost region of earth, Antarctica, has world's most challenging environments. Those who live for long time and work in Antarctic stations are subjected to environmental stresses such as cold weather, photoperiod variations leading to disrupted sleep cycles, constrained living spaces, dry air, non-availability of fresh food items, and high electromagnetic radiations, psychological factors, such as geographical and social isolation, etc. All these factors have a significant impact on the human body. The present study investigated the impact of Antarctica harsh environment on human physiology and its metabolic processes by evaluating urine metabolome, using 1H NMR spectroscopy and analyzing certain physiological and clinical parameters for correlation with physiological expression data and metabolite results. Two study groups - before Antarctic exposure (B) and after Antarctic exposure (E), consisting of 11 subjects, exposed to one-month summer expedition, were compared. 35 metabolites in urine samples were identified from the 700 MHz 1H NMR spectra from where integral intensity of 22 important metabolites was determined. Univariate analysis indicated significant decrease in the levels of citrate and creatinine in samples collected post-expedition. Multivariate analysis was also performed using 1H NMR spectroscopy, because independent metabolite abundances may complement each other in predicting the dependent variables. 10 metabolites were identified among the groups; the OPLS-DA and VIP score indicated variation in appearance of metabolites over different time periods with insignificant change in the intensities. Metabolite results illustrate the impact of environmental stress or altered life style including the diet with absence of fresh fruits and vegetables, on the pathophysiology of the human health. Metabolic adaptation to Antarctic environmental stressors may help to highlight the effect of short-term physiological status and provide important information during Antarctic expeditions to formulate management programmes.

AB  - Skewing of the sex ratio towards males occurs in humans. The possible explanation for excess male births could be a preference for Y-bearing sperm at fertilization and/or selective elimination of female embryos during pregnancy. In this study, we have tested the sex ratio in the preimplantation embryo (2-3 cells stage/closest possible primary sex ratio), the post-implantation embryo (day E7.5), and at birth (secondary sex ratio) on a homogenous (genetic, environmental, and dietary) population of mice to ascertain the biological reason i.e., male preference at fertilization or female elimination during pregnancy or both. Primary sex ratio on early preimplantation embryos (2-3 cells stage) was studied on 598 embryos and secondary sex ratio (at birth) on 721 pups using PCR-based sexing (both X & Y chromosome-specific) besides sex ratio of 80 post-implantation embryos (day E7.5). We have also investigated whether the fat content (high & low) of the diet affects the sex ratio. We observed a skewed sex ratio (more female) in preimplantation embryos (0.436; 95 % CI 0.39, 0.48), and post-implantation embryos (0.462; 95 % CI 0.35, 0.57) but reverse skewing (more male) at birth (0.539; 95 % CI 0.5, 0.58). We also observed that high-fat diet promoted male sex ratio at birth (0.657; 95 % CI 0.57, 0.74) whereas a low fat diet had the opposite effect (0.46; 95 % CI 0.36, 0.56) but no effect at fertilization (2-3 cells stage embryos). This indicates selective elimination of female embryo and fetus throughout pregnancy in mice, more so with a high-fat diet.

AB  - Management of mis-dissected lenticule during Small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) is technically challenging and might be experienced more by novice surgeons especially in eyes with low refractive errors and thin lenticules. Presently, we describe a rescue method of inverse centripetal dissection (ICD) to manage mis-dissected lenticules. In this technique, after inadvertent dissection of posterior plane prior to anterior plane, the double-ended SMILE dissector is rotated along its shaft axis clockwise from the left upper margin of the mis-dissected lenticule to form an inversely folded lenticule which is then subsequently dissected centripetally till midline. This is then extracted by performing lenticulorrhexis with a pair of microforceps. We performed this technique in 10 eyes of 10 patients and the lenticule extraction was accomplished successfully in all eyes. At six months follow-up, the uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 with a clear interface in all eyes. The ICD approach might serve as a useful rescue technique for managing mis-dissected lenticules.

AB  - In regard to the global pandemic of COVID-19, it seems that persons with epilepsy (PWE) are not more vulnerable to get infected by SARS-CoV-2, nor are they more susceptible to a critical course of the disease. However, management of acute seizures in patients with COVID-19 as well as management of PWE and COVID19 needs to consider potential drug-drug interactions between antiseizure drugs and candidate drugs currently assessed as therapeutic options for COVID-19. Repurposing of several licensed and investigational drugs is discussed for therapeutic management of COVID-19. While for none of these approaches, efficacy and tolerability has been confirmed yet in sufficiently powered and controlled clinical studies, testing is ongoing with multiple clinical trials worldwide. Here, we have summarized the possible mechanisms of action of drugs currently considered as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 management along with possible and confirmed drugdrug interactions that should be considered for a combination of antiseizure drugs and COVID-19 candidate drugs. Our review suggests that potential drug-drug interactions should be taken into account with drugs such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir while remdesivir and tocilizumab may be less prone to clinically relevant interactions with ASMs.

AB  - Introduction: Posterior circulation strokes (PCS) have been less extensively studied than anterior circulation strokes (ACS), especially regarding revascularization therapies. We analyzed the differences in baseline stroke characteristics, revascularization therapy and 3-month outcomes between PCS and ACS in a large prospective multicentre Indian stroke registry. Methods: Patients with acute ischemic stroke recruited in the Indo-US collaborative stroke project from January 2012 to August 2014 were classified into PCS and ACS based on imaging-confirmed infarct location. Demographics, stroke severity, risk factors, and mechanisms were compared. We further compared these parameters in the subgroups who received revascularization therapies (RT) and no revascularization therapies (NRT). The primary outcome was 3-month modified Rankin scale (mRS). Results: Of 1889 patients (1270 males), 1478 (78.2%) had ACS and 411 (21.8%) PCS. The median NIHSS was lower in PCS (7 vs 11, p < 0.001). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were more common in PCS and rheumatic heart disease in ACS. Small artery occlusion was higher in PCS (23.8% vs 12.9%, p < 0.001). Only 28 (6.8%) PCS received RT compared to 213 (14.4%) ACS. At 90 days, a good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) was more common in PCS (56.4% vs 45.9%, p < 0.001) in NRT group, while no significant difference was noted in RT group. Stroke territory was not an independent predictor of 3-month outcome in regression analysis. In-hospital mortality was not different between the groups. Conclusions: The 3-month functional outcome and in-hospital mortality were not different between ACS and PCS. Compared to ACS, PCS received revascularization therapies less often.

AB  - Polymer gel dosimetry (PGD) can provide three-dimensional (3D) dose data for evaluation of the dose calculation algorithms used by treatment planning systems (TPS). Although the PGD technique, particularly with MRI, is now ready for clinical applications, an accurate calibration method is vital for treatment validation in 3D. This study evaluated the single-phantom electron beam (SPE) method that used the depth-dose data of a 9 MeV electron beam. This technique was compared with the multi-vial x-ray (MVX) method that used nine small vials irradiated with various doses. We tested two regression equations, i.e., third-order polynomial and tangent functions, and two dose-normalization methods, i.e., one-point and two-point methods. These methods were evaluated using a dose distribution generated by a 3 cm x 3 cm open arc beam. We used MAGAT polymer gel manufactured in-house. We found that the SPE method required a smaller dose scaling for the dose comparison. The tangent function showed better data fitting than the polynomial function with smaller uncertainty of the estimated coefficients. We did not observe a distinct advantage of the SPE method over the MVX method for the 3D dose comparison with the test case. From this study, we infer that the SPE method with the tangent function as the regression equation and one-point dose normalization is a good calibration option for the MRI-based polymer gel dosimetry.

AB  - Objective To compare the risk of mortality and other clinical outcomes in children with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock who received antibiotics within the first hour of recognition (early antibiotics group) with those who received antibiotics after the first hour (delayed antibiotics group).
   Study design In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled children <17 years of age presenting to the pediatric emergency and diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock without prior antibiotic therapy. Primary outcome was mortality and the secondary outcomes were day 1 Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, ventilator-free days, and hospital-free days. These outcomes were compared between the early and the delayed antibiotic groups. The reference point for defining early and delayed antibiotic groups was time 0, which was measured from the time the patient was diagnosed to have sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock to the time of administration of the first dose of antibiotics.
   Results About three-fourths (77%) of the 441 children enrolled had septic shock. A total of 241 (55%) and 200 (45%) children were in the delayed and early antibiotic groups, respectively. Children in the delayed group had significantly higher odds of mortality than those in the early group (29% vs 20%; aOR 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14-2.92; P = .01). The time to shock reversal was significantly shorter, and the ventilator-free days and hospital-free days were significantly greater, in the early antibiotic group. There was no difference between the groups with regard to any of the other clinical outcomes.
   Conclusions Delayed administration of antibiotics beyond 1 hour of recognition was associated with higher mortality rates in children with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Antibiotics should be administered within the first hour, along with other resuscitative measures, in these children.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the cognitive functions in participants maintained on buprenorphine for opioid dependence at peak and trough buprenorphine levels.
   Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized, experimental study. Sixty participants maintained on buprenorphine were matched for age and education and randomly allocated to "peak" group or "trough" group. The "peak" group received buprenorphine two hours before assessment, whereas the trough group received placebo. The cognitive domains of attention, learning and memory, and executive function including fluency, working memory, response inhibition and set shifting were tested.
   Results: The two groups were comparable on socio-demographic, substance use profile and opioid agonist treatment-related characteristics. Significant differences in performance of peak and trough group were observed on Wisconsin Card Sorting Test parameters of number of correct responses (U = 289.00, p = 0.03), number of errors (t = 02.26, df = 58, p = 0.03), and perseverative errors (U = 301.50, p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: The time since buprenorphine dose has significant relation on specific cognitive tasks in patients maintained on buprenorphine for opioid dependence.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the anatomical changes in kidney orientation in prone position with use of horizontal or vertical bolster alignment. Methods Patients having renal stone(s) on ultrasonogram or X-ray underwent split bolus computed-tomo-urography (CTU) in prone position with horizontal and vertical bolster positions. CTUs were read by a single radiologist to quantify the cranio-caudal, antero-posterior, side to side and rotational movements of kidneys as relevant to prone percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Results 19 adult patients with 38 renal units and mean basal metabolic index of 25.6 kg/m(2) underwent CTU. Greater inferior displacement of both kidneys was seen with horizontal bolsters as compared to vertical bolsters. The right upper calyceal-diaphragm distance was 2.1 +/- 1.5 cm and the lower calyceal-diaphragm distance was 2.0 +/- 1.6 cm greater with the horizontal bolsters (p < 0.01). Similarly, the displacement on the left side was 1.5 +/- 0.8 cm and 1.4 +/- 0.8 cm, respectively (p < 0.01). Horizontal bolsters also result in significantly longer calyceal-skin distance at both poles of both kidneys [right upper: 0.4 +/- 0.5 cm (p < 0.01), right lower: 0.8 +/- 0.7 cm (p < 0.01), left upper: 0.4 +/- 0.6 cm (p = 0.02), left lower: 0.8 +/- 1.1 cm (p < 0.01)] and wider erector spinae-mid posterior calyceal-colon angle (124.8 v/s 110.0 on the right and 96.2 v/s 85.7 on the left) (p < 0.01). Conclusion Horizontal bolsters provide significantly more caudal displacement of the kidneys; the right kidney being displaced more as compared to the left. However, there is also an increase in the skin-calyceal distance with horizontal as compared to the vertical bolsters. These assessments may help the surgeons decide optimal bolster position individualized to the patient.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the patterns of recurrence and factors affecting the same after interval cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in primary stage IIIC and IV A epithelial ovarian cancer.
   Methods: In this retrospective multicentric study, all patients with FIGO stages III-C and IV-A epithelial ovarian carcinoma were treated with CRS and HIPEC after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Relevant clinical and demographic data were captured. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the factors affecting recurrence after CRS and HIPEC.
   Results: From January 2017 to Jan 2020, 97, consecutive patients of Stage IIIC/IVA epithelial ovarian cancer underwent interval cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median duration of follow up duration was 20 months [1-36months]. 21/97 (21.6%) patients presented with disease recurrence. Visceral recurrences involving the lungs, liver and brain were seen in 8/21 (38%) of cases and comprised the commonest sites. On multivariable analysis, nodal involvement (p = 0.05), selective peritonectomy (p = 0.001) and leaving behind residual disease <0.25 mm (CC1) (p = 0.01) was associated with increased risk of disease recurrence. Extent of peritonectomy (OS,p = 0.56, PFS p = 0.047, Log Rank test) and nodal positivity (OS, p = 0.13,PFS,p = 0.057, Log Rank test) were found to impact progression free survival but had no impact on overall survival.
   Conclusion: There is a higher incidence of systemic recurrences in patients with Stage IIIC/IVA epithelial ovarian carcinoma after CRS and HIPEC. Extent of peritonectomy and nodal clearance impacts patterns of recurrence and progression free survival.

AB  - Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a sensitive, efficient, and rapid nucleic acid amplification technique resulting in a large number of amplicons; however, it suffers from a high incidence of false positives due to carry-over and aerosol. Herein, we report a 10 min nano-capture system that is used in conjunction with a modified reverse transcriptase-LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay for the accurate detection of SARS CoV-2 virus. The nano-capture system employs in-house-designed probe-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles Co2FeAl (cobalt-based Heusler alloy) for efficient capture of contaminating amplicons from the reaction mixture preceding RT-LAMP. The nano-cleaned RT-LAMP assay along with engineered primers successfully detected the presence of 10 copies of SARS CoV-2 virus while completely eliminating the incidence of false positives. The presented contaminant-capture method has been compared with other approaches for elimination of contaminants and was found to be more effective. The insight brought in this work is the design of a rapid nano- capture system that hybridizes with contaminating amplicons (carry-over) with high specificity to enable easy removal from the assay for elimination of false positives. The method has been proven to be successful for RT-LAMP assays in the rapid and highly specific detection of SARS CoV-2, which is currently a major challenge for global health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work involving a nano-based cleaning strategy for reliable and rapid diagnosis using isothermal amplification approaches.

KW  - IMPLEMENTATION
AB  - Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are systematically developed statements backed by scientific evidence to assist practitioners in management in clinical practice. An international cross-sectional survey was conducted by the IPNA to examine the perceptions of pediatric nephrologists on guidelines and their usage and to identify important diseases for future clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). The survey found that the majority of pediatric nephrologists find CPGs useful in clinical practice and admitted to using them most of the time. Developing CPGs is challenging and there are standards available to develop trustworthy guidelines. While evidence-based global guidelines are ideal, pediatric nephrologists expressed the desire that they address regional differences. Most respondents (89.2%) to the survey agreed that adult guidelines did not cover the pediatric perspective adequately and 71.4% opined that consensus-based pediatric guidelines can be developed when evidence for the pediatric population is lacking. The development of high-quality practice guidelines requires substantial resources and may not be feasible in resource-poor countries. Adaptation of an existing guideline has been suggested as an alternative and the ADAPTE collaboration provides a systematic approach to adapting guidelines. Several diseases where pediatric guidelines are needed as a priority including IgA and C3 glomerulopathy were identified in the survey. Implementation of guideline-based care is challenging and the survey found that lack of availability of guidelines (43%) and resources (22.8%) are important reasons for poor implementation in lower-middle and low-income countries. Perceived complexity of guidelines, physician attitudes, and lack of training also contribute to non-adherence to guidelines.

AB  - Despite lack of evidence, the practice of routine prefeed gastric residue aspiration before the next feed is common. Recent studies suggest that this practice might be even harmful. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of avoiding routine prefeed gastric residue aspiration as compared to routine aspiration, on various clinical outcomes in preterm infants. We searched five different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) until March 8, 2021. Only randomized controlled trials comparing the practice of routine prefeed gastric aspiration with no routine aspiration in preterm infants were considered eligible. The random-effects meta-analysis was done using RevMan 5.3 software. Of the 894 unique records identified by our search, we included 6 studies (451 participants) in the review. There was no significant difference in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.08; 421 participants in 5 trials). Avoiding routine prefeed aspiration was associated with achieving full enteral feeds earlier (MD - 3.19 days, 95% CI - 4.22 to - 2.16), shorter duration of hospitalization (MD - 5.32 days; 95% CI - 10.25 to -0.38), and lower incidence of late-onset sepsis (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99). Time to regain birth weight, days of total parenteral nutrition or central venous line usage, culture-positive sepsis, and all-cause mortality did not differ between the two groups.
   Conclusion: In the absence of other signs of feed intolerance, routine prefeed gastric residue aspiration should be avoided in preterm infants.

AB  - Background: Patients with postpolio residual paralysis can develop disabling hip arthritis in paralytic as well as a nonparalytic limb, warranting total hip arthroplasty (THA). Limited literature is available on the results of THA among these patients in the form of small series or case reports. We have undertaken a systematic review to evaluate the clinical outcome of THA in patients with poliomyelitis with hip pathologies.
   Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science pertaining to English literature was undertaken from 1945 to August 2020 to assess the results of THA in patients with poliomyelitis. Information was gathered about demographics, indication, clinical course, complications, functional outcome, survival, and need for any revision surgery in these patients.
   Results: The literature search revealed 81 articles. Finally, after deduplication and manual selection, 16 relevant articles (128 hips) were included for evaluation. There is a paucity of literature evaluating THA in patients with poliomyelitis over the last 2 decades. The principal reason for arthroplasty was osteoarthritis of the hip in the ipsilateral (paralyzed) limb. A combination of cemented, uncemented, and hybrid implant fixation system was found to be used by surgeons. Addressing instability and perioperative management of limb length discrepancy were found to be challenging propositions.
   Conclusion: THA remains an effective intervention to relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients of poliomyelitis afflicted with either primary or secondary arthritis of the hip. The use of uncemented nonconstrained hip implant designs appears to demonstrate better results than constrained implants. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Few studies have focused on exploring the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in older patients. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to have a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of older COVID-19 patients. Methods A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus was performed from December 2019 to May 3rd, 2020. Observational studies including older adults (age >= 60 years) with COVID-19 infection and reporting clinical characteristics or outcome were included. Primary outcome was assessing weighted pooled prevalence (WPP) of severity and outcomes. Secondary outcomes were clinical features including comorbidities and need of respiratory support. Result Forty-six studies with 13,624 older patients were included. Severe infection was seen in 51% (95% CI- 36-65%, I-2-95%) patients while 22% (95% CI- 16-28%, I-2-88%) were critically ill. Overall, 11% (95% CI- 5-21%, I-2-98%) patients died. The common comorbidities were hypertension (48, 95% CI- 36-60% I-2-92%), diabetes mellitus (22, 95% CI- 13-32%, I-2-86%) and cardiovascular disease (19, 95% CI - 11-28%, I-2-85%). Common symptoms were fever (83, 95% CI- 66-97%, I-2-91%), cough (60, 95% CI- 50-70%, I-2-71%) and dyspnoea (42, 95% CI- 19-67%, I-2-94%). Overall, 84% (95% CI- 60-100%, I-2-81%) required oxygen support and 21% (95% CI- 0-49%, I-2-91%) required mechanical ventilation. Majority of studies had medium to high risk of bias and overall quality of evidence was low for all outcomes. Conclusion Approximately half of older patients with COVID-19 have severe infection, one in five are critically ill and one in ten die. More high-quality evidence is needed to study outcomes in this vulnerable patient population and factors affecting these outcomes.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the cardiovascular, tracheobronchial and pulmonary abnormalities associated with tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve syndrome (TOF-APVS) on multidetector computed tomograpgy (MDCT) angiography.
   Materials and Methods We conducted a retrospective review of our electronic database from January, 2014 to December, 2020 to identify pediatric patients diagnosed with TOF-APVS on MDCT angiography. Pulmonary anatomy, associated tracheobronchial and coronary compression, compression of intrapulmonary bronchi, lung parenchymal changes and other associated cardiovascular abnormalities were evaluated.
   Results Forty-seven patients with TOF-APVS were included in the study. Compression of the airways was observed at multiple levels; 4 (8.5%) patients had carinal compression while right main bronchus and left main bronchus compression was seen in 12 (25.5%) and 16 (34.0%) patients, respectively. Forty-three (91.5%) patients showed abnormal pulmonary arterial branching at the segmental level and compression at the level of intrapulmonary bronchi was seen in 24 (51.1%) patients. Some degree of air trapping was seen in 35 (74.5%) patients whereas atelectasis was observed in 15 (31.9%) patients. Mild coronary arterial compression was seen in 3 (6.4%) patients.
   Conclusion TOF-APVS is characterized by aneurysmal dilatation of pulmonary arteries leading to a varying degree of airway compression. However, even in the absence of compression of the trachea and main bronchi, there can be distal bronchial compression secondary to abnormal pulmonary arterial branching resulting in lung abnormalities in the majority of these patients. This study highlights the importance of dedicated airway assessment in addition to cardiovascular morphological assessment by MDCT angiography, before planning surgery.

AB  - Not all anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies (HLA-DSAs) are detrimental to renal allograft. In this context, the C1q complement activating ability of antibodies appears to be an important parameter to distinguish clinically inert versus detrimental DSAs. We evaluated sera of 206 consecutive primary live donor renal transplant recipients before transplant and at post-operative day 7, 30, 90, 180 and at the time of graft dysfunction for quantifying HLA-DSAs using single antigen bead assay on a Luminex platform. Patients positive for these antibodies with an MFI >500 were further screened for C1q fixing nature of DSA. Fourteen of the 18 antibody-positive patients had C1q fixing DSA with MFI value >5000. Only 4 antibody-positive patients did not have C1q fixing DSA. The MFI values of DSA detected by C1q assay were generally higher at least by 25% than those detected by the conventional IgG-SAB assay. Twelve of the 14 patients (85.71%) with C1q+ DSA developed antibody-mediated rejection during the mean follow-up period of 21.43 +/- 8.03 months as compared to none of the four C1q-negative DSA (85.71% vs 0%; P = .001). These results suggest deleterious effect of C1q+ DSA vis-a-vis C1q-negative DSA on renal allograft.

AB  - Cancer genomics has evolved over the years from understanding the pathogenesis of cancer to screening the future possibilities of cancer occurrence. Understanding the genetic profile of tumors holds a prognostic as well as a predictive value in this era of therapeutic surveillance, molecular remission, and precision medicine. Identifying molecular markers in tumors is the current standard of approach, and requires an efficient combination of an accessible sample type and a profoundly sensitive technique. Liquid biopsy or cell-free DNA has evolved as a novel sample type with promising results in recent years. Although cell-free DNA has significant role in various cancer types, this review focuses on its application in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Beginning with the current concept and clinical relevance of minimal residual disease in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we discuss the literature on circulating DNA and its evolving application in the realm of cutting-edge technology.

AB  - Background and aims: Hemorrhagic stroke (HS) results in significant mortality and disability worldwide. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is responsible for blood pressure regulation and vascular homeostasis. Our objective was to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis for ascertaining the association of ACE I/D polymorphism with HS since a number of studies depicted inconclusive evidence. Methods: Literature search was performed till July 10, 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Chinese National Knowledge Information and Google Scholar databases with keywords: ('Angiotensin Converting Enzyme' OR 'ACE') AND ('Single Nucleotide polymorphisms' OR 'SNP') AND ('Hemorrhagic stroke or 'HS'). Pooled Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were determined for gene-disease association using either fixed (when I2 < 50%) or random effect (when I2 > 50%) models. Risk of bias in studies was assessed using funnel plots and sensitivity analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13.0 software. Results: A total of 53 studies having 5186 HS and 7347 healthy control subjects were included in our metaanalysis. Pooled analyses showed that ACE I/D gene polymorphism had significant association with risk of HS in overall study population [(dominant model: OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.12-1.50 & recessive model: OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.46-2.20)]. Population subgroup analyses further revealed significant relationship of ACE I/D polymorphism with ICH in Asians (recessive: OR 1.97, 95% CI = 1.57-2.47) but not in Caucasians (recessive: OR 1.02, 95% CI = 0.76-1.36). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that ACE I/D polymorphism may lead to risk of HS and can be a potential biomarker for HS susceptibility especially in Asian population.
