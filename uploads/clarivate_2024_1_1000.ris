AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal beta-coronavirus that emerged in 2012. The virus is part of the WHO blueprint priority list with a concerning fatality rate of 35%. Scientific efforts are ongoing for the development of vaccines, anti-viral and biotherapeutics, which are majorly directed toward the structural spike protein. However, the ongoing effort is challenging due to conformational instability of the spike protein and the evasion strategy posed by the MERS-CoV. In this study, we have expressed and purified the MERS-CoV pre-fusion spike protein in the Expi293F mammalian expression system. The purified protein was extensively characterized for its biochemical and biophysical properties. Thermal stability analysis showed a melting temperature of 58 degrees C and the protein resisted major structural changes at elevated temperature as revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Immunological assessment of the MERS-CoV spike immunogen in BALB/c mice with AddaVaxTM and Imject alum adjuvants showed elicitation of high titer antibody responses but a more balanced Th1/Th2 response with AddaVaxTM squalene like adjuvant. Together, our results suggest the formation of higher-order trimeric pre-fusion MERS-CoV spike proteins, which were able to induce robust immune responses. The comprehensive characterization of MERS-CoV spike protein warrants a better understanding of MERS spike protein and future vaccine development efforts.

AB  - BackgroundTo evaluate outcomes of laparoscopic retroperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy for stage 1b3-3b cervical cancer.MethodsPathology databases searched for all para-aortic lymphadenectomy cases 2005-2016. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse baseline characteristics, cox models for treatment affect after accounting for variables, and Kaplan Meier curves for survival (STATA v15).Results191 patients had 1b3-3b cervical cancer of which 110 patients had Para-aortic lymphadenectomy. 8 (7.3%) patients stage 1b3, 82 (74.6%) stage 2b, and 20 (18.1%) stage 3b cervical cancer. Mean lymph node count 11.7 (SD7.6). The intra-operative and post-operative 30 day complication rates were 8.8% (CI: 4.3%, 15.7%) and 5.3% (CI: 1.9%, 11.2%) respectively.Para-aortic nodes were apparently positive on CT/MRI in 5/110 (5%) cases. Cancer was found in 10 (8.9%, CI: 4.3%, 15.7%) cases on histology, all received extended field radiotherapy. Only 2 were identified on pre-operative CT/MRI imaging. 3 of 10 suspected node-positive cases on CT/MRI had negative histology. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy led to alteration in staging and radiotherapy management in 8 (8%, CI: 3.7%, 14.6%) patients. Mean overall survival 42.81 months (SD = 31.79 months). Survival was significantly higher for women undergoing PAN (50.57 (SD 30.7) months) compared to those who didn't (31.27 (SD 32.5) months)Results191 patients had 1b3-3b cervical cancer of which 110 patients had Para-aortic lymphadenectomy. 8 (7.3%) patients stage 1b3, 82 (74.6%) stage 2b, and 20 (18.1%) stage 3b cervical cancer.

   We evaluated outcomes for patients with stage 1b3-3b cervical cancer that had lymph nodes removed prior to planning their chemoradiotherapy. There were 3 groups - patients that had their lymph nodes removed, those that did not and those that had their procedure abandoned so didn't have their lymph nodes removed. We looked at the lymph nodes down the microscope to see if they contained cancer and compared this to their pre-operative imaging. 8 patients had a change to their staging and treatment because they were found to have cancer in the lymph nodes. We found that the keyhole procedure to remove lymph nodes is an acceptable procedure which can guide treatment in women with locally advanced cervical cancer.

AB  - BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that usually affects the lungs, although it can also affect other parts of the body. Vitamin D deficiency and response to treatment have been demonstrated in patients with active TB in several studies, but not in MDR-TB patients, which is a new observation in the present study.ObjectiveTo study the time to initial sputum culture conversion and to associate baseline vitamin D levels and response to treatment in patients with PTB Cat I and MDR-TB.MethodsA total of 897 North Indian participants were recruited and divided into three groups: treatment-na & iuml;ve PTB Cat I, MDR-TB, and healthy controls. Serum biochemistry, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium, was measured in all participants with PTB, Cat I, and MDR-TB.ResultsPTB Cat I patients had high bacillary load grading at baseline compared to 2nd month followed by 6th month of treatment. More severe chest radiographic features, such as cavitation and the presence of bilateral disease at baseline. Mean sputum smear conversion times were 0.95 +/- 0.7 months and culture conversion to negative occurred at a mean time of 0.8 +/- 0.7 in PTB Cat I patients compared to MDR-TB patients on average sputum smear and time of 2.4 +/- 3 months. Significantly lower mean serum 25-hyroxyvitamin D concentration was found in the 6th month than in the 2nd month and baseline in PTB Cat I.ConclusionLow serum vitamin D deficiency was observed in both groups during treatment and is one of the important factors responsible for susceptibility to TB in both groups; however, its significance is uncertain. Patients with continuous positive sputum for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) had a worse prognosis than those with sputum bacteriology conversion. Two months into a treatment regimen, sputum smear conversions may be a useful indicator of an MDR-TB patient's prognosis.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions, ranging from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and severe outcomes such as cirrhosis or cancer. The progression from hepatic steatosis to fibrosis involves significant extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, characterized by increased collagen deposition and cross-linking of ECM proteins, causing increased tissue stiffness and altered MMP expression patterns. Dysregulated MMP expression and extracellular acidosis are key contributors to NAFLD progression. Unlike other MMPs, which may be relevant only at specific disease stages, MMP-9 serves as a universal marker, allowing for monitoring of its expression in relation to disease states and ECM parameters. Understanding dysregulated MMP-9 expression across different NAFLD stages can provide crucial insights into disease progression and serve as both a diagnostic and a prognostic biomarker, identifying potential therapeutic targets. This study introduces a three-dimensional (3D) collagen/alginate-based liver disease model designed to investigate how matrix collagen content, elasticity, and diseased cell conditions influence MMP expression and pH levels in situ using nanoprobes. The platform offered an understanding of the relationships between these factors and their role in NAFLD progression, offering valuable insights into disease progression and potential resolution. To examine how various physicochemical and biological factors, particularly MMP expression and collagen deposition, drive NAFLD progression, three 3D NAFLD models were developed, simulating healthy (HL), steatotic (SL), and fibrotic (FL) liver matrices. Additionally, the role of collagenase treatment in the FL matrix in enhancing MMP expression and potentially mitigating fibrosis was also explored. By employing dual-sensitive fluorescent nanoprobes to monitor real-time in situ changes in MMP-9 expression and pH levels, this platform offers a novel approach to understanding the in vitro roles of matrix stiffness, collagen deposition, and diseased cell conditions in NAFLD pathogenesis.

AB  - Dexter energy transfer (DET) of triplet electronic states is used to direct energy in photovoltaics, quench reactive singlet oxygen species in biological systems, and generate them in photodynamic therapy. However, the extent to which repeated DET between aromatic residues can lead to triplet energy migration in proteins has not been investigated. Here, we computationally describe DET rates in microtubules, actin filaments and the intermediate filament, vimentin. We discover instances where interaromatic residue Dexter couplings within individual protein subunits of these polymers are similar those of small molecules used for organic electronics. However, interaromatic residue coupling is mostly weak (<10(-3) eV), limiting triplet energy diffusion lengths to 6.1, 0.5 and 1.0 & Aring; in microtubules, actin filaments and vimentin, respectively. On the other hand, repeated forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between aromatic residues leads to singlet energy diffusion lengths of 12.4 & Aring; for actin filaments and about 8.6 & Aring; for both microtubules and vimentin filaments. Our work shows that singlet energy migration dominates over triplet energy migration in cytoskeletal polymers.

AB  - ObjectiveRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition that, despite available approaches to manage the disease, lacks an efficient treatment and timely diagnosis. Using the most advanced omics technique, metabolomics and proteomics approach, we explored varied metabolites and proteins to identify unique metabolite-protein signatures involved in the disease pathogenesis of RA.MethodsUntargeted metabolomics (n = 20) and proteomics (n = 60) of RA patients' plasma were carried out by HPLC/LC-MS/MS and SWATH, respectively and analyzed by Metaboanalyst. The targets of metabolite retrieved by PharmMapper were matched with SWATH data, and joint pathway analysis was carried out. An in-vitro study of metabolites in TNF-alpha induced SW982 cells was conducted by Western, RT-PCR, scratch, and ROS scavenging assay. The effect of GUDCA was also evaluated in the CIA rat model.ResultsA Total of 82 metabolites and 231 differential proteins were revealed. Porphyrin and chlorophyll pathway and its metabolite Glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) was found to be significantly altered. In vitro analysis has shown that GUDCA reduces inflammation thus offering protection against ROS production and cell proliferation. PharmMapper analysis revealed that GUDCA was significantly linked with identified SWATH proteins insulin like growth factor-1(IGF1), and Transthyretin (TTR) and it upregulates the expression of IGF1 and downregulates the expression of TTR in both in vitro and in vivo models.ConclusionGUDCA was found to possess antioxidative, antiproliferative properties and an effective anti-inflammatory property at a low dosage. It may be considered as a potential therapeutic option for reducing the inflammatory parameters associated with RA.

AB  - Sustainable plant disease management has long been a major issue in agriculture since the excessive reliance on broad-spectrum pesticides exacerbates chemical resistance, presenting environmental and health hazards. Taking cues from nature's intricate defense mechanisms, scientists are exploiting bioactive agents involved in plant-pathogen/pest interactions to develop novel strategies to combat diseases. Embracing biomolecules in agriculture offers an ecofriendly alternative to chemical pesticides. However, traditional delivery methods for biomolecules often suffer from low utilization rates and low field stability, diminishing the overall effectiveness of active compounds. The advent of nanotechnology has facilitated the design of novel delivery systems for biomolecular cargos, further enhancing their capacity to adhere to plant surfaces and make disease control strategies effective. Tailored depending upon the extent of infection and type of plant species, innovative nanoparticle strategies maximize the effectiveness of delivery by modifying the size, surface characteristics, and adhesion capacity of the particles to suit particular requirements. This review examines how the various biological factors involved in innate plant defenses can be exploited, as well as the potential of various nanocarriers in biomolecule delivery for plant disease management.

TI  - Darolutamide in Combination With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer From the Phase III ARANOTE Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
KW  - CLINICAL-TRIALS
AB  - PURPOSE For patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), delaying progression to castration-resistant disease is important not only for overall survival (OS) but also for patients' quality of life. Darolutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with docetaxel improved OS versus ADT and docetaxel in patients with mHSPC. The ARANOTE trial evaluated darolutamide and ADT without chemotherapy in patients with mHSPC. METHODS In this global phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo, with concomitant ADT. The primary end point was radiological progression-free survival (rPFS). RESULTS From March 2021 to August 2022, 669 patients were randomly assigned (darolutamide n = 446; placebo n = 223). At the primary cutoff date (June 7, 2024), darolutamide plus ADT significantly improved rPFS, reducing the risk of radiological progression or death by 46% versus placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71]; P < .0001), with consistent benefits across subgroups, including high- and low-volume disease. OS results were suggestive of benefit with darolutamide versus placebo (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.12]), and clinical benefits were seen across all other secondary end points, including delayed time to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.51]) and time to pain progression (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96]). Adverse events were similar in the two groups. Notably, the incidence of fatigue was lower in patients receiving darolutamide (5.6%) versus those receiving placebo (8.1%), and fewer patients receiving darolutamide (6.1%) versus placebo (9.0%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSION These results confirm the efficacy and tolerability of darolutamide plus ADT in patients with mHSPC, demonstrating clinically and statistically significant improvement in rPFS and a favorable safety profile consistent with prior phase III darolutamide trials.

The objective of the study is to assess dietary diversity and associated risk factors among children, focusing on complex interplay of socio-economic and demographic factors. Methods The study utilized nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) conducted in 2019-2021, focusing on a sample of 62,553 children aged 6-24 months. Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) was assessed using children received foods from >= 5 food group out of eight specified food groups over the 24 h preceding the survey. Logistic regression employed to examine the association between DD and its predictors (p value < 0.05). Results Overall, 52% of the children were male, while the remaining 48% were female. Only 23.3% of the children across India achieved MDD. Mother's education was positively associated with dietary diversity (OR:1.15; 95% CI:0.92-1.4). Factors significantly associated with dietary diversity were children aged 19-23 months (OR:4.03; CI:3.46-4.69), working mothers (OR:1.30; 95% CI:1.14-1.5) and children belonged to middle (OR:1.22; CI:1.05-1.43) and rich socio-economic status (OR:1.48; CI:1.26-1.8) as compared to their counterparts. Additionally, no difference found in dietary diversity among male and female children (OR:1.01; CI:0.9-1.11) and urban and rural areas (OR:101; CI:0.87-1.17). Those children belonged to Northeast region had around 70% higher dietary diversity as compared to Central region. Conclusion This study highlights a concerning low prevalence of dietary diversity among young children in India. Interventions and policies should target on implementing comprehensive nutrition education programs for caregivers, coupled with targeted financial support and community engagement.

AB  - Thyroid cancer (TC) being the common endocrine malignancy is glooming steadily due to its poor prognosis. The treatment strategies of surgery, radiotherapy, and conventional chemotherapy are providing unsatisfactory output. However, combination therapy can negotiate the worse prognosis to the better, where chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy with surgery, or dual chemotherapeutic drugs are being glorified. Chemotherapy includes the use of doxorubicin or taxanes generally with platinum-based drugs viz. cisplatin or carboplatin that are administered alone or along with multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors viz. Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Vandetanib, Pyrazolo-pyrimidine compounds, etc., single target tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Dabrafenib plus Trametinib and Vemurafenib against BRAF, Gefitinib against EGFR, Everolimus against mTOR, vascular disruptors like Fosbretabulin, and immunotherapy with viz. Spartalizumab and Pembrolizumab, are anti-PD-1/PD-L1 molecules. Hence, several trials are currently evaluating the possible beneficial role of combinatorial therapy in TC. Since TC is the outcome of multiple genetic alterations, it necessitates targeting the multiple factors in a single shot. These combination strategies for systemically delivering therapeutic drugs seem feasible only with the help of theranostic. To date, nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) have devoted themselves to diagnosis, bioimaging, imaging-assisted surgery, and therapy with high success rates. The ease of handling hybrid technologies is also selectively admirable. However, in this review, we have summarized the sequential progression of chemotherapeutic drugs to NDDS designed for Personalized Medicine (PM) against TC. Personalized medicine is an ever-growing field that will be explored in future discoveries in biomedicine, particularly cancer theranostics. Hence, our review presents a closer view of NDDS as a personalized treatment for TC. We have also discussed the primary challenges facing NDDS in meeting excellence in PM.

AB  - BackgroundThe objective of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of care among women diagnosed with vulvar malignancy at a tertiary care teaching institute. Additionally, the study aimed to analyse the implications of revised FIGO staging system on stage shift and patient outcomes.MethodsA retrospective observational study was conducted, wherein hospital records of biopsy-proven cases of vulvar cancers managed over a period of 10 years were comprehensively reviewed. The assignment of FIGO staging was performed utilizing both 2009 and 2021 FIGO staging systems for comparative analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 17. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with differences assessed using the log-rank test. Additionally, multivariable analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard model.ResultsA total of 82 cases meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Management patterns varied widely, with the majority undergoing surgery (73.2%), followed by definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (10.9%), neoadjuvant radiotherapy and subsequent surgery (4.9%), and palliative care (10.9%). Post-operative radiotherapy was administered in 31.7% of cases. The disease-specific recurrence rate was found to be 32.9%, and the mortality rate was 30.5%. The median Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was 17 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-36 months), while the Overall Survival (OS) was 27 months (IQR: 9-52 months). Upon application of the 2021 staging system, a stage shift was observed in 18% of cases of advanced vulvar cancer. The 3-year DFS and OS were reduced for stage IIIA and stage IVA, while showing improvement for stage IIIB.ConclusionsThe revised FIGO 2021 staging system offers enhanced simplicity in its application within clinical practice and demonstrates improved correlation with prognosis. Approximately 18% cases experienced restaging under the updated system.Trial registration numberNot applicable.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Working memory (WM) impairment is a common and progressive abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD), which ultimately leads to dementia. Individuals with PD exhibit altered electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns while engaging in tasks that require WM. The study examined the EEG patterns associated with WM maintenance in PD patients. Methods:The study consisted of two groups of PD patients with a sign of dementia (PDD) who had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score <= 24, PD patients with no sign of dementia (PDND) with an MMSE score >24, and a group of healthy individuals serving as controls (CON). We obtained EEG during a word memorization task using a 128-channel system. The spectral power of the EEG was computed using the fast Fourier transformation algorithm. Results:Compared to both PDND and CON groups, PDD group exhibited higher power in the delta and beta frequency bands. Conversely, there was a notable decrease in power in the gamma band in both the PDD and PDND groups compared to the CON group. In addition, the PDD group exhibited higher power in the gamma band compared to the PDND group. Power in the alpha (LA1, LA2, and UA) and theta bands was greater in PDND and PDD compared to CON, but was similar between PDND and PDD groups. Conclusion:While performing WM tasks, PDD exhibits increased delta and beta power. These findings can be used as a quantitative biomarker to evaluate the severity of initial WM impairments, which could potentially develop into dementia in the future.

AB  - A substantial share of patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) fail to achieve control of CVD risk factors, but clinicians lack a structured approach to identify these patients. We applied machine learning to longitudinal data from two completed randomized controlled trials among 1502 individuals with diabetes in urban India and Pakistan. Using commonly available clinical data, we predict each individual's risk of failing to achieve CVD risk factor control goals or meaningful improvements in risk factors at one year after baseline. When classifying those in the top quartile of predicted risk scores as at risk of failing to achieve goals or meaningful improvements, the precision for not achieving goals was 73% for HbA1c, 30% for SBP, and 24% for LDL, and for not achieving meaningful improvements 88% for HbA1c, 87% for SBP, and 85% for LDL. Such models could be integrated into routine care and enable efficient and targeted delivery of health resources in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - Background India witnessed three COVID-19 pandemic waves, each with various degrees of severity and clinical signs. The coronavirus strain and immunization status have a significant impact on the severity of COVID-19 infections. The current study intends to evaluate and compare the symptoms, severity, and breakthrough infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals over the three waves of the pandemic.Methods This was a retrospective survey study. A Google based questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection status, re-infections, associated symptoms, severity, and vaccination status over three waves, post-COVID-19 sequelae, and willingness to receive a COVID-19 booster dose in the Indian population. The replies of 3,404 Indian participants were analysed using STATA 11.Results Each wave showed a decrease in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. However, fever and loss of smell/taste were identified as the most common symptoms in each wave. Clinical symptoms such as fever, weariness, and shortness of breath were shown to be considerably higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals. The number of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections increased between the second and third waves. Approximately 36.5% of people with protracted COVID-19 had previously received immunization after recovering from a natural COVID-19 illness. Overall, 34.8% of individuals were hesitant to take the COVID-19 booster dose.Conclusion Increased symptoms in vaccinated individuals during the second wave, emphasizing the potential role of antibody-dependent augmentation. A considerable fraction (36.5%) of those with protracted COVID-19 infections had previously received vaccination after contracting the virus naturally. The fact that vaccine received after COVID-19 infection has been shown to be a risk factor for long-term COVID-19 emphasizes the need for vigilance in this specific subgroup.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive disorder caused due to the persistence of mutant measles virus in the brain. Treatment strategies for SSPE remain largely undefined, and there exists no information on how neurologists are currently managing SSPE. Methods: A survey-based study was conducted among Indian neurologists managing pediatric and adult patients with SSPE. A questionnaire-based survey was circulated by email regarding respondent demographics, preference for disease-modifying strategies, and symptomatic therapy. Results: Survey response was obtained from 298 neurologists (responder rate 9.5%) and eventually analyzed from 266 respondents who managed SSPE in routine practice. This included 222 (83.5%) adult and 44 (16.5%) pediatric neurologists from 21 states of India. Ninety-five respondents (35.7%) indicated that they always advised Isoprinosine (inosine pranobex) to their patients. Regarding interferon therapy, 121 (45.5%) reported never advising it, whereas 56 (21.1%) always advised it. For myoclonus, the most frequently used first-line drug was valproate (181, 68%), followed by levetiracetam (58, 21.8%). Most (150, 56.4%) of the respondents favored personalized therapy for the individual patient in terms of the duration of disease-modifying treatment. The patient follow-up was reported to be poor, with most (171, 64.3%) of the patients following up only occasionally and 24 (9%) respondents indicating that patients are lost to follow-up promptly after the initial visit. Conclusions: While SSPE remains a vaccine-preventable illness and the focus should be on prevention through vaccination, there is an unmet urgent need among Indian neurologists for better-defined treatment strategies for patients with SSPE.

AB  - The female reproductive system dysfunction considerably affects the overall health of women and children on a global scale. Over the decade, the incidence of reproductive disorders has become a significant source of suffering for women. Infertility in women may be caused by a range of acquired and congenital abnormalities. Ovaries play a central role in the female reproductive function. Any defect in the normal functioning of these endocrine organs causes health issues and reproductive challenges extending beyond infertility, as the hormones interact with other tissues and biological processes in the body. The complex pathophysiology of ovarian disorders makes it a multifactorial disease. The key etiological factors associated with the diseases include genetic factors, hormonal imbalance, environmental and lifestyle factors, inflammatory conditions, oxidative stress, autoimmune diseases, metabolic factors, and age. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to disease development and progression affecting the oocyte quality, fertilization, embryo development, and implantation. The choice of treatment for ovarian disorders varies among individuals and has associated complications. Reproductive tissue engineering holds great promise for overcoming the challenges associated with the current therapeutic approach to tissue regeneration. Furthermore, incorporating nanotechnology into tissue engineering could offer an efficient treatment strategy. This review provides an overview of incorporating antioxidant nanomaterials for engineering ovarian tissue to address the disease recurrence and associated pathophysiology. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) are prioritized for evaluation primarily due to their antioxidant properties. In conclusion, the review explores the potential applications of CeO2 NPs for effective and clinically significant ovarian tissue regeneration.

AB  - Background Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a cancer-associated immune checkpoint protein implicated in tumor-driven immune escape mechanisms. This study was undertaken to determine genetic variations at the 3'-UTR of the HLA-G gene that may alter its expression, identify risk alleles and genotypes for their association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and treatment responses in the Indian population.Objectives Case-control genetic association study of HLA-G gene UTR polymorphisms with HCC and response to locoregional therapy (LRT).Methods HCC cases (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 110) were recruited for the genetic association study, of which 88 patients received LRT. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the HLA-G 3'-UTR gene were genotyped by sequencing and PCR-RFLP. The genetic association of 14 SNPs with HCC and LRT responses was determined using population genetic approaches.Results Three of the 14 SNPs (rs1707, rs1710, and rs1063320) were found to be genetically associated with HCC risk and treatment responses. These three UTR SNPs are important for miRNA binding. We did not observe significant association of the most studied SNP, rs371194629 (INDEL, +2960), with HCC or treatment response. Serum sHLA-G levels were found to be significantly (p = 0.027) higher in HCC patients as compared to healthy controls. Highly prevalent UTR haplotypes in Indian HCC patients were UTR-4, -1, and -7 whereas in healthy controls it was UTR-3, and 15 as determined by a linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot using 8 SNPs.Conclusion HLA-G SNPs are genetically associated with HCC and treatment response. Haplotypes associated with high levels of HLA-G expression are more prevalent in HCC than in healthy controls.Core tip Population genetic approaches were used to study HLA-G gene polymorphisms in the Indian population for its genetic association with HCC risk, treatment response and altered gene expression. Out of the 14 SNPs studied for HLA-G UTR, three were linked to HCC and response to locoregional therapy. Linkage disequilibrium and UTR haplotyping analysis show that the UTR-4 haplotype linked to high HLA-G levels, is more common in HCC patients, while the UTR-3 haplotype, linked to low HLA-G levels, is more common in healthy controls. This study is the first to look at the UTR types based on HLA-G gene polymorphisms of Indian HCC patients and their response to therapy.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy has been proven to be a fast, convenient, and nondestructive technique for advancing our understanding of biological systems. The Raman effect originates from the inelastic scattering of light which directly probe vibration/rotational states in biological molecules and materials. Despite numerous advantages over infrared spectroscopy and continuous technical as well as operational improvement in Raman spectroscopy, an advanced development of the device and more applications have become possible. In this review, we explore the principles, techniques, and myriad applications of Raman spectroscopy in the realm of biology. We begin by providing an overview of Raman spectroscopy, highlighting its significance in unraveling the complexities of biological research. The focus of this review is on Raman spectroscopy concepts and methods, clarifying the fundamentals of Raman scattering and spectral interpretation. The review also highlights the key experimental considerations for productive biological applications. We explore the broad range of Raman applications including molecular structure, biomolecular composition, disease detection, and medication discovery. The Raman imaging and mapping can also be used to visualize biological samples at the molecular level. Raman spectroscopy is still developing, giving fresh insights and remedies, from biosensing to its use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This review sheds light on the past, present, and future of Raman spectroscopy; it also highlights promising directions of future research developments and serves as a thorough resource for all researchers.

AB  - BackgroundHealthcare-associated bloodstream infections (BSI) threaten patient safety and are the third most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI) in low- and middle-income countries. An intensive-care-unit (ICU) based HAI surveillance network recording BSIs was started in India in 2017. We evaluated this surveillance network's ability to detect BSI to identify best practices, challenges, and opportunities in its implementation.MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods descriptive study from January to May 2022 using the CDC guidelines for evaluation. We focused on hospitals reporting BSI surveillance data to the HAI network from May 2017 to December 2021, and collected data through interviews, surveys, record reviews, and site visits. We integrated quantitative and qualitative results and present mixed methods interpretation.ResultsThe HAI surveillance network included 39 hospitals across 22 states of India. We conducted 13 interviews, four site visits, and one focus-group discussion and collected 50 survey responses. Respondents included network coordinators, surveillance staff, data entry operators, and ICU physicians. Among surveyed staff, 83% rated the case definitions simple to use. Case definitions were correctly applied in 280/284 (98%) case reports. Among 21 site records reviewed, 24% reported using paper-based forms for laboratory reporting. Interviewees reported challenges, including funding, limited human resources, lack of digitalization, variable blood culture practices, and inconsistent information sharing.ConclusionImplementing a standardized HAI surveillance network reporting BSIs in India has been successful, and the case definitions developed were simple. Allocating personnel, digitalizing medical records, improving culturing practices, establishing feedback mechanisms, and funding commitment are crucial for its sustainability.

AB  - Oxidative and nitrosative stress play pivotal roles in normal physiological processes and the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Previous studies from our lab demonstrated insulin resistance (IR), and dyslipidemia in iNOS-/-mice, emphasizing the importance of maintaining optimal redox balance. These mice exhibited altered gut microbiota with decreased Lactobacillus . Therefore, we hypothesized that Lactobacillus supplementation could mitigate metabolic disturbances in iNOS-/-mice. To test this hypothesis, iNOS-/-mice and wild-type (WT) mice were divided into four groups: iNOS-/-with or without Lactobacillus supplementation, WT with or without Lactobacillus supplementation and glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis, lipids, gene expression related to glucose and lipid metabolism (qPCR), fecal gut microbiota (16S rRNA sequencing), and serum and caecum metabolomics (LC-MS) were monitored. IR and dyslipidemic iNOS-/-mice exhibited reduced microbial diversity, diminished presence of Lactobacillus , and altered serum metabolites, indicating metabolic dysregulation. Lactobacillus supplementation in iNOS-/-mice effectively reversed glucose intolerance, IR, dyslipidemia, and associated metabolic irregularities compared to WT. These improvements correlated with changes in gene expression related to fatty acid synthesis in liver and adipose tissue, lipid oxidation in liver, and lipid efflux in intestinal tissue as compared to untreated iNOS-/-mice. Despite the positive effects on metabolic markers, Lactobacillus supplementation did not reduce body weight or rectify disrupted energy balance, as evidenced by reduced VCO2 production, heat generation, and metabolic rates in iNOS-/- mice. The results suggest that Lactobacillus supplementation ameliorates metabolic disturbances but did not fully restore disrupted energy balance, highlighting complex interactions between the gut microbiome and metabolism.

AB  - Background: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is an accepted and approved brain stimulation technique to treat patients with treatment-resistant depression. Aim: Using neuroimaging, this open-label study aimed to predict the response by observing glucose metabolism with the help of 18-FDG PET scan. Methods: A total of 25 treatment-resistant depression patients received 15 sessions of iTBS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Two FDG-PET scans were done for all the patients. Fifty-six percent of patients responded to treatment with iTBS. Results: We found that there was hypometabolism in left and right prefrontal lateral regions, left and right inferior parietal regions, and left prefrontal medial regions at baseline but no statistically significant difference in the metabolism between responders and nonresponders. Conclusion: We did not find any statistically significant difference in the metabolism between responders and nonresponders in any brain regions at T0 as well as T1. Further large-scale studies are required.

AB  - Diagnosing pediatric rheumatic diseases can be challenging, as they often mimic common conditions such as infections and, less commonly, malignancies. Characteristic pattern recognition, guided by a detailed history and clinical examination, often helps in making the correct diagnosis. A delay in diagnosing these disorders can lead to disease-related damage, such as joint disabilities in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and life-threatening organ involvement in conditions like childhood vasculitis and lupus. Easily accessible laboratory investigations can guide towards the underlying diagnosis. In the current era, early diagnosis helps achieve favorable outcomes with the use of effective therapeutic options. This article aims to highlight important clinical and laboratory features that would assist the primary care pediatricians in the early diagnosis of rheumatic disorders.

AB  - Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but preventable cause of acute hepatic dysfunction which is associated with significant mortality, unless treated appropriately. There are significant regional variations in the etiologies of ALF globally and this determines the outcomes of the disease as well as the long-term survival in patients receiving liver transplantation for management. Improvements in understanding of disease pathophysiology and critical care medicine have led to better outcomes over the last few decades. Despite this, the burden of indeterminate ALF and the pathogenesis of many etiological agents are yet to be fully known. Improvements in diagnostic and prognostic modalities are expected to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with ALF. Changes in vaccination programs and stronger legislative practices regarding over-the-counter sale of acetaminophen and non-proprietary drugs are expected to reduce the burden of disease globally.

AB  - Background: Optimal anticoagulation management in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) experiencing splanchnic vein thrombosis (SpVT) requires balancing risks of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the incidence of bleeding and thrombosis recurrence in patients with MPN-SpVT. Methods: We included retrospective or prospective studies in English with >= 10 adult patients with MPN-SpVT. Outcomes included recurrent venous thrombosis (SpVT and non-SpVT), arterial thrombosis, and major bleeding. Pooled rates per 100 patient years with 95% CIs were calculated by DerSimonian-Laird method using random-effects model. Results: Out of 4624 studies screened, 9 studies with a total of 443 patients were included in the meta-analysis with median follow-up of 3.5 years. In the 364 patients with MPN-SpVT treated with anticoagulation, pooled event rate for major bleeding was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.5-5.1; I2 = 95%), for recurrent venous thrombosis was 1.4 (95% CI, 0.8-2.2; I2 = 72%), and for arterial thrombosis was 1.4 (95% CI, 0.6-3.3; I2 = 92%) per 100 patient years. Among 79 patients (n = 4 studies) who did not receive anticoagulation, pooled event rate for major bleeding was 3.2 (95% CI, 0.7-12.7; I2 = 97%), for recurrent venous thrombosis 3.5 (95% CI, 1.8-6.4; I2 = 88%), and for arterial thrombosis rate 1.6 (95% CI, 0.4-6.6; I2 = 95%) per 100 patient years. Conclusion: Patients with MPN-SpVT treated with anticoagulation have significant risks for both major bleeding and thrombosis recurrence. Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal anticoagulation approach in patients with MPN-SpVT.

AB  - Purpose Sarcopenic obesity, characterized by increased adiposity with low skeletal muscle mass, contributes to frailty and the development of chronic disease. Data on sarcopenic obesity in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) is limited. Methodology A cross-sectional study on 65 cALL survivors (7-18 years, > 2 years from treatment completion) was conducted on cALL survivors with the primary outcome to determine the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as patients with a positive Fat Mass Index (FMI) z-score with a negative Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) z-score, measured using a Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan. In addition, we assessed the factors associated with sarcopenic obesity by multivariable regression analysis. Results The mean (+/- SD) age was 12.9 (+/- 3.2) years, the median (Interquartile Range) time since diagnosis was 6.5 (5.9;8) years, and 66% received cranial radiotherapy. Central obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome were seen in 21.5%, 23.1%, and 21% respectively. DXA-derived body composition variables revealed higher fat percentage despite normal body mass index (BMI) and lower muscle mass compared to the general population. Sarcopenic obesity was seen in 21 (34%) of survivors. On multivariable regression analysis, age at diagnosis (OR: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.98), p = 0.02), central obesity (OR: 18.99 (95% 2.32-155.5), p = 0.006) and insulin resistance (OR: 10.2 (95% CI: 1.75-59.09), p = 0.01) were associated with sarcopenic obesity. Conclusions Sarcopenic obesity, an early clinical indicator for metabolic disease despite normal BMI, was significantly worse in children diagnosed with ALL at a younger age and was associated with central obesity and insulin resistance, which may contribute to adverse outcomes later in life.

AB  - PurposeTelemedicine use in healthcare is rising. However, infrastructural barriers may impede implementation in lower- and middle-income country settings. Patient perspectives regarding teleconsultation need to be explored. This study assesses the feasibility of teleconsultation among patients with cancer, patient satisfaction with its use, determinants of satisfaction, and its economic benefits.MethodsA cross-sectional telephonic interview-based study was conducted between February and September 2021 in a tertiary care cancer center in India. Adult patients with cancer or their caregivers who had availed of teleconsultation during the 6 months preceding the interview date were included. Teleconsultation was administered through email and telephone conversation. The research team developed an interview guide to elicit demographic details, satisfaction with teleconsultation, and the underlying reasons. Cost savings through teleconsultation were also recorded. Factors predicting subject satisfaction were identified by multivariable logistic regression.ResultsDuring the study period, 195 subjects, including 84 patients (43.1%) and 111 caregivers (56.9%), were interviewed. The median patient age at diagnosis was 31 years. In our study, 147 (75.4%) patients/caregivers reported satisfaction with teleconsultations. The benefits cited included better access and follow-up (n = 173, 88.7%) and saving time and money (n = 164, 84.1%). In multivariable analysis, a higher patient age (more than 30 years) was the only factor predictive of less satisfaction with teleconsultation. The median cost savings were not a predictor of satisfaction.ConclusionTeleconsultation is feasible and acceptable to most patients availing treatment in a tertiary oncology care setting in India. Patient and physician training for better communication may further improve the utility of this modality.

AB  - BACKGROUND:A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare phenylephrine boluses versus prophylactic infusion in parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia on feto-maternal outcomes.METHODS:Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and US Clinical registry databases were searched. Studies comparing phenylephrine boluses (both therapeutic and prophylactic) with infusion (both fixed- and variable-rate) assessing various feto-maternal outcomes were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of maternal hypotension. Secondary maternal outcomes included the incidence of reactive hypertension, bradycardia, nausea, or vomiting; secondary neonatal outcomes included umbilical arterial pH, partial pressure of oxygen (paO2), umbilical venous pH, fetal acidosis, Apgar Scores at 1 and 5 minutes. All outcomes were quantitatively analyzed using the random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration R0B 2.0 tool.RESULTS:We included 15 studies with 2153 parturients. The parturients receiving phenylephrine bolus during cesarean delivery under spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia had a significant increase in the incidence of predelivery hypotension compared to phenylephrine infusion (risk ratio [RR], 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-3.18). Reactive hypertension (RR, 0.48, 95% CI, 0.29-0.79) and bradycardia (RR, 0.57, 95% CI, 0.41-0.79) were less common in the parturients receiving phenylephrine bolus; whereas, vomiting (RR, 2.15, 95% CI, 1.53-3.03) was more common compared to the infusion group. No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of nausea or any fetal outcomes (umbilical artery pH, paO2, umbilical venous pH, fetal acidosis, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes) between either of the groups. Three studies had a high risk of bias.CONCLUSIONS:A prophylactic phenylephrine infusion significantly reduces the incidence of predelivery hypotension in parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia in comparison to the therapeutic or prophylactic phenylephrine bolus group. A prophylactic phenylephrine infusion may be considered in all parturients without preexisting hypertensive disorder or cardiovascular disorders to reduce the risk of predelivery hypotension. More evidence is needed to guide optimal hemodynamic management for patients with hypertensive or cardiovascular disorders.

AB  - Port site infection causes significant morbidity in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The umbilicus, the most common location for creating pneumoperitoneum, frequently harbours resident microflora, which can render a patient susceptible to subsequent port site infections. Umbilical hygiene and its role in preventing surgical site infections have not yet been studied. Our study aimed to bridge this gap by proposing a method for umbilical hygiene. Five hundred two patients planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised. In the intervention arm, the umbilicus was cleaned with 2-3 drops of coconut oil and patients were instructed to take a bath, with an emphasis on umbilicus cleaning. Patients in the control group were asked to bathe before surgery, without applying coconut oil. In both arms, the abdomen was painted using chlorhexidine, and a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done with the gall bladder being extracted through the epigastric port. Eight (or 1.5%) of the 480 patients had port site infections. Five of them had infections at the umbilical port site, of which four (p=0.200) belonged to the control group. Our study showed no statistically significant association between preoperative umbilical hygiene and port site infection. This might be due to the fact that patients in both arms bathed prior to the surgery and had their abdomen painted and deep cleaned with chlorhexidine. Hence, we would like to emphasise the significance of deep cleaning of the umbilicus with chlorhexidine during the painting of the abdomen. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed.

AB  - One of the key challenges in medical research is developing safe medications to treat neurodegenerative disorders. Increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are common features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT-1), part of the sirtuin family, plays a critical role in various physiological processes by binding to histones and nonhistone proteins. SIRT-1 primarily mitigates oxidative stress and regulates mitochondrial activity by maintaining the deacetylated form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), ensuring stable PGC-1 alpha levels. Research has shown reduced SIRT-1/PGC-1 alpha expression in AD and PD models. Targeting this pathway presents a promising therapeutic approach for managing AD and PD, potentially leading to disease-modifying treatments and improved outcomes. This review highlights the findings of various studies suggesting that the SIRT-1/PGC-1 alpha pathway promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, as well as exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, offering a potential method for AD and PD treatment.

AB  - BackgroundInflammatory bowel diseases are complex chronic disorders with a relapsing-remitting course that affect the gut due to dysregulated immune response. The incidence of these disorders is increasing globally along with an increase in the incidence in pediatric population. Very early onset inflammatory bowel diseases are seen in children with age less than 6 years, where monogenic causes predominate. With the advent of next-generation sequencing methods, these disorders are being diagnosed more. Interleukin-10 receptor mutation-associated inflammatory bowel diseases is one such monogenic disorder where immunosuppression shows poor response.MethodsWe report the case of an 8-month-old child of Indian origin who presented with severe enterocolitis and rectovaginal fistulas. She was evaluated on lines of a very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. She was found to have a mutation in the interleukin-10 receptor causing severe enterocolitis. She underwent a diversion colostomy. She was admitted at 25 months of age for the hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplant (HSCT). The conditioning regimen used consisted of busulfan, fludarabine, and anti-thymocyte-globulin (ATG). The child received a 10/10 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched from a matched-unrelated adult female donor with bone marrow stem cell product at a dose of 5.6 million CD34+ cells per kg.ResultsShe was treated successfully by a matched unrelated donor HSCT. At present, she is 2 years and 4 months posttransplant and is cured.ConclusionsEarly recognition and prompt genetic testing can help in diagnosing and establishing the cause of a very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease caused due to interleukin-10 receptor mutations can be cured by HSCT.

AB  - The objective of the study was to provide a comprehensive genomic landscape of Indian lung cancer patients. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of actionable alterations in lung adenocarcinoma and the novel discovery of frequent EGFR alterations in lung squamous carcinoma. Thus, this study underscores the potential for implementation of precision medicine and the need for novel therapeutic strategies tailored to Indian population. Background: The genomic landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the Indian patients remains under- explored. We revealed distinctive genomic alterations of Indian NSCLC patients, thereby providing vital molecular insights for implementation of precision therapies. Methods: We analyzed the genomic profiles of 325 lung adenocarcinoma and 81 lung squamous carcinoma samples from Indian patients using targeted sequencing of 50 cancer related genes. Correlations between genomic alterations and clinical characteristics were computed using statistical analyses. Additionally, we identified distinct features of Indian NSCLC genomes by comparison across different ethnicities. Results: Our genomic analysis revealed several noticeable features of Indian NSCLC patients. Alterations in EGFR (45.8%), TP53 (27.4%), ALK (11.4%) and KRAS (10.2%) were predominant in adenocarcinoma, with 68% eligible for targeted therapies. Squamous carcinoma exhibited prevalent alterations in TP53 (40.7%), PIK3CA (17.3%), and CDKN2A (8.6%). We observed higher frequency of EGFR alterations (18.5%) in lung squamous carcinoma patients, significantly distinct from other ethnicities reported till date. Beyond established correlations, we observed 60% of PD-L1 negative squamous patients harbored TP53 alterations, suggesting intriguing therapeutic implications. Conclusions: Our data revealed unique genomic variations of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma patients, with significant indications for precision medicine and clinical practice of lung cancers. The study emphasizes the importance of clinical utility of NGS for routine diagnostics.

AB  - Breast conserving therapy is now considered the preferred option for early invasive and in situ ductal (DCIS) breast carcinoma. In an attempt to decrease positive margin and local recurrence, various methods for margin delineation have been described. Our team at AIIMS New Delhi have developed a new technique of injecting methylene blue at the sonographically determined margin of tumour to delineate the margin of excision for breast cancer. We perform this procedure after immobilization of tumour with a transparent Ioban/Opsite adhesive sheet applied over the breast. The injection of blue dye at sonographically determined margins facilitates the lumpectomy with free margins.

AB  - Background Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Binding Protein 3 (IGF2BP3) promotes cancer migration and invasion by binding to several coding and non-coding RNAs. Hypoxia stimulates tumor progression by upregulating Hypoxia Inducible Factors and downstream signaling. Quaking (QKI) gene, which is upregulated in hypoxia and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), induces circular RNAs. Therefore, the axis between IGF2BP3, QKI, circular RNAs and their respective host genes under hypoxia was studied. Methods and results Several IGF2BP3-bound circular RNAs were previously identified in HepG2. There were 13 circRNAs originating from 8 host genes bound to IGF2BP3. We confirmed their binding to IGF2BP3 in U87MG using an RNA Immunoprecipitation assay. MALAT1, an oncogenic lncRNA was also found to be associated with IGF2BP3. Three adherent cell lines expressing high levels of IGF2BP3 viz., HeLa, HepG2 and U87MG were cultured under normoxia (20%O2) and hypoxia (<0.2%O2) for 48-168 h. Expression of IGF2BP3, QKI, EMT markers, IGF2BP3-bound circRNAs and their host mRNAs expression were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in both normoxia and hypoxia. The hypoxia markers viz., VEGF and CA9 were upregulated in all the cell lines in hypoxia at all time points along with an increase in SNAIL. We found 6 genes, viz., PHC3, CDYL, ANKRD17, ARID1A, NEIL3 and FNDC3B with increased expression both at the mRNA and circRNA level indicating their synergistic role in tumor initiation. Overall, we found that circRNA to mRNA expression was observed to be increased for most of the genes and time points of hypoxia in all the cell lines. IGF2BP3 and QKI were also upregulated in hypoxia indicating their role in circRNA biogenesis and stability. Conclusion Our data implies that hypoxia augments circRNA biogenesis which might subsequently play a role in tumor progression.

AB  - Corneal perforations are potentially sight-threatening conditions if not promptly treated. Management depends on the size, location, cause, and severity of the perforation. Various methods, including tissue adhesives, amniotic membrane grafting (AMG), and keratoplasty, are available. However, the limited availability of donor tissue in emergencies poses a significant challenge. Recently, Tenon's patch grafting (TPG) has emerged as a promising treatment option due to its autologous nature, availability, and lack of immunogenicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various aspects of TPG, along with relevant images. A literature search using keywords such as "Tenon's patch graft," "Tenon's capsule," "corneal patch graft," "amniotic membrane," and "corneal perforations" yielded 37 articles, included in this review. TPG is suitable for cases involving corneal tissue degradation leading to perforation, impending perforation, or descemetocele, with lesion sizes ranging from 2 to 6 mm. For larger perforations, the procedure may be modified by combining it with AMG or tissue adhesives. Postoperatively, the graft undergoes characteristic changes, including epithelialization and collagen deposition, resulting in the formation of a thick scar. Complications such as delayed epithelialization, wound leaks, and graft dehiscence can occur. High success rates have been reported, ranging from 74% to 87%. However, TPG may result in suboptimal visual outcomes, particularly when the graft is centrally located, necessitating future keratoplasty for visual rehabilitation. Overall, TPG is a safe and cost-effective technique for restoring structural integrity in corneal thinning disorders and perforations, especially in emergency settings when donor tissue is unavailable.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic kidney disease of undetermined aetiology (CKDu) is an important public health problem. Indian data are mostly based on studies from rural regions in south and east India. We examined the burden and profile of CKDu in patients attending a tertiary care hospital in north India. Methods: We assessed records of consecutive new CKD patients registered in a nephrology clinic from January 2015 to June 2022. Patients were classified as having CKDu based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation and kidney biopsy when done were noted. Results: Records of 32,369 patients with CKD were screened, and 29,663 were included (2,706 excluded due to inadequate data). A total of 370 (1.2%) patients were categorized as CKDu. Mean age was 41 +/- 14.7 years, 58.1% being male. Of them, 158 (42.7%) patients were in CKD stage 3, 89 (24.1%) in stage 4, 84 (22.7%) in stage 5, and 39 (10.5%) were dialysis dependent at presentation; 232 (62.7%) patients had proteinuria <0.5 gm/day and 138 (37.3%) between 0.5 and 1 gm/day. Renal histology was available for 65 CKDu patients: 62 had chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) and 3 had non-specific changes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION:Life-long adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) and its assessment is essential for patients with celiac disease (CeD). We have developed and validated a tool for assessing adherence to GFD which can be used by both physicians and dietitians. METHODS:Phase 1: Development, content validation, and assessment of reliability of tool. Phase 2: Validation of tool against standard dietary evaluation (SDE) (gold standard), immunoglobulin A - anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG Ab), and gluten immunogenic peptides in urine. Overall, 380 biopsy-confirmed patients with CeD (derivation cohort: n = 100 [phase 1], n = 210 [phase 2] and independent validation cohort, n = 70) were recruited. RESULTS:Of an initial 90-point questionnaire, 84 items (Celiac Disease: Compliance Assessment Test [CD-CAT.v1]) were retained after content validation and pilot testing. In phase 1, upon administering CD-CAT.v1 on 100 patients, a comprehensive 35-item tool (CD-CAT.v2; alpha = 0.86) was obtained after removing items with low test-retest reliability and item-rest correlation values. In phase 2, upon administering CD-CAT.v2 on 210 patients, 22 items were removed having low correlation values (R < 0.4) with SDE. Finally, a 13-item tool (CD-CAT.v3; alpha = 0.84) was obtained with high criterion validity with SDE (r = 0.806, P < 0.001), moderate convergent validity with celiac disease adherence test (r = 0.602, P = 0.007), and moderate to weak correlation with urine gluten immunogenic peptides (r = 0.46, P = 0.001) and IgA anti-tTG Ab (r = 0.39, P = 0.008), respectively. The final 13-item tool also strongly correlated with SDE (r = 0.78, P < 0.001) in an independent validation cohort of 70 patients with CeD. Principal component analysis identified 3 relevant subscales with a cumulative variance of 62%. The sensitivity and specificity of CD-CAT.v3 were 80% and 91%, respectively, with an area under curve of 0.905 with SDE. The obtained cutoff score of <19 from the receiver operating characteristic curve was further categorized as 13 = excellent, 14-18 = very good, 19-28 = average, and >28 = poor adherence to GFD. DISCUSSION:CD-CAT is a new and rapid tool for monitoring dietary adherence to GFD with high sensitivity and specificity, which can be administered by both physicians and dietitians.

AB  - Background: The purpose of the present systematic review and meta-analyses was to appraise the case-control studies that have evaluated late adverse effects of chemotherapy for treating hematological malignancies in pediatric patients. Methods: Five electronic databases along with grey literature were searched using broad keywords and MeSH terms for the articles that could meet the eligibility criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was employed for quality assessment. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model using the (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) REML approach was used for meta-analyses to calculate the pooled Odds Ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes and Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes. The GRADE approach was used to synthesize the certainty of evidence utilizing GRADEpro (R) GDT software. Results: 8,052 records were obtained from the searches. After duplicate removal and initial screening of titles and abstracts, 109 articles were subjected to full-text reading but only 5 could be included. The pooled ORs of having root malformation, microdontia, tooth agenesis, taurodontism, and enamel defects in patients who have undergone treatment were 7.68, 5.39, 3.74, 2.00, and 1.84 compared to controls, respectively. The SMD for dental caries was also significant among the groups (p= 0.03) and indicated an SMD of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.51) indicating higher pooled mean DMFT in the cases than controls. Conclusions: Root malformations are associated with treatment for childhood hematological cancers with a moderate certainty of assessment. Tooth agenesis and microdontia are associated with low certainty of evidence, while taurodontism, enamel defects, and caries were associated with very low certainty of evidence. Future studies on larger sample sizes are needed to validate the findings as the number of studies included in our review was small.

AB  - Clinical biomarkers such as fasting glucose, HbA1c, and fasting insulin, which gauge glycemic status in the body, are highly influenced by diet. Indians are genetically predisposed to type 2 diabetes and their carbohydrate-centric diet further elevates the disease risk. Despite the combined influence of genetic and environmental risk factors, Indians have been inadequately explored in the studies of glycemic traits. Addressing this gap, we investigate the genetic architecture of glycemic traits at genome-wide level in 4927 Indians (without diabetes). Our analysis revealed numerous variants of sub-genome-wide significance, and their credibility was thoroughly assessed by integrating data from various levels. This identified key effector genes, ZNF470, DPP6, GXYLT2, PITPNM3, BEND7, and LORICRIN-PGLYRP3. While these genes were weakly linked with carbohydrate intake or glycemia earlier in other populations, our findings demonstrated a much stronger association in the Indian population. Associated genetic variants within these genes served as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in various gut tissues essential for digestion. Additionally, majority of these gut eQTLs functioned as methylation quantitative trait loci (meth-QTLs) observed in peripheral blood samples from 223 Indians, elucidating the underlying mechanism of their regulation of target gene expression. Specific co-localized eQTLs-meth-QTLs altered the binding affinity of transcription factors targeting crucial genes involved in glucose metabolism. Our study identifies previously unreported genetic variants that strongly influence the diet-glycemia relationship. These findings set the stage for future research into personalized lifestyle interventions integrating genetic insights with tailored dietary strategies to mitigate disease risk based on individual genetic profiles.

KW  - Asthma
KW  - MDOT
KW  - Metered dose inhaler
AB  - Objectives We aimed to assess the acceptability of Mobile Direct Observed Therapy (MDOT) amongst the parents/caregivers of children with asthma. Methods This open-label pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled newly diagnosed children aged 5-15 years with asthma, who were followed up telephonically for six weeks. Parents of children in the intervention arm were requested to record a video of the metered dose inhaler with spacer (MDI-S) technique of their child on a mobile phone and share it through WhatsApp with investigator who then provided corrective measures as required by a text/video message. The children in the control arm continued follow-up telephonically without exchange of any videos for six weeks. The primary outcome measures were the acceptability of MDOT and the effect of such interaction on the correctness of the MDI-S technique. Secondary outcome measures were the level of asthma control as per GINA guidelines and the caregivers' perception and feedback about MDOT. Result A total of 30 children were enrolled, 15 in each arm. Thirteen (86%) parents uploaded good-quality videos. The average number of incorrect steps decreased from 2.64 in the first video to 0.18 after the fourth video and nil after the fifth video in the MDOT group. At six weeks of follow-up, the average number of incorrect steps was significantly lower in the MDOT group compared to the control group (0 vs 2.9; P < 0.001). The proportion of children having controlled asthma was better in the MDOT group compared to controls (85% vs 70%) (P = 0.39). All parents liked MDOT. Conclusions MDOT was well accepted by caregivers of children with asthma and was helpful in improving the MDI-S technique.

AB  - Introduction Pelvi-Ureteric Junction Obstruction (PUJO) is a common cause of hydronephrosis (HDN) in children. While ultrasonography (USG) is useful for initial assessment and grading of hydronephrosis, it cannot differentiate obstructive from non-obstructive cases. Renal Dynamic Scintigraphy (RDS) confirms the diagnosis but involves ionizing radiation exposure. Ureteric jets using colour Doppler USG have been proposed for diagnosing obstructive HDN. Objective Our study aimed to evaluate Ureteric Jet Frequency (UJF) and Relative Jet Frequency (RJF) in unilateral PUJO before and after furosemide (Lasix) administration, assessing their diagnostic and postoperative utility. Materials and methods Children (<14 years) with unilateral HDN underwent USG and RDS for PUJO diagnosis. Pyeloplasty was performed based on standard criteria. UJF and RJF were assessed before and after furosemide administration (0.5 mg/kg) by colour Doppler USG. The non-obstructed side was taken as the control. Follow-up included repeat RDS and ureteric jet assessment. Results Fifty-two cases were included. UJF (pre- and postLasix) was significantly lower in the obstructed side compared to the non-obstructed side at baseline and post-pyeloplasty (p < 0.0001). However, the baseline UJF difference between cases and controls was not significant (p > 0.05). UJF and RJF (pre- and post-Lasix) increased postoperatively. The UJF difference decreased postoperatively (p < 0.05). (attached Table) Conclusion UJF and RJF are useful for diagnosing and monitoring unilateral PUJO. The effect of furosemide on UJF needs to be assessed using additional studies with larger sample sizes to understand if it can affect UJF in a way similar to that noted in diuretic scintigraphy.

AB  - BackgroundCOVID19 is a pandemic that has affected millions around the world since March 2020. While many patients recovered completely with mild illness, many patients succumbed to various organ morbidities. This heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of COVID19 infection has posed a challenge to clinicians around the world. It is therefore crucial to identify specific organ-related morbidity for effective treatment and better patient outcomes. We have carried out serum-based proteomic experiments to identify protein biomarkers that can flag organ dysfunctions in COVID19 patients.MethodsCOVID19 patients were screened and tested at various hospitals across New Delhi, India. 114 serum samples from these patients, with and without organ morbidities were collected and annotated based on clinical presentation and treatment history. Of these, 29 samples comprising of heart, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal, liver, and neurological morbidities were considered for the discovery phase of the experiment. Proteins were isolated, quantified, trypsin digested, and the peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography assisted tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Data analysis was carried out using Proteome Discoverer software. Fold change analysis was carried out on MetaboAnalyst. KEGG, Reactome, and Wiki Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins were carried out using the STRING database. Potential biomarker candidates for various organ morbidities were validated using ELISA.Results254 unique proteins were identified from all the samples with a subset of 12-31 differentially expressed proteins in each of the clinical phenotypes. These proteins establish complement and coagulation cascade pathways in the pathogenesis of the organ morbidities. Validation experiments along with their diagnostic parameters confirm Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine, Cystatin C, and Catalase as potential biomarker candidates that can flag cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and respiratory disease, respectively.ConclusionsLabel free serum proteomics shows differential protein expression in COVID19 patients with morbidity as compared to those without morbidity. Identified biomarker candidates hold promise to flag organ morbidities in COVID19 for efficient patient care.

AB  - With advances in genetic testing increasing proportion of early onset Parkinson disease (EOPD) are being identified to have an underlying genetic aetiology. This is can be in the form of either highly penetrant genes associated with phenotypes with monogenic or mendelian inheritance patterns or those genes known as risk factor genes which confer an increased risk of PD in an individual. Both of them can modify the phenotypic manifestation in a patient with PD. This improved knowledge has helped in deciphering the intricate role of various cellular pathways in the pathophysiology of PD including both early and late and even sporadic PD. However, the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity is a major challenge. Different deleterious alterations in a same gene can result in a spectrum of presentation spanning from juvenile to late onset and typical to atypical parkinsonism manifestation. Similarly, a single phenotype can occur due to abnormality in two or more different genes. This conundrum poses a dilemma in the clinical approach and in understanding the clinico-genetic correlation. Understanding the clinico-genetic correlation carries even more importance especially when genetic testing is either not accessible or affordable or in many regions both. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss briefly the approach to various PARK gene related EOPD and describe in detail the clinico-genetic correlation of individual type of PARK gene related genetic EOPD with respect to their classical clinical presentation, pathophysiology, investigation findings and treatment response to medication and surgery.

AB  - Despite many efforts, a comprehensive understanding and clarification of the intricate connections within cancer cell metabolism remain elusive. This might pertain to intracellular dynamics and the complex interplay between cancer cells, and cells with the tumor stroma. Almost a century ago, Otto Warburg found that cancer cells exhibit a glycolytic phenotype, which continues to be a subject of thorough investigation. Past and ongoing investigations have demonstrated intricate mechanisms by which tumors modulate their functionality by utilizing extracellular glucose as a substrate, thereby sustaining the essential proliferation of cancer cells. This concept of "aerobic glycolysis," where cancer cells (even in the presence of enough oxygen) metabolize glucose to produce lactate plays a critical role in cancer progression and is regulated by various signaling pathways. Recent research has revealed that the canonical wingless-related integrated site (WNT) pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis, directly and indirectly, thereby influencing cancer development and progression. The present review seeks to gather knowledge about how the WNT/beta-catenin pathway influences aerobic glycolysis, referring to relevant studies in different types of cancer. Furthermore, we propose the concept of impeding the glycolytic phenotype of tumors by employing specific inhibitors that target WNT/beta-catenin signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between the extent and severity of stress-induced ischemia and the extent and severity of anatomic coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with obstructive CAD is multifactorial and includes the intensity of stress achieved, type of testing used, presence and extent of prior infarction, collateral blood flow, plaque characteristics, microvascular disease, coronary vasomotor tone, and genetic factors. Among chronic coronary disease participants with site-determined moderate or severe ischemia, we investigated associations between ischemia severity on stress testing and the extent of CAD on coronary computed tomography angiography. METHODS: Clinically indicated stress testing included nuclear imaging, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or nonimaging exercise tolerance test. Among those with preserved renal function who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography, we examined relationships between ischemia and CAD by coronary computed tomography angiography, overall, and by stress test modality, regardless of subsequent randomization. Core laboratories categorized ischemia as severe, moderate, mild, or none, while the extent and severity of anatomic CAD were categorized based on the modified Duke prognostic index. RESULTS: Among 3601 participants with interpretable stress tests and coronary computed tomography angiography, ischemia severity was weakly associated with CAD extent/severity (r=0.27), with modest variability in strength of association by modality: nuclear (n=1532; r=0.40), echocardiography (n=827; r=0.15), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (n=108; r=0.31), and exercise tolerance test (n=1134; r=0.18). The extent of infarction on nuclear imaging and echocardiography was weakly associated with CAD extent/severity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ischemia severity on stress testing showed weak to moderate associations with the anatomic extent of CAD in this cohort with moderate or severe ischemia on local interpretation and controlled symptoms.

AB  - Purpose: Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in form of tumor necrosis predicts outcome in osteosarcoma; although response-adapted treatment escalation failed to improve outcome among patients treated with high- dose methotrexate-based (HDMTx) chemotherapy. This study aimed to identify factors predicting tumor necrosis and its impact on survival among patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma treated with a response- adapted non-HDMTx regimen. Methods: A retrospective single-institutional study was conducted among non-metastatic osteosarcoma patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy between 2004-2019. Patients were treated uniformly with three cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin/doxorubicin. Post-operatively, patients with favourable necrosis (>= 90 %) received 3 cycles of cisplatin/doxorubicin, while patients with poor necrosis (<90 %) received escalated treatment with alternating six cycles of cisplatin/doxorubicin and ifosfamide/etoposide. Propensity score matching (PSM) analyses were conducted to ascertain independent impact of necrosis on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 594 registered osteosarcoma patients, 280 patients (median age 17 years; male 67.1 %) were included for analysis. 73 patients (26.1 %) achieved favourable necrosis. Patients with smaller tumor size (<10 cm) (aOR = 2.28; p = 0.030), lower serum alkaline phosphatase (<450 IU/L) (aOR = 2.10; p = 0.035), and who had surgery earlier (<115 days) (aOR = 2.28; p = 0.016) were more likely to have favourable necrosis. On 1:2 PSM analysis, patients not achieving favourable necrosis demonstrated inferior EFS (HR = 2.68; p = 0.003) and OS (HR = 3.42; p = 0.003). Conclusions: Patients of osteosarcoma with smaller tumor, lower serum alkaline phosphatase and earlier surgery are more likely to achieve favourable necrosis. Tumor necrosis independently predicts outcome in osteosarcoma, and response-adapted treatment escalation fails to overcome the adverse impact of poor necrosis in non-HDMTx based regimen.

AB  - Breast conservation surgery is the standard of care for patients with early breast cancer. Although most surgeons perform oncoplasty for closure of defect, there is no randomised evidence for its favour as compared to simple closure of breast defect. We compared the cosmetic outcomes of patients treated by oncoplasty versus simple closure with 1-cm vs. 2-cm margin of excision. One hundred and four patients with breast cancer were randomised to four groups: excision with 1-cm margin with simple closure or excision with 2-cm margin with simple closure; excision with 1-cm margin and oncoplasty; and excision with 2-cm margin oncoplasty. Fifty-two patients underwent oncoplasty and 52 patients had simple closure of breast defect. There was no significant difference in the cosmetic outcomes in patients undergoing oncoplasty compared to simple closure. Excision with 2-cm margin compared to 1 cm did not worsen the cosmetic outcome. The margin positivity and re-excision rates were higher with 1-cm margin and oncoplastic closure group (p-value 0.018). There was no significant difference in complications between oncoplasty compared to simple closure, and 1-cm vs. 2-cm margin of excision. Simple closure demonstrated similar cosmesis as compared to oncoplasty.

AB  - Microvascular complications of diabetic retinopathy (DR) may require surgical intervention in the form of vitrectomy. Since its inception, diabetic vitrectomy has evolved with introduction of better instruments, newer techniques, and smaller port sizes. Common indications for diabetic vitrectomy include nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, progression of fibrovascular membranes despite laser therapy, recalcitrant diabetic macular edema, and neovascular glaucoma. Preoperative systemic stabilization is essential prior to planning surgery. Surgical techniques commonly used in diabetic vitrectomy are segmentation, delamination, and rarely en-bloc dissection. Modification in surgical techniques such as chandelier-assisted bimanual dissection and pharmacological adjuvants improve surgical outcomes in these patients. Prognosis in these patients could be improved with early intervention. Studies evaluating the outcome of vitrectomy in patients with early proliferative DR are required to understand the appropriate time of intervention in patients. Treatment aimed at arresting the progression of DR and gene therapy are avenues that need further evaluation. The following review will focus on covering the epidemiology of DR, indications of vitrectomy, preoperative considerations, surgical procedures of diabetic vitrectomy, methods of membrane dissection, pharmacological adjuvants to vitrectomy, outcomes of diabetic vitrectomy, and future directions of diabetic vitrectomy.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sudden halt in the academic activities of many medical professionals including burns and plastic surgery. Worldwide, this led to many societies switching over to various virtual platforms like Google Meet and Zoom for teaching and training. In India, as the other plastic surgery societies started their educational webinars, the National Academy of Burns India (NABI) also geared up for its web journey for imparting burn education to doctors and the general population. Methodology: Webinars were conducted in four series - acute burn care, post-burn reconstructions, video demonstrations of burn procedures, and research in burns. The first series included a specialist from an allied department. To reach the public and non-medical population, the burn tutorials for general awareness were live-streamed on social media, and the teaching was done in the form of a panel discussion between the speakers and moderators. Results: A total of 54 webinars including 29 for professionals and 25 for the public were conducted between October 2020 to December 2023 in four series. The participation of professionals on the virtual platform was comparable to a burns conference and an extremely encouraging response was received to the NABI tutorials conducted on social media for the public. Conclusion: NABI webinars showed that education in burns is possible on a virtual platform under special circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic and can be used as an adjunct to

AB  - Head and neck cancer (HNC) represents a challenging oncological entity with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Despite advances in conventional therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, the overall survival rates for advanced HNC remain suboptimal. In recent years, the emerging field of oncolytic virotherapy has gained attention as a promising therapeutic approach for various malignancies, including HNC. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of oncolytic viruses (Ovs) in the context of HNC treatment, including their mechanisms of action, preclinical and clinical studies, challenges, and future directions. Future oncolytic virotherapy focuses on improving delivery and specificity through nanoparticle carriers and genetic modifications to enhance tumor targeting and immune response. Combining different OVs and integrating them with immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, could overcome tumor resistance and improve outcomes. Personalized approaches and rigorous clinical trials are key to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of virotherapy in treating HNC.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess real-time intraoperative pachymetry changes occurring during corneal cross-linking (CXL) using microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography (Mi-OCT) and compare accuracy of various modalities of pachymetry assessment. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational comparative study including 45 consecutive patients with progressive keratoconus planned for CXL. Mi-OCT (RESCAN 700) was used to measure central corneal thickness (CCT) during four stages of CXL: before epithelial debridement, after debridement, after riboflavin instillation, and after ultraviolet irradiation. Scheimpflug imaging, anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT), and ultrasound pachymetry were used to assess CCT preoperatively. All data were entered into Excel software (Microsoft Corporation) and analyzed. RESULTS: The CCT significantly decreased after each step of CXL as measured on Mi-OCT (P < .0001). Mi-OCT overestimated the CCT significantly by 1.12 times on average (range: 1.02 to 1.43) compared to ultrasound pachymetry (P = .0004). CCT measured using Scheimpflug imaging and anterior segment OCT was statistically comparable to ultrasound pachymetry. CONCLUSIONS: Mi-OCT provides a real-time assessment of CCT during CXL. However, because it overestimates the pachymetry, ultrasound pachymetry remains the gold standard for decision-making during CXL.

AB  - Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the common biliary tract malignancies that is often associated with late presentation of clinical symptoms resulting in poor prognosis, thereby considerably increasing the mortality rate. Geographic and ethnic variations are one of the major causes of GBC incidence. However, in addition to genetic susceptibility to GBC, other factors like age, obesity, sex, and exposure to certain heavy chemicals may also lead to the incidence of GBC. Most of GBC research has so far used traditional cell culture systems. Recently, newer approaches using 2D and 3D cultures, xenograft models, and organoids are also becoming popular. However, whole organism model systems for GBC research have not yet been established. In this study, the authors propose the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study GBC. However, the zebrafish gallbladder is relatively unexplored besides the anatomical features. Here, the authors unravel and then compare the unique transcriptomic profile of zebrafish gallbladder with humans to identify genes consistently expressed in both species. The authors provide a comprehensive list of all gallbladder specific genes in zebrafish that also have their orthologous counterparts in humans. Therefore, they can be used as potential biomarkers for gallbladder transcriptomic profile. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study so far to provide a complete genomic expression profile of zebrafish gallbladder along with an exhaustive cross-species comparison, thus paving the path for using zebrafish as a model organism to study GBC and help identify novel biomarkers for its early detection and diagnosis.

TI  - Microarray integrated spatial transcriptomics (MIST) for affordable and robust digital pathology
T2  - NPJ SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - 10X Visium, a popular Spatial transcriptomics (ST) method, faces limited adoption due to its high cost and restricted sample usage per slide. To address these issues, we propose Microarray Integrated Spatial Transcriptomics (MIST), combining conventional tissue microarray (TMA) with Visium, using laser-cutting and 3D printing to enhance slide throughput. Our design facilitates independent replication and customization in individual labs to suit specific experimental needs. We provide a step-by-step guide from designing TMAs to the library preparation step. We demonstrate MIST's cost-effectiveness and technical benefits over Visium and GeoMx Nanostring. We also introduce 'AnnotateMap', a novel computational tool for efficient analysis of multiple ROIs processed through MIST.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by impaired differentiation of myeloid cells leading to hematopoietic failure. Despite advances, the molecular mechanisms driving AML remain incompletely understood, limiting the identification and targeting of critical vulnerabilities in leukemic cells. Homeobox (HOX) genes, encoding transcription factors essential for myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, are distributed across four clusters: HOXA (chromosome 7), HOXB (chromosome 17), HOXC (chromosome 12), and HOXD (chromosome 2). In addition to protein-coding sequences, HOX clusters encode non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are functional as transcripts and do not translate into proteins. This is the first study wherein we comprehensively reviewed the literature for HOX-embedded ncRNAs, encompassing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs), and piwiRNAs with a role in AML. To date, there is no evidence of circular RNAs and piwi RNAs encoded from the HOX gene clusters. Our review focuses on how leukemic cells harness the regulatory mechanisms of HOX-cluster-derived ncRNAs, (predominantly HOXA and HOXB) to modulate expression of HOX transcription factors facilitating leukemogenesis. HOX ncRNAs either regulate genes on the same chromosome (e.g., lncRNA HOTTIP) or influence expression of genes on different chromosomes (e.g., HOTAIR, HOX10-AS, miR-196b, and miR-10a). We discuss how specific HOX ncRNA networks are leveraged by leukemic cells, presenting an opportunity to explore targeted therapies and address the molecular heterogeneity of AML. Additionally, the aberrant expression of HOX ncRNAs such as HOXB derived ncRNAs in NPM1 mutated AML suggests their potential utility as improved biomarkers and for prognostication of patients with specific molecular aberrations.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are increasingly recognized as environmental contaminants with potential health risks. These emerge as breakdown products of larger plastics and are omnipresent in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. They are primarily composed of polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and additives that enhance their performance. MPs also adsorb harmful environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, posing risks to human and environmental health. Human exposure to MPs occurs mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with MPs detected in food products, water, and even the air. MPs have been shown to accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, disrupting the gut microbiome, and causing dysbiosis-a harmful imbalance between beneficial and harmful bacteria. This disruption has been linked to various health issues, including gastrointestinal disorders, systemic inflammation, and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis may be affected, with potential neuroinflammatory consequences. As research continues to unravel the health impacts of MP exposure, understanding the mechanisms of accumulation and the broader implications on human health is crucial. This review highlights the effects of MPs on human health, emphasizing their impact on the gut microbiome. We discuss the potential connections between MP exposure and cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases, and disorders related to the Gut-Brain Axis. By synthesizing the latest research, this work sheds light on the silent yet pervasive threat posed by MPs and underscores the importance of further studies to understand their health impacts fully.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful tool for biomolecule sensing. When combined with a broadband plasmonic structure, label-free, highly sensitive detection of specific molecules is possible. It is non-invasive, sensitive, fast, and can be used for in-situ analysis, unlike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence immunoassay, and radioimmunoassay. However, one of the challenges is to have an active SERS substrate that is uniform, sensitive, and specific to molecules of interest. In this work, we report plasmonic quasicrystal (PlQC) as a highly sensitive (enhancement factor approximate to 1014), uniform, reproducible, and stable (concerning time and ambient conditions) SERS active substrate. Herein, we present the label-free sensing of standard cotinine (up to 1 ng/mL), the ideal biomarker for nicotine exposure due to its long lifetime compared to nicotine. In addition, up to 1 nanogram level of cotinine has also been detected in synthetic urine and saliva employing PlQC as a SERS-active substrate. Our results on the principal component analysis of Rhodamine 6G and Cotinine demonstrate that broadband, dispersionless PlQC is suitable for label-free detection of single biomolecules.

AB  - BackgroundInternship is a phase of training wherein medical graduates acquire the skills and competencies required to function independently. It has been reported that interns lack confidence in performing common procedures, as these skills are often learnt through self-learning or performing without supervision. This type of learning endangers patient safety and fails to instil the required confidence in the student. Training in skills laboratories provide opportunity to learn clinical skills in a safe environment. However, skills laboratories are resource-intensive, and there is limited information on different training approaches, such as blended learning, and how the trainees perceive their usefulness. Hence, we conducted this pilot study to assess the perceived usefulness of a blended learning approach for skills training among medical interns.MethodsThis mixed methods study was conducted in the skills laboratory of an apex medical institute in India, among 42 interns posted for the Interns Skill-based Clinical Induction Program (ISCIP). In this training, a blended learning approach was adopted, which comprised of two components - an online e-learning module, followed by a hands-on training session. The trainees were asked to complete a feedback form and grade different components of the online session, and hands-on session on a five-item Likert-based scale. The scores were expressed as the mean (SD) of a maximum possible score of 5 for each of the components. In order to gain insight of the perceived usefulness of skills training among learners, focused group discussions (FGDs) were conducted.ResultsThe mean (SD) score for perceived importance ranged from 5 (0) to 4.9 (0.2) for various skills. The proportion of interns who felt confident in performing the skill after the training was 88.1% for IV cannulation to 97.6% handwashing, and gloving and gowning. The findings of the qualitative component revealed that interns found the training to be useful and interesting. It was perceived to be more ethical, uniform, well-structured, and provided an opportunity to practice a skill repeatedly.ConclusionsThe blended learning approach was perceived to be useful among the medical interns. Further research may be conducted in other medical institutes to assess the effectiveness of skills training.Clinical trial registration numberNot applicable, as the study is not a trial.

AB  - Despite strides in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ESCC, patient survival rates remain relatively low. Recent studies highlight the pivotal role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating diverse cellular activities in humans. Dysregulated lncRNAs have emerged as potential diagnostic indicators across various cancers, including ESCC. However, further research is necessary to effectively leverage ESCC-associated lncRNAs in clinical settings. Understanding their clinical significance for ESCC diagnosis and their mechanisms can pave the way for more effective therapeutic strategies. Our qRT-PCR analysis revealed significant downregulation of SOX2-OT (similar to 2.02-fold) and NEAT1 (similar to 1.53-fold) in ESCC blood samples. These lncRNAs show potential as biomarkers for distinguishing ESCC patients from healthy individuals, with ROC curves and AUC values of 0.736 for SOX2-OT and 0.621 for NEAT1. Further analysis examined the correlation between SOX2-OT and NEAT1 expression and various clinicopathological factors, including age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, hot beverage intake, tumor grade, and TNM stages. In-silico studies highlighted their roles in miRNA sponging via mTOR and MAPK pathways, while co-expression network analysis identified associated genes. This research paves the way for future studies on ESCC prognosis using SOX2-OT and NEAT1 as predictive markers. By thoroughly investigating the functions of these lncRNAs, we aim to deepen our understanding of their potential as diagnostic markers and their role in facilitating effective therapeutic interventions for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) within clinical contexts.

We report the outcome of the 2023 International Society of Nephrology HUS International Forum where a global panel of experts considered the current state of the art, identified areas of uncertainty, and proposed optimal solutions. Areas of uncertainty and areas for future research included the nomenclature of HUS, novel complement testing strategies, identification of biomarkers, genetic predisposition to atypical HUS, optimal dosing and withdrawal strategies for C5 inhibitors, treatment of kidney transplant recipients, disparity of access to treatment, and the next generation of complement inhibitors in complement-mediated HUS. The current rationale for optimal patient management is described.

AB  - Oral cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in India and 5% of all cancers in women is contributed by oral cancer. In spite of being a part of national programme, the screening coverage rates remain low. Studies have indicated that the societal status of women and their empowerment plays a role in screening coverage for cancer. The objective of the current study is to estimate the coverage of oral cancer screening among Indian women within reproductive age-group across Indian states and union territories (UTs), to explore the relationship of socioeconomic status (SES) and women empower status (WES) with oral cancer screening coverage across Indian states and union territories (UT). Data from the fifth round of the nationally representative cross-sectional survey (National Family Health Survey, NFHS-2019-2021) was used in the present study with 3,48,882 individuals being included in the final analysis. We have cross-tabulated SES and WES composite scores with the Dimension Index (DI) of screening and categorised states and UTs into low, middle and high. We have represented these values over the Indian map. The interaction among these was graphically represented by a bubble plot. Further, we estimated the association of each indicator of SES and WES with screening coverage using multivariable logistic regression. The national coverage of oral cancer screening among women of reproductive age was 0.77% with Andhra Pradesh (7%) and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (10%) recording the highest screening coverage. Despite having high SES and WES scores, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the screening (DI) was low. States with both high women empowerment status and high socioeconomic status showed high oral cancer screening uptake but the trend was not universal. Still, there were variations in the association among the states. The increased screening was significantly associated with higher access to improved sanitary facility (76%) and clean fuel for cooking (44%). Socio-economic status is an important precursor for better oral cancer screening coverage but women empowerment status did not always translate into good cancer screening uptake. Deep-rooted socio-cultural constructs and stigma associated with cancer and its implications may play a role. Implementation research for better uptake of oral cancer screening coverage is required.

AB  - BackgroundDespite extensive clinical documentation, few studies have explored the genetic basis of congenital pouch colon (CPC) which is crucial for early detection, personalized treatment, and genetic counselling.ObjectiveTo compile the information on the genetic basis of CPC and the functional enrichment of underlying molecular pathways.Materials and methodsThe review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The implicated genes were investigated for underlying molecular pathways. A network was subsequently created on String-database followed by gene-ontology analysis.ResultsThe study included 20 CPC cases and 52 controls (across 4 studies). Numerous variants, including 24 missense SNPs, 63 frameshift variants, and stop-gain/stop-loss mutations in 11 genes were identified. Notable genetic markers included MUC5B, FRG1, and TAF1B, with potential roles in mucosal barrier functions, colonic muscular development, and ribosomal RNA transcription, respectively. Copy number variants and lnc-EPB41-1-1 were also implicated. Genetic hotspots were identified on chromosomes 11, 17 and 16. RGPD2 and RGPD4, contributing to GTPase activator activity and known to be associated with bowel/colon, were differentially expressed. Pathway analysis highlighted Wnt and HOX pathways, with JAG1 and MLL relevant to CPC pathogenesis.ConclusionThe study integrates genetic evidence and pathway analysis, shedding light on the complex genetic architecture of CPC. While the importance of genetic markers in the etiopathogenesis of CPC is underscored, the need for validating the findings on larger cohorts, diverse populations and through functional studies is suggested.

AB  - During the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients experienced breathlessness, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, leading to the need for supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. With each passing day, the need for medical oxygen increased and simultaneously medical oxygen reserves in the country were getting depleted. Government agencies deployed multipronged strategies to ensure that the hospitals had an adequate supply of medical oxygen. Mechanisms and formulae were devised for the rational allocation of medical oxygen to various regions in the country; the production of medical oxygen was boosted along with the curtailment of oxygen usage in industries; and efficient supply chain management, which included " Oxygen Express"- special trains for transporting oxygen, aircrafts for transporting medical oxygen, creating green corridors and real-time monitoring of oxygen levels using information technology. The usage and promotion of indigenous PSA oxygen technology augmented the medical oxygen generation capacity at the health care facility level. This emergency situation demonstrated a need for strengthening established intersectoral coordination mechanisms for swift and effective responses to similar situations in future. Various strategies adopted by the Central Government and other government agencies to a large extent helped in addressing the medical oxygen emergencies.

AB  - Background and objectives: Tau PET is being increasingly appraised as a novel diagnostic modality for dementia work up. Given limited data among South Asians, we assessed the frequency, patterns, phenotypic associations and incremental value of positive Tau PET scans in clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative dementia. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited consecutive patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD syndromes (September 2021 to October 2022, India). Participants underwent clinical interview, cognitive assessment, MRI brain and tau PET scan ([F-18]ML-104). Visual read in a priori regions of interest was used to identify patterns of tau deposition in the brain. Results: We recruited 54 participants (mean age: 63.2 +/- 9.2 years, 64.8 % men, 77.8 % dementia, 70.4 % early onset cases, 37.8 % APOE4+). The analysis identified abnormal tau uptake in 40/54 (74.1 %) participants; with uptake in AD signature areas in 27/40 (67.5 %) cases [cortical subtype (74.1 %), limbic (14.8 %), combined cortical/limbic (11.1 %)], and patterns not conforming to AD in 13/40 (32.5 %) cases. Tau PET substantiated the diagnosis of AD among 17/19 (89.5 %) cases with clinically diagnosed AD dementia, 8/23 (34.8 %) cases with suspected non-AD cause, and 2/12 (16.7 %) cases with mild cognitive impairment. A trend for increasing proportion of early onset cases, and worsening cognition, behavior and functional ability was seen, from 'limbic' to 'combined cortical/limbic' to 'cortical' subgroups. Conclusion: Tau PET is a useful modality to differentiate AD dementia from other neurodegenerative causes in the Indian setting where amyloid biomarkers are not widely available. Biological subtypes of AD map well onto clinical phenotypes and need study in larger cohorts.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori is a highly prevalent gut pathogen with reported implications in a wide range of gastrointestinal disorders. Antibiotic based therapy, especially with clarithromycin is one of most effective treatment strategies against H. pylori. However, rising global prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in certain H. pylori strains, primarily attributed to point mutations in the 23S ribosomal RNA coding gene, pose a major challenge in effective eradication of this pathogen. There are a number of established methodologies devised for H. pylori mutation detection, so as to provide a tailored treatment plan to the patients and resist further transmissions of antibiotic resistant strains. However, there is no 'gold standard' method available to detect mutation status in clinical isolates of H. pylori from infected patients. CRISPR-Cas9 based technologies have revolutionized the field of mutation detection in biological samples, particularly during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Although multiple assays have been reported for detection of H. pylori in clinical samples including CRISPR diagnostics (CRISPRDx) platforms, there is no such assay reported till date to detect specific mutations that confer antibiotic resistance to this pathogen. In this study, we have developed an assay using engineered FnCas9 (en31-FnCas9) protein to effectively detect the A2142G and A2143G mutations in the 23S rDNA of H. pylori strains isolated from gastric biopsy samples. The data from in vitro cleavage assays and strip-based lateral flow tests using en31-FnCas9 and guide RNAs targeting the conserved and mutated loci of H. pylori 23S rDNA are in perfect congruence with the data from Sanger sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Our results indicate that en31-FnCas9 based mutation analysis can be deployed as an efficient diagnostic methodology to detect clarithromycin susceptibility in patients with suspected H. pylori infections.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesSovateltide (Tycamzzi (TM)), an endothelin-B (ET-B) receptor agonist, increases cerebral blood flow, has anti-apoptotic activity, and promotes neural repair following cerebral ischaemic stroke. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sovateltide in adult participants with acute cerebral ischaemic stroke.MethodsThis was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, Phase III clinical trial of sovateltide in participants with cerebral ischaemic stroke receiving standard of care (SOC) in India. Patients aged 18-78 years presenting up to 24 h after the onset of symptoms with radiologic confirmation of ischaemic stroke and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) of >= 6 were enrolled. Patients with recurrent stroke, receiving endovascular therapy, or with intracranial haemorrhage were excluded. The study drug (saline or sovateltide [0.3 mu g/kg] was administered intravenously in three doses at 3 +/- 1 h intervals on Days 1, 3, and 6, and follow-up was 90 days). The Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) was used to impute the missing assessments on the endpoints. An unpaired t-test, two-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test, and the Chi-square test were used for the statistical analysis. The objective was to determine at Day 90 (1) the number of patients with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) 0-2, and (2) the number of patients with an NIHSS 0-5 at 90 days.ResultsPatients were randomised with 80 patients in the sovateltide and 78 in the control group. Patients received the investigational drug at about 18 h of stroke onset in both control and sovateltide groups. The median NIHSS at randomisation was 10.00 (95% CI 9.99-11.65) in the control group and 9.00 (95% CI 9.11-10.46) in the sovateltide group. Seventy patients completed the 90-day follow-up in the control group and 67 in the sovateltide group. The proportion of intention-to-treat (ITT) patients with mRS 0-2 score at Day 90 post-randomisation was 22.67% higher (odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% CI 1.37-5.57); similarly, the proportion of patients with NIHSS score of 0-5 at Day 90 was 17.05% more (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.27-5.90) in the sovateltide group than in the control group. An improvement of >= 2 points on the mRS was observed in 51.28% and 72.50% of patients in the control and sovateltide groups, respectively (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.29-4.81). Seven of 78 patients (8.97%) in the control group and 7 of 80 (8.75%) in the sovateltide group developed intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). The adverse events were not related to sovateltide.ConclusionsThe sovateltide group had a greater number of cerebral ischaemic stroke patients with lower mRS and NIHSS scores at 90 days post-treatment than the control group. This trial supported the regulatory approval of sovateltide in India, but a multinational RESPECT-ETB trial will be conducted for US approval.Trial RegistrationClinical Trials Registry, India (CTRI/2019/09/021373) and the United States National Library of Medicine, ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04047563).

AB  - Purpose: Brain imaging is needed when investigating epilepsy. Imaging options available include MRI and CT scan which may be non-contrast (NCCT) or contrast-enhanced (CECT). The specific clinical question and probable epilepsy substrate in the epidemiological context and socioeconomic milieu are important in determining the choice of imaging. In patients with well-controlled focal or unknown epilepsy who are unlikely to be surgical candidates, is CECT essential or can NCCT be an acceptable choice? Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in India. Consecutive patients with focal or unknown epilepsy who were relatively well-controlled on medical treatment underwent NCCT followed by CECT brain. Three neuroradiologists independently reported the images. Proportion of abnormalities missed on NCCT and picked only on CECT were determined. How often abnormalities picked on CECT changed patient management was also analysed. Results: Two hundred and nineteen patients with focal (87 %) or unknown (13 %) epilepsy underwent NCCT followed by CECT brain. Most had epilepsy for >3 months and an annual seizure frequency of 2-10 seizures. There was a nearly perfect inter-observer agreement between 3 neuroradiologists in reporting the NCCT and CECT as 'normal' or 'abnormal' with kappa (kappa) values of 0.9 and 1.0 respectively. The sensitivity of NCCT compared to CECT in detecting an abnormality was 97 % (CI 92.6 - 99.5 %) and the specificity was 99 % (CI 94.9 - 99.9 %). There was no significant difference in the proportion of NCCTs and CECTs found abnormal (50.22 % vs 51.14 %, p = 0.91). A solitary calcified granuloma was the most common abnormality reported on NCCT as well as CECT, 21.0 % and 19.1 % respectively. New findings picked on CECT alone, did not change management in any patient. Conclusion: When imaging focal or unknown epilepsy, an NCCT performs as well as a CECT, especially in regions where calcified lesions contribute a significant etiological burden. The role of imaging in epilepsy varies between patients and a universal recommendation of an MRI or a CECT in all patients is neither cost-efficient nor evidence-based. In drug responsive focal or unknown epilepsy of longstanding duration, CT scans are either normal or have calcified lesions that are easily picked on NCCT.

AB  - High pigmentation and the abundance of M2 macrophages have been identified as negative predictors in uveal melanoma (UM). Risk factors associated with UM that are prevalent in high-risk White populations are still present, although less common, in relatively low-risk Asian populations. Research indicates that proangiogenic M2 macrophages and monosomy 3 play significant roles in UM progression. Our aim was to investigate the impact of tumor- associated macrophages in UM and examine their correlation with monosomy 3 and pigmentation. Transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze the morphology of macrophages in UM. Forty UM samples underwent fluorescent in situ hybridization for monosomy 3 identification. Immunohistochemis try was done to assess M2/M 1 macrophages on 82 UM tissue samples. IL-10 and IL-12 expressions were quantified in UM serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of all markers was correlated with pigmentation markers (tyrosinase-related protein 1, tyrosinase-related protein 2, silver protein, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor). Prognostic outcomes were determined using the Cox proportional hazard model and log-rank tests. Increased expression of M2/M 1 macrophages was observed in 31 UM cases, which correlated with the high expression of pigmentation markers. IL-10 concentration was high in UM cases. Monosomy 3 was evident in 50% of UM cases and significantly associated with increased immunoexpressi on of M2/M 1 macrophages and pigmentation markers. Reduced metastasis-free survival was observed in patients with UM with high M2/M 1 macrophage expression (P 1 / 4 .001). High pigmentation and increased M2 macrophage density could impact the tumor microenvironment in UM. This could contribute to ineffective antitumor immune responses in patients with UM.

AB  - BackgroundThe Androgen Receptor (AR) has emerged as an endocrine therapy target in Breast Cancer, exhibiting up to 80% expression in clinical cases. AR-V7, a constitutively activated splice variant of AR with a truncated ligand-binding domain (LBD), demonstrates ligand-independent transcriptional activity and resistance to nonsteroidal antiandrogens like Bicalutamide or Enzalutamide, targeting the LBD. In metastatic prostate cancer, elevated AR-V7 levels lead to therapeutic resistance and increased metastasis.MethodsIn this study, we evaluated the expression of AR and AR-V7 in cell lines and a cohort of 89 patients undergoing surgical intervention for treatment-na & iuml;ve breast cancer. Further clinicopathological correlations and survival analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between the AR and AR-V7 expression and clinical outcomes.ResultsAR-V7/AR-FL ratio was elevated in the TNBC cell line and downregulation of AR-FL upon AR antagonists' treatment led to a compensatory increase in AR-V7. Clinical samples showed significantly elevated expression of AR and AR-V7 in tumors compared to control cases. Further clinicopathological correlation revealed aggressive clinical traits, higher pathological grades, and poor survival with AR-V7 expression.ConclusionsOur study unravels AR-V7 as a marker for poor clinical outcomes, predicting breast cancer aggressiveness, and encourages consideration of AR-V7 as a probable target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Background Parents of children with differences of sex development (DSD) are known to suffer from psychological distress at the time of diagnosis and thereafter. We analyzed the prevalence of anxiety and depression in Indian parents of children with DSD and its associated risk factors, as well as their experiences, perceptions and expectations from the healthcare system.Methods This cross-sectional study included parents of children aged <= 6 years with atypical genitalia. Data was collected through face-to-face semi-structured interview using specially designed questionnaire. Depression and anxiety have been assessed using PHQ9 (Patient health questionnaire) and GAD-7 (Generalized anxiety disorder scale), respectively.Results The current mean age of the 43 children (46,XY=26, 46,XX=16 and chromosomal DSD=1) was 36.5 +/- 21.4 months with a median age of diagnosis of 5 months (range- 0-60 months). 68 parents (35 mothers and 33 fathers) were interviewed. The score was above the cut-off for clinically significant depression in 27.2 and 25.7 % of the fathers and mothers, respectively; and for clinically significant anxiety in 15.1 and 28.6 % of the fathers and mothers, respectively. The most significant factor associated with psychological distress was rearing a boy with lower EMS in fathers and lower literacy levels (with higher perception of stigma) in mothers. Absence of family support was associated with high levels of distress in both parents.Conclusions There is a high level of depression and anxiety amongst Indian parents of children born with atypical genitalia and requirement for psychological support and counseling.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for cancer signalling pathways and tumour maintenance, making ROS targeting a promising anti-cancer strategy. Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) has been shown to be effective against various cancers, but its impact on retinoblastoma, alone or with trolox, remains unreported. Cytotoxicity of CoQ(10) alone and with trolox was evaluated in normal human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) and Y79 retinoblastoma cells using CCK-8. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis, cell cycle, ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Anti-angiogenic potential was tested using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. Mechanistic studies were conducted via RT-PCR and western blotting. CoQ(10), alone and with trolox, reduced Y79 cell viability, induced apoptosis through excess ROS generation, and decreased MMP significantly. Both treatments caused G2/M phase cell arrest. The CAM assay showed a significant reduction in endothelial cell proliferation, evidenced by fewer number of co-cultured HUVECs when exposed to CoQ(10) or CoQ(10) with trolox. The combination of CoQ(10) and trolox significantly reduced VEGF-A, ERK, and Akt receptor levels, while CoQ(10) alone significantly inhibited ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Together, CoQ(10 )and trolox reduced protein expression of VEGFA. CoQ(10) alone and with trolox, induces apoptosis in Y79 retinoblastoma cells by inhibiting the ERK/Akt pathway and downregulating VEGFA. This study is the first to report the in vitro and in-ovo anti-cancer potential of CoQ(10) alone or when combined with trolox, on human retinoblastoma Y79 cells.

AB  - Purpose: Telemedicine was widely adopted for epilepsy care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its role extends beyond preventing disease transmission, offering an efficient and high-quality care alternative. To understand the global scenario, an international group conducted a survey comparing telemedicine practices in epilepsy care before, during, and after the pandemic. Methods: The survey included 26 questions on demographics, telemedicine use for epilepsy care, regulations, reimbursement mechanisms, and tools used. Responses were collected via an online survey platform from June to October 2023. Results: Two hundred eighty-five respondents from 60 countries participated. The average telemedicine use in daily practice was 0 %, 0-10 % (median, IQR) before the pandemic, 65 %, 30-90 % during the pandemic, and 20 %,10-50 % after the COVID pandemic. Female respondents reported higher telemedicine use than males after the pandemic (25 %, 10-50 % vs 15 %, 5 %-30 %, p = 0.002). According to respondents' perceptions, post-pandemic telemedicine regulations flexibilities were reported as expanded by 36.8 %, restricted by 17.2 %, and unchanged by 46 %. Reimbursement for telemedicine increased during the pandemic but decreased afterward (Cochran's Q test, p < 0.001). Voice calls were the most used telemedicine platform (46.6 %). Privacy issues were reported by 49 respondents (18.3 %). Conclusion: Telemedicine use for epilepsy care increased during the pandemic and remained higher than pre- pandemic levels. However, improvements are needed in telemedicine applications, regulations, reimbursement, and patient privacy. International collaboration and experience sharing can enhance telemedicine's acceptance and practice globally.

AB  - Background/aims Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) are gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical presentations but diverging etiologies. The study aims to decipher CD and ITB-associated gut dysbiosis signatures and identify disease-associated co-occurring modules to evaluate whether this dysbiosis signature is a disease-specific trait or is a shared feature across diseases of diverging etiologies.
   Methods Disease-associated gut microbial modules were identified using statistical machine learning and co-abundance network analysis in controls, CD and ITB patients recruited as part of this study. Module reproducibility was reinvestigated through meta-network analysis encompassing >5400 bacteriomes and similar to 900 mycobiomes. Subsequently, >1600 Indian gut microbiomes were analyzed to identify a central-core gut microbiome of 46 taxa, whose abundances aided in the formulation of an India-specific Core Gut Microbiome Score (CGMS) to measure the degree of core retention.
   Results Both diseases witness similar patterns of alterations in [alpha]-diversity, characterized by a significant reduction in gut bacterial (i.e., bacterial/archaeal) diversity and a concomitant increase in the fungal [alpha]-diversity. Specific bacterial taxa, along with the diverging mycobiome enabled distinction between the diseases. Co-abundance network analysis of these taxa, validated by integrated meta-network analysis, revealed a 'disease-depleted' module, consistent across multiple cohorts, with >75% of this module constituting the central-core Indian gut microbiome. CGMS robustly assessed the core-microbiome loss across different stages of gut inflammatory disorders, in Indian and international cohorts.
   Conclusions While the disease-specific gain of detrimental bacteria forms an important component of gut dysbiosis, loss of the core microbiome is a shared phenomenon contributing to various GI disorders.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of ureteral diameter ratio (UDR) as a tool to prognosticate and manage vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Four scientific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria were all studies in which UDR was used in prognostication and/or management of VUR. An independent assessment of the methodological quality was performed by two authors using the Newcastle Ottawa Quality scale. The statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Thirteen studies (all retrospective) were included in this review. Pooling the data demonstrated a significantly lower UDR in the spontaneous resolution vs. persistence of VUR group (p = 0.001). Also, the pooled data showed significantly higher values of UDR in the breakthrough UTI group (p < 0.00001), those requiring operative intervention (p = 0.03), and those with persistence of VUR after endoscopic treatment (p < 0.0001). The estimated heterogeneity for two outcomes, i.e., spontaneous resolution and requirement of operative intervention in VUR were substantial and statistically significant. All except one of the included studies were of good methodological quality. However, further studies are required to identify the cut-off values for these respective outcomes.

AB  - BackgroundThe steep increase in knee arthroplasties in lower- and middle-income countries has increased demand for personalised rehabilitation care. Technology-based rehabilitation programs offer potential to replace or augment conventional face-to-face rehabilitation for providing continuum of care. We aimed to systematically develop a theory, evidence-driven, contextualised, and user-centred mobile health platform for people undergoing knee arthroplasty to facilitate monitoring progress during rehabilitation.MethodsWe followed the UK Medical Research Council's framework and adopted a behaviour design thinking approach, consisting of five steps; (1) conduct multiple literature reviews and cross-sectional surveys to determine the needs and problems experienced during the rehabilitation phase by healthcare professionals and individuals with replaced knees, (2) identify target behaviours along with barriers and facilitators, integrated within the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework, (3) identify intervention functions and components, behaviour change techniques, and features for the mobile application, selected after discussions with orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and behavioural experts, (4) develop a prototype application for end-users, and a web-based platform for healthcare professionals, and (5) pilot test the intervention for end-users' feedback on usability of the application and to identify possible strategies for implementing the intervention package.ResultsUsing the COM-B model, education, training, persuasion, enablement, and modelling were chosen as intervention functions for improving adherence to exercise protocol during early-phase of rehabilitation. The application featured five interlinked components; education, training, goal setting and self-management, communication, and a personalized therapy plan utilising 13 behaviour change techniques. An education booklet, exercise videos, text messaging, video consultation, and a digital tool for measuring range of motion were incorporated into the application. Feedback on the interactive prototype and education material was sought from ten patient volunteers and a physiotherapist. Pilot testing in a convenient sample with broad eligibility criteria (n = 30) indicated importance of digital literacy and dedicated time for remote consultation by healthcare provider within the existing clinical work. Overall, the intervention was well received and valued by the end users.ConclusionThis paper demonstrates the development of a contextualised digital behavioural intervention grounded in behavioural theory and evidence from literature to improve end-user's engagement with rehabilitation protocols after knee arthroplasty in lower- and middle-income country context.Trial registrationStudy registered prospectively (on 16 February 2023) at Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2023/02/049792).

AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to determine the utility of prophylactic antibiotics before pyloromyotomy for the prevention of Surgical Site Infections (SSI) among children with Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS).MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases was performed to identify papers published till 30th July 2024. The main outcome of interest was the incidence of SSIs. The relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random effects model. The I2 statistic was used to calculate the heterogeneity. The Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale (NOS) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies.ResultsFive studies, published between 1999 and 2024, were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of developing SSI among those treated was RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.78, with I2 = 0%, indicating no incremental benefit of administration of prophylactic antibiotics. A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding the database studies. Results from this analysis (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.20, I2 = 0%) demonstrated that no significant difference was observed after excluding studies with large sample sizes. All included studies were of good methodological quality as assessed with the NOS.ConclusionThe findings of this review demonstrate no incremental benefit of the administration of prophylactic antibiotics before pyloromyotomy in preventing SSIs in children with IHPS. However, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials need to be conducted in the future before any definite conclusions are drawn in this regard.

AB  - Sodium valproate is used for the management of seizures, status epilepticus, chronic pain syndrome, bipolar, and other affective disorders. Even with an acceptable safety profile, severe idiosyncratic reactions can occur with valproate use. A rare, serious, and life-threatening side effect of valproate is valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE). We intend to analyze the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment options, and outcome of VHE in neurosurgical patients and review the pertinent literature on this rare sequelae. We retrospectively reviewed patients who developed VHE following valproate use, either for the treatment of epilepsy or for seizure prophylaxis in our centre. We analyzed the demographic details, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes. A total of four patients with a mean age of 26.3 +/- 5.1 (range 19 - 32 years). Valproate was prescribed for primary seizure prophylaxis in 2 patients (50%). The commonest etiology for valproate prescription was for brain tumors (3, 75%) followed by drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) (1, 25%). None of the patients were documented to have urea cycle disorder. The mean daily prescribed dosage of valproate was 1250 +/- 559 mg and the mean duration of administration was 13 +/- 13.3 months (range 4 months - 36 months). The mean serum NH3 level was 136,5 +/- 44.2 mu mol/L (range 107 - 212.8) and all patients (4, 100%) had hyperammonemia with a mortality rate of 50% (2 patients). The hyperammonemia was treated by stopping the valproate use (4, 100%) and dialysis (2, 50%). Normalization of ammonia levels led to clinical improvement in 50% (2 patients). Neurological deterioration in the postoperative period is a diagnostic challenge. VHE is a rare and life-threatening sequelae of Valproate-associated Hyperammonemia (VAH) in neurosurgical patients. A high index of suspicion is required due to its ambiguous presentation. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can change the course of this life-threatening sequelae.

AB  - BackgroundVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease primarily affecting Brazil, East Africa, and India, with India accounting for 18% of the global burden. While VL typically presents with systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, and splenomegaly, it can occasionally manifest atypically, posing significant diagnostic challenges. Neurological presentations of VL are extremely rare, making them difficult to suspect and diagnose. Cases where VL predominantly presents with neurological symptoms are particularly novel, underscoring the need for heightened awareness of such atypical manifestations in endemic regions.Clinical caseA 38-year-old man with history of recurrent atypical VL presented with diffuse lower back pain, progressive tingling, numbness, weakness in the lower extremities, and double vision for one month. Clinical and radiological evaluations suggested cauda equina syndrome and cranial nerve palsy, accompanied by generalized lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules, and skin papules. The differential diagnosis initially included disseminated tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and lymphoma. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an inflammatory syndrome. Histopathology of lymph node and bone marrow revealed Leishmania amastigotes and subcutaneous nodule and skin biopsy revealed inflammatory cells with granulomas. Furthermore, the qPCR test on DNA from a subcutaneous nodule, lymph node, and CSF was positive for Leishmania kinetoplast DNA. The species was further confirmed as Leishmania donovani through ITS-based PCR amplification and sequencing. Finally, a diagnosis of relapse of VL with lymph node, cutaneous, and neurological involvement, including abducens nerve palsy and cauda equina syndrome, was established. He was treated with combination of liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine, along with intrathecal hyaluronidase, resulting in significant improvement.ConclusionUnlike previously reported cases with both systemic and neurological symptoms, our patient predominantly presented with neurological manifestations, making this a unique and novel presentation of VL. This case highlights diagnostic challenges and management of atypical VL, emphasizing neurological involvement and successful therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Importance Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. Objective To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength. Evidence Review This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches. Findings A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation. Conclusions and Relevance In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a well-known member of the PPAR family and a potential target for the treatment of various disorders. Herein, we present the design and synthesis of various 6-aryl-4-sec.amino-2-oxo-2H-pyran-3-carbonitrile derivatives and functionalized thieno[3,2-c]pyran-2-ones, derived from ketene dithioacetal. Then all the synthesized compounds were docked for their activity as PPAR-gamma to predict the binding mechanism and affinities regarding rosiglitazone and muraglitazar. Our studies revealed that three compounds 10 e, 10 f, and 10 h showed significant binding affinities, with energy ranges comparable to standard drugs rosiglitazone and muraglitazar. The docking conformation studies revealed that the selected compounds nicely interact with PPAR-gamma in the ligand binding domain with positive predictive values. We also performed molecular dynamics of the most potent compounds to validate the result. Our results indicate that these novel compounds are potential PPAR-gamma ligands, offering new possibilities for therapeutic applications. This study underscores the potential of these synthesized compounds in the development of novel PPAR-gamma agonists.

AB  - A fifteen-year-old boy was brought to emergency department with complaints of altered sensorium, aphasia and right sided hemiparesis following severe dengue one month back. On physical examination, tone was flaccid and power was diminished in right upper and lower limbs. Reflexes were diminished in all four limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple well defined thin walled ring-enhancing lesions in left basal ganglia, bilateral cerebellum, left occipital lobe and bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal lobes. The basal ganglia focus was tapped. Potassium hydroxide-calcofluor white mount of the intra-operative pus sample showed fragmented septate hyphae with folding and with wide variations in breadth. A provisional report of septate and aseptate hyphae suggestive of mixed infection was given. Empirical voriconazole was stopped and the patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B to cover a broader spectrum of molds. Subsequently, fungal culture of the pus sample grew off-white glabrous colonies in multiple culture tubes. On lactophenol cotton blue mount, shield cells were seen suggestive of Cladosporium spp. Amphotericin B was stopped after provisional identification of Cladosporium spp. was given by the laboratory and IV voriconazole was started. The identification was confirmed to be Cladosporium cladosporioides by microculture and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the 18s ribosomal DNA. The patient improved with drainage of the largest basal ganglia focus and voriconazole. This case exemplifies the potential of saprobic fungi to cause invasive infections in human.

AB  - Background: Sustained activation of default mode network has been implicated for momentary lapses of attention and higher errors during performance of cognitive tasks in attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) children. Despite emerging evidence indicating the genetic basis of ADHD, there is paucity of literature investigating the alteration of DMN in children with ADHD and their unaffected siblings. Aim: To study the cortical sources of DMN in children with ADHD compared to their siblings and neurotypical controls. Methods: Eighty-six participants (35 ADHD (12.4(+2.7) years), 16 unaffected siblings (11.8(+4.3) years) and 35 matched neurotypical controls (12.6 (+3.6) years) participated in the study. 128 channel EEG data was acquired during rest and Stroop cognitive task and analyzed for cortical source estimation using LORETA software. Results: Higher activation of DMN and DMN associated areas were observed during encoding of the color-word stimuli in children with ADHD. Sustained activation of core DMN areas namely medial frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule was observed across all groups. Among the three groups, distinct cortical source activation differences were identified solely in the DMN and its associated areas among children with ADHD during the task encoding phase compared to baseline. In contrast, both siblings and neurotypical controls displayed activation in fronto-parieto-temporal areas subserving executive function were also observed. Conclusion: Sustained activity of DMN areas with minimal activity in executive network in ADHD children and unaffected siblings during encoding of stimulus implies potential endophenotypic marker in children with ADHD compared to neurotypical controls.

TI  - Validation of urinary Congo Red preeclampsia detection point-of-care devise
T2  - PREGNANCY HYPERTENSION-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH
KW  - WOMEN
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate a commercial a Congo Red urine devise for assessing preeclampsia risk. Study design: Prospective non-intervention study among women presenting with clinical suspicion of preeclampsia. The devise was used at the time of enrolment and, depending on gestation, on 1-3 later occasions. Outcome measures: Abnormal diffusion patterns classified as positive or negative, in relation to subsequent confirmation of preeclampsia (detection and false- positive rates, and predictive value) and the probability of diagnosis within a fixed time period (rule-in and rule-out). Results: 600 women were enrolled in the study and follow-up information was available on 538, of whom 95 had preeclampsia at delivery and 443 did not. At enrolment the detection rate was 18 % and the false-positive rate 3.2 %; positive predictive value - probability of positive result being associated with preeclampsia - was 55 % and negative predictive value - probability of negative result not being preeclampsia - was 85 %. A positive test ruled-in delivery with preeclampsia within 28 days among 35 % and ruled-out preeclampsia with 7 days among 98 %. Repeat testing after enrolment yielded similar results to the initial sample. Conclusion: The test has screening potential although published studies differ in the observed detection rate. Using the test to rule-out preeclampsia within 7 days can provide a significant management advantage especially for triaging patients and selecting those who can be managed at the peripheral centres.

AB  - Purpose: A comprehensive operative report for cancer surgery is crucial for accurate disease staging, risk stratification, and therapy escalation/de-escalation, which affects the outcome. Narrative operative reports may fail to include some critical findings. Furthermore, standardized operative reports can form the basis of a local registry, which is often lacking in limited-resource settings (LRSs). In adult literature, synoptic operative reports (SOR) contain more key findings than narrative operative reports. In the LRSs, where the capacity of diagnostic pathology services is typically suboptimal, the value of a thorough operative report is even greater. The aim of this study was to develop a SOR template to help standardize childhood cancer surgery reporting in LRSs.
   Methods: Twenty-three experts in pediatric cancer with extensive experience practicing in LRSs were invited to participate in a modified Delphi procedure. SOR domains for pediatric oncology surgery were drafted based on a literature search and then modified based on experts' opinions. The experts anonymously answered multiple rounds of online questionnaires until all domains and subdomains reached a consensus, which was predefined as 70% agreement.
   Results: Sixteen experts participated in the study, and two rounds of the survey were completed. Twenty-one domains were considered relevant, including demographics, diagnosis, primary site, preoperative disease stage, previous tumor biopsy or surgery, preoperative tumor rupture, neoadjuvant therapy, surgical access, type of resection, completeness of resection, tumor margin assessment, locoregional tumor extension, organ resection, intraoperative tumor spillage, vascular involvement, lymph node sampling, estimated blood loss, intraoperative complications and interventions to address them, specimen names, and specimen orientation.
   Conclusion: We developed a SOR template for pediatric oncology surgery in LRSs. Consensus for all 21 domains and associated subdomains was achieved using a modified Delphi procedure.

AB  - Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of amoebiasis, which is a significant global health concern. The virulence mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity are multifaceted and complex. However, endocytic processes and motility are well accepted virulence determinants. As previously reported, an AGCK family kinase, EhAGCK1 to be involved in trogocytosis exclusively while another one from same family named EhAGCK2 participates in all actin dependent endocytic processes. As the kinase dead mutants of EhAGCK1 showed significant defect in destruction of live host cells and also the localisation pattern of same is distinguishable from EhAGCK2. From observations so far, it appears that former initiates a distinguishable signaling cascade. In this work, we have demonstrated distinct biochemical properties of kinases involved in related yet distinguishable endocytic processes for the first time. Our biochemical characterization highlights distinct ion dependency of EhAGCK1 along with substrate specificity. We also show upstream activator of these kinases, 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) activity and its role in activating the kinase activity. The kinases exhibit property of autophosphorylation, and which may regulate the kinase activity subsequently. Summarily, these studies show that EhAGCK1 and EhAGCK2 show distinct biochemical properties which further confirm their unique role in related endocytic processes of trogocytosis and phagocytosis.

AB  - Background & objectives: Biobanks are crucial for biomedical research, enabling new treatments and medical advancements. The biobank at the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) aims to gather, process, store, and distribute biospecimens to assist scientific studies. Methods: This article details the profile of two cohorts: the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study and the Registry of people with diabetes in India with young age at onset (ICMR-YDR). The ICMR-INDIAB study is the largest epidemiological study on diabetes in India, encompassing a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 20 yr and older from urban and rural areas in every State across the country. The ICMR-YDR is the first national-level, multicentric clinic-based registry focusing on youth-onset diabetes in India, aiming to understand the disease patterns and variations in youth-onset diabetes across different country regions. Results: Key operations at the MDRF biobank include collecting and processing samples, where serum and whole blood samples are aliquoted and transferred through a cold chain to the central laboratory, and then stored in Siruseri (29 km from the capital city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu). Samples are barcoded, linked to subject information, and stored in freezers or liquid nitrogen (LN2) vessels, with inventory tracked via software for easy retrieval. A register records access to the biobank, ensuring sample integrity and compliance with regulatory requirements. The biobank adheres to the ICMR's National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research involving human participants. Interpretation & conclusions: The biobank enables the analysis of biomarkers in stored samples, aiding in scientifically sound decisions, treating patients, and potentially curing diabetes.

AB  - Background:Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a common gastrointestinal malignancy noted for its aggressive characteristics and poor prognosis, which is mostly caused by delayed detection. However, the scarcity of information regarding somatic mutations in Indian patients with GBC has hampered the development of efficient therapeutic options. In the present study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing the mutational profile of GBC.Materials and methods:To evaluate the somatic mutation profile, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 66 tumor and matched blood samples from individuals with GBC. Somatic variant calling was performed using GATK pipeline. Variants were annotated at pathogenic and oncogenic levels, using ANNOVAR, VEP tools and the OncoKB database. Mutational signature analysis, oncogenic pathway analysis and cancer driver genes identification were performed at the functional level by using the maftools package.Results:Our findings focused on the eight most altered genes with pathogenic and oncogenic mutations: TP53, SMAD4, ERBB3, KRAS, ARID1A, PIK3CA, RB1, and AXIN1. Genes with pathogenic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were enriched in oncogenic signaling pathways, particularly RTK-RAS, WNT, and TP53 pathways. Furthermore, our research related certain mutational signatures, such as cosmic 1, cosmic 6, and cosmic 18, 29, to known characteristics including patient age and tobacco smoking, providing important insights into disease etiology.Conclusions:Given the scarcity of exome-based sequencing studies focusing on the Indian population, this study represents a significant step forward in providing a framework for additional in-depth mutational analysis. Genes with substantial oncogenic and pathogenic mutations are promising candidates for developing targeted mutation panels, particularly for GBC detection.

AB  - The Descemet membrane (DM) is the basement membrane of corneal endothelial cells, which are responsible for maintaining corneal transparency. DM detachment (DMD) can occur due to various reasons, with the most common etiology being post-surgical. Older age, blunt instruments, and faulty surgical technique predispose to the intraoperative or postoperative occurrence of DMD, and one should have a high index of suspicion for DMD in cases with unexplained or an atypical pattern of corneal edema after surgery. Prompt intervention for DMD management is imperative to effect early visual rehabilitation, decrease corneal morbidity, and avoid permanent damage leading to scarring of the cornea. Various classifications of DMD and management protocols have been described. Anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging is the most effective imaging to detect DMD and quantify its extent. Desmetopexy with air/gas is the initial treatment of choice and could be aided by suture fixation. Non-responsive cases might need endothelial keratoplasty.

AB  - Exercise has numerous health benefits in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRDs). Regular physical activity can help maintain/improve bone health. The aim of the present article was to review current knowledge on the effects of exercise on bone health in patients with AIRDs, particularly in those experiencing a high corticosteroid burden. The article also aimed to discuss potential mechanisms underlying the benefits of physical activity/exercise on bone tissue. Potential explanations regarding the role of exercise on bone health in AIRDs include anti-inflammatory effects, mechanical loading, improvement in muscle strength, hormonal changes, improvement in balance, and effects on telomere erosion, deoxyribonucleic acid methylation, and gene expression. Current evidence regarding the outcomes of exercise on bone health in patients with AIRDs is predominantly derived from studies focused on rheumatoid arthritis. Expanding research to include other rheumatic conditions would enhance the overall understanding of this topic.

AB  - Background Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. Patients with trachomatous corneal opacity (TCO) are traditionally considered high-risk cases for graft failure. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that corneal transplantation may restore vision in such individuals. We wanted to review the available evidence for keratoplasty outcomes in TCO. Methods A literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science was performed using the search terms "trachoma* AND (keratoplasty OR cornea* transplant*)". The search was restricted to studies published between 1 January 1992 and 12 October 2022. All types of prospective and retrospective study designs reporting outcomes of keratoplasty in trachoma were included. The primary outcome assessed was rate of graft survival in patients with TCO who received keratoplasty. Secondary outcomes were postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and graft rejection rates. Results Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. None were prospective trials; 215/302 grafts (71%) were clear at final follow-up. There was significant variability between studies in the reporting of patient characteristics, follow-up, complications, and outcomes. In data on penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), graft survival at final follow-up was observed in 161/195 eyes (83%). Studies assessing lamellar keratoplasty (LKP) reported graft survival in 18/20 eyes (90%). Rejection episodes were reported in 31/167 (19%) eyes managed with PKP and 0 of 20 eyes managed with LKP. Of 163 eyes, preoperative BCVA was <= counting fingers in 76% and <= 6/60 in 91%. A postoperative BCVA of >6/60 was achieved in 63% of eyes. Conclusions There is a paucity of evidence supporting keratoplasty in TCO. However, it may hold visual rehabilitation promise for people whose needs have to date been largely ignored. More structured reporting of outcomes from centres which perform keratoplasty in TCO and a well-designed prospective study would be valuable additions to the literature.

AB  - Objective: To estimate objective cut-off values for Bath ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) corresponding to Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with CRP (ASDAS) cut-off values (1.3, 2.1, and 3.5), and for interval changes (Delta BASDAI) corresponding to Delta ASDAS (1.1 and 2). Methods: In this multicentric study, adult patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) treated with either tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously fortnightly were recruited. Available paired data on BASDAI and ASDAS and paired interval change of these parameters (taken at least 3-months apart) were analyzed. Cut-off values for BASDAI were determined from a multinomial logistic regression and that for Delta BASDAI were determined with ordinal logistic regression with predicted probabilities. Diagnostics were assessed with correct classification rate (CRR), polychoric correlations (PCC), Goodman and Kruskal Gamma (GKG), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: Total 962 observations of paired data and 670 interval change data were available from 266 patient (mean age 35 years, mean disease duration 7 years, mean BASDAI 2.7, and mean ASDAS 2.1). Following ASDAS classes were observed: inactive disease 131 (13.6%), moderate disease activity 322 (33.5%), high disease activity 420 (43.65%), and very high disease activity 89 (9.25%). The three cut-offs generated for BASDAI were 0.8, 2.5, and 6 for BASDAI and those for Delta BASDAI were 2 and 4. The CRR for BASDAI cut-offs was 65.59 and that for Delta BASDAI was 54.9. For the BASDAI cut-offs, both PCC and GKG showed high values (> 0.85) and the MCC was 0.471. Conclusion: In patients with axSpA, without any clinical or serological confounders, BASDAI values 0.8, 2.5, and 6 corresponded to ASDAS-CRP values 1.3, 2.1, and 3.5, respectively, and Delta BASDAI values of 2 and 4 correspond to Delta ASDAS cut-offs of 1.1 and 2.

AB  - Background:There is lack of data on bipolar disorder (BD) type II from India.Aim:To compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with BD-I and BD-II using the data of the Bipolar Disorder Course and Outcome study from India (BiD-CoIN study).Methodology:Using the data of the BiD-CoIN study, patients with BD-I and BD-II were compared for demographic and clinical variables.Results:Out of the 773 patients, 59 (7.63%) participants had BD-II. Compared to BD-I, patients with BD-II had a higher income; were more often unemployed or housewives; had a higher mean number of episodes per year of illness, higher severity of depressive episodes, higher depressive affective morbidity, and a higher number of hypomanic episodes (in the lifetime, and number of episodes per year of illness); received lower doses of lithium and a lower number of medications; and had lower prevalence of alcohol dependence, higher prevalence of seasonality, a high proportion of them sought faith healing treatment, and a higher proportion of them have predominant depressive polarity.Conclusions:Patients with BD-I and BD-II differ from each other on certain demographic and clinical variables. The difference in the clinical variables suggests that the patients with BD-II may require different treatment approaches for management.

AB  - Background: Gout is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by elevated uric acid levels in the blood, which can precipitate acute gout attacks in individuals with genetic susceptibility, existing medical conditions, and dietary influences. Genetic predispositions, comorbid medical conditions, nutritional choices, and environmental factors increasingly recognize the multifactorial etiology of the disease. Methods: Recent research has highlighted the potential of phytochemicals, particularly flavonoids, saponins, and alkaloids, to manage hyperuricemia (HUA) and its associated complications. Results: Plant's natural compounds have garnered attention for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and uric acid-lowering properties, suggesting their role in alternative and complementary medicine. Phytochemicals have demonstrated promise in mitigating gout symptoms and potentially modifying the disease course by addressing different aspects of hyperuricemia and inflammation. Herbal remedies, with their complex phytochemical profiles, offer a unique advantage by potentially complementing conventional pharmacological treatments. The integration of herbal therapies with standard medications could lead to enhanced therapeutic outcomes through synergistic effects, optimizing disease management, and improving patient quality of life. Conclusions: This review examines the current understanding of the multifaceted etiology of gout, explores the role of phytochemicals in managing hyperuricemia, and discusses the potential benefits of combining herbal remedies with conventional treatments to improve patient care and therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Oncocytic renal neoplasms are a major source of diagnostic challenge in genitourinary pathology; however, they are typically nonaggressive in general, raising the question of whether distinguishing different subtypes, including emerging entities, is necessary. Emerging entities recently described include eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (ESC RCC), low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT), eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT), and papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity (PRNRP). A survey was shared among 65 urologic pathologists using SurveyMonkey.com (Survey Monkey, Santa Clara, CA, USA). De-identified and anonymized respondent data were analyzed. Sixty-three participants completed the survey and contributed to the study. Participants were from Asia (n=21; 35%), North America (n=31; 52%), Europe (n=6; 10%), and Australia (n=2; 3%). Half encounter oncocytic renal neoplasms that are difficult to classify monthly or more frequently. Most (70%) indicated that there is enough evidence to consider ESC RCC as a distinct entity now, whereas there was less certainty for LOT (27%), EVT (29%), and PRNRP (37%). However, when combining the responses for sufficient evidence currently and likely in the future, LOT and EVT yielded>70% and>60% for PRNRP. Most (60%) would not render an outright diagnosis of oncocytoma on needle core biopsy. There was a dichotomy in the routine use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the evaluation of oncocytoma (yes=52%; no=48%). The most utilized IHC markers included keratin 7 and 20, KIT, AMACR, PAX8, CA9, melan A, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)B, and fumarate hydratase (FH). Genetic techniques used included TSC1/TSC2/MTOR (67%) or TFE3 (74%) genes and pathways; however, the majority reported using these very rarely. Only 40% have encountered low-grade oncocytic renal neoplasms that are deficient for FH. Increasing experience with the spectrum of oncocytic renal neoplasms will likely yield further insights into the most appropriate work-up, classification, and clinical management for these entities.

TI  - Sporadic Late-Onset Nemaline Rod Myopathy: An Interesting Case
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
KW  - Monoclonal gammopathy
KW  - nemaline rods
KW  - sporadic late-onset myopathy
AB  - Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy is a rare, acquired, sub-acute, adult-onset myopathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness and nemaline rods in the myofibers. In contrast to its congenital form, the prevalence in adult population is comparatively rare. Herein, we report a case of 60-year-old male who presented with insidious onset proximal muscle weakness with myopathic pattern on electromyography. Histopathological examination showed type 1 and 2 muscle fiber atrophy with minimal chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Modified Gomori trichrome staining revealed granular deposits in the myofibers. Ultrastructure examination showed numerous nemaline rods in the myofibers; hence, the diagnosis of sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy was rendered. Its association with monoclonal protein has been reported in the past. One should be aware of this rare entity as without correct diagnosis, there can be treatment failure and unfavorable outcome.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the safety, efficacy, and visual outcomes of topography-guided (TG) LASIK ablation versus advanced ablation algorithm (AAA) on Zeiss Mel 90 on virgin eyes.Setting:A tertiary care hospital in north India.Design:A retrospective comparative study.Methods:Case sheets of 30 patients who underwent TG LASIK and 45 patients who underwent AAA LASIK between January 2021 and September 2022 were retrieved and reviewed. The TG group included 60 eyes of 30 patients, and the AAA group included age- and sex-matched 90 eyes of 45 patients. Both groups were compared for visual outcomes, residual refraction, and root-mean-square higher-order aberrations (rms HOA) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively and using unpaired t-test and Mann-Whitney U test.Results:The mean preoperative spherical equivalent in the TG group and AAA group was - 3.12 (1.67) and - 3.19 (1.61), respectively. The safety and efficacy of the treatment were 100% in both groups. The postoperative increase in rms HOA was comparable in both groups (P = 0.55). The ablation duration was significantly longer in topo-guided LASIK (P = 0.001).Conclusion:AAA LASIK on MEL 90 is comparable to topography-guided LASIK for the management of low myopia and myopic astigmatism.

AB  - Low vision and blindness are increasing public health issues impacting individuals' quality of life. During clinical low-vision services, vision rehabilitation is crucial for enhancing daily living skills and improving life quality. Low-vision and rehabilitation (LVR) services encompass comprehensive measures that aid visually disabled individuals in restoring function, autonomy, and social participation. Such holistic management requires a multidisciplinary approach, facilitating adaptation to environmental and sociocultural changes. However, the lack of awareness about the principles and practices of LVR services poses a major hindrance to setting up such a special clinic in the eye hospital. This article is about a consensus statement on the guidelines for establishing LVR services focusing on basic requirements, especially in low-resource countries. The present recommendation to set up an LVR clinic was made after group discussions and debates among various experts and stakeholders during the National Workshop on Strengthening Low-Vision and Rehabilitation Services organized at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The event was participated by many ophthalmologists and optometrists coming from across the country. The recommendations required at the tertiary level are outlined under the four headings: Human resources and training: two ophthalmologists, that is, a low vision specialist or a well-experienced in low vision and one who has received one-week orientation and training, one optometrist, one rehabilitation supervisor, and two rehabilitation assistants; Assessment equipment: basic screening and diagnostic; Assistive devices for low vision, including, digital and non-digital; Assistive devices for rehabilitation, and methods for records maintenance. The institution may not follow strictly the present guidelines but will provide an idea on LVR services initiation.

AB  - Drug courts are specialized programs from the courts that aim to offer a chance to individuals with substance-related problems encountering law enforcement to take treatment rather than face incarceration. The aim of this debate is to critically debate the utility, applicability, and feasibility of drug courts in India. This is a theoretical debate based on the existing evidence and considerations of ground realities in the country. There is enough evidence that drug courts are effective in decreasing substance use and decreasing rearrests. These courts have been demonstrated to be cost-effective, and they seemingly decrease the burden on traditional courts. However, it can also potentially lead to discrimination of marginalized groups while at the same time can be seen to be punitive and coercive. Legal provisions exist that may facilitate the development of such programs. Nonetheless, there is a scrupulous consideration of the pros and cons of drug courts and their operational considerations in the local context.

AB  - We describe the hybrid technique of tuck-in Tenon's patch graft (TPG) and tissue adhesive bandaged contact lens (TABCL) for large corneal perforations (>5 mm) with intact surrounding stroma. Management of large corneal perforation is often challenging, and urgent availability of donor cornea might be difficult; Tenon patch alone does not provide tectonic support; hence, this hybrid technique can be used safely in large perforations. This involves freshening the perforation edges, creating a 3600 stromal pocket, harvesting a Tenon's graft 1 mm oversized, tucking into the pocket, and suturing. Then areas of leakage were noted, and only those areas were supplemented with minimal cyanoacrylate glue (CG) at the graft edges. This technique was used in two eyes, one with a large corneal perforation and intact surrounding stroma and the other with 4 mm corneal fistula post healed keratitis with a failed primary TPG alone, and led to epithelialization and a smooth corneal surface at 6 weeks. The advantages include autologous tissue, cost-effective, easily available, minimal post-operative inflammation, vascularization, and surface irregularity.

AB  - Background & objectives: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most prevalent healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). They cause significant morbidity, leading to excess health expenditures and increased length of hospital stay. Despite a high population burden, data on post-discharge SSIs is lacking from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is no existing surveillance system of SSIs in India that covers the post-discharge period. Therefore, we proposed a multicentric analysis to estimate the proportion and identify the risk factors associated with SSIs occurring during hospital stay and after discharge. Methods: SSI Surveillance was conducted in three hospitals in different parts of India according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (30 days-6 months). An indigenous database was developed for data entry and analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test for an association between SSI and potential risk factors. Results: A total of 161 out of 3090 patients acquired SSI, resulting in a 5.2 per cent SSI incidence. Debridement surgery, which was carried out with either an amputation, open reduction internal fixation surgery (ORIF), or closed reduction internal fixation (CRIF) surgery, had the highest SSI rate (54.2%). Clean, polluted wound class and surgeries lasting longer than 120 minutes were substantially linked to an increased risk of SSI. Interpretation & conclusions: Post-discharge surveillance helped with the detection of 66 per cent of SSI cases. Combination surgeries were seen to increase the risk of SSIs in patients.

AB  - Melittin is a major active ingredient of the bee venom produced by honeybees (Apis mellifera) that exerts various biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, and antioxidant. The role of melittin in modulating melanin production by melanocytes is not known. Therefore, the present study aimed to study the effect of melittin on melanin production by human melanocytes along with its antioxidant status. Cultured human melanocytes were treated with melittin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, followed by the study of the cell viability, cell proliferation, and total melanin content. The effects of melittin in combination with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) on the total melanin content, melanocyte dendricity, oxidative stress, and the expression of genes associated with melanogenesis were investigated. An increased melanin content was observed with a low dose of melittin (LDM) (alone or in combination with NB-UVB), and there was a corresponding increase in the tyrosinase activity, melanocyte dendricity, and melanogenesis-associated genes. The present study concluded that LDM alone or LDM (+NB-UVB) can induce melanin synthesis by increasing the tyrosinase activity in melanocytes by limiting the oxidative stress, and this may be therapeutically exploited as an adjuvant therapy for vitiligo.

AB  - We report two cases of established Wilson's disease (WD) presenting with calcific myonecrosis of the pelvic girdle in association with pelvic fractures. Despite initial improvement with chelation, subacute worsening of ambulation in both led to a consideration of neurologic deterioration on chelation therapy. However, evaluation revealed calcific myonecrosis of the hip joint and adjacent muscles as the cause. Both patients improved with intensive rehabilitation. A review of literature indicates that although osseomuscular complications are reported in WD, calcific myonecrosis is a hitherto unknown entity which, if recognized early, may be reversed, preventing disability and unnecessary change in chelation regimens.

AB  - Background: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis (SDSE) is an emerging pathogen causing pharyngitis and post-streptococcal sequelae like S. pyogenes. SDSE was initially considered a commensal microorganism inhabiting the upper respiratory tract and skin. However, recently it has gained attention due to an increase in the invasive SDSE infections, which were reported in the early 20th century. Objectives: The aim of this review is to bring awareness of SDSE in the medical microbiologists because often its ignorance leads to the under reporting or misdiagnosis of SDSE. This also highlights the clinical spectrum of infections and the molecular epidemiology of SDSE. Content: Diagnosis of SDSE in clinical laboratories is challenging, because SDSE can be seen expressing either of the three Lancefield antigen Groups, Group A, C, and G. While MALDI-TOF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Time-of-Flight) is a discriminatory method for identifying SDSE, its high cost can limit its use in many laboratories. Currently, there is limited data on SDSE, and further studies are required to associate the disease outcome and the emm type/ST of SDSE in India and other developing countries. This review highlights the importance of recognizing SDSE as an emerging pathogen, and to screen for SDSE in infections similar to S. pyogenes, especially in regions such as India with a high incidence of Streptococcal diseases.

AB  - Background: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is being increasingly utilized to visualize the brain areas involved in cognitive activity to understand the human brain better. Its portability and easy setup give it an advantage over other functional brain imaging tools. The current study utilizes fNIRS while performing a Stroop test, which is commonly used to assess the impairment of information selection in depression. Aim: To compare cortical activation during the Stroop test in depressed individuals to healthy controls. Methods: This cross-sectional study compared oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) concentration changes in 39 individuals with depression to 40 healthy individuals. The Stroop test was construed in an event-related design with an intertrial interval of 2 seconds with jitter. A continuous wave fNIRS system was used for recording the cortical activity at 17 locations. Analysis of fNIRS data was done using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for estimating general linear model (GLM) coefficients. Further analysis of the mean change of OxyHb concentrations during the 2 seconds after the presentation of congruent and incongruent stimuli was done between the groups using Mann-Whitney U test corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction. Results: While the number of errors and correct responses were similar between the groups, the reaction time for correct responses was more in the depression group in comparison to healthy individuals (t = -2.39, P = 0.01). For both healthy and depressive individuals in incongruent versus congruent task contrast, deactivation was seen in the region between the left middle frontal sulcus and frontopolar area of the brain (t = 0.41 and t = 0.21, respectively, P < 0.05). The depressed group had a higher mean change in OxyHb concentration following incongruent stimuli in comparison to the HCs (mean rank: HC = 32.63, depression = 47.56). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that individuals with depression exhibited prolonged reaction times and distinct activation patterns of the frontal cortex compared to healthy individuals. The observed pattern of brain activation for congruent and incongruent tasks among both healthy and depressed individuals aligns with the findings of the prior studies, emphasizing the utility of fNIRS as a valuable instrument for assessing brain activity.

AB  - Aromatase inhibitors play a critical therapeutic role in treating ER+ breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women. However, their efficacy is often limited by resistance and severe side effects. Identifying new compounds that can disrupt aromatase enzyme function is essential. In this study, structural anomalies in the aromatase enzyme were corrected through energy minimization, and the structure was validated via Ramachandran plot. We screened 170,269 natural compounds from the ASINEX Biodesign library using high-throughput screening algorithms to target the aromatase enzyme. Molecular docking identified three compounds: BDD30170158, BDE33872639, and BDE30177677, all showing stable binding interactions with the aromatase enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns confirmed the conformational stability of these compounds. Although all three compounds exhibited the desired pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism properties, only one compound (BDE33872639) was identified as a non-blocker, demonstrating a reduced risk of adverse cardiac effects. This compound exhibits significant potential as a novel aromatase inhibitor, warranting further experimental research to develop it as a therapeutic option for ER+ breast cancer.

AB  - Inhibiting the immune checkpoint (ICP) PD-1 based on PD-L1 expression status has revolutionized the treatment of various cancers, yet its efficacy in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains limited. The therapeutic response depends upon multiple factors, particularly the conduciveness of the tumor's immune milieu. This study comprehensively evaluated and classified ATC's immune microenvironment (IME) to elucidate the factors behind suboptimal response to anti-PD therapy. Utilizing multiplex-immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, we retrospectively analyzed 26 cases of ATC for expression of ICPs PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA4, TIM3, and Galectin-9 and tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)-the effector cells, the anti-tumor NK cells, the immune-inhibitory myeloid-derived suppressor (MDSC) and regulatory T (Treg) cells, and B lymphocytes. Most ATCs (65%) exhibited PD-L1 positivity, but only 31%, in addition, had abundant CTL (type I IME), a combination associated with a better response to ICP inhibition. Additionally, PD-1 expression levels on CTL were low/absent in most cases-a "target-missing" situation-unfavorable for an adequate therapeutic response. All but one ATC showed nuclear Galectin-9 expression. The documentation of nuclear expression of Galectin-9 akin to benign thyroid is a first, and its role in ATC pathobiology needs further elucidation. In addition to less abundant PD-1 expression on CTL, the presence of MDSC, Treg, and exhausted cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the immune milieu of ATC can contribute to anti-PD resistance. TIM3, the most frequently expressed ICP on CTL, followed by CTLA4, provides alternate therapeutic targets in ATC. The co-expression of multiple immune checkpoints is of great interest for ATC since these data also open the avenue for combination therapies.

AB  - Background: The Delphi consensus study was carried out under the auspices of the International and Asia-Pacific Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Associations (IHPBA-APHPBA) to develop practice guidelines for management of gallbladder cancer (GBC) globally. Method: GBC experts from 17 countries, spanning 6 continents, participated in a hybrid four-round Delphi consensus development process. The methodology involved email, online consultations, and in-person discussions. Sixty eight clinical questions (CQs) covering various domains related to GBC, were administered to the experts. A consensus recommendation was accepted only when endorsed by more than 75% of the participating experts. Results: Out of the sixty experts invited initially to participate in the consensus process 45 (75%) responded to the invitation. The consensus was achieved in 92.6% (63/68) of the CQs. Consensus covers epidemiological aspects of GBC, early, incidental and advanced GBC management, definitions for radical GBC resections, the extent of liver resection, lymph node dissection, and definitions of borderline resectable and locally advanced GBC. Conclusions: This is the first international Delphi consensus on GBC. These recommendations provide uniform terminology and practical clinical guidelines on the current management of GBC. Unresolved contentious issues like borderline resectable/locally advanced GBC need to be addressed by future clinical studies.

AB  - Background Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated immune responses, with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) playing a significant role. NETs are recognized by autoantibodies in SLE patients, exacerbating pathology. Both excessive NET formation and impaired degradation contribute to SLE pathophysiology.Objective To investigate the immunomodulatory effects of Dexamethasone-primed Wharton's jelly (WJ) derived MSCs CM (DW) and IFN-gamma-primed WJ-MSCs-CM (IW) on NETosis and associated protein markers in SLE patients' LPS or ribonucleoprotein immune complexes (RNP ICs) induced neutrophils and in pristane induced lupus (PIL) model. And to elucidate the mechanism involved therein.Methods We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of DW and IW on NETosis in SLE. Utilizing ex vivo and in vivo models, we assessed the impact of preconditioned media on NET formation and associated protein markers neutrophil elastase (NE), citrullinated histone (citH3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS production. We also examined the involvement of key immunomodulatory factors present in DW and IW, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).Results Preconditioned media effectively suppressed NETosis and reduced ROS generation in SLE neutrophils, indicating their immunomodulatory potential. Inhibition studies implicated IDO and PGE2 in mediating this effect. Combined treatment with DW or IW together with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) demonstrated superior efficacy over HCQ alone, a standard SLE medication. In PIL mouse model, DW and IW treatments reduced NETosis, ROS generation, as evidenced by decreased NET-associated protein expression in vital organs.Conclusion Our study highlights the multifaceted impact of IW and DW on NETosis, ROS dynamics, and lupus severity in SLE. These findings underscore the potential of preconditioned media for the development of targeted, personalized approaches for SLE treatment.

AB  - IntroductionTo evaluate the efficacy and side effects of re-circulant hyperthermic intravesical chemotherapy versus conventional treatments for intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).MethodsA randomized 3-arm, parallel group trial was conducted at a single tertiary care centre. 135 patients with low-grade intermediate-risk cancer, having undergone complete resection of bladder tumor were included. Patients were assigned 1:1:1, to receive intra-vesical chemo-hyperthermia (C-HT), mitomycin-C (MMC) or BCG therapy. There was no treatment crossover. Patients were followed up with check cystoscopy every 3 months for histopathological recurrence.ResultsThe three arms were comparable in terms of age, gender, tumor size, number of tumors and clinical stage or grade of tumors. Mean tumor size was 2.58 (+/- 0.88) cm and the mean number of tumors resected was 2.04 (+/- 1.02) (Range 1-5). There was no significant difference between the various groups for tumor recurrence (chi 2 = 1.96, p = 0.375) or time to recurrence (13.6 vs. 10.8 vs. 9.8 months, p = 0.844) though incidence of non-healing necrotic area was higher with C-HT (22.2% vs. 11.1% and 4.8%, chi 2 = 6.093, p = 0.048). Median (IQR) follow up period was 26 (12-52) months. Treatment discontinuation or drug intolerance was significantly higher in BCG arm (p = 0.03).ConclusionsIntravesical C-HT with MMC, conventional MMC and BCG are equally effective and comparable alternatives for intravesical therapy in low-grade intermediate-risk NMIBC. Higher incidence of non-healing resection site with C-HT and higher local symptoms with BCG are a concern.

AB  - The histomorphological features predictive of p16 and human papilloma virus (HPV DNA) positivity in oropharyngeal carcinoma have been a matter of much debate. However, only few studies have been done on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to correlate the histomorphological features with p16 and HPV DNA positivity. Oral squamous cell carcinoma has distinct etiopathogenesis, treatment and prognosis as compared to oropharyngeal carcinomas. A total of 800 oral squamous cell carcinoma biopsy cases were evaluated for features suggestive of HPV infection like basaloid appearance, absence of stromal reaction, nests and lobules of tumor cells with pushing borders, central necrosis, lympho-epithelial morphology, koilocytes, and non-keratinizing or hybrid morphology. Immunohistochemistry was performed for p16 expression (E6H4 clone, CINtec histology, Roche diagnostics). The cases which showed 2+/3+ (from moderate to high intensity) staining with >75 % cells were considered as p16 immunopositive. All the p16 immunopositive cases were subjected to real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for HPV DNA detection to confirm HPV positivity. A total of 139 (17.37 %) OSCC cases were p16 immunopositive and out of these 104 (104/139, 74.8 %) cases showed HPV-DNA PCR positivity. None of the features were found to be predictive on multivariate logistic regression analysis. However, on bivariable analysis, nest/lobule with pushing border was the only histopathological feature which had a significant correlation with p16 immunopositivity (P value = 0.0001) and p16 and HPV DNA copositivity (P value = 0.0001). (Fisher's exact test -two tailed). To conclude-morphology is not really predictive of HPV positivity in OSCC cases. Only one feature- nests and lobule with pushing border is suggestive on bivariable analysis.

AB  - Objectives: Previous studies generally used cross-sectional data and focused on under-five children to assess the risk factors for malnutrition among Indian children. Some recent studies have reported that recovery from or faltering in malnutrition is possible after five years of age, but socio-demographic subgroup disparities have not been explored. This study aims to find the longitudinal disparity in height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) and body-mass-index-for-age Z-scores (BMIAZ scores) across various sub-groups of a cohort from childhood to adolescence. Methods: This study used a cohort from the Young Lives Survey, which followed children aged of 1-15 years between 2002 and 2016-17 in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, India. Mixed-effect models were applied to find the main, time, and interaction effects of HAZ scores and BMIAZ scores. In addition, an extended Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition approach to assess group-based differences over time was used. Results: The cross-sectional prevalence of stunting reduced across all subgroups, while thinness rose during the same period. The interactions of child sex, mother's education, place of residence, wealth index, and antenatal care with time were statistically significant at p <0.05. The gender disparity in adjusted HAZ score decreased from 0.214 units at 1 year to 0.011 units at 15 years, whereas BMIAZ score differential increased from 0.106 to 0.538 units over same timeframe. Disparities in scores were also observed across rural-urban, maternal education, social group, religion, socioeconomic status, maternal age at birth, antenatal care, and premature birth status. Conclusion: The study sheds light on the nuanced dynamics of paediatric growth, emphasising the importance of longitudinal approaches in understanding and addressing the health disparities across different stages of childhood and adolescence.

AB  - BackgroundMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as promising candidates for immune modulation in various diseases that are associated with dysregulated immune responses like Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GVHD). MSCs are pleiotropic and the fate of MSCs following administration is a major determinant of their therapeutic efficacy.MethodsHuman MSCs were derived from bone marrow (BM) and Wharton's Jelly (WJ) and preconditioned through exposure to hypoxia and induction of apoptosis, either sequentially or simultaneously. The immune programming potential of preconditioned MSCs was evaluated by assessing their effects on T cell proliferation, induction of Tregs, programming of effector T-cell towards Th2 phenotype, macrophage polarization in the direct co-culture of MSCs and aGVHD patients-derived PBMNCs. Additionally, efferocytosis of MSCs and relative change in the expression of immunomodulatory soluble factors were examined.ResultsOur study demonstrated that hypoxia preconditioned apoptotic MSCs (BM-MSCs, WJ-MSCs) bear more immune programming ability in a cellular model of acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease (aGVHD). Our findings revealed that WJ-MSCsHYP+APO were superior to BM-MSCsHYP+APO for immune regulation. These induced the differentiation of CD4+T-cell into Tregs, enhanced Th2 effector responses, and simultaneously mitigated Th1- and Th17 responses. Additionally, this approach led to the polarization of M1 macrophages toward an M2 phenotype.ConclusionOur study highlights the potential of WJ-MSCs conditioned with hypoxia and apoptosis concurrently, as a promising therapeutic strategy for aGVHD. It underscores the importance of considering MSC apoptosis in optimizing MSCs-based cellular therapy protocols for enhanced therapeutic efficacy in aGvHD.

AB  - Posterior fossa congenital pial arteriovenous fistulas are rare vascular anomalies associated with high morbidity. These anomalies often present challenges to neurointerventionists due to their complex morphological features. We successfully treated two technically challenging, infratentorial large pial arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) associated with complete flow steal in the basilar artery. The first case involved an 18-year-old male with a posterior fossa single-hole AVF characterized by dilated venous pouches and retrograde venous reflux. After an unsuccessful initial coiling attempt, this patient was treated using a double microcatheter coiling technique, supported by a large balloon for flow control. The second case involved a 9-month-old infant with a complex two-hole posterior fossa pial AVF and a large venous sac. This patient was treated with coil embolization of the fistula and with balloon protection of the vertebrobasilar junction. Both patients recovered without postoperative complications and showed significant improvement on follow-up. These cases provide valuable insights into the management and characteristics of pial arteriovenous fistulas.

AB  - Background: A glaring gender inequality persists in global neurosurgery, influenced by various factors, including the notion that female neurosurgeons have lower academic output. This study aims to compare the research output of female and male neurosurgeons at the leading academic institutions in India. Methods: The pertinent details regarding female neurosurgeons were collected from the Neurological Society of India (NSI) and Women In Neurosurgery (India) database. The institutes with at least five neurosurgery faculty recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI) were included in the study. Various bibliometric parameters of male and female faculty at these academic centres were collected and compared using PubMed and Web of Science databases. Results: Among the 2643 neurosurgeons in NSI, 113 were females (4.27%). Out of 156 faculty members across eighteen academic institutions, only seven (4.7%) were female, with eleven institutions lacking female faculty. Female academic neurosurgeons had slightly higher h-index (9.57 vs. 9.56), citation per publication (8.82 vs. 8.54), and original article percentage (47.5 vs. 46.5) compared to males. They also had more citations per year (34.01 vs. 33.17), while males had more total publications (51.19 vs. 46.71) and citations (565.22 vs. 533.57), but these differences weren't statistically significant. Only 4.1% (327/7955) of neurosurgery research was contributed by females. Female neurosurgeons authored articles received 3735 citations (4.2%) out of 87,953 total citations. Conclusion: Female academic neurosurgeons in India exhibit comparable or superior academic output compared to their male counterparts, suggesting gender equality or even superiority in certain aspects of academic performance.

AB  - CLINICAL QUESTION In adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis), or psoriasis taking biologic drugs, does proactive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) improve outcomes as compared with standard care? CONTEXT AND CURRENT PRACTICE Standard care for immune mediated inflammatory diseases includes prescribing biologic drugs at pre-determined doses. Dosing may be adjusted reactively, for example with increased disease activity. In proactive TDM, serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies are measured irrespective of disease activity, and the drug dosing is adjusted to achieve target serum drug levels, usually within pre-specified therapeutic ranges. The role of proactive TDM in clinical practice remains unclear, with conflicting guideline recommendations and emerging evidence from randomised controlled trials. THE EVIDENCE Linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis which identified 10 trials including 2383 participants. Inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, and psoriasis were grouped together as best current research evidence on proactive TDM did not suggest heterogeneity of effects on outcomes of interest. Proactive TDM of intravenous infliximab during maintenance treatment may increase the proportion of patients who experience sustained disease control or sustained remission without considerable additional harm. For adalimumab, it remains unclear if proactive TDM during maintenance treatment has an effect on sustained disease control or sustained remission. At induction (start) of treatment, proactive TDM of intravenous infliximab may have little or no effect on achieving remission. No eligible trial evidence was available for proactive TDM of adalimumab at induction (start) of treatment. No eligible trial evidence was available for proactive TDM of other biologic drugs in maintenance or at induction (start) of treatment. RECOMMENDATIONS The guideline panel issued the following recommendations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, or psoriasis: 1. A weak recommendation in favour of proactive TDM for intravenous infliximab during maintenance treatment 2. A weak recommendation against proactive TDM for adalimumab and other biologic drugs during maintenance treatment 3. A weak recommendation against proactive TDM for intravenous infliximab, adalimumab, and other biologic drugs during induction (start) of treatment. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS When considering proactive TDM, clinicians and patients should engage in shared decision making to ensure patients make choices that reflect their values and preferences. The availability of laboratory assays to implement proactive TDM should also be considered. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED An international panel including patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis which identified 10 trials including 2383 participants. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by significant loss of central cholinergic neurons. This progressive deterioration leads to cognitive dysfunction and impaired motor activity, culminating in the brain cell's death at the later stages of the disease. The approved drugs for AD are limited to providing symptomatic relief for an initial period due to the multifaceted etiology of the disease. Several studies have demonstrated that rivastigmine (RIV) is a selectively potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase and devoid of antioxidant, A beta, and tau protein aggregation inhibition and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, to address these issues associated with RIV, novel rivastigmine-based molecules were rationally designed, synthesized, and evaluated in various in-vitro and in-vivo AD models. In in-vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition studies revealed that 3q & 6e as promising leads (AChE, IC50 1.72 f 0.15, 0.91 f 0.016 mu M, BChE, IC50 6.69 f 0.28 mu M, 1.19 f 0.026 mu M, for 3q & 6e , respectively). The computational studies (molecular docking and dynamics) further corroborated the in-vitro studies. Further, 3q and 6e were found to be potent antioxidants in the DPPH assay (IC50 16.15 f 1.05 & 15.17 f 0.07 mu M, for 3q & 6e , respectively). Interestingly, 3q, and 6e could effectively inhibit self-induced full-length tau and A beta 1-42 aggregation. Treatment with 3q & 6e inhibited microglial activation by attenuating ROS release and mitochondrial damage. Further, 3q & 6e also suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kappa B expression levels in microglial cells and halted the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human microglial cells. Finally, 3q & 6e were found to be efficacious in reversing the scopolamine-induced memory impairment in the Morris water maze test. The expression of various neuroprotection markers, such as BDNF and TRKB, was significantly overexpressed compared to the disease control group.

AB  - Introduction Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) estimation offers a non-invasive method to potentially diagnose, monitor, and prognosticate patients with malignancy. This prospective study aimed to assess plasma cfDNA levels in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) to determine its role in predicting disease status in the post-operative setting.Materials and methods This was a single-center prospective observational study conducted at a public medical research university and hospital in New Delhi, India. 254 patients with DTC in the post-operative setting were included: 95 in Group 1 (active structural disease) and 159 in Group 2 (disease-free). Blood samples were collected for plasma separation and cfDNA extraction. The cfDNA concentrations were quantified and compared across various disease states.Results Median values of plasma cfDNA (ng/mu L) in groups 1 and 2 were found to be 0.272 (IQR: 0.137-0.442) and 0.222 (IQR: 0.123-0.398), respectively with no significant difference (p=0.122). cfDNA levels were significantly higher in patients in the age group >= 55 years (p=0.016). However, the cfDNA levels were not significantly associated with any of the other known prognostic markers of DTC.Discussion Based on the results of this study, plasma cfDNA levels did not significantly predict disease status in patients with DTC in the post-operative setting.

KW  - SGLT2i
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizations from heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. However, SGLT2i therapy's potential effects on the risks of dementia and Parkinson's disease are not well established, with conficting results based on observational studies. Hence, we sought to evaluate the association between SGLT2i and the risk of dementia and Parkinson's disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, and Clinicaltrial.gov for relevant randomized controlled trials from inception until March 2024 without any language restrictions. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials with 74,442 patients (40,784 in the SGLT2i group and 33,658 in the control group) were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients in SGLT2i and control was 65.3 and 65.2 years, respectively. Pooled analysis showed that there is no significant association between SGLT2i use and the risk of dementia (OR 1.37; 95% CI, 0.70-2.69; P = .36), dementia Alzheimer's type (OR 1.99; 95% CI, 0.59-6.71; P = . 27), vascular dementia (OR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-1.85; P = . 24), and Parkinson's disease (OR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.25-1.61; P = . 33) when compared with the control groups. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that there is no significant association between SGLT2i use and the risk of dementia, its subtypes, and Parkinson's disease when compared with the control groups.

AB  - Ovarian reserve tests are valuable for evaluation of female fertility, and to formulate appropriate treatment strategies for infertile women. Antral follicle count (AFC) and Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) are most reliable markers of ovarian reserve which are related inversely to age. There are many factors that affect ovarian reserve like race, ethnicity, fertility status, BMI or any chronic illness. We conducted this study to find outage specific nomograms for AMH and AFC among fertile and Infertile Indian women, to find out any variations between fertile and Infertile ovarian reserves at various centiles, to define the age cut-off of decline in AMH and AFC among fertile and Infertile Indian women and to find correlation between AMH and AFC. It was a prospective cross sectional single centre study conducted at a tertiary hospital of northern India from March 2017 to February 2022. Fertile healthy women were recruited from family planning clinic, oocyte donors and subfertile women from Gynaecology and ART clinic. AMH was done using ELISA, Beckmann Coulter Gen II assay and AFC was done using TVS with high frequency probe (9.0 MHZ, Voluson,S-6, GE Healthcare, USA) by trained personnel. R Statistical Programming Language was used for statistical modelling and visualization. Age-specific AFC centile chart and AMH centile chart were generated using GAMLSS (Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape) package available in R Statistical Computing Language. A Non-linear decline in ovarian reserves among fertile, while linear among infertile women was seen. Centiles defined for both groups with a faster decline in infertile women. Age cut off for decline in AMH and AFC in fertile women approximately 31 years using ROC analysis and Age cut off for decline in AMH and AFC in infertile women is approximately 34 years. There seems to be a good correlation between AFC and AMH. We need to counsel women to consider child bearing well before ovarian reserves decline (31-34 years).

AB  - Keratoconus is a progressive eye disorder primarily affecting individuals in adolescence and early adulthood. The ectatic changes in the cornea cause thinning and cone-like steepening leading to irregular astigmatism and reduced vision. Keratoconus is a complex disorder with a multifaceted aetiology and pathogenesis, including genetic, environmental, biomechanical and cellular factors. Environmental factors, such as eye rubbing, UV light exposure and contact lens wearing, are associated with disease progression. On the cellular level, a complex interplay of hormonal changes, alterations in enzymatic activity that modify extracellular membrane stiffness, and changes in biochemical and biomechanical signalling pathways disrupt collagen cross-linking within the stroma, contributing to structural integrity loss and distortion of normal corneal anatomy. Clinically, keratoconus is diagnosed through clinical examination and corneal imaging. Advanced imaging platforms have improved the detection of keratoconus, facilitating early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Treatment strategies for keratoconus are tailored to disease severity and progression. In early stages, vision correction with glasses or soft contact lenses may suffice. As the condition advances, rigid gas-permeable contact lenses or scleral lenses are prescribed. Corneal cross-linking has emerged as a pivotal treatment aimed at halting the progression of corneal ectasia. In patients with keratoconus with scarring or contact lens intolerance, surgical interventions are performed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a major public health concern. We aimed to assess the definitions, etiologic spectrum, organ failure (OF), and outcomes of ACLF globally. METHODS: Three databases were searched for studies on ACLF from 1990 until September 2022. Information regarding definitions, acute precipitants, underlying chronic liver disease (CLD), OF, and mortality were extracted. Meta-analyses were performed for pooled prevalence rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) using random-effects model for each definition of ACLF. RESULTS: Of the 11,451 studies identified, 114 articles (142 cohorts encompassing 210,239 patients) met the eligibility criteria. Most studies (53.2%) used the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) definition, followed by Asia-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) (33.3%). Systemic infection was the major acute precipitant, and alcohol use was the major cause of CLD in EASL-defined studies, whereas alcohol was both the major acute precipitant and cause of CLD in APASL-defined studies. Liver failure was the major OF in APASL-based studies, whereas renal failure was predominant in EASL-based studies. Thirty-day mortality varied across definitions: APASL: 38.9%, 95% CI, 31.2%-46.9%; EASL: 47.9%, 95% CI, 42.2%-53.5%; and NACSELD: 52.2%, 95% CI, 51.9%-52.5%. Diagnostic overlap between definitions ranged from 7.7% to 80.2%. Meta-regression suggested that the World Health Organization region influenced 30-day mortality in studies using EASL definition. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity in the definition of ACLF proposed by different expert societies and regional preferences in its use result in differences in clinical phenotype and outcomes. A uniform definition would enhance the comparability and interpretation of global data.

AB  - Importance The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) varies across the globe. Indian studies on PCOS are limited by poor design, small sizes, regional representations, and varying methods. Objectives To estimate the nationwide prevalence of PCOS in India, examine the phenotypic spectrum, and assess the magnitude of comorbidities associated with PCOS. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study recruited 9824 women aged 18 to 40 years from November 1, 2018, to July 31, 2022, across 5 zones of the country. A prevalidated questionnaire dichotomized women into screen-positive and screen-negative groups. Relevant clinical, hormonal, and sonographic assessments categorized women as either women with criteria-based PCOS (ie, National Institutes of Health [NIH] 1990 criteria, Rotterdam 2003 criteria, or Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society [AE-PCOS] criteria), women with partial phenotypes (hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, or polycystic morphology labeled as pre-PCOS), or healthy women, in addition to quantitating various comorbidities. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence and phenotypes of PCOS among women of reproductive age and the burden of comorbidities associated with PCOS. Results A total of 8993 women (mean [SD] age, 29.5 [6.2] years) were enrolled in this study; 196 women were already diagnosed with PCOS, 2251 were categorized as screen positive, and 6546 were categorized as screen negative. The mean (SD) age of screen-positive women (28.1 [6.4] years) was lower than that of screen-negative women (29.7 [6.1] years) (P < .001), and the mean (SD) age at menarche was higher in the former group (13.2 [1.3] vs 13.1 [1.2] years; P < .001). The national prevalence of PCOS was 7.2% (95% CI, 4.8%-10.8%) by NIH 1990 criteria, 19.6% (95% CI, 12.7%-29.2%) by Rotterdam 2003 criteria, and 13.6% (95% CI, 8.4%-21.6%) by AE-PCOS criteria. Overall, PCOS phenotypes C (501 [40.8%]) and D (301 [24.6%]) were the most common, and 492 women (pre-PCOS subgroup) had oligomenorrhea (n = 75), hyperandrogenism (n = 257), or polycystic ovarian morphology (n = 160) only. Among women with PCOS (n = 1224), obesity was present in 529 (43.2%), dyslipidemia in 1126 (91.9%), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in 403 (32.9%), metabolic syndrome in 305 (24.9%), impaired glucose tolerance in 111 (9.1%), diabetes in 41 (3.3%), and hypertension in 101 (8.3%). The pre-PCOS subgroup (n = 492) displayed similar metabolic aberrations (dyslipidemia: 390 [79.3%]; metabolic syndrome: 78 [15.9%]; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: 163 [33.1%]; impaired glucose tolerance: 62 [12.6%]; diabetes: 7 [1.4%]; and hypertension: 26 [5.3%]). Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of reproductive-age women recruited across India, the prevalence of PCOS was high, with phenotype C being predominant. Most of these women had metabolic abnormalities. These findings are crucial for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies, potentially integrating PCOS management into national health programs.

AB  - Metastatic breast-cancer is one of the major causes of death, due to remaining dormant cancer cells for several years. Rac1 is upregulated with cancer and stay elevated throughout the metastatic pathway to regulate the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. This work developed peptide FGDWS as novel inhibitor targeting Rac1-Tiam1 binding site by in-silico as it was found to be the strongest interacting peptide with Rac1 at the Tiam binding site. The binding and inhibition study of peptide with Rac1 was performed by Surface plasmon resonance and MTT assay, respectively. Cell-migration, apoptotic assay and western-blot in breast-cancer cells were performed with FGDWS and in combination with Doxorubicin (Dox). Tumor regression experiment was done with mice model. The strong binding of FGDWS with Rac1 and reduction of cell-viability were observed in breast-cancer cell-lines. The cell-migration was suppressed, and higher regression were obtained in synergy group. The apoptotic effect of FGDWS alone and with Dox were detected by annexin-V via activating caspase3/7. The tumor size was reduced by the treatment of FGDWS and more reduced in combinatorial effect. The combinatorial effect of FGDWS-Dox may enhance the treatment efficacy without side-effects.

AB  - Host-directed therapies (HDT) via modulation of specific host responses like inflammation can limit mycobacterial infection. HDTs could be included in current TB therapy as an adjunct to increase bacterial clearance and limit tissue damage to control spread. Individually, Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) and human beta defensin2 (hBD-2) are promising therapies for tuberculosis (TB). They can directly target the TB bacilli and enhance cell- mediated immune responses, which is limiting with conventional drugs. Therefore, our study investigated the combined application of MIP and hBD-2 to evaluate their efficacy in clearing infections caused by Mycobacterium smegmatis ( M.smeg ) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) (both avirulent; H37Ra and virulent strain; H37Rv) in THP-1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). A strong pro-inflammatory response was observed against the combination of MIP and hBD-2 which also correlated with a significant reduction in the bacterial load. This combination further showed protection against M.tb by enhancing pyroptosis in the infected cells. The study suggests the combined use of these potent immunomodulators, which could be employed as an effective mode of therapy as adjuvants against mycobacterial infections after validation in a suitable animal model.

AB  - Since the 1940s, generalized cytotoxic therapy has been a valuable tool in cancer treatment. Over the years, there's been a significant increase in developing potential cytotoxic drugs. However, little progress has been made in enhancing patients' quality of life. The therapeutic index is limited due to the drug's poor solubility and lack of selectivity. Various carriers have been explored for drug delivery to enhance efficacy. Yet, there's a gap for a versatile delivery system that can adjust to specific drug and application requirements. Here, a multifaceted drug delivery platform based on a genetically engineered nature-inspired polymer, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) is introduced. This technology enables the customization of the polymeric vehicle's physicochemical characteristics to suit the needs of a specific drug and application. The review highlights ELP's advantages in cancer targeting, such as site-specificity, controlled release, biocompatibility, and extended plasma circulation. For the first time, ELP-based drug delivery into passive and active targeting for better comprehension of its adaptability is classified. Moreover, numerous opportunities for loading different types of drugs onto the polymer are outlined. Finally, the polymer's efficacy in delivery across multiple cancer types, underscoring the wide spectrum of ELP-based cancer drug delivery is precisely described.
   ELP technology represents a versatile platform with unique delivery attributes to facilitate selective delivery encompassing a range of potent therapeutics across multiple cancer models. image

AB  - Delta and Omicron variants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are remarkably contagious, and have been recognized as variants of concern (VOC). The acquisition of spontaneous substitutions or insertion-deletion mutations (indels) in the spike protein-encoding gene substantially increases the binding affinity of the receptor binding domain (RBD)-hACE2 complex and upsurges the transmission of both variants. In this study, we analyzed thousands of genome sequences from 30 distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on the unique nucleic acid signatures in the spike gene specific to the Delta and Omicron variants. Using these variant-specific sequences, we synthesized a range of oligonucleotides and optimized a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay capable of accurately identifying and differentiating between the Delta and Omicron variants. Building on this mPCR assay, we developed a dipstick format by incorporating a tag linker sequence at the 5 ' end of the forward primer and adding biotin to the 3 ' end of the oligonucleotides, enhancing the assay's usability and accessibility. Streptavidin-coated latex beads and the dipstick imprinted with a probe for the tag linker sequence in the test strips were used for the detection assay. Our dipstick-based assay, developed as a rapid point-of-care test for identifying and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 variants has the potential to be used in low-resource settings and scaled up to the population level.

AB  - Background: The medical management of DT comprises tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), hormonal agents, anti-inflammatory drugs with the recently approved gamma secretase inhibitor nirogacestat being the current standard of care. Real-world data on evolving treatment landscapes of DT remains scarce. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with DT registered between 1995 and 2020 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and Tata Medical Center, Kolkata. Baseline characteristics were analyzed in form of median values and interquartile range. Categorical and continuous variables were compared by chi square and independent samples T- tests respectively. Anxiety, depression and QoL were prospectively measured among 30 patients using Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scales respectively between 2022 to 2023. Results: 200 patients were included with a male-predominant (n=111, 55.5%) population and median age 26.5 (2.5-75) years. Extremity (n=100, 50%) and abdomen (n=65, 32.5%) were commonest primary sites and median of 2 (1-4) lines of treatment were received. First-line included surgery (n=116, 58%), systemic therapy (n=67, 33.5%), radiotherapy (10, n=5%) and active surveillance (n=7, 3.5%). First-line systemic agents included tamoxifen (n=55, 27.5%), imatinib (n=7, 3.5%), sorafenib (n=1, 0.5%) and chemotherapy (n=4, 2%). 2019 onward, 3% and 63% underwent active surveillance and surgery respectively. Best radiological response obtained with tamoxifen was stable disease (SD) (n=76, 59%) and partial response (PR) (n=31, 24.2%). Best radiological response obtained with sorafenib was PR (n=17, 60.7%) and SD (n=9, 32.1%). Thirty patients underwent HADS and FACT-G scale assessment. Mean HADS-Anxiety subscale score was 3.6 (+/-3.9 SD) and HADS-Depression sub-scale score was 2.6 (+/-3.5 SD) with clinically significant anxiety and depression in 2 (6.7%) patients each. The overall mean FACT-G score was 87.5 (+/-12.6 SD) and lower mean physical well-being (p=0.006) and emotional well-being (0.017) scores were significantly associated with higher HADS-anxiety (>/=8) scores. Conclusions: Assessment of anxiety, depression and QoL are paramount to gauge the psychological impact of DT. This study gives an overview of clinical and management profile of patients with DT in India, with limitations of selection bias, heterogeneous population and small sample size for QoL assessment.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of information on the long-term course and outcomes of bipolar disorder (BD) patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Aim: To compare the demographic and clinical profile of BD patients with and without SAD. Methodology: Data from 773 BD patients with an illness duration of at least 10 years were collected from 14 tertiary care centers. SAD was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Participants with and without SAD were compared for demographic and clinical features. Results: The prevalence of SAD was 9.44 %. BD patients with SAD spent more time in episodes (p < 0.001), had a higher number of lifetime episodes (p < 0.001), and more episodes per year of illness in the lifetime. They also spent more time in depressive episodes (p < 0.001), had higher depressive (p < 0.001) and manic (p = 0.01) affective morbidity indices, shorter durations of current remission (p < 0.001), higher levels of residual depressive and manic symptoms, higher levels of disability, and received more medications (p < 0.001). Patients with SAD were also more likely to have BD-II (p = 0.01), rapid cycling (p < 0.001), a first-lifetime episode of depressive polarity (p = 0.01), a history of breakthrough episodes (p < 0.001), self-discontinuation of pharmacoprophylaxis, and relapses due to poor medication adherence. They were more often receiving lithium, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. However, a lower proportion of those with SAD had been hospitalized, received electroconvulsive therapy, or were receiving valproate. Conclusion: Patients with SAD, in general, have more severe BD, and differ from those without SAD on many clinical parameters.

AB  - To compare the difference between primary homoeopathic and conventional paediatric care in treating acute illnesses in children in their first 24 months of life. One hundred eight Indian singleton newborns delivered at 37 to 42 weeks gestation were randomised at birth (1:1) to receive either homoeopathic or conventional primary care for any acute illness over the study period. In the homoeopathic group, conventional medical treatment was added when medically indicated. Clinicians and parents were unblinded. Children in the homoeopathic group experienced significantly fewer sick days than those in the conventional group (RR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.24-0.58; p < 0.001), with correspondingly fewer sickness episodes (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32-0.87; p = .013), as well as fewer respiratory illnesses over the 24-month period. They were taller (F (1, 97) = 8.92, p = .004, partial eta squared = 0.84) but not heavier than their conventionally treated counterparts. They required fewer antibiotics, and their treatment cost was lower. Conclusion: Homoeopathy, using conventional medicine as a safety backdrop, was more effective than conventional treatment in preventing sick days, sickness episodes, and respiratory illnesses in the first 24 months of life. It necessitated fewer antibiotics and its overall cost was lower. This study supports homoeopathy, using conventional medicine as a safety backdrop, as a safe and cost-effective primary care modality during the first 2 years of life. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registry-India (2018/09/015641). https://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/login.php What is Known: center dot Due to their holistic nature, many Complementary and Alternative Medical (CAM) modalities are not readily amenable to assessment by head-to-head RCT for a given Indication. center dot We propose a pragmatic, RCT comparing homoeopathic with conventional medicine as a system. What is New: center dot Homoeopathic was apparently superior to conventional primary care in preventing sick days, sickness episodes, and respiratory illness episodes and was significantly associated with growth in height but not weight and required fewer antibiotics in children from birth to 24 months of age.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough national food guides are designed, ostensibly, to translate scientific evidence with respect to food, dietary patterns, and health, their development has increasingly become a corporate/political process as well as scientific one; often with corporate/political influences overriding science. Our aim was to construct an unbiased, sustainable, evidence-informed Universal Food Guide to serve as a template for countries to develop their unique guides, thereby, provide a valid resource for health professionals, health authorities, and the public.MethodsTo address our aim, we conducted an integrative review of multiple evidence-informed sources (e.g., established databases, evidence syntheses, scholarly treatises, and policy documents) related to four areas: 1. Food guides' utility and conflicts of interest; 2. The evidence-based healthiest diet; 3. Constituents of the Universal Food Guide template; and 4. Implications for population health; regulation/governance; environment/climate/planetary health; and ethics.ResultsThe eating pattern that is healthiest for humans (i.e., most natural, and associated with maximal health across the life cycle; reduced non-communicable disease (NCD) risk; and minimal end-of-life illness) is whole food, low fat, plant-based, especially vegan, with the absence of ultra-processed food. Disparities in national food guide recommendations can be explained by factors other than science, specifically, corporate/political interests reflected in heavily government-subsidized, animal-sourced products; and trends toward dominance of daily consumption of processed/ultra-processed foods. Both trends have well-documented adverse consequences, i.e., NCDs and endangered environmental/planetary health. Commitment to an evidence-informed plant-based eating pattern, particularly vegan, will reduce risks/manifestations of NCDs; inform healthy food and nutrition policy regulation/governance; support sustainable environment/climate and planetary health; and is ethical with respect to 'best' evidence-based practice, and human and animal welfare.ConclusionThe Universal Food Guide that serves as a template for national food guides is both urgent and timely given the well-documented health-harming influences that corporate stakeholders/politicians and advisory committees with conflicts of interest, exert on national food guides. Such influence contributes to the largely-preventable NCDs and environmental issues. Policy makers, health professionals, and the public need unbiased, scientific evidence as informed by the Universal Food Guide, to inform their recommendations and choices.

AB  - The WNT/(3-catenin is among one of the most extensively studied cellular signaling pathways involved in the initiation and progression of several deadly cancers. It is now understood that the WNT/(3-catenin signaling, during tumor progression operates in a very complex fashion beyond the earlier assumed simple WNT 'On' or 'Off' mode as it recruits numerous WNT ligands, receptors, transcriptional factors and also cross-talks with other signaling molecules including the noncanonical WNT regulators. WNT/(3-catenin signaling molecules are often mutated in different cancers which makes them very challenging to inhibit and sometimes ranks them among the undruggable targets. Furthermore, due to the evolutionary conservation of this pathway, inhibiting WNT/ (3-catenin has caused significant toxicity in normal cells. These challenges are reflected in clinical trial data, where the use of WNT/(3-catenin inhibitors as standalone treatments remains limited. In this review, we have highlighted the crucial functional associations of diverse WNT/(3-catenin signaling regulators with cancer progression and the phenotypic switching of tumor cells. Next, we have shed light on the roles of WNT/(3-catenin signaling in drug resistance, clonal evolution, tumor heterogeneity, and immune evasion. The present review also focuses on various classes of routine and novel WNT/(3-catenin therapeutic regimes while addressing the challenges associated with targeting the regulators of this complex pathway. In the light of multiple case studies on WNT/(3-catenin inhibitors, we also highlighted the challenges and opportunities for future clinical trial strategies involving these treatments. Additionally, we have proposed strategies for future WNT/(3-catenin-based drug discovery trials, emphasizing the potential of combination therapies and AI/ML-driven prediction approaches. Overall, here we showcased the opportunities, possibilities, and potentialities of WNT/(3-catenin signaling modulatory therapeutic regimes as promising precision cancer medicines for the future.

AB  - Background Bilateral ocular surface disease resulting from Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and chemical injuries are visually debilitating and difficult to treat. Ocular surface reconstruction by various means has been reported with variable results. This study addresses an unmet need for a prospective clinical trial comparing the outcomes of transplanting autologous oral and conjunctival epithelial cell constructs on human amniotic membrane by ex vivo tissue engineering. Methods A prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial was prospectively applied for registration, with the clinical trial registry of India (CTRI), with the approval of the Institute Ethics Committee number IEC/NP-99/11.04.2014 and CTRI No. REF/2018/10/021791, the study also registered with the WHO-recognized trial registry, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registration reference number 45780. The study was conducted to compare clinical outcomes of two different tissue-engineered cell grafts, Cultivated Oral Mucosal Epithelial Transplantation (COMET) and Conjunctival Cultivated Epithelial Transplantation (CCET) for ocular surface reconstruction in patients with bilateral ocular surface disease due to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or chemical injuries. Fifty patients were enrolled and randomized to either the COMET or CCET group. A uniform pre-op and post-op protocol using standard medications was followed for all patients Parameters assessed at baseline, day 1, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively included patient comfort, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ocular surface status and corneal clarity. The efficacy was measured in terms of improvement of vision, reduction in vascularization, symblepharon and corneal clarity. Results In the study, 50 patients (50 eyes; mean ages of 29 +/- 15.86 years and 26.36 +/- 10.85 years, respectively; range, 12-65 years) were enrolled, with 25 patients each in the COMET and CCET groups. Out of them, 36% were female and 64% were male; the causes were Steven Johnson syndrome (48), and chemical injury (2). Mean pre-operative BCVA was log MAR 1.73 +/- 0.57 for COMET and 1.99 +/- 0.33 for the CCET group. Pre-operatively all 50 enrolled patients had opaque corneas pre-operatively, symblepharon that extended to the cornea categorised as grade 3 and corneal vascularization that went beyond the pupil's boundary into the central zone encluaching on the visual axis. The minimal follow-up time was six months. Following surgery postoperatively, the BCVA considerably improved in the COMET group by 1.51 +/- 0.58 compared to the CCET group by 1.91 +/- 0.33 at 3 months. BCVA at 6 months was 1.73 +/- 0.56 in the COMET group and 1.99 +/- 0.31 in the CCET group, which is not statistically significant and comparable to the BCVA before surgery. The corneal clarity was significantly improved in COMET group 25 eye (100%) at 2 month, 3month and 19 eye (76%), 6eye (24%) at 6 months when compared to CCET group 15 eye improved (60%), 9 eyes (36%) not improved and one eye with opaque cornea (4%) at 2 months. 22 eye (88%) had not improved, 2 eye (8%) opaque cornea and 1 eye (4%) improved at 3 months. At 6 months 21 eye (84%) were not improved, 4 eye (16%) eye became opaqued at 6 months. Compared to preoperative conditions, both groups had improved corneal clarity significantly (p > 0.005).
   Of the 50 patients with grade 3 symblepharon extended to the cornea, were completely resolved 19 (76%) in COMET group when compared to CCET group 22 eye (88%) not improved. Similarly, 19 eye (76%) had a improvement in corneal vascularization when compared to the CCET group not improved 25 eye (100%) at 6months. No adverse event was observed in any of either group during the follow up periods. Conclusion Both cell types are effective to restore the ocular surface integrity in bilateral ocular surface disease. Whereas COMET is safe and efficacious in terms of improvement of clinical parameters including, BCVA, corneal clarity, reduction in vascularization and preventing the recurrence of symblepharon postoperatively 3months and 6 months. In addition, the CCET group maintained the stability of the ocular surface and had improvement in corneal clarity and a decrease in vascularization at 3 months compared to their pre-operative characteristics.

AB  - Background Heart failure affects almost 64 million people, with more than half of it constituting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) are in the first line for HFrEF, but no head-to-head trials are available. Moreover, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) has been demonstrated as a promising prognostic marker, specifically for HFrEF, but has not been explored much. Methods This pragmatic randomised controlled trial recruits 100 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction <40%) of New York Heart Association (NYHA) II-III and allocates them in a 1:1 ratio to the dapagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan groups. The primary objective is to assess the difference in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide serum levels at the end of 16 weeks. The secondary efficacy objectives are to assess GDF-15, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-overall summary score and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients will be assessed at baseline, fourth week and 16th week after randomisation. As health technology assessment practices widely differ in countries, cost assessment is a vital factor to consider. The cost needed to treat one cardiovascular event is also compared between both groups. The occurrence of safety events will also be evaluated at each follow-up point. Conclusion This pragmatic study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HFrEF in real-world settings. The study aims to provide clinicians with data to make informed decisions regarding the preferred drug class. Additionally, examining the impact of ARNI and SGLT2i on GDF-15 levels could offer better insights into prognosis among patients with HFrEF. Ethics and dissemination This study involves human participants and was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee at AlIMS Jodhpur with reference number AIIMS/IEC/2023/5842 approved this study. Participants gave informed consent to participate in the study before taking part. The research findings will be disseminated via closed group discussions at the site of study, scientific conferences, peer-reviewed published manuscripts, and social media.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical threat to global public health, necessitating the development of novel strategies. AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve to resist antimicrobial drugs, making infections difficult to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. Over 70% of infection-causing microorganisms are estimated to be resistant to one or several antimicrobial drugs. AMR mechanisms include efflux pumps, target modifications (e.g., mutations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), ribosomal subunits, or DNA gyrase), drug hydrolysis by enzymes (e.g., beta-lactamase), and membrane alterations that reduce the antibiotic's binding affinity and entry. Microbes also resist antimicrobials through peptidoglycan precursor modification, ribosomal subunit methylation, and alterations in metabolic enzymes. Rapid development of new strategies is essential to curb the spread of AMR and microbial infections. Nanomedicines, with their small size and unique physicochemical properties, offer a promising solution by overcoming drug resistance mechanisms such as reduced drug uptake, increased efflux, biofilm formation, and intracellular bacterial persistence. They enhance the therapeutic efficacy of antimicrobial agents, reduce toxicity, and tackle microbial resistance effectively. Various nanomaterials, including polymeric-based, lipid-based, metal nanoparticles, carbohydrate-derived, nucleic acid-based, and hydrogels, provide efficient solutions for AMR. This review addresses the epidemiology of microbial resistance, outlines key resistance mechanisms, and explores how nanomedicines overcome these barriers. In conclusion, nanomaterials represent a versatile and powerful approach to combating the current antimicrobial crisis.

AB  - Introduction Kuwait has a large expatriate community who experience both restricted access to public health services and lower income than Kuwaiti citizens. Given these conditions, we examined differences in characteristics and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) between Kuwaitis and expatriates. Methods Clinical and laboratory data for adult CKD Stages 3-5 not on dialysis (CKD 3-5 ND) patients with native kidneys attending nephrology clinics in all Ministry of Health hospitals collected from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. Cohort was then divided into Kuwaiti patients and expatriates patients for comparison. Results We collected data from 2,610 patients (eGFR: 30.8 ml/min/1.73m(2); age: 62.6 years; males: 56.7%; Kuwaitis: 62.1%). Kuwaitis were older (63.94 vs. 60.3 years, p < 0.001), with lower mean eGFR (30.4 vs. 31.5 ml/min/1.73m(2), p = 0.052) than non-Kuwaitis, however, Kuwaitis had lower mean blood pressure (137.2/76.5 vs. 139.1/78.9 mmHg, p = 0.006), lower HbA1c in diabetics (7.59 vs. 7.82%, p = 0.010), and better lipid profile despite higher body mass indexes (29.6 vs. 28.9 kg/m(2), p = 0.002). Both groups had high diabetes mellitus and hypertension rates. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were used in only 22.6% and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) in only 46.2%. Conclusion CKD 3-5 ND is caused by diabetes mellitus in 56.6% of cases, and the majority have hypertension. In our study, non-Kuwaitis had higher eGFR; however, restricted public healthcare access and lower income can lead to an unhealthy diet and suboptimal care, which may cause higher blood pressure, higher HbA1c, and a higher dyslipidemia rate. RAASi and SGLT2i utilization must increase to combat CKD, and antihypertensive selection must improve.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer has the highest mortality rate among all cancers affecting females worldwide. Several new effective therapeutic strategies are being developed to minimize the number of breast cancer-related deaths and improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients. However, resistance to conventional therapies in breast cancer patients remains a challenge which could be due to several reasons, including changes in the tumor microenvironment. Attention is being diverted towards minimizing the resistance, toxicity, and improving the affordability of therapeutics for better breast cancer management. This includes personalized medicine, target-specific drug delivery systems, combinational therapies and artificial intelligence based screening and disease prediction. Nowadays, researchers and clinicians are also exploring the use of combinatorial immunotherapies in breast cancer patients, which have shown encouraging results in terms of improved survival outcomes. This study attempts to analyze the role of combinational immunotherapies in breast cancer patients, and offer insights into their effectiveness in breast cancer management. Methodology: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for which we selected the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) focused on completed Phase I/II/III/IV clinical trials investigating combination immunotherapies for breast cancer. The analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of combination therapies in comparison to mono-therapies, focusing on overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: We observed that, combination immunotherapies significantly (P<0.05) improved OS as compared to single-drug therapies in the Phase I with overall Risk ratio (RR) of 16.17 (CI 2.23,117.50), Phase II with an overall RR of 19.19 (CI 11.76,31.30) and for phase III overall RR 22.27 (CI 13.60,36.37). In the case of PFS, it was significant with RR: 12.35 (CI 2.14, 71.26) in Phase I RR 6.10 (CI 4.31, 8.64) in phase II, RR 8.95 (CI 6.09, 13.16) in phase III and RR 14.82 (CI 6.49, 33.82) in Phase IV of clinical trials. Conclusion: The observed improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival suggest that combination immunotherapies could serve as a better approach to breast cancer management.

AB  - Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN characterized by reciprocal translocation in the ABL1 and BCR region of chromosomes 9 and 22 respectively. Progression to the blast phase in chronic myeloid leukemia results in a poorer prognosis. It can be of either myeloid, lymphoid or a mixed lineage. Progression to the promyelocytic blast phase is very rare, and there are no evidence-based guidelines for its management. Thrombosis in CML is not well defined. Thrombosis can be seen in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with venous thrombosis (VTE) being more common than arterial thrombosis. Ischemic stroke as the presenting feature of blast phase progression in CML is extremely rare. We report a case of CML who presented to us with acute ischemic stroke and subsequently was diagnosed as CML transformed to the promyelocytic blast phase. She was successfully treated with dasatinib along with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO).

AB  - Astroblastoma, a unique entity of glial tumor, predominantly occur in young women with distinctive MN1 rearrangement, Given its limited documentation in existing literature, we report eight cases of astroblastoma, detailing their clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics along with molecular analysis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of our neuropathology archive database spanning the past 8 years. We included all cases that underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), surgical resection, histopathological examination, molecular testing, and follow-up. Histopathological examination involving immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) was carried out for all cases. All tumors were found to be located in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemisphere). The median age of the group was 35.1 years, with a female- to-male ratio of 1.6:1. The most common clinical presentation was headache. Morphologically, all tumors exhibited astroblastic features with pseudorosettes and perivascular hyalinization. Immunohistochemistry consistently revealed positivity for EMA and variable immunoreactivity for GFAP, OLIG2, and D2-40. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis conducted for all cases showed MN1 rearrangement in 7 cases. The mean follow-up period was 45 months (ranging from 12 to 105 months). Radiotherapy was administered for high-grade and recurrent astroblastomas. All patients are currently alive and in good health. Astroblastomas are uncommon central nervous system (CNS) tumors with characteristics morphology and molecular signatures. They typically carry a favorable prognosis. High level suspicion is required for their diagnosis and molecular analysis is must to distinguish them from other morphological mimics.

AB  - Introduction: Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy causing developmental defects and progressive retinal dystrophy, whereas choroidal coloboma is a developmental defect causing structural deficiency in the posterior retina. Both are rarely reported together. Methods: Here, we describe the phenotype and genotype of three unrelated patients with co-occurrence of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome and chorioretinal coloboma and review the pertinent literature. Results: We describe three unrelated patients, with variable clinical features of Bardet Biedl syndrome. None had family history of BBS or coloboma. Each carried biallelic variants in BBS1, BBS9 and TTC8 gene, respectively. Two had unilateral chorioretinal coloboma, while one had bilateral chorioretinal coloboma. Discussion: Although there may be other explanatory factors yet to be revealed, our data suggests that chorioretinal coloboma may be associated with BBS. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, an intercellular communicator for development of the eye, is dependent on the primary cilia and plays a crucial role in the closure of the optic fissure. Both disorders therefore involve disruption of primary cilia function which may explain their association.

AB  - Objectives: Assessment of diabetes-specific knowledge among children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their caregivers using a validated diabetes knowledge test (DKT) and to determine the factors associated with DKT score. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, New Delhi (India). Children 5-18 years with T1D and caregivers were evaluated using a validated DKT tool to assess knowledge in basic and advance domains. The factors associated with DKT scores were studied. Results: 110 T1D children with mean (SD) age 12.2 (3.3) years and duration 5.3 (2.7) years were assessed. The mean (SD) composite DKT score (%) was 58.0 (11.1) while in basic and advance domains were 66.4 (9.5) and 50.4(1.5), respectively. Maternal education (>= graduate), socio-economic strata (>= upper middle), annual per capita income (>Rs 50,000/700 USD), urban setting and HbA1c<8.5 % were significantly associated with higher odds of DKT score>50 %. HbA1c<8.5 % and urban setting were significant predictors of the DKT score on multivariate logistic regression analysis (p<0.001). Conclusions: DKT can identify individual challenges in specific (basic or advance) domains related to diabetes self-management skills. Higher maternal education significantly impacted achieving a high DKT score and improved glycemic control.

AB  - Introduction: This prospective study evaluated the effect of immediate functional loading (IFL) of a full-coverage prosthesis on the clinical and radiographic outcome of nonsurgical endodontic therapy (NSET) performed on mandibular molar teeth with pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Methods: In 20 subjects, standardized 2-visit NSET was performed in bilateral mandibular first molar teeth (split-mouth model) with a diagnosis of pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis exhibiting a radiographic periapical index (PAI) score >= 3. In each subject, the nonvital bilateral mandibular first molar teeth were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: the IFL group or the functional loading after a time interval of 6 months group. Provisional full-coverage prostheses were provided within 7 days after the completion of endodontic therapy. The cases were followed up clinically and radiographically at 6 and 12 months. Radiographs were assessed for periapical healing based on PAI scores, which were dichotomized as healed (PAI score <= 2) or nonhealed (PAI score >= 3). The data were compared using chi-square and Fisher exact tests. Results: A recall rate of 100% was achieved at the end of 12 months. All teeth in the IFL group and the functional loading after a time interval of 6 months group were clinically asymptomatic. According to an intergroup comparison between the proportion of teeth healed and nonhealed (radiographic), there was a significant difference (P < .05). Conclusions: IFL of a full-coverage prosthesis in endodontically treated mandibular molar teeth with pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis delayed periapical healing.

AB  - Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most common urological abnormalities in infants and children. The association of VUR, urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal parenchymal damage is well established. The most serious complications of VUR-associated reflux nephropathy are hypertension and proteinuria with chronic kidney disease. Over the past two decades, our understanding of the natural history of VUR has improved, which has helped to identify patients at increased risk of both VUR and VUR-associated renal injury. The main goals in the treatment of paediatric patients with VUR are the prevention of recurrent UTIs and minimizing the risk of renal scarring and long-term renal impairment. Currently, there are four options for managing primary VUR in infants and children: surveillance or intermittent treatment of UTIs with management of bladder and bowel dysfunction; continuous antibiotic prophylaxis; endoscopic subureteral injection of tissue-augmenting substances; and ureteral reimplantation via open, laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery. Current debates regarding key aspects of management include when to perform diagnostic imaging and how to best identify the paediatric patients that will benefit from continuous antibiotic prophylaxis or surgical intervention, including endoscopic injection therapy and minimally invasive ureteral reimplantation. Evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence, have the potential to assist clinicians in the decision-making process and in the individualization of diagnostic imaging and treatment of infants and children with VUR in the future.
   Primary vesicoureteral reflux is the most common urological abnormality in infants and children and its association with urinary tract infection and renal parenchymal damage is well established. In this Primer, Puri and colleagues review the current classifications, epidemiology, mechanisms, diagnosis and management of this disorder and highlight open research questions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feasibility and safety of endoscopic endonasal approaches have become well established, and focus has now shifted to minimizing nasal morbidity. To this end, several modifications in the nasal stage have been described that focus primarily on preservation of nasal mucosa on right side of the nasal cavity. However, nasal mucosal preservation on the left side of the nasal cavity has largely been ignored. This technical note describes a modified technique that can eliminate mucosal damage in the left nasal cavity. METHODS: A transseptal approach is used on the left, and an endonasal approach is used on the right side. A hemitransfixion incision is used to raise the left submucosal tunnel. The mucosa of the tunnel lies laterally in apposition with the lateral nasal wall, thereby protecting it from injury by repeated passage of instruments. When the tunnel mucosa is pushed back medially, the left nasal cavity appears absolutely normal without any evidence of mucosal damage. RESULTS: Combined endonasal and transseptal technique for the nasal stage was performed in 51 patients with sellar/suprasellar lesions. Nonfunctional pituitary adenomas were the most common pathology (macroadenomas: n = 14; giant adenomas: n = 10) followed by functional adenomas (acromegaly: n = 10; prolactinomas: n = 3; Cushing disease: n = 1), craniopharyngiomas (n n = 6), clival tumors (n n = 5), and tuberculum sellae meningiomas (n n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of endonasal and transseptal approaches uses the advantages of both endoscopic and microscopic approaches sans the disadvantage of restricted space seen in microscopic approaches. It makes the binostril approach least disruptive to the left nasal mucosa and thus can reduce overall morbidity of endoscopic endonasal approaches.

AB  - Background: Various types of needles are available to perform endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). A relatively new needle for EBUS-TBNA, the Acquire Fine Needle Biopsy (FNB) device, has recently become available. Methods: Consecutive subjects with lymphadenopathy >1 cm undergoing EBUS-TBNA were randomized to the Acquire 22-G EBUS-FNB needle and the standard 22-G EBUS-TBNA needle groups. Results: A total of 86 subjects were randomized (43 in each group). The diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA was similar between the two groups: (36/43) 83.7% in the 22-G EBUS-FNB group and (34/43) 79.1% in the standard 22-G EBUS group (p = 0.58). The sampling adequacy, stations sampled, number of stations sampled, number of needle passes, and mean duration of the procedure between the two groups were also similar. Visible tissue clot core was obtained in a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the 22-G EBUS-FNB group (93.0% vs 46.5%, p < 0.001). Visibly bloody samples were more frequent in the 22-G EBUS-FNB group (74.4% vs 51.2%, p = 0.03). There was no difference in the complication rates between the two groups (p = 0.15). Conclusion: We did not observe a difference in the diagnostic yield of the Acquire 22-G EBUS-FNB needle compared with the standard 22-G EBUS needle.

AB  - Asthma and related respiratory symptoms are growing in India and urban cities are experiencing increasing traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) levels. Our study investigates the association between TRAP and respiratory symptoms, and unplanned visits made to general practitioner/ emergency department/hospital admission in children and adolescents; we also aimed to understand whether low greenspaces surrounding the schools impacted this association. Trucks passing near the child's residences were used as a surrogate marker for measuring exposure to heavy TRAP. Exposures to school neighbourhood characteristics such as distance from major roads, a major source of TRAP, and industries were studied and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to measure greenspaces at 100 m and 200 m. Results showed no relationship between TRAP exposures and the odds of unplanned visits to general practitioners/emergency department /hospital admissions in young children; however, adolescents experienced increased risk. TRAP-related characteristics and greenspaces (within 200 m) strongly

AB  - Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogenous group of inherited disorder, and its progression not only affects the retina but also the primary visual cortex. This manifests imbalances in the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Here, we investigated if changes in cortical functioning is linked to alterations in GABAergic population of neurons and its two important subsets, somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) neuron in rd1 model of retinal degeneration (RD). We demonstrate marked decrease in the proportion of SST neurons in different layers of cortex whereas PV neurons were less affected. Moreover, we found reduced expression of glutamatergic thalamic afferents (VGLUT2) due to lack of visual activity. These results suggest PV neurons are likely recruited by the cortical circuitry to increase the inhibitory drive and compensate the disrupted inhibition-excitation balance. However, reduced SST expression perhaps results in weakening of stimulus selectivity. Delineating their functional role during RD will provide insights for acquisition of high-resolution vision thereby improving current state of vision restoration.

TI  - Intravenous Thrombolysis in Patients With Cervical Artery Dissection: A Secondary Analysis of the STOP-CAD Study
T2  - NEUROLOGY
KW  - ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE
KW  - SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT
KW  - ALTEPLASE
AB  - Objectives
   Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) accounts for 25% of ischemic strokes in young adults. This study evaluated the benefits and harms of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients presenting with spontaneous CeAD and acute ischemic stroke symptoms.
   Methods
   This analysis used data from the retrospective STOP-CAD study and included patients with spontaneous CeAD who presented within 1 day of acute ischemic stroke symptoms. Patients were dichotomized into those who received IVT and those managed without IVT. We assessed the association between IVT and 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2) and the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH, defined as ICH causing new or worsening neurologic symptoms within 72 hours after CeAD diagnosis).
   Results
   This study included 1,653 patients from the original STOP-CAD cohort of 4,023. The median age was 49 years, and 35.1% were women; 512 (31.0%) received IVT. IVT was associated with 90-day functional independence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.67, 95% CI 1.23-2.28, p = 0.001), but not with symptomatic ICH (aOR = 1.52, 95% CI 0.79-2.92, p = 0.215).
   Discussion
   In patients with spontaneous CeAD and suspected ischemic stroke, IVT improved functional outcomes, without increasing symptomatic ICH risk. These findings support current guideline recommendations to consider thrombolysis for otherwise eligible patients with CeAD.
   Classification of Evidence
   This study provides Class III evidence that IVT significantly increases the probability of 90-day functional independence in patients with CeAD.

AB  - Background: The ACR in 2021 and the EULAR in 2022 published recommendations for management of ANCAassociated vasculitis. Given the differences in the demographic, clinical profiles, and the socio-economic realities between various countries, there is a need for development of guidelines for the management of AAV for less economically developed regions of the world. Methods: These guidelines were made following the GRADE methodology. After the systematic literature review, recommendations were formulated and opinion was sought from the 18-member expert panel consisting of 17 clinicians and one patient representative. Results: Twenty recommendations were formulated. We recommend ANCA testing by ELISA over IIF. For remission induction in active GPA or MPA, we recommend use of intravenous cyclophosphamide or rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids. We conditionally recommend the use of reduced dose glucocorticoids over standard dose glucocorticoids for remission induction in active GPA or MPA. For remission maintenance in patients with GPA or MPA, we recommend the use of rituximab over azathioprine for at least 48 months from diagnosis. We conditionally recommend the use of plasma exchange in patients with severe renal vasculitis. For remission induction in EGPA, we recommend use of cyclophosphamide or rituximab in severe disease and mepolizumab or azathioprine or methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil in non-severe disease. Conclusions: These are the first ever Indian recommendations for the management of AAV. Despite our effort to formulate these recommendations based on high quality evidence, some recommendations were still based on low quality evidence but with high rate of agreement among expert panel members.

AB  - This letter critically evaluates the effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on inflammatory bowel disease, particularly focusing on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as discussed in Liang et al's recent review. While the review provides significant insights, it relies heavily on cross-sectional and observational studies, which limits the ability to draw causal inferences. The heterogeneous study populations and inconsistent definitions of long-term PPI use further complicate the findings. This letter also highlights the need for rigorous control of confounding factors and considers the potential publication bias in the existing literature. The implications of these issues are discussed in the context of both CD and UC, and future research directions are proposed to address these shortcomings.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesImplementation of national haemovigilance programmes has significantly improved donor and recipient safety. Recently, India completed a decade of successful implementation of its national haemovigilance programmes. The national programme is still enrolling more blood centres. This study aimed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of Haemovigilance Programme of India (HvPI), thereby providing valuable insights for future initiatives.Materials and MethodsThe National Coordinating Centre (NCC) conducted a multi-centre, cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey among the reporting blood centres (January to April 2022). The survey consisted of three sections with a total of 27 questions focusing on the demographics of the participant blood centre as well as the impact on the recipient and donor haemovigilance. The survey was sent to 733 blood centres regularly reporting to the donor and recipient HvPI through Donor and Hemovigil Software.ResultsTotal 296 responses were received (response rate of 40.4%) with maximum participation of private non-teaching hospital-based blood centres (33.8%). After their involvement in recipient HvPI, 85.7% of the respondents reported changes in their blood centre's work procedures, with the maximum improvement seen in the documentation of transfusion reactions (92.7%). Out of the 278 respondents who participated in donor HvPI, 89.9% (250) found that their blood centre's policies or work process changed as a result of their involvement in the programme.ConclusionIn conclusion, our haemovigilance programme facilitates national collaboration for learning and sharing experiences, leading to improved policies and practices in reducing adverse reactions for both recipients and donors.

AB  - BackgroundHigh body-mass index (BMI) is an established risk factor for late-life cognitive impairment and dementia, but most evidence comes from high-income contexts. Existing evidence from cross-sectional data in low- and middle-income settings is inconsistent, and many studies do not adequately address potential sources of bias.MethodsWe used data from Wave 1 of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) (analytic N = 56,753) to estimate the association between BMI categories and cognitive functioning among older adults aged 45 + years using survey-weighted linear regression models stratified by gender and controlling for potential confounders including demographic factors, socio-economic status (SES) characteristics, and health-related behaviors. To probe potential sources of bias, including residual confounding and reverse causation, we used weighting and trimming methods, sample restriction, and explored effect modification.ResultsIn fully adjusted models, relative to normal BMI underweight BMI was associated with lower cognitive scores (Men: -0.16 SD difference, 95% CI -0.18, -0.13; Women: -0.12 SD, -0.15, -0.10). Overweight and obesity were associated with higher cognitive scores in both men (overweight: 0.09; 0.07, 0.12, obese: 0.10; 0.05, 0.15) and women (overweight: 0.09; 0.07-0.12, obese: 0.12; 0.08-0.15). Estimates were similar after weighting and trimming but were attenuated after excluding those with low cognition (>= 1 SD below the mean relative to those with similar demographic characteristics). Positive associations between overweight and obese BMI and cognition were attenuated or null in those living in urban settings and those with higher levels of educational attainment.ConclusionsUnderweight BMI is a risk factor for poor cognitive outcomes in adults 45 years and older and may be indicative of poor nutritional status and life-course disadvantage in India. In tandem with existing literature, supplemental analyses and effect modification results indicate that unmeasured confounding and reverse causation may explain the observed positive associations between overweight and obese BMI and cognitive functioning from cross-sectional studies in low- and middle-income settings. Future data with longitudinal follow-up will be helpful to further disentangle biases.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are evolutionarily conserved dynamic organelles that play an important role in cellular physiology. Growing evidence suggests that LD biogenesis occurs at discrete endoplasmic reticulum (ER) subdomains demarcated by the lipodystrophy protein, Seipin, lack of which impairs adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms of how these domains are selected is not completely known. These ER sites undergo ordered assembly of proteins and lipids to initiate LD biogenesis and facilitate establishment of ER-LD contact sites, a prerequisite for proper growth and maturation of droplets. LDs retain both physical and functional association with the ER throughout their lifecycle to facilitate bi-directional communication, such as exchange of proteins and lipids between the two organelles at these ER-LD contact sites. In recent years several molecular tethers have been identified that bridge ER and LDs together including few proteins that are found exclusively at these ER-LD contact interface. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding the role of factors that ensure functionality of ER-LD contact site machinery for LD homeostasis.

AB  - Wound healing, an intricate biological process, comprises orderly phases of simple biological processed including hemostasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and ECM remodeling. The regulation of the shift in these phases can be influenced by systemic or environmental conditions. Any untimely transitions between these phases can lead to chronic wounds and scarring, imposing a significant socio-economic burden on patients. Current treatment modalities are largely supportive in nature and primarily involve the prevention of infection and controlling inflammation. This often results in delayed healing and wound complications. Recent strides in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering offer innovative and patient-specific solutions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secretome have gained specific prominence in this regard. Additionally, technologies like tissue nano-transfection enable in situ gene editing, a need-specific approach without the requirement of complex laboratory procedures. Innovating approaches like 3D bioprinting and ECM bioscaffolds also hold the potential to address wounds at the molecular and cellular levels. These regenerative approaches target common healing obstacles, such as hyper-inflammation thereby promoting self-recovery through crucial signaling pathway stimulation. The rationale of this review is to examine the benefits and limitations of both current and emerging technologies in wound care and to offer insights into potential advancements in the field. The shift towards such patient-centric therapies reflects a paradigmatic change in wound care strategies.Graphical abstractPromising Modes of Treating Skin Wounds

AB  - Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) constitute a morphological continuum with certain overlapping histopathological features and MUC 4 immunopositivity. SEF is characterized by EWSR1 gene rearrangement, is relatively more aggressive and shows a limited response to chemotherapy. Lately, a subset of tumors with morphological features of SEF, but lacking MUC4 immunostaining and EWSR1 gene rearrangement have been observed. We report the first case of YAP1::KMT2A-positive sarcoma from the Indian subcontinent along with a review of similar tumors reported previously. A case of 31-year-old male presented with a 3 cm painful lump in the right suboccipital region. Histopathological examination of the excised specimen revealed a cellular tumor composed of atypical spindle and epithelioid cells, exhibiting moderate nuclear pleomorphism, arranged in cords, embedded in a dense collagenous/hyalinized stroma. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for cyclin D1 and negative for MUC4, desmin, myogenin, beta-catenin, STAT6, myoD1, SMA, and S100P. By fluorescence in-situ hybridization, EWSR1 gene rearrangement was negative. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed YAP1exon5::KMT2Aexon4 fusion. Given a positive resection margin, he underwent a revision surgery involving wide local excision of the lesion including the outer table of the occipital bone followed by image-guided radiation therapy. Over 2 years of his follow-up, the patient is alive with no evidence of recurrence. Thus, YAP1::KMT2A positive sarcomas have distinct molecular and overlapping histopathological features with SEF, with relatively less aggressive disease course. Documentation of additional similar tumors with long-term follow-up is required.

AB  - Anti-PD immunotherapy is currently under investigation in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). Tumor cell surface PD-L1 expression is considered predictive of therapeutic response. Although papillary thyroid carcinoma has been widely studied for PD-L1 expression, there are limited data on ATC. In this retrospective multi-institutional study involving 9 centers across Asia, 179 ATCs were assessed for PD-L1 expression using the SP263 (Ventana) clone. A tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 1% was required to consider a case PD-L1-positive. PD-L1 expression was compared with the histological patterns, the type of specimen (small or large), tumor molecular profile (BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutation status), and patient outcome. PD-L1 expression in any co-existent differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) was evaluated separately and compared with ATC. Most ATCs (73.2%) were PD-L1-positive. The median TPS among positive cases was 36% (IQR 11% to 75%; range 1% to 99%). A high expression (TPS >= 50%) was noted in 30.7%. PD-L1-negative cases were more likely to be small specimens (P=0.01). A negative result on small samples, hence, may not preclude expression elsewhere. ATCs having epithelioid and pleomorphic histological patterns were more likely to be PD-L1-positive with higher TPS than sarcomatoid (P<0.01). DTCs were more frequently negative and had lower TPS than ATC (P<0.01). Such PD-L1 conversion from DTC-negative to ATC-positive was documented in 71% of cases with co-existent DTC. BRAF V600E, but not TERT promoter mutations, correlated significantly with PD-L1-positivity rate (P=0.039), reinforcing the potential of combining anti-PD and anti-BRAF V600E drugs. PD-L1 expression, however, did not impact the patient outcome.

AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a high-risk and low-volume life support with increasing clinical study. However, heterogenous outcome definitions impede data assimilation into evidence to guide practice. The Academic Research Consortium (ARC), an international collaborative forum committed to facilitating the creation of stakeholder-driven consensus nomenclature and outcomes for clinical trials of medical devices, supported the ECMO Core Elements Needed for Trials Regulation And quality of Life (ECMO-CENTRAL) ARC. The ECMO-CENTRAL ARC was assembled to develop definitions of paediatric ECMO adverse events for use in clinical trials and regulatory device evaluation. An initial candidate list of ECMO adverse events derived from the mechanical circulatory support ARC was supplemented with a review of ECMO-relevant adverse event definitions collated from literature published between Jan 1, 1988, and Feb 20, 2023. Distinct teams of international topic experts drafted separate adverse event definitions that were harmonised to existing literature when appropriate. Draft definitions were revised for paediatric ECMO relevance with input from patients, families, and an international expert panel of trialists, clinicians, statisticians, biomedical engineers, device developers, and regulatory agencies. ECMO-CENTRAL ARC was revised and disseminated across research societies and professional organisations. Up to three rounds of internet-based anonymous surveys were planned as a modified Delphi process. The expert panel defined 13 adverse event definitions: neurological, bleeding, device malfunction, acute kidney injury, haemolysis, infection, vascular access-associated injury, non-CNS thrombosis, hepatic dysfunction, right heart failure, left ventricular overload, lactic acidaemia, and hypoxaemia. Definitional structure varied. Among 165 expert panel members, 114 were eligible to vote and 111 voted. Consensus was achieved for all proposed definitions. Agreement ranged from 82% to 95%. ECMO-CENTRAL ARC paired rigorous development with methodical stakeholder involvement and dissemination to define paediatric ECMO adverse events. These definitions will facilitate new research and the assimilation of data across clinical trials and ECMO device evaluation in children.

AB  - Noninvasive sample sources of exosomes, such as exhaled breath and sputum, which are in close proximity to the tumor microenvironment and may contain biomarkers indicative of lung cancer, are far more permissive than invasive sample sources for biomarker screening. Standardized exosome extraction and characterization approaches for low-volume noninvasive samples are critically needed. We isolated and characterized exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and sputum exosomes from healthy nonsmokers (n = 30), tobacco smokers (n = 30), and lung cancer patients (n = 40) and correlated the findings with invasive sample sources. EBC samples were collected by using commercially available R-Tubes. To collect sputum samples the participants were directed to take deep breaths, hold their breath, and cough in a collection container. Dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the exosome morphology. Protein isolation, western blotting, exosome quantification via EXOCET, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were performed for molecular characterization. Exosomes were successfully isolated from EBC and sputum samples, and their yields were adequate and sufficiently pure for subsequent downstream processing and characterization. The exosomes were confirmed based on their size, shape, and surface marker expression. Remarkably, cancer exosomes were the largest in size not only in the plasma subgroups, but also in the EBC (p < 0.05) and sputum (p = 0.0036) subgroups, according to our findings. A significant difference in exosome concentrations were observed between the control sub-groups (p < 0.05). Our research confirmed that exosomes can be extracted from noninvasive sources, such as EBC and sputum, to investigate lung cancer diagnostic biomarkers for research, clinical, and early detection in smokers.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore and compare the utility of baseline F-18-PSMA-1007 and Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/computed tomography (CT) derived volumetric parameters in initial risk stratification and prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis.
   Methods: Forty treatment-naive, biopsy-proven intermediate-/high-risk PCa patients were prospectively recruited. Each patient underwent PET/CT with Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-PSMA-1007 (within 2 weeks). The maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) of primary tumor, prostate PSMA-tumor volume (PSMA-TVp), and prostate total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMAp) were measured.
   Results: PSMA-TVp and TL-PSMAp (with both radiotracers) mostly exhibited moderate-to-strong correlation with Gleason score, serum prostate-specific antigen level and clinical tumor stage (Spearman rho = 0.361-0.783, P-values <= 0.022). Primary tumor SUVmax values were similar across initial risk categories. PSMA-TVp and TL-PSMAp, however, were significantly higher in high-risk PCa compared to intermediate-risk PCa (P-values <= 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that F-PSMA-TVp, Ga-PSMA-TVp, F-TL-PSMAp, and Ga-TL-PSMAp (optimal cutoff values of 20.9, 23.4, 142.5, and 144.8, respectively) could effectively differentiate high-risk from intermediate-risk PCa [area under the ROC curve (AUCs) 0.859-0.898, P-values <0.001] with high sensitivity (similar to 68.8-75%) and excellent specificity (100%). PSMA-TVp and TL-PSMAp (with both radiotracers) could predict presence of regional and extraregional nodal metastasis (AUCs 0.703-0.801, P-values <= 0.03) with moderate sensitivity (similar to 47.8-70.6%) and excellent specificity (similar to 82.6-94.1%).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that baseline PSMA-PET primary tumor volumetric parameters provide a noninvasive, objective, and accurate index for initial risk stratification and can predict presence of regional and extraregional nodal metastasis in PCa patients. Larger studies are warranted to evaluate their incremental role over conventional parameters. Copyright (c) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND:The ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) demonstrated greater health status benefits with an initial invasive strategy, as compared with a conservative one, for patients with chronic coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia. Whether these benefits vary globally is important to understand to support global adoption of the results. METHODS:We analyzed participants' disease-specific health status using the validated 7-item Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ: >5-point differences are clinically important) at baseline and over 1-year follow-up across 37 countries in 6 international regions. The average effect of initial invasive versus conservative strategies on 1-year SAQ scores was estimated using Bayesian proportional odds regression and compared across regions. RESULTS:Considerable regional variation in baseline health status was observed among 4617 participants (mean age=64.4 +/- 9.5 years, 24% women), with the mean SAQ summary scores of 67.4 +/- 19.5 in Eastern Europe participants (17% of the total), 71.4 +/- 15.4 in Asia-Pacific (18%), 74.9 +/- 16.7 in Central and South America (10%), 75.5 +/- 19.5 in Western Europe (26%), and 78.6 +/- 19.2 in North America (28%). One-year improvements in SAQ scores were greater in regions with lower baseline scores with initial invasive management (17.7 +/- 20.9 in Eastern Europe and 11.4 +/- 19.3 in North America), but similar in the conservative arm. Adjusting for baseline SAQ scores, similar health status benefits of an initial invasive strategy on 1-year SAQ scores were observed (ranging from 2.38 points [95% CI, 0.04-4.50] in North America to 4.66 points [95% CI, 2.46-6.94] in Eastern Europe), with an 88.3% probability that the difference in benefit across regions was <5 points. CONCLUSIONS:In patients with chronic coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia, initial invasive management was associated with a consistent health status benefit across regions, with modest regional variability, supporting the international generalizability of health status benefits from invasive management of chronic coronary disease.

AB  - Eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) is an aggressive skin cancer characterized by a heightened risk of recurrence and metastasis. While surgical excision is the primary treatment, unraveling the molecular intricacies of SGC is imperative for advancing targeted therapeutic interventions and enhancing patient outcomes. This comprehensive review delves into the molecular landscape of eyelid SGC, emphasizing key genetic alterations, signaling pathways, epigenetic modifications, and potential therapeutic targets. Significant findings include aberrations in critical signaling pathways (beta-catenin, lymphoid enhancer binding factor, hedgehog, epidermal growth factor receptor, P53, and P21WAF1) associated with SGC progression and poor prognosis. Notably, eyelid SGC manifests a distinctive mutational profile, lacking ultraviolet signature mutations in tumor protein 53 (TP53), indicating alternative mutagenic mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing identifies actionable mutations in genes such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), facilitating the emergence of personalized medicine approaches. Molecular chaperones, specifically X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and BAG3, emerge as pivotal players in promoting tumor survival and proliferation. The review underscores the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, where regulators like E-cadherin, vimentin, and ZEB2 contribute to SGC aggressiveness. Epigenetic modifications, encompassing DNA methylation and microRNA dysregulation, further elucidate the molecular landscape. This review consolidates a comprehensive understanding of the molecular drivers of eyelid SGC, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets and providing a foundation for future investigations in diagnostic, prognostic, and personalized treatment strategies for this formidable malignancy.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to characterize the profile of myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies (MSAs/MAAs) in an Indian cohort of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) patients and correlate them with clinical features and outcomes.MethodsForty-three children diagnosed with JDM were enrolled for this observational study. Clinical details (presentation, course, and outcome) were noted in a predesigned proforma. Serum samples were tested for 16 MSAs/MAAs by line immunoassay. MSAs/MAAs were correlated with clinical features and outcome (defined as a complete clinical response [>= 6 months' disease inactivity on medication] or complete remission [>= 6 months' inactivity off all drugs]).ResultsThirty-five subjects (81.4%) had at least 1 MSA/MAA detected. The most common antibodies were anti-NXP2 (n = 13, 30.2%), anti-TIF1 gamma (n = 10, 23.2%), and anti-MDA-5 (n = 8, 18.6%). No patient had anti-Ku, anti-Pm Scl-100, anti-PL-12, anti-EJ, anti-OJ, or anti-Ro52. Thirty-two patients (74.4%) attained a complete clinical response over a median follow-up duration of 14 months, among which 6 (13.9%) achieved complete remission over a median follow-up duration of 30 months. Anti-TIF1 gamma was associated with younger age at onset (<= 3 years) (odds ratio [OR], 6.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-34.12; p = 0.034) and disease flares after attaining complete response (OR, 10.18; 95% CI, 1.64-70.93; p = 0.013). Patients with anti-NXP2 had higher odds of severe muscular weakness (OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 0.95-14.59; p = 0.058) and truncal weakness (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 0.97-15.64; p = 0.056). One child with anti-MDA-5 positivity had interstitial lung disease. We found no association between the MSA/MAA profile and the achievement of complete clinical response or remission.ConclusionsMSAs/MAAs were identified in 81% of children with JDM in our study, which is higher than most other studies. The most frequently observed antibodies displayed a pattern consistent with other studies. Anti-TIF1 gamma was associated with a younger age at onset and disease flares even after attaining a complete clinical response. Anti-NXP2 had higher odds of severe muscular weakness. These observations suggest consistency in certain phenotypic associations observed across geographic boundaries.

AB  - Introduction: Benign fibro-osseous lesions have long been an area of diagnostic difficulty due to overlapping of histological and radiological features. Differentiating between these lesions is crucial because of their unique pathogenesis and biological behavior. Ossifying fibroma (OF) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) are the most prevalent lesions. However, not all FD or OF exhibit the typical radiological and histopathological features. In such situations, molecular-level investigations could be essential for precise identification and differentiation. Aim: To evaluate the screening of GNAS and CDC73 mutations in blood and formalin fixed tumor tissues (FFTT) of FD and OF cases. Material and methods: Six blood samples (three cases of FD and JOF each) and thirteen FFTT (six cases of FD and seven cases of JOF) were included in the study. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using salting out method followed by whole exome sequencing. Multiple efforts were made to extract DNA from tumor tissues using various protocols, but no measurable yield was obtained. Results: DNA derived from blood samples gave successful DNA library preparation and subsequent exome sequencing data generation. We report a pathogenic GNAS mutation (exon8:c.G602A:p.R201H) associated with McCune-Albright syndrome and a novel benign mutation identified in a case of FD (GNAS(NM_000516.7): c.257+687_257+688del) whereas none of the subjects of JOF displayed GNAS and/or CDC73 mutation. Conclusion: Study observed mutations in GNAS gene in blood samples from FD cases. However, a limitation is that only DNA extracted from blood underwent successful exome sequencing. Potential reason for low-quality DNA extraction from tissue may be attributed to prior fixation procedures conducted on bone specimens.

AB  - Objective was to assess the precision and reproducibility of spatial penalty-based intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) methods in comparison to the conventional bi-exponential (BE) model-based IVIM methods. IVIM-MRI (11 b-values; 0-800 s/mm(2)) of forty patients (N = 40; Age = 17.7 +/- 5.9 years; Male:Female = 30:10) with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla scanner at 3 time-points: (i) baseline, (ii) after 1-cycle and (iii) after 3-cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Diffusion coefficient (D), Perfusion coefficient (D*) and Perfusion fraction (f) were estimated at three time-points in whole tumor and healthy muscle tissue using five methodologies (1) BE with three-parameter-fitting (BE), (2) Segmented-BE with two-parameter-fitting (BESeg-2), (3) Segmented-BE with one-parameter-fitting (BESeg-1), (4) BE with adaptive Total-Variation-penalty (BE + TV) and (5) BE with adaptive Huber-penalty (BE + HPF). Within-subject coefficient-of-variation (wCV) and between-subject coefficient-of-variation (bCV) of IVIM parameters were measured in healthy and tumor tissue. For precision and reproducibility, intra-scan comparison of wCV and bCV among five IVIM methods were performed using Friedman test followed by Wilcoxon-signed-ranks (WSR) post-hoc test. Experimental results demonstrated that BE + TV and BE + HPF showed significantly (p < 10(-3)) lower wCV and bCV for D (wCV: 24-32%; bCV: 22-31%) than BE method (wCV: 38-49%; bCV: 36-46%) across three time-points in healthy muscle and tumor. BE + TV and BE + HPF also demonstrated significantly (p < 10(-3)) lower wCV and bCV for estimating D* (wCV: 89-108%; bCV: 83-102%) and f (wCV: 55-60%; bCV: 56-60%) than BE, BESeg-2 and BESeg-1 methods (D*-wCV: 102-122%; D*-bCV: 98-114% and f-wCV: 96-130%; f-bCV: 94-125%) in both tumor and healthy tissue across three time-points. Spatial penalty based IVIM analysis methods BE + TV and BE + HPF demonstrated lower variability and improved precision and reproducibility in the current clinical settings.

AB  - Auditory and visual cues have been efficacious in laboratory-based freezing of gait (FoG) mitigation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, real-life applications of these cues are restricted due to inconvenience to the users. Closed-loop vibrotactile cues based on temporal gait events have overcome the shortcomings of auditory and visual cueing. However, kinematic gait parameter-driven vibrotactile cueing has not been explored yet. Kinematic gait parameter-driven cueing is more effective than temporal cueing, according to FoG pathophysiology studies. Therefore, we developed and pilot-tested a novel cueing scheme in which the foot-to-ground angle at heel strike (FGA_HS) is estimated using indigenous instrumented shoes to drive vibrotactile cueing. Ten PD freezers underwent a 6-meter timed walk test in the off-medication state with and without the cue and after medication without the cue. The proposed system potentially mitigated FoG, quantified by a reduction in the ratio of time spent freezing to the total walking time and the number of FoGs. The FoG mitigation potential of the cue was further supported by increased anteroposterior center of pressure progression and FGA_HS. With a future comprehensive validation in a larger number of participants, the novel cue could likely be used in practice and commercialized.

AB  - Introduction:Many countries from South-East Asia reported an epidemic of sino-orbital mucormycosis (SOM), otherwise a rare disease, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. SOM, a potentially fatal disease, is typically treated with orbital exenteration and systemic antifungals after metabolic stabilization. There is no clear evidence of survival benefit of exenteration in the literature, and thus, there have been attempts at globe conserving treatments like orbital infusion after limited debridement and intraorbital injections with Amphotericin B (IOAB).Methods:We conducted a prospective comparative interventional study at a tertiary eye care hospital to evaluate treatment outcomes with the use of adjunctive IOAB in cases of SOM with mild to moderate orbital disease.Results:Thirty-six patients of SOM with mild to moderate orbital disease were recruited in the study. In the intervention group, 23/26 (885%) eyes had stable orbital disease at the end of treatment (4-6 weeks). No deterioration in visual acuity was noted as a result of treatment. In 8/26 (30.77%) patients, inflammation was noted as a side effect of IOAB requiring temporary discontinuation of injections. The mean follow-up for cases was 14.2 months (range 12-15 months). 1/23 (4.35%) patients had relapse of orbital disease at 3 months. Twenty-one patients are alive on last follow-up. Of the patients who refused treatment (controls), 2/9 (22.22%) patients relapsed. One of these patients with relapse underwent exenteration, while the other was managed with IOAB. At a follow-up of 14 months (range 12-15 months), eight patients are alive. On evaluating the ocular parameters in salvaged eyes, improvement in extraocular movements was noted in 75-80% cases. The degree of proptosis and resistance to retropulsion did not change significantly.Conclusion:In the current study, an improvement in the globe salvage rates was noted in cases of SOM with mild to moderate orbital disease treated with adjunctive IOAB as compared to controls at a mean follow-up of 14 months, although it did not achieve statistical significance. The study supports the inclusion of IOAB in routine management of mild to moderate orbital disease.

AB  - Purpose:The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to overall interrupted medical care, resulting in disease progression and morbidity. The study aimed to evaluate clinicopathological presentations and severity of eyelid malignancy during the COVID era, comparing the results with patients presented during pre-COVID era and evaluating the reasons for delayed presentation in patients with advanced eyelid malignancy in the COVID-era.Methods:This was a comparative, ambispective observational study. Data regarding demographic, clinical, histopathology, and treatment modalities of confirmed cases of eyelid malignancy admitted during the period from March 2020 to September 2022 (defined as COVID era group) were collected and compared with retrospectively collected data from March 2017 to March 2020 (defined as pre-COVID era group). COVID era patients were further categorized as localized and advanced disease. Patients with advanced eyelid malignancy during COVID era were further subjected to a questionnaire to evaluate the reasons for delayed presentation.Results:In total, 115 patients of eyelid malignancy were studied [COVID era group 40 (35%) and pre-COVID era group 75 (65%)]. A statistically significant increase in the duration of disease (P = 0.0001) and advanced tumor T-stage (P = 0.03) was noticed in the COVID era group. Demographic, histopathology, and ocular morbidity details were similar in both groups. The common reasons that led to delay in presentation and treatment in advanced T-stage patients during the COVID era were fear of acquiring COVID, lockdown, and lack of medical facilities.Conclusion:During the COVID-19 pandemic, both hospital- and patient-related factors contributed to delay in presentation, leading to advanced-stage disease indicating need of triaging of eyelid malignancy in the event of such pandemics in future.

AB  - Purpose of review Despite advances in our radiological, histological and microbiological armamentarium, distinguishing between Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB), especially in a TB endemic country, continues to be a challenging exercise in a significant number of patients. This review aims to summarize current available evidence on novel diagnostic techniques which have a potential to fill the gap in our knowledge of differentiating between ITB and CD. Recent findings Both ITB and CD are associated with altered host immune responses, and detection of these altered innate and adaptive immune cells has potential to distinguish ITB from CD. ITB and CD have different epigenetic, proteomic and metabolomic signatures, and recent research has focused on detecting these differences. In addition, the gut microbiome, which is involved in mucosal immunity and inflammatory responses, is considerably altered in both ITB and CD, and is another potential frontier, which can be tapped to discriminate between the two diseases. With technological advancements, we have newer radiological modalities including perfusion CT and dual-layer spectral detector CT enterography and evidence is emerging of their role in differentiating ITB from CD. Finally, time will tell whether the advent of artificial intelligence, with rapidly accumulating data in this field, will be the gamechanger in solving this puzzle of diagnostic dilemma between ITB and Crohn's disease. Summary Recent advances need to be clinically validated before they can be used as novel diagnostic measures to differentiate Intestinal TB from CD.

AB  - Brachytherapy (BT) is an extensively used treatment modality for cancer in many sites in the body. In this treatment method, small radioactive sources are localized proximal to cancerous tumors. The commercially available applicators, templates, etc., used for tumor localization and targeting in BT have standard sizes and dimensions. Besides this, researchers are now focusing on achieving more accuracy in BT. This goal can be accomplished through 3D printing technology, also known as "additive manufacturing" (AM) or rapid prototyping, which has rapidly evolved in numerous applications. The 3D printing technology has enormous potential to perform personalized BT products and has enormous scope to improve clinical outcomes while lowering the risk of radiation-induced toxicity by growing recognition of precision medicine. In this review, the authors summarize the application of 3D printing in BT, and the challenges in developing a practical system are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Region-specific data on individual factors associated with uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening or early testing in diverse Indian populations are limited. Aim: To assess the prevalence and individual determinants of uptake of breast and/or cervical cancer screening or testing among women aged 30-69 years in regionally representative populations of two large Indian cities: New Delhi and Chennai. Methods: We conducted an analysis of the cross-sectional data (2016-2017) nested within the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia cohort, established in 2010-2011 with 12,271 participants (5365 in New Delhi; 6906 in Chennai). Among 3310 women participants, we evaluated the associations of demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, medical, psychosocial, and reproductive factors with breast and/or cervical cancer screening or testing using multivariable logistic regression models with results expressed as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: At any point prior to 2016-2017, 193 women self-reported having undergone evaluations for breast and/or cervical cancer. The reasons for evaluation were 'general examination' or 'physician's advice' (i.e., screening) or 'being symptomatic' (i.e., early testing). The overall prevalence was 5.8% for screening or testing and 2.5% for screening alone. Formal education (OR:1.88; 95% CI:1.12-3.15), high monthly household income (OR:2.27; 95% CI:1.59-3.25) and less 'fear-of-judgement' (OR:1.65; 95% CI:1.05-2.58) were positively associated with screening or testing uptake. When screening uptake was analysed separately, the results were generally similar. Conclusion: Our findings may have important implications for interventions at community-level (e.g., reducing 'fear-of-judgement', increasing awareness to screening programs and early symptoms) and health-system level (e. g., opportunistic screening).

AB  - Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) occurs in bone marrow failure due to a variety of causes. Although common in hematological disorders like myelofibrosis and hemoglobinopathies, EMH occurring as a result of bone marrow metastasis from solid tumors is very rare. We report a case of EMH subsequent to bone marrow metastasis from parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma in a 17-year-old girl. The patient presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed metastasis from rhabdomyosarcoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed and revealed an enhancing mass in the left nasal cavity, with adjacent bone erosion suggestive of parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma. Additionally, multiple homogenously enhancing masses were seen in the paravertebral location, adjoining multiple bilateral ribs, along the anterior surface of the sternum and in the presacral space, suggestive of EMH. Chemotherapy was subsequently started, but the patient developed febrile neutropenia and expired as a result of septic shock.

AB  - This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.

AB  - This study aimed to comprehensively explore the intricacies of corneal neurotization (CN) and the nuanced factors that set it apart from routine clinical practice, exerting a substantial influence on its success. A symbiotic relationship is evident between corneal innervation and ocular surface health. The loss of corneal innervation results in a potentially challenging corneal condition known as neurotrophic keratopathy (NK). The majority of treatments are primarily focused on preventing epithelial breakdown rather than addressing the underlying pathogenesis. Consequently, to address the impaired corneal sensation (underlying etiology), a novel surgical approach has emerged, namely CN, which involves transferring healthy sensory nerve axons to the affected cornea. This review offers valuable insights into the existing body of supporting evidence for CN, meticulously examining clinical studies, case reports, and experimental findings. The aim is to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness and potential outcomes associated with this innovative surgical technique. The exploration of innovative therapeutic avenues holds promise for revolutionizing the management of NK, offering a potentially permanent solution to a condition once deemed incurable and severely debilitating.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) with cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) for the management of total limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) in eyes with unilateral ocular burns. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: 100 patients (100 eyes) with unilateral total LSCD following ocular burns undergoing autologous Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation (LSCT) were enrolled and randomized into SLET and CLET groups. Restoration of an epithelized ocular surface was the primary outcome measure. Occurrences of progressive conjunctivalization and persistent epithelial defects postoperatively were considered surgical failures. Results: Mean age was 20.2 f 13.1 years (SLET) and 22.6 f 14.3 years (CLET) (p = 0.363). Alkali burn was the most common causative factor in both groups and had comparable mean logMAR BCVA at presentation [SLET: 2.33 f 0.5, CLET: 2.23 f 1.48 (p = 0.652)]. Median time interval between injury and surgical intervention was 18 months (SLET) and 12 months (CLET) (p = 0.06). 88 % eyes in SLET group maintained a stable ocular surface at 1 year period versus CLET group (86 %) (p = 0.999). Mean logMAR BCVA significantly improved in both groups with SLET having significantly better BCVA versus CLET at 6 months (p = 0.0390), 1 year (p = 0.0001), 2 year (p = 0.0001) and 3 years (p = 0.0001) follow up. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was statistically insignificant amongst the 2 groups (p = 0.590). Conclusions: Compared to CLET, SLET is equally efficacious in restoring and maintaining a stable ocular surface in eyes with total LSCD due to ocular burns, with the added advantage of providing superior visual outcomes.

AB  - Globally, 15% of the population suffers from disability. However, the percentage of people visiting hospitals who may be suffering from some form of disability may be higher. It may cause difficulty in accessing the health-care facilities. Universal design features help assimilate persons with disabilities with the mainstream. Patients on trolleys in hospitals jostling with vehicular traffic are a common sight. The lack of functional, dedicated, and encumbrance-free sidewalks for the movement of trolleys is a hindrance. We wish to highlight this aspect, suggest some remedial measures, and initiate a conversation among the health-care planners through this article.

AB  - INTRODUCTION:Limited evidence exists on the optimal strategy to correct iron deficiency anemia after variceal bleeding (VB) in cirrhosis. This trial compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (IV-FCM) with those of oral iron therapy in this cohort. METHODS:In this open-label, single-center, randomized controlled trial, eligible patients with hemoglobin <10 g/dL and iron deficiency (ferritin <100 ng/mL) after VB received either IV-FCM (1,500-2,000 mg) divided into 2 doses (n = 48) or oral carbonyl iron (100 mg elemental iron/day) (n = 44) for 3 months. The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included improvement in anemia (last hemoglobin >12 g/dL), normalization of iron stores (ferritin >100 ng/mL), liver-related adverse events, adverse drug reactions, and changes in quality of life (CLDQOL questionnaire). RESULTS:Baseline characteristics, including median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score 7 (interquartile range [IQR] 6-9), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score 12 (IQR 10-17), blood hemoglobin (8.25 +/- 1.06 g/dL), and ferritin (30.00 ng/mL [15.00-66.50]), were comparable in both arms. The median increase in hemoglobin at 3 months in the IV and oral arms was 3.65 g/dL (IQR 2.55-5.25) and 1.10 g/dL (IQR 0.05-2.90 g/dL) (P < 0.001), respectively. Iron stores normalized in 84.6% and 21% of the IV and oral arms, respectively (P < 0.001). Anemia improved in 50% and 21.9% in the IV and oral arms, respectively (P < 0.009). Patients in the IV arm showed a significant improvement in all domains of CLDQOL. Liver-related adverse events were comparable in both arms. Transient mild/moderate hypophosphatemia developed in 43% of patients receiving IV-FCM. DISCUSSION:Intravenous iron replacement is efficacious and safe to treat iron deficiency anemia after VB in patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - Thoracoabdominal duplication cysts are a congenital malformation of the posterior primitive foregut with synchronous thoracic and abdominal duplication cysts being found in up to 15% of cases. The presentation of duplication cysts depends on their location, size, and other factors, like the presence of ectopic functioning gastric mucosa, which is reported in 20%-30% of duplication cysts. Tc-99m-pertechnetate scintigraphy along with SPECT/CT helps in the preoperative localization of ectopic functioning gastric mucosa in these duplication cysts. We report the scintigraphic and SPECT/CT findings of one such case, which helped in the final diagnosis and management of the patient.

AB  - Background The tobacco epidemic signifies a major public health threat. Nicotine (NIC), a major active constituent in tobacco, impedes male fertility and semen quality. This work is implemented to explore the potential of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) and the newly fabricated SeNPs @vitamin C (SeNPs@VITC) nanocomposite in mitigating testicular toxicity induced by NIC.Materials and methods The six groups of 48 adult Wistar rats were designed as follows: the control group injected intraperitoneally with normal saline, the SeNPs group treated orally with 2 mg/kg of SeNPs, the SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite group treated orally with 2 mg/kg of SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite, the NIC group injected intraperitoneally with 1.25 mL/kg of NIC, the NIC+ SeNPs group received SeNPs plus NIC, and the NIC+ SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite group received SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite plus NIC. Treatments were administered over a 28-day period.Results NIC treatment significantly caused poor sperm quality, decreased serum testosterone, increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, reduced hemoglobin levels, leukocytosis, disrupted testicular oxidant/antioxidant balance, and disorganized testicular structure. The construction of the novel SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite, compared to NIC plus SeNPs alone, demonstrated a more potent ameliorative effect on NIC-induced reproductive toxicity in adult rats. The SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite significantly increased sperm count, reduced the percentage of sperm head abnormalities, lowered both serum FSH and LH concentrations, and improved the hemoglobin response.Conclusions Both SeNPs and SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite alleviated the testicular toxicity induced by NIC, but the SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite exhibited superior efficacy. The SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite could be employed to advance enhanced therapeutic strategies for addressing male infertility.

AB  - Traditionally, psammoma bodies (PB) have been considered as tale-tell evidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and are frequently encountered in classic and other subtypes of PTCs. However, the presence of PBs in the thyroid gland does not always indicate malignancy. The leading hypothesis on their origin suggests that PB are remnants of papillary structures that have undergone thrombosis, necrosis, and subsequent calcification. From January 2010 to May 2024, 26 patients with psammoma bodies associated with benign thyroid lesions, mainly thyroid follicular nodular disease (TFND), Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease, and follicular adenomas, were found. The case cohort included 16 females and 10 males with a median age of 49.3 years. The series included 12 TFND, two HT, and 12 follicular adenomas (11 out of 12 were oncocytic adenomas). Twenty-four out of 26 underwent total thyroidectomy. In 24 out of 26 cases, the entire lobes and parenchyma were included and serial cuts at multiple levels were performed in cases with PB but without any evidence of malignancy. Even though the detection of PB is associated with a malignant thyroid lesion, especially PTC and its subtypes, our multi-institutional series showed that in a minority PB can be found in a variety of benign thyroid lesions. Evaluation of the entire thyroid parenchyma at multiple levels is mandatory to exclude sub-centimeter papillary thyroid carcinoma.

AB  - Background: In two phase 3 studies, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) showed non-inferior efficacy versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), with more favourable renal and bone safety in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Aims: Here, we report the studies' final 8-year results. Methods: CHB patients (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-negative and HBeAg-positive) were randomised (2:1) to double-blind TAF 25 mg/day or TDF 300 mg/day for up to 3 years, followed by open-label (OL) TAF through year 8. Virological, biochemical, serological and fibrosis responses, and safety, including bone and renal parameters, were evaluated. Resistance to TAF was assessed annually by deep sequencing of polymerase/reverse transcriptase and by phenotyping. Results: Among 1298 patients randomised to double-blind TAF (n = 866) or double-blind TDF (n = 432), 775 in the TAF group and 382 in the TDF group received OL TAF, including 180 and 202 who switched from TDF to TAF at year 2 (TDF2y -> TAF6y) or year 3 (TDF3y -> TAF5y), respectively. At year 8, among patients in the TAF8y, TDF2y -> TAF6y and TDF3y -> TAF5y groups, 69%, 66% and 73% (missing-equals-failure analysis) and 95%, 94% and 97% (missing-equals-excluded) of patients, respectively, achieved HBV DNA <29 IU/mL. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (Cockcroft-Gault method; eGFR(CG)) and hip/spine bone mineral density (BMD) remained stable in patients receiving double-blind/OL TAF, with only small declines at year 8. Decreases in eGFRCG and hip/spine BMD observed during double-blind TDF improved after switching to OL TAF. No patients developed resistance to TAF. Conclusion: Long-term TAF treatment exhibited favourable safety and tolerability with high rates of viral suppression and no development of resistance.

TI  - High-resolution AI image dataset for diagnosing oral submucous fibrosis and squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB  - Oral cancer is a global health challenge with a difficult histopathological diagnosis. The accurate histopathological interpretation of oral cancer tissue samples remains difficult. However, early diagnosis is very challenging due to a lack of experienced pathologists and inter- observer variability in diagnosis. The application of artificial intelligence (deep learning algorithms) for oral cancer histology images is very promising for rapid diagnosis. However, it requires a quality annotated dataset to build AI models. We present ORCHID (ORal Cancer Histology Image Database), a specialized database generated to advance research in AI-based histology image analytics of oral cancer and precancer. The ORCHID database is an extensive multicenter collection of high-resolution images captured at 1000X effective magnification (100X objective lens), encapsulating various oral cancer and precancer categories, such as oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Additionally, it also contains grade-level sub-classifications for OSCC, such as well- differentiated (WD), moderately-differentiated (MD), and poorly-differentiated (PD). The database seeks to aid in developing innovative artificial intelligence-based rapid diagnostics for OSMF and OSCC, along with subtypes.

AB  - Introduction: The global rise in ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence highlights the urgent need for enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic loci associated with UC, providing insights into the disease's molecular mechanisms, including immune modulation, mucosal defense, and epithelial barrier function. Despite these findings, many GWAS signals are located in non-coding regions and are linked to low risk, suggesting that protein-coding genes alone do not fully explain UC's pathophysiology. Emerging research emphasizes the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets due to their crucial role in UC. This review explores the current understanding of miRNAs in UC, including their mechanisms of action and their potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The present review provides the latest update on their potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Areas covered: This review synthesizes an extensive literature search on miRNAs in UC, focusing on their roles in the mucosal barrier, innate and adaptive immunity, and their potential applications as biomarkers and therapeutic modalities. Expert opinion: While miRNAs present promising opportunities as biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents in UC, challenges in validation, specificity, delivery, and clinical application need to be addressed through rigorous, large-scale studies.

AB  - Background: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) has been described in the literature mostly as early-onset leukodystrophy with cerebellar ataxia being the main clinical phenotype. However, other associated movement disorders have also been reported discretely. Cases: Here, we present seven cases of MLC. Cerebellar ataxia was common in them, while dystonia was present in six, parkinsonism in one and stereotypy in two. Six of them, belonging to the Agarwal community, had the common c.135dup variant. Conclusion: Our observation highlights the presence of movement disorders in MLC beyond cerebellar ataxia and phenotypic variability of the c.135dup variant, prevalent in the Agarwal community.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has long been a challenging disease owing to its high aggressive behaviour, poor prognosis and its limited treatment options. The growing demand of new therapeutics against TNBC enables us to examine the therapeutic efficiency of an emerging class of anticancer compounds, azapodophyllotoxin derivative (HTDQ), a nitrogen analogue of podophyllotoxin, using different biochemical, spectroscopic and computational approaches. The anticancer activities of HTDQ are studied by performing MTT assay in a dose depended manner on Triple negative breast cancer cells using MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with IC50 50 value 937 nM and 1.13 mu M respectively while demonstrating minimal effect on normal epithelial cells. The efficacy of HTDQ was further tested in 3D tumour spheroids formed by the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB468 and also the murine MMTV positive TNBC cell line 4 T1. The shrinkage that observed in the tumor spheroid clearly indicates that HTDQ remarkably decreases the growth of tumor spheroid thereby affirming its cytotoxicity. The 2D cell viability assay shows significant morphological alteration that possibly caused by the cytoskeleton disturbances. Hence the binding interaction of HTDQ with cytoskeleton protein tubulin, its effect on tubulin polymerisation as well as depolymerisation of preformed microtubules along with the conformational alternation in the protein itself have been investigated in detail. Moreover, the apoptotic effects of HTDQ have been examined using a range of apoptotic markers. HTDQ-treated cancer cells showed increased expression of cleaved PARP-1 and pro-caspase-3, suggesting activation of the apoptosis process. HTDQ also upregulated proapoptotic Bax expression while inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl2 expression, supporting its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Hence the consolidated biochemical and spectroscopic research described herein may provide enormous information to use azapodophyllotoxin as promising anticancer therapeutics for TNBC cells.

AB  - Pure intertubular seminoma (PITS) of the testis is described as the presence of seminoma cells within the interstitium of testis without any evidence of diffuse growth pattern or mass lesion of classical seminoma. These tumors are clinically and grossly inconspicuous and are diagnosed incidentally or during investigations for testicular pain, infertility or other symptoms. Rarely metastasis is the first presentation. Microscopic identification can be difficult and poses a diagnostic challenge in the absence of a mass lesion. Seminomas with exclusive intertubular growth patterns were gathered in an international cohort. Diagnoses were confirmed by fellowship- trained or specialized urologic pathologists. Cases with the presence of a classical diffuse or nested pattern of seminoma or any other germ cell tumor component were excluded. The patient's age, tumor characteristics and additional clinicopathologic features were recorded and analyzed. 15 patients of pure intertubular seminoma (PITS) were collated. . The mean age of presentation was 29 years. Patients presented with variable symptoms, including undescended testis (26%, n = 4/15), testicular heaviness/pain (20%, n = 3/15) infertility (20%, n = 3/ 15) and metastasis (6%, n = 1/15); presentation was unknown in 4 patients. Of note, none of the patients presented because of testicular mass. Serum markers were within normal limits in most patients (93%, n = 14/ 15) with available data. No tumors were identified macroscopically; however, an ill-defined, grey-white, firm area was noted in one orchiectomy specimen. Microscopically, tumor cells were seen in intertubular spaces as dispersed individual cells or small clusters. Tumor cells were round to polygonal with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltrates were seen admixed with tumor cells in 40% (n = 6/15) of the tumors. GCNIS was present in association with most PITS (73%, n = 11/15). Tubular atrophy with thickening of the basement membrane and Leydig cell hyperplasia was observed in one tumor. Thirty-three percent (n = 5/15) of the tumors showed pagetoid involvement of rete testis, including the tumor with metastasis. All tumors showed the classical immunohistochemical profile of seminoma, with PLAP, c-KIT, OCT3/4, D2-40 and SALL4 positivity. PITS can be clinically & pathologically inconspicuous, difficult to stage and liable to be misdiagnosed especially if presented with metastasis. Despite the inconspicuousness, PITS may represent an aggressive growth pattern of seminoma with the propensity for rete testis invasion.

TI  - Thromboelastography-Guided versus Standard-of-Care or On-Demand Platelet Transfusion in Patients with Cirrhosis and Thrombocytopenia Undergoing Procedures: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: To determine the rate of platelet transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <50 x 10(9)/L) undergoing high-risk invasive procedures when prescribed by thromboelastography (TEG) compared with empirical and on-demand transfusion strategies. Materials and Methods: This was a single-center, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia undergoing high-risk invasive procedures were randomized into 3 groups: TEG group, transfusions based on TEG parameters; standard of care (SOC) group, 3 units of random donor platelets before procedure; and on-demand group, transfusions based on procedural adverse events/clinician's discretion. The primary outcome was periprocedural platelet transfusion in each arm. Results: Eighty-seven patients were randomized (29 in each group) with no significant differences in demographics/coagulation profile/procedures. The median platelet count was 33 x 10(9)/L (interquartile range, 26-43 x 10(9)/L). Percutaneous liver biopsy was the most common procedure (46, 52.9%). Significantly lower number of patients in the TEG group received platelets (4 cases, 13.8%; 95% CI, 3.9-31.7) compared with SOC group (100%; 95% CI, 88.1-100; P < .001). Four patients in the on-demand group received platelets (13.8%; 95% CI, 3.9-31.7). Minor (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade 2) procedure-related bleeding occurred in 3 (10%; 95% CI, 2.2-27.4) patients in the TEG-guided transfusion group compared with 1 (3.4%; 95% CI, 0.1-17.8) patient each in the SOC and on-demand groups (P = .43), although the study was not powered for comparison of bleeding rates. No bleeding-related mortality was observed in any of the 3 groups. Conclusions: TEG-prescribed transfusion reduced prophylactic transfusions in patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia undergoing high-risk invasive procedures. The study was not powered for comparison of bleeding rates.

AB  - Aims This study aims to assess the potential bacterial inactivation pathway triggered by argon (Ar) cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (CAPJ) discharge using spectroscopic and imaging techniques. Methods and results Electrical and reactive species of the Ar CAPJ discharge was characterized. The chemical composition and morphology of bacteria pre- and post-CAPJ exposure were assessed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman micro-spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A greater than 6 log reduction of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was achieved within 60 and 120 s of CAPJ exposure, respectively. Extremely low D-values (<20 s) were recorded for both the isolates. The alterations in the FTIR spectra and Raman micro-spectra signals of post-CAPJ exposed bacteria revealed the degree of destruction at the molecular level, such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, bond breakages, etc. Further, TEM images of exposed bacteria indicated the incurred damages on cell morphology by CAPJ reactive species. Also, the inactivation process varied for both isolates, as evidenced by the correlation between the inactivation curve and FTIR spectra. It was observed that the identified gas-phase reactive species, such as Ar I, O I, OH center dot, NO+, OH+, NO2-, NO3-, etc. played a significant role in bacterial inactivation. Conclusions This study clearly demonstrated the effect of CAPJ exposure on bacterial cell morphology and molecular composition, illuminating potential bacterial inactivation mechanisms.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is often diagnosed at a very advanced stage due to its location and non-specific initial symptoms. Moreover, no clinically useful serological marker has been established so far for early detection of NPC. In this study, we have investigated the clinical significance of plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA load along with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels to evaluate if these three all together can be useful as a strong serological marker for early detection and prediction of treatment response in patients with NPC. Plasma EBV DNA load, IL-6 level, VEGF expressions were measured in 24 patients with NPC at presentation and various time points during and after treatment. There was a positive correlation between high plasma EBV DNA load with higher IL-6 and VEGF expression, which was closely associated with therapeutic response as well. Persistent or recurrent plasma EBV load with higher IL-6 and VEGF levels can potentially predict disease progression and may be useful to select patients for additional therapy and longer follow-up.

AB  - Objective: To study serum interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-8(IL-8) and interleukin-10(IL-10) levels in Epilpetic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep(EE-SWAS), drug refractory epilepsy(DRE) and well controlled epilepsy(WCE). Methods: Children(2-12 years) with immunotherapy na & iuml;ve EE-SWAS, DRE and WCE were enrolled. Valid psychometric tools were used to assess cognition and behavior. Children with EE-SWAS were longitudinally followed. They received a three-month steroid course alongwith the ongoing antiseizure drugs. Electroclinical responders were defined as change in social quotient by 5-points with improvement in atleast one behavioral domain by 5-points and 50 % reduction in mean seizure frequency if active seizures were present alongwith a 25 % reduction in Spike-wave-index(SWI) at three months. Change in serum Interleukin levels at one month follow up was compared between participants who eventually became responders or non-responders at three months. Results: Twenty children with EE-SWAS, 18 with DRE and WCE each were enrolled. Serum IL-6(pg/ml){(EE-SWAS: 3.775(IQR 2.205, 11.28); DRE: 3.01(IQR 2.04, 4.56); WCE: 1.655(IQR 1.27, 2.29), p = 0.0065} and IL-8(pg/ml){(EE-SWAS: 103.2(IQR 34.01, 200.82); DRE: 19.595(IQR 16.54, 39.7); WCE: 18.97(IQR 16.54, 21.91) p = 0.0002} was significantly different between the three groups. In EE-SWAS group 12/20(60 %) showed electroclinical response to steroids. Responders had significant reduction in IL6 levels (pg/ml){4.045(IQR 2.605, 18.96) to 1.13(IQR 054, 1.74)} at one month follow up compared to non responders {3.12(IQR 1.655, 5.27) to 4.37(IQR 2.83, 9.855)} (p = 0.0069). Conclusions: Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) are significantly elevated in EE-SWAS compared to DRE and WCE. Reduction in IL-6 levels at one month post-therapy predicted electroclinical responders at 3months follow up.

AB  - Withania coagulans (WC) is used in traditional and Ayurveda medicine to treat various ailments, including diabetes. Our investigation found that WC fruit hexane extract effectively suppresses alpha-glucosidase activity (IC50 50 = 0.013 mg/ml, Ki i = 0.012 mg/ml). The purified molecule has an IC50 50 of 0.004 mg/ml and Ki i of 0.0037 mg/ml. FTIR examination indicates distinctive peaks at 3500, 2900, 1770, and 1500 cm-- 1 corresponding to functional groups OH bending, C-H - H stretching, C--O - - O stretching, and C-O - O stretching. GCMS analysis reveals plant secondary metabolites (PSM) such as n-hexadecenoic acid and methyl 9,10-octadecadienoate. NMR confirms the existence of olefinic fatty acids. The bioactive fraction recorded a non-competitive mode of inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity. The cytotoxicity exhibited against HELA cell was IC50 50 0.4 mg/ml and found positive in inhibiting the growth of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. . Additionally, ensemble docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that, out of the four PSMs examined, methyl 12,13-tetradecadienoate interacted with the alpha-glucosidase enzyme's allosteric site (BE-128.78 kJ/mol) and changed the configurations of the catalytic sites, as demonstrated by the enzyme's decreased affinity for isomaltose. The study found that PSMs from WC fruit may inhibit alpha-glucosidase, making them viable candidates for antidiabetic medication development.

AB  - Tuberculosis is a global threat and is still a leading cause of death due to an infectious agent. The infection is spread through inhalation of M. tb containing aerosol droplets. Bacteria after reaching the lung alveoli are engulfed by alveolar macrophages, leading to an immune response. Then, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released by these macrophages, recruiting other antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells. These cells phagocytose the bacteria and present mycobacterial antigens to na & iuml;ve T cells. After activation by DCs, T cells differentiate into various T cells subsets, viz. CD4(+), CD8(+), Th17, Treg, Tfh cells and others display enormous diversification in their characteristics and functions. This review comprises a comprehensive literature on conventional and unconventional T cells, highlighting the polyfunctional T cells as well, their role in controlling TB infection, and their implications in the spectrum of TB infection. While some subsets such as CD4(+ )T cells are extensively studied, some T cell subsets such as gamma delta T cells and Tfh cells remain poorly understood in the pathophysiology of tuberculosis, despite having significant potential implications. The goal of TB eradication can be assisted by development of better vaccines against TB, which can effectively induce a robust and longterm T cells memory. The same has been discussed in the latter part of this review. BCG being the standalone commercialised TB vaccine so far has its limitations. Strategies for the enhancement of BCG along with novel studies in vaccine development, has also been discussed in great detail. Lastly, T cells display a complex interplay of an adaptive immune response against TB, with activation and enhancement of the innate immune responses. Therefore, it is critical to fully understand the role of various T cells subsets in pathophysiology of tuberculosis to provide better therapeutic inventions and improve patient care.

AB  - Informed by the almost unimaginable unmet need for cardiac surgery in the developing regions of the world, leading surgeons, cardiologists, editors in chief of the major cardiothoracic journals as well as representatives of medical industry and government convened in December 2017 to address this unacceptable disparity in access to care. The ensuing " Cape Town Declaration" " constituted a clarion call to cardiac surgical societies to jointly advocate the strengthening of sustainable, local cardiac surgical capacity in the developing world. The Cardiac Surgery Inter- society Alliance (CSIA) was thus created, comprising The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery (ASCVTS), the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the World Heart Federation (WHF). The guiding principle was advocacy for sustainable cardiac surgical capacity in lowincome countries. As a fi rst step, a global needs assessment confirmed fi rmed rheumatic heart disease as the overwhelming pathology requiring cardiac surgery in these regions. Subsequently, CSIA published a request for proposals to support fl edgling programs that could demonstrate the backing by their governments and health care institution. Out of 11 applicants, and following an evaluation of the sites, including site visits to the 3 fi nalists, Mozambique and Rwanda were selected as the fi rst Pilot Sites. Subsequently, a mentorship and training agreement was completed between Mozambique and the University of Cape Town, a middle- income country with a comparable burden of rheumatic heart disease. The agreement entails regular video calls between the heart teams, targeted training across all aspects of cardiac surgery, as well as on-site presence of mentoring teams for complex cases with the strict observance of " assisting only." " In Rwanda, Team Heart, a US and Rwanda-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) that has been performing cardiac surgery in Rwanda and helping to train the cardiac surgery workforce since 2008, has agreed to continue providing mentorship for the local team and to assist in the establishment of independent cardiac surgery with all that entails. This involves intermittent virtual conferences between Rwandan and US cardiologists for surgical case selection. Five years after CSIA was founded, its " Seal of Approval" " for the sustainability of endorsed programs in Mozambique and Rwanda has resulted in higher case numbers, a stronger government commitment, significant fi cant upgrades of infrastructure, the nurturing of generous consumable donations by industry and the commencement of negotiations with global donors for major grants. Extending the CSIA Seal to additional deserving programs could further align the international cardiac surgical community with the principle of local cardiac surgery capacity-building in developing countries.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, heterogeneous, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody production, complement activation, and immune complex deposition. SLE predominantly affects young, middle-aged, and child-bearing women with episodes of flare-up and remission, although it affects males at a much lower frequency (female: male; 7:1 to 15:1). Technological and molecular advancements have helped in patient stratification and improved patient prognosis, morbidity, and treatment regimens overall, impacting quality of life. Despite several attempts to comprehend the pathogenesis of SLE, knowledge about the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this disease is still lacking. The current treatment options for SLE are pragmatic and aim to develop composite biomarkers for daily practice, which necessitates the robust development of novel treatment strategies and drugs targeting specific responsive pathways. In this communication, we review and aim to explore emerging therapeutic modalities, including multiomics-based approaches, rational drug design, and CAR-T-cell-based immunotherapy, for the management of SLE.

AB  - Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor diagnosed mostly in children below the age of five years and comprises of about 15 % of all paediatric cancer deaths. Tumor initiating cancer stem cells (CSCs) can be targeted for better treatment approaches. BASP1-AS1 is a long non coding (Lnc) RNA that is a divergent LncRNA for its coding gene brain abundant membrane attached signal protein 1 (BASP1). We had earlier demonstrated it to be expressed in foetus derived human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), where it was a positive regulator of BASP1 and was critical for neural differentiation. In this study, we have investigated the role of BASP1-AS1 in CSCs derived from the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. We cultured SH-SY5Y cells on Poly-D-Lysine coated flasks in serum free media supplemented with growth factors, which led to the enrichment of CSCs as determined by marker expression. When grown on ultra-low attachment flasks, these cells formed CSCs enriched neurospheres. We examined the effects of BASP1-AS1 siRNA mediated knockdown on CSCs enriched SH-SY5Y cells and SH-SY5Y derived neurospheres. BASP1-AS1 knockdown decreased the levels of the corresponding gene BASP1 and the rate of cell proliferation of CSCs enriched cells along with low expression of Ki67. It also reduced the mRNA levels of stem cell and pluripotency gene markers (CD133, CD44, c-KIT, SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG), as also Wnt 2 and the Wnt pathway effector beta catenin. It also abrogated the formation of neurospheres in ultra-low attachment flasks. A similar effect on proliferation and stemness related properties was seen on BASP1 knockdown. BASP1-AS1 and its related pathways may provide a point of intervention for the CSCs population in neuroblastoma.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.

AB  - In the south Asian region, delivering non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and control services through existing primary health-care (PHC) facilities is urgently required yet currently challenging. As the first point of contact with the health-care system, PHC offers an ideal window for prevention and continuity of care over the life course, yet the implementation of PHC to address NCDs is insufficient. This review considers evidence from five south Asian countries to derive policy-relevant recommendations for designing integrated PHC systems that include NCD care. Findings reveal high political commitment but poor multisectoral engagement and health systems preparedness for tackling chronic diseases at the PHC level. There is a shortage of skilled human resources, requisite infrastructure, essential NCD medicines and technologies, and dedicated financing. Although innovations supporting integrated interventions exist, such as innovations focusing on community-centric approaches, scaling up remains problematic. To deliver NCD services sustainably, governments must aim for increased financing and a redesign of PHC service.

AB  - Many of the daily systemic medications (parenteral and oral) used to treat various diseases are known to cause ocular toxicities - leading to vision loss. How these medications gain entry into the eye despite the ocular barriers is an important question to be addressed. Various reports show almost 30-40 % of systemic drugs causing ocular toxicity are organic cation in nature. We hypothesize these systemic drugs (cations) are non-specifically recognized as endogenous substrates by organic cation transporter (OCT1) in the lacrimal gland, thereby facilitating its entry into the anterior eye segment. Therefore, we studied the expression and localization of OCT1 in the lacrimal gland of rabbits. Further, to prove our hypothesis, OCT1 substrates (known as well as predicted from our previous Artificial Intelligence study) were administered intravenously in the presence and absence of topically administered OCT1 blockers. Our findings show, OCT1 gene and protein expression in the lacrimal gland, with its localization in the terminal acinar cells. The tear levels of intravenously administered substrates decreased in the presence of topical OCT1 blockers, indicating - a) the entry of systemic drugs into the eye via lacrimal secretion and b) OCT1 in the lacrimal gland is involved in the drug transport (substrates) from blood to the eye. Though the role of transporters in toxicity is well-known, the current study opens a new avenue for understanding the role of transporters in ocular toxicity.

AB  - South Asia is rapidly urbanising. The strains of rapid urbanisation have profound implications for the health and equity of urban populations. This Series paper examines primary health care (PHC) in south Asian cities. Health and its social determinants vary considerably across south Asian cities and substantial socioeconomic inequities are present. Although cities offer easy geographical access to PHC services, financial hardship associated with health care use and low quality of care are a concern, particularly for low-income residents. Providing better PHC in south Asia requires a multi-sectoral response, with effective and resourced urban local bodies; increased public financing for health care; and new service delivery models aimed at low-income urban communities that involve strengthening public sector services, strengthening government engagement with private providers where necessary, and engaging with low-income communities and the PHC providers that serve them.

AB  - Liquid biopsy for CNS tumors is in its nascent phase, hindered by the low levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Overcoming this challenge requires highly sensitive molecular techniques. DD-PCR emerges as a standout technique due to its ability to identify rare mutations, copy number variations, and circulating nucleic acids, making it one of the best methods for identifying somatic mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Despite promising results from various studies demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining informative ctDNA profiles from liquid biopsy samples, challenges persist, including the need to standardize sample collection, storage, and processing methods, define clear assay positivity thresholds, and address the overall low assay sensitivity. Our two-phase study began by assessing DD-PCR efficacy in FFPE tissues, revealing robust concordance with immunohistochemistry. In Phase 1 (85 cases), DD-PCR on FFPE tissues demonstrated 100 % sensitivity and specificity for IDH1 R132H mutations. In Phase 2 (100 cases), analysis extended to cfDNA, maintaining high specificity (100 %) with moderate sensitivity (44.2 %). Overall concordance with immunohistochemistry was 61 %, highlighting liquid biopsy's potential in glioma management. The findings emphasized DD-PCR's clinical utility in both tissue and liquid biopsy, underscoring its role in early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of diffuse gliomas.

AB  - Increased iron level is detected in rat kidney and human urine in diabetic condition and implicated in associated nephropathy. However, the biological cue and mechanism of the iron accumulation remain unclear. Here we reveal that glucose increases iron uptake by promoting transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) in kidney cells by a translational mechanism but does not alter expression of endosomal iron transporter DMT1. Glucose decreases iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) by a protein degradation mechanism. Hepcidin is known to bind at Cys-326 residue in promoting degradation of human ferroportin. When Cys-326 was mutated to Ser in human-FPNFLAG and expressed in kidney cells, glucose still could degrade FPN-FLAG implicating involvement of hepcidin independent mechanism in glucose induced ferroportin degradation. Chronic hyperglycemia was generated in rats by administering streptozotocin (STZ) with periodic insulin injection to determine the level of iron homeostasis components. Increased TFRC and decreased ferroportin levels were detected in hyperglycemic rat kidney by Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Hepcidin mRNA was not significantly altered in kidney but was marginally decreased in liver. Perls' staining and non-heme iron estimation showed an elevated iron level in hyperglycemic rat kidney. These results suggest that high glucose dysregulates iron transport components resulting iron accumulation in diabetic kidney.

AB  - Oncocytic renal neoplasms are a major source of diagnostic challenge in genitourinary pathology; however, they are typically nonaggressive in general, raising the question of whether distinguishing different subtypes, including emerging entities, is necessary. Emerging entities recently described include eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (ESC RCC), low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT), eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT), and papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity (PRNRP). A survey was shared among 65 urologic pathologists using SurveyMonkey.com (Survey Monkey, Santa Clara, CA, USA). De-identified and anonymized respondent data were analyzed. Sixty-three participants completed the survey and contributed to the study. Participants were from Asia (n=21; 35%), North America (n=31; 52%), Europe (n=6; 10%), and Australia (n=2; 3%). Half encounter oncocytic renal neoplasms that are difficult to classify monthly or more frequently. Most (70%) indicated that there is enough evidence to consider ESC RCC as a distinct entity now, whereas there was less certainty for LOT (27%), EVT (29%), and PRNRP (37%). However, when combining the responses for sufficient evidence currently and likely in the future, LOT and EVT yielded>70% and>60% for PRNRP. Most (60%) would not render an outright diagnosis of oncocytoma on needle core biopsy. There was a dichotomy in the routine use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the evaluation of oncocytoma (yes=52%; no=48%). The most utilized IHC markers included keratin 7 and 20, KIT, AMACR, PAX8, CA9, melan A, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)B, and fumarate hydratase (FH). Genetic techniques used included TSC1/TSC2/MTOR (67%) or TFE3 (74%) genes and pathways; however, the majority reported using these very rarely. Only 40% have encountered low-grade oncocytic renal neoplasms that are deficient for FH. Increasing experience with the spectrum of oncocytic renal neoplasms will likely yield further insights into the most appropriate work-up, classification, and clinical management for these entities.

AB  - Purpose To observe the variability in the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) profiles of first-line antitubercular drugs in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods Newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients aged 18-60 years with or without DM were included in the study. Group I (n = 20) included patients with TB, whereas group II (n = 20) included patients with both TB and DM. After 2 weeks of therapy, plasma concentrations and other PK-PD parameters were determined. Improvements in clinical features, X-ray findings, sputum conversion, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed after 2 months of therapy. Results Isoniazid displayed non-significantly higher plasma concentrations in diabetic patients, along with a significantly (P < 0.05) longer elimination half-life (t(1/2)). Rifampicin plasma concentrations at 4, 8, and 12 h were significantly (P < 0.05) lower, and it displayed significantly (P < 0.05) lower area under the curve (AUC(0-12) and AUC(0-infinity)), shorter t(1/2), higher clearance (Cl), and a lower AUC(0-infinity)/MIC ratio in diabetic patients. Pyrazinamide and ethambutol showed non-significantly higher plasma concentrations, AUC(0-12), AUC(0-infinity), and t(1/2) in diabetic patients. The improvements in clinical features, X-ray findings, sputum conversion, and ADRs were comparable in both groups. Conclusions The presence of DM in TB patients affects the PK-PD parameters of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol variably in the Indian population. Studies with a larger number of patients are required to further elucidate the role of DM on the PK-PD profile of first-line antitubercular drugs and treatment outcomes in TB patients with concomitant DM.

AB  - Background: Obesity is an important predictor of development of Lumbar canal stenosis (LCS) and its symptoms. LCS further restricts the mobility of the patient and a vicious cycle develops. The operative decision on patients with LCS and obesity is a matter of debate. Hence, we attempted to compare changes in body mass index and patient satisfaction in patients with LCS with and without concomitant obesity, undergoing spinal decompression surgery. Methods: Patients undergoing decompression for LCS between 1st June 2019 to 31st May 2020 were included. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, co-morbidities, BMI, self-recorded maximal walking distance (SRMWD) and Oswestry disability index score (ODI) were recorded. All patients were followed up prospectively at 1 year post surgery. Satisfaction was recorded on a five-point Likert scale. Participants were classified into non obesity (group 1) and obesity (group 2) groups according to JAPI and WHO classification and compared. Results: 55 patients met the inclusion criteria, 23 in group 1 and 32 in group 2. Group 2 showed a mean decrease in BMI of 0.95 +/- 1.32 kg/m2 2 while other group had an increase of 0.14 +/- 1.31 kg/m2 2 (p = 0.021). Significant weight change was seen in 31.3 % group 2 vs 8.7 % group 1 patients which was significant (p = 0.046). Pre operative BMI positively correlated with change in BMI after surgery (r = 0.406, p = 0.001) and with percentage weight reduction (r = 0.321, p = 0.017). Both the groups were comparable in improvement in ODI and SR-MWD scores and patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Patients with obesity achieve significant reduction in weight and BMI following decompression surgery for LCS. It will further prevent other health conditions attributed to obesity. Both the groups were comparable in ODI, SR-MWD and satisfactory outcome following surgery. Hence obesity should not be a deterring factor for surgical consideration for patients with lumbar canal stenosis.

AB  - Introduction: Up to 40% of patients with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) have a negative prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging (nMRI), and up to 15% of them may have clinically significant PCa (csPCa). The ability to predict the presence of csPCa despite nMRI may help avoid unnecessary biopsies. We aimed to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of mpMRI, the influence of MRI reporting patterns in clinical practice, and the factors that might predict csPCa among men with an nMRI. Methodology: In an IRB-approved, ambispective study, men who underwent prostate biopsy from 2016 to 2023 and had a prebiopsy MRI, were included to determine the presence of csPCa. The reporting patterns of institutional and noninstitutional MRI were evaluated. Age, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, prostate specific antigen (PSA), PSA density (PSAD), and MRI reports were evaluated for their ability to predict csPCa in men with nMRI. Results: 1660 patients who underwent prostate biopsy were assessed for eligibility, and 685 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age, PSA and PSAD were 60 years, 11.63 ng/ml and 0.23 ng/ml/ cm3, respectively. 62 (9%) men had an nMRI, among which csPCa, non-csPCa, and negative biopsy were found in 34%, 5%, and 61% of men, respectively. 61% had an institutional MRI, while 39% had a noninstitutional MRI. The sensitivity and NPV of any MRI for csPCa were 93% and 66%, respectively, which improved to 96% and 81% for institutional MRI. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed abnormal DRE and PSAD >= 0.25 ng/ml/cc as predictive factors for csPCa in men with an nMRI. Conclusion: 34% of men with negative MRIs were found to harbor csPCa on prostate biopsy. The NPV of institutional MRI was higher than for noninstitutional MRI. Men with an abnormal DRE or PSAD >= 0.25 ng/ml/cc had a higher incidence of csPCa despite an nMRI. (c) 2024 The Asian Pacific Prostate Society. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction:<bold> </bold>To evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of ZRC-3277 (pertuzumab biosimilar) with Perjeta (R) (pertuzumab) in previously untreated patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients and methods:<bold> </bold>This phase III, multicenter, double-blind study across 38 sites in India randomized (1:1) patients with HER2-positive MBC in either the ZRC-3277 or Perjeta (R) group. Both groups also received trastuzumab and docetaxel. Of 268 enrolled patients, mITT population had 243 patients (119 and 124 in the ZRC-3277 and Perjeta (R) groups, respectively). The primary objective was to compare the between-group objective response rate (ORR) after 6 cycles of treatment. ORR was determined by evaluating scans of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging following Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST 1.1). Two-sided 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference in ORR was determined to evaluate the noninferiority of ZRC-3277 to Perjeta (R). The secondary outcomes included the assessment of PK, immunogenicity, and safety between the 2 groups. Results: In the mITT population, 104 (87.39%) and 114 (91.94%) participants achieved the ORR in the ZRC-3277 and Perjeta (R) groups, respectively. For predefined -15% noninferiority margin, obtained 2-sided 95% CIs (-12.19%, 3.11%) for the difference in ORR (-4.55%) between the 2 groups demonstrated the noninferiority of ZRC-3277 to Perjeta (R). PK, immunogenicity, and safety were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusion:<bold> </bold>Efficacy, PK, immunogenicity, and safety profiles of ZRC-3277 was found to be similar to those of Perjeta (R).

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment, particularly for hematologic malignancies. Various cancer immunotherapy strategies are presently being explored, including cytokines, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulators monoclonal antibodies, etc. The therapy has shown impressive efficacy in treating conditions such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and multiple myeloma, often leading to complete remission in refractory cases. However, the clinical application of CAR T-cell therapy is accompanied by challenges, notably severe side effects. Effective management of these adverse effects requires meticulous monitoring and prompt intervention, highlighting the critical role of nursing in this therapeutic process. Nurses play a crucial role in patient education, monitoring, symptom management, care coordination, and psychosocial support, ensuring safe and effective treatment. As research advances and new CAR T-cell therapies are developed, the role of nursing professionals remains pivotal in optimizing patient outcomes. The continued evolution of CAR T-cell therapy promises improved outcomes, with nursing professionals integral to its success.

The incomplete fusion of bones in pediatric patients provides an acoustic window for the US. The epidural space in children is at shallow depth, hence a high-frequency probe, which provides better resolution can be used. We present a case series in which real-time US-guided epidural catheter placement was performed in 10 infants in lower thoracic and upper lumbar interspaces. We reiterate that the use of real-time US during epidural catheter placement in patients increases the success rate of epidural catheter placement while decreasing procedural complications.

AB  - Mitochondria-targeting agents, known as mitocans, are emerging as potent cancer therapeutics due to pronounced metabolic and apoptotic adaptations in the mitochondria of cancer cells. ONC212, an imipridone-family compound initially identified as a ClpP agonist, is currently under investigation as a potential mitocan with demonstrated preclinical efficacy against multiple malignancies. Despite this efficacy, the molecular mechanism underlying the cell death induced by ONC212 remains unclear. This study systematically investigates the mitochondrial involvement and signaling cascades associated with ONC212-induced cell death, utilizing HeLa and A549 cancer cells. Treated cancer cells exhibited characteristic apoptotic features, such as annexin-V positivity and caspase-3 activation; however, these occurred independently of typical mitochondrial events like membrane potential loss (Delta Psi m) and cytochrome c release, as well as caspase-8 activation associated with the extrinsic pathway. Additionally, ONC212 treatment increased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which impeded apoptosis, as the overexpression of Bcl-2-GFP and Bcl-xL-GFP significantly reduced ONC212-mediated cell death. Furthermore, combining a sub-lethal dose of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor Navitoclax with ONC212 markedly augmented caspase-3 activation and cell death, still without any notable Delta Psi m loss or cytochrome c release. Moreover, inhibition of caspase-9 activity unexpectedly augmented, rather than attenuated, caspase-3 activation and the subsequent cell death. Collectively, our research identifies ONC212 as an atypical mitochondrial-independent, yet Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-inhibitable, caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell death inducer, highlighting its potential for combination therapies in tumors with defective mitochondrial apoptotic signaling.

AB  - BackgroundThe perivascular spaces of the brain are also known as Virchow-Robin spaces (VRSs). Dilated Virchow-Robin spaces in the brainstem are rare and mainly cause symptoms due to obstructive hydrocephalus, less frequently because of their size, mass effect, and impact on eloquent structures.Case illustrationWe present a patient with giant tumefactive VRS with hydrocephalus and neurological symptoms who was treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) followed by microscopic cyst fenestration. On the basis of this observation, we performed a thorough review of the literature to evaluate different treatment options.ResultsAn 11-year-old girl presented with a headache for 3 months. The patient had a giant tumefactive mesencephalothalamic VRS with triventricular hydrocephalus. She was initially treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy and multiple cyst fenestration. Symptomatic cyst regrowth required multiple cyst fenestrations via transcallosal transchoroidal (N = 2) and subtemporal approaches (N = 1) at the 2- and 4-year follow-ups. A literature review of these conditions allowed the detection of 12 cases (including our index case), and only 25% (3/12) of the patients underwent cyst fenestration 16.7% (2/12) required endoscopic fenestration and 8.3% (1/12) required microscopic fenestration.ConclusionGiant mesencephalothalamic dVRSs are rare in the pediatric population. These patients are usually symptomatic due to obstructive hydrocephalus. Surgical options are endoscopic third ventriculostomy, ventricular shunt procedures, or direct cyst fenestration (microscopic or endoscopic). Close follow-up is mandatory owing to the risk of progression of the disease. Cyst fenestration resolves symptoms immediately, as it addresses both hydrocephalus and mass effects due to the cystic lesion in the same setting.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic condition, characterized by hyperglycaemia, oxidative imbalance, pancreatic beta-cell death, and insulin insufficiency. Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) can ameliorate inflammatory response and oxidative stress. However, like other small-molecule drugs, free ARBs show poor in vivo efficacy and dose-limiting toxicities. Hence, in this study, we developed nano-formulations of telmisartan (TEL), an ARB, by encapsulating it inside a murine insulinoma cell-derived extracellular vesicle (nanoTEL) and a bio-mimetic lipid nanovesicle (lipoTEL). Both nano-formulations showed spherical morphology and sustained release of TEL. In vitro, nanoTEL restored oxidative equilibrium, attenuated reactive oxygen species levels, enhanced the uptake of glucose analogue, and increased the expression of glucose transporter protein 4 better than lipoTEL. In a streptozotocin-induced murine model of diabetes, nanoTEL lowered blood glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance, and promoted insulin synthesis and secretion significantly better than lipoTEL. Moreover, nanoTEL was found superior in ameliorating the pancreatic inflammatory microenvironment by regulating NF-kappa Bp65, HIF-1 alpha, and PPAR-gamma expression; modulating IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-10, and IL-4 levels and inducing the polarization of macrophage from M1 to M2. Further, nanoTEL administration induced angiogenesis and promoted the proliferation of pancreatic cells to restore the structural integrity of the islets of Langerhans more efficiently than lipoTEL. These findings collectively suggest that nanoTEL outperforms lipoTEL in restoring the function of pancreatic beta-cells by modulating the pancreatic inflammatory microenvironment and show potential for the treatment of DM.

AB  - Background We sought to estimate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) in childhood tuberculous meningitis. Methods Hospital records of children (6 months to 14 years) with tuberculous meningitis were retrospectively analyzed from September 2019 through January 2022. In September 2019, the first case of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity in tuberculous meningitis was identified in our division. Since then, all admitted children with tuberculous meningitis have been screened for paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity using the Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity Assessment Measure (PSH-AM). Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is suspected when any of the following are present: recurrence of fever after initial defervescence, episodic posturing, dystonia, or unexplained tachycardia. Outcome at 3 months was prospectively scored according to the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score. Results Forty-one hospital records of children with tuberculous meningitis were analyzed, and 6 of them had paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (probable paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, 5/6; possible paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, 1/6). Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity appeared after a mean duration of 17 weeks (range: 12-25 weeks) from the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis in 4 of 6 children and at 4 weeks in 2 of 6 children. Children with tuberculous meningitis who developed paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity were younger (median age: 5 years) compared with the nonparoxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity tuberculous meningitis cohort (median age: 10 years). A high proportion of children who developed paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity had hydrocephalus at presentation (5 of 6 [83.3%] vs 12 of 35 [34.3%], P = .035). Hospital stay was significantly prolonged in children with probable paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (mean: 71.2 +/- 26.8 days) compared with tuberculous meningitis without paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (mean: 20.8 +/- 11.6 days; P < .0001). Conclusion Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is a late complication of tuberculous meningitis observed in 14.6% cases and should be anticipated in children with reappearance of fever or neurologic worsening without any apparent cause.

AB  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) have been used as adjuncts to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthrocentesis but without any high-quality evidence. This systematic review collated data from published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide level-1 evidence on its efficacy. Trials published on the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science up to 4 August 2023 and comparing intra-articular PRP/PRF with control after TMJ arthrocentesis were eligible. Primary outcomes were pain and maximal mouth opening (MMO). Twelve RCTs were included. Pooled analysis showed that pain scores were significantly reduced with the use of PRP/PRF as compared with control at one month (MD: -0.96 95% CI: -1.58 to -0.35 I-2 = 86%), three months (MD: -1.22 95% CI: -1.86 to -0.59 I-2 = 85%), and >= six months (MD: -1.61 95% CI: -2.22 to -1.00 I-2 = 88%). Similarly, MMO was significantly improved in the PRP/PRF group at one month (MD: 2.40 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.77 I-2 = 88%), three months (MD: 3.17 95% CI: 1.63 to 4.72 I-2 = 91%), and >= six months (MD: 2.98 95% CI: 1.86 to 4.10 I-2 = 75%) as compared with the control group. Subgroup analysis for PRP and PRF failed to show any difference in outcomes. Moderate quality evidence suggests that PRP and PRF may significantly improve pain and MMO when used as adjuncts to TMJ arthrocentesis. Due to the small effect size, the clinical significance of the results is questionable. The high heterogeneity in PRP/PRF preparation methods is a significant limitation.

AB  - Background In today's modern world, shift working has become an important part of society and industrial work; prolonged wakefulness is a widespread phenomenon due to which the sleep patterns of individuals are getting disturbed, and many sleep disorders are arising. Purpose This study compared the sleep quality and insomnia of the security guards working the day and night shifts. Methods This observational study comprised 100 security guards from Delhi and the NCR region. Self-administered questionnaires, i.e., the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), were used to assess sleep quality and insomnia. Fifty questionnaires were filled out by the day shift security guards, and the night shift security guards filled out 50. The data underwent analysis, and a comparison was conducted between security workers on night and day shifts using a Mann-Whitney U test, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Results The result revealed a significant difference (95% CI; p < 0.05) for the variables, sleep quality and insomnia when compared between night and day shift working security guards. Among night shift workers, 74% reported issues with sleep quality and 48% experienced insomnia. In comparison, among day shift workers, 58% reported concerns about sleep quality, while 32% reported experiencing insomnia. Conclusion The study concluded that night-shift working security guards had poorer sleep quality and a higher prevalence of insomnia compared to their day-shift counterparts. These differences are highly significant, highlighting the potential adverse effects of night shift work on sleep health, urging the need for interventions to improve sleep quality and manage insomnia among night shift workers.

AB  - The rise of antimicrobial resistance has positioned ESKAPE pathogens as a serious global health threat, primarily due to the limitations and frequent failures of current treatment options. This growing risk has spurred the scientific community to seek innovative antibiotic therapies and improved oversight strategies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the origins and resistance mechanisms of ESKAPE pathogens, while also exploring next-generation treatment strategies for these infections. In addition, it will address both traditional and novel approaches to combating antibiotic resistance, offering insights into potential new therapeutic avenues. Emerging research underscores the urgency of developing new antimicrobial agents and strategies to overcome resistance, highlighting the need for novel drug classes and combination therapies. Advances in genomic technologies and a deeper understanding of microbial pathogenesis are crucial in identifying effective treatments. Integrating precision medicine and personalized approaches could enhance therapeutic efficacy. The review also emphasizes the importance of global collaboration in surveillance and stewardship, as well as policy reforms, enhanced diagnostic tools, and public awareness initiatives, to address resistance on a worldwide scale.

AB  - Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder that impairs motor abilities. Identifying maternal biomarker derangements can facilitate further evaluation for early diagnosis, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes. This study investigates the association between maternal biomarker derangements and CP development during the antenatal period. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases, following MOOSE guidelines. Data on participants exceeding biomarker thresholds (95th and 5th percentiles) were extracted for combined odds ratio estimation. Geometric mean differences, reported as multiples of the median (MoMs), were used to analyze changes in marker levels. Trimesterwise subgroup analysis and metaregression assessed the impact of variables on outcomes. Results: Five observational studies (1552 cases, 484,985 controls) revealed lower maternal pregnancyassociated plasma protein A levels were associated with CP (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22 to 2.09; I = 0%), with a -0.04 MoM geometric mean difference. Lower maternal beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels in first and second trimesters indicated a pooled OR = 1.18 (95% CI = 0.85 to 1.63; I = 57%). Sensitivity analysis showed an OR =1.40 (95% CI =1.08 to 1.82; I = 0%), with a -0.07 MoM geometric mean difference. Metaregression identified primigravida status as negatively influencing beta-HCG levels. Elevated nuchal translucency values and CP presented a pooled OR = 1.06 (95% CI = 0.77 to 1.44; I = 0%). Conclusion: Lower maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein A levels during the first trimester and lower beta-HCG levels in the first and second trimesters are associated with CP development in children.

AB  - A disbalance between immune regulatory cells and inflammatory cells is known to drive atherosclerosis. However, the exact mechanism is not clear. Here, we investigated the homing of immune regulatory cells, mainly, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) subsets in asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factor-exposed young individuals (dyslipidemia [DLP] group) and stable CAD patients (CAD group). Compared with healthy controls (HCs), Tregs frequency was reduced in both DLP and CAD groups but expressed high levels of CCR5 in both groups. The frequency of monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) was increased while polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) were decreased in CAD patients only. Interestingly, although unchanged in frequency, M-MDSCs of the DLP group expressed high levels of CCR5. Serum levels of chemokines (CCL5, CX3CL1, CCL26) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were higher in the DLP group. Stimulation with inflammatory cytokines augmented CCR5 expression in Tregs and M-MDSCs isolated from HCs. Activated endothelial cells showed elevated levels of CX3CL1 and CCL5 in vitro. Blocking CCR5 with D-Ala-peptide T-amide (DAPTA) increased Treg and M-MDSC frequency in C57Bl6 mice fed a high-fat diet. In accelerated atherosclerosis model, DAPTA treatment led to the formation of smooth muscle-rich plaque with less macrophages. Thus, we show that CCR5-CCL5 axis is instrumental in recruiting Tregs and M-MDSCs to dysfunctional endothelium in the asymptomatic phase of atherosclerosis contributing to atherosclerosis progression. Drugs targeting CCR5 in asymptomatic and CAD risk-factor/s-exposed individuals might be a novel therapeutic regime to diminish atherogenesis.

AB  - Introduction: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) warrants an early diagnosis and prompt management. Delay in diagnosis can result in repeated flares, permanent damage, and even death. There is a large variability in the time taken to diagnose SLE across the world. We undertook this study to determine the time taken for diagnosis of SLE in India and to identify the factors associated. Methods: Patients with SLE diagnosed within the previous 1 year as per Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics criteria (SLICC) 2012 criteria were included in a cross-sectional multicentre questionnaire-based survey. Demographic profile, self-reported socioeconomic status as per Kuppuswamy classification of socioeconomic status (version 2022) (SES), and several healthcare related parameters including referral pattern were recorded. Median time taken for diagnosis was used to demarcate early or late diagnosis and associated factors were explored. Results: We included 488 patients with SLE from 10 rheumatology centres. The median time to diagnosis was 6 months Interquartile Range (IQR 3,14.7) and within 3 months in about one third [150(30.7%)]. Very early diagnosis (<1 month) was established in 78(16.0%) patients. The mean SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) at diagnosis was 10.28+7.24. In univariate analysis, an older age, lower SES, non-southern state of residence and larger family size were significantly associated with late diagnosis. In the multivariate analysis, higher SES (AOR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98), multiple organ system involvement at initial presentation (AOR1.75 95%CI: 1.08-2.84) and place of residence in south Indian states (AOR1.92 95%CI: 1.24-2.97) had lesser odds of being associated with late diagnosis. Distance from the closest medical centre/professional did not influence the time to diagnosis. Majority of patients had first consulted a medical graduate (42.5%) or postgraduate doctor (48.2%), and referral to rheumatologist was largely done by postgraduate (65%) doctors. More than half of our patients (61%) self-finance their treatment. Conclusion: Median time to diagnosis of SLE was 6 months, 1/3rd being diagnosed within 3 months and 78(16.0%) with 1 month of symptom onset. Delay in diagnosis was noted in those belonging to lower socioeconomic strata and those with single organ disease. Distance to the health care facility did not influence time to diagnosis.

AB  - <black square> INTRODUCTION: This study compares the effectiveness of virtual reality simulators (VRS) and a saw bone model for learning lumbar pedicle screw insertion (LPSI) in neurosurgery. <black square> METHODS: A single-center, cross-sectional, randomized controlled laboratory investigation was conducted involving residents and fellows from a tertiary care referral hospital. Participants were divided into two groups (A and B). Group A performed 3 LPSI tasks: the first on a saw bone model, the second on VRS, and the third on another saw bone model. Group B completed 2 LPSI tasks: the first on a saw bone model and the second on another saw bone model. The accuracy of LPSI was evaluated through non- contrast computed tomography scans for the saw bone models, while the in-built application of VRS was utilized to check for accuracy of screw placement using the simulator. <black square> RESULTS: The study included 38 participants (19 in each group). Group A participants showed reduced mean entry point error (0.11 mm, P 0.024), increased mean purchase length (4.66 cm, P 0.007), and no cortical breaches (P P 0.031) when placing the second saw bone model screw. Similar improvements were observed among group A participants in PGY 1e3 while placing the second saw bone model screws. <black square> CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality simulators (VRS) prove to be an invaluable tool for teaching complex neurosurgical skills, such as LPSI, to trainees. This technology investment can enhance the learning curve while maintaining patient safety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) tumors are challenging due to their unique anatomical location. This study aimed to evaluate the complexities in dealing with such precarious CVJ extradural lesions over the decade. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients of extradural CVJ tumors operated between 2009 and 2018 were included. The demographic details, neurological status, surgical approach, extent of resection, type of fixation, complications, and outcome at final follow-up were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 39.5 +/- 20 years. Most (17/27) of the patients had involvement of a single level. Clivus was the most common (9/17) involved region followed by atlas (7/17) vertebrae. Majority of the patients (13/27) were operated through the posterior- only approach. About 15 patients (55.5%) had instability or extensive lesions that necessitated posterior fixation. None of the patients underwent anterior fixation. Gross and near total excision were achieved in 10 patients (37%) and 3 patients (11%) respectively while 14 patients underwent subtotal excision of tumor. On histopathological analysis, clival chordoma (8/27) was found to be the most common pathology followed by giant cell tumor (6/27), plasmacytoma (4/27), and multiple myeloma (2/27). Most patients (13 out of 27) had the same neurological status after the surgery. Six patients (22%) improved post-operatively with decreased weakness and spasticity. Thirteen (48%) patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study provides valuable insights into managing extradural CVJ tumors and highlights the importance of individualized approaches for optimal outcome.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity in all age groups worldwide. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a salvage procedure in patients with TBI. The outcome and quality of life following DC is questionable. Basal cisternostomy (BC) has been proposed to reduce edema and lead to brain relaxation. It was initially used as an adjunct in TBI patients, thereby improving outcomes. With gaining popularity among neurosurgeons, BC was used as a standalone approach in TBI patients. This network meta-analysis aims to analyze the role of BC either as an adjunct or as a standalone approach in managing TBI patients. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) was performed using the search strategy using the field terms and medical subheading terms (MeSH Terms) to retrieve studies describing the role of BC in patients with TBI either as an adjunct with DC or standalone treatment and their outcome. Results: Thirty-one articles were selected for full-text review and 18 articles were selected for the final analysis. BC alone group was found to have minimum in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.348; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.254 to 0.477) followed by DC combined with BC group (OR, 0.645; 95% CrI, 0.476 to 0.875). DC combined with the BC group was found to have a minimum duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 0.114; 95% CrI, 0.005 to 2.451) followed by the BC alone group (OR, 0.604; 95% CrI, 0.024 to 15.346). DC combined with the BC group were found to have the maximum Glasgow Outcome Scale score (OR, 1.661; 95% CrI, 0.907 to 3.041) followed by the BC alone group (OR, 1.553; 95% CrI, 0.907 to 3.041). Conclusions: Our analysis showed that BC alone was associated with lower in-hospital mortality rates in TBI patients. DC with BC had decreased the requirement of mechanical ventilation. However, larger multi-centric studies from other parts of the world are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background and objectives: The impact of chronic pancreatitis (CP) on quality of life (QOL) of children is not well established. Our objective was to evaluate the QOL, identify contributing factors, and determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression in children with CP in India.
   Methods: Children (8-18y old) with CP were prospectively enrolled across three pediatric gastroenterology centres in India. QOL was assessed using the pediatric QOL inventory (PedsQL 4.0) scale, administered to both children and their parents. Anxiety and depression was studied using the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS 25). Contributing factors were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. The data was compared against published QOL data in healthy Indian children.
   Results: 121 children with CP (boys-57.9 %, age at QOL-14 +/- 3.2years) were enrolled. A majority (82.7 %) had pain and advanced disease (Cambridge grade IV- 63.6 %). Children with CP had poorer QOL compared to controls (total score 74.6 +/- 16 vs. 87.5 +/- 11.1, p < 0.0001). QOL scores were similar across centres. Older children were similar to younger ones, except for a poorer emotional QOL. Taking QOL < -2 standard deviation (SD) of controls, similar to 35 % had poor physical (50.9 +/- 11.9) and 20% had poor psychosocial (PS) QOL score (52.1 +/- 7.2). On analysis, presence of pain and lower socio-economic status (SES) adversely affected both physical and PS-QOL. Additionally, girls had poorer PS-QOL than boys (Odds ratio 3.1, 95%CI:1.23-7.31). Anxiety and depression were uncommon (2,1.6 %).
   Conclusions: Patients with CP had impaired physical and psycho-social QOL. Presence of pain and lower SES adversely affected QOL. Psychiatric comorbidities were uncommon. (c) 2024 IAP and EPC.

AB  - Background Lung cancer and tuberculosis share similar risk factors, clinical spectrum, radiological features and it is difficult to differentiate but it is important to diagnose both conditions for targeted therapy and better outcome. Aims Our primary objective was to estimate the proportion of TB in primary biopsy proven non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cases. Material & methods This prospective observational study was conducted in the Departments of Medicine/Pulmonary Medicine/Medical Oncology and Microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for a period of 2 years (January 2020-December 2021). Patients with biopsy proven, primary non-small cell lung cancer were recruited and sputum samples were subjected to microbiological investigations to confirm tuberculosis. Comparison was done in two groups of lung cancer patients with confirmed TB (Group A) and without confirmed tuberculosis (Group B). Results Total 75 patients with biopsy proven, primary NSCLC were recruited and 16 % (12/75) were diagnosed with confirmed TB. Adenocarcinoma (36.48 %) and Squamous cell carcinoma (33.44 %) were the two predominant histopathological subtypes of NSCLC. About 57 (76 %) of them were found to be in stage IV of Lung cancer at initial presentation itself (75 % in group A & 74.6 % in group B; p value < 0.80). A majority of patients (11/12 cases; 91 %) of group A were males with a mean age of 59 +/- 7.5 years. The upper lobes of the lung were involved in 65 % (49/75) of the cases and showing a mass lesion on imaging (75 % in group A & 65 % in group B; p value < 0.52). Kaplan Meier survival revealed a median survival time of 11 months in subjects with only NSCLC and a median survival time of 4 months in the group with concomitant TB and NSCLC (p value < 0.44).

AB  - Introduction: Knowledge of the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the population is an important risk management strategy for the prevention of this disease. This is especially true for India, which has resource-restrained settings with an increased risk in a younger population for the development of the disease. An important modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension, with its influence on the development of CVD. Methods: The data from the first wave of the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) was used to calculate the 10-year CVD Risk Score among older adults >= 45 years using a WHO (2019) non-laboratory- based chart for South Asia. Univariate analysis was done using Pearson's chi-square test, and multivariable analysis using ordinal logistic regression. Categories of CVD risk score were considered as dependent variable. Socio-demographic variables, regular exercise, history of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia were considered as the independent variables. Relationship between CVD Risk score and hypertensives and self-reported hypertensives were presented using restricted cubic splines. Result: Two-thirds (68.8%) of the population had a 10-year CVD risk of <10, and 2.8% had a risk of >= 20%. The self-reported hypertensives were distributed linearly in restricted cubic splines, with a more scattered distribution in higher scores, while actual hypertensives showed a sigmoid pattern. Urban residents (OR-0.88), being unmarried (OR-0.86), being in the richer (OR-0.94) and richest (OR-0.86) monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) quintile and exercising regularly (OR-0.68) decreased the odds of being in a higher CVD risk score. Less than primary schooling (1.21) and diabetics (1.69) had higher odds for a higher CVD risk score. Conclusion: In this population, two-thirds had <10% risk for the development of CVD. The study shows a higher risk among rural, poor, and those with a lower education and lower CVD risk for those undertaking physical activity. The sigmoid pattern in actual hypertensives highlights the need for early detection. Even those with undiagnosed hypertension but with a higher BP had a similar risk for disease development, thus highlighting the need for an early detection of hypertension.

KW  - COARCTATION
AB  - Aim. The present study sought to evaluate the cardiovascular morphology and associated anomalies in patients with interrupted aortic arch (IAA) on CT angiography. Materials and Methods. A retrospective review of our departmental database was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with IAA on CT angiography between January 2014 and September 2022. The demographic information, anatomic characteristics, and associated cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with IAA were assessed. The morphological types of IAA were described in accordance with Celoria-Patton classification. Results. IAA was seen in 49 patients (32 males and 17 females; mean age: 15.9 months). The most common type of IAA based on the site of interruption was type A seen in 27/49 (55.1%) patients, while type B was observed in 22/49 (44.9%) patients. No patient of type C IAA was encountered in the current series. The most commonly associated cardiovascular anomaly was patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) seen in 45/49 (91.8%) patients. Atrial septal defect was seen in 15/49 (30.6%) patients, while 39/49 (79.6%) patients had a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Common arterial trunk was the most common abnormal ventriculo-arterial connection seen in 13/49 (26.5%) patients. Aorto-pulmonary window was associated with 7/49 (14.3%) patients. Conclusion. IAA is a rare congenital heart defect associated with an array of cardiovascular anomalies, most common being PDA and VSD. CT angiography is useful not only in diagnosing and characterizing the IAA but also in identifying associated anomalies which may have a bearing on the clinical presentation, prognosis, and surgical management.

AB  - Background: Chest X-ray, the established standard of confirming endotracheal tube (ETT) position, has important drawbacks including radiation exposure. Point-of-care airway ultrasound, which has been insufficiently studied in children, can overcome these problems. Materials and methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study done on children aged 2 months to 17 years undergoing intubation with cuffed ETT in the PICU. The ETT cuff was filled with saline and three ultrasonographic techniques were used- 1) Suprasternal (SS) method 2) Cricoid (CC) metho and 3) Tracheal ring (TR) method. Position of the ETT as determined by ultrasound and X-ray were compared. The main outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) for ultrasound-based methods vs. X-ray. For the TR method, concordance between the X-ray and ultrasound categories were taken. Results: Total 62 patients were enrolled. The sensitivity and specificity of SS method were 71% (95% CI: 57-83%) and 100% (40-100%). The CC distance method had an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.0). In the TR method, 98% of correct position on X-ray were correctly classified by USG. The agreement between X-ray and ultrasound categories with the cuff between the first and third tracheal rings, was very good [kappa (95% CI): 0.87 (0.70, 1.00), p <= 0.001)]. Conclusion: Bedside ultrasound is a good method to confirm ETT depth in children. The tracheal ring method had the best diagnostic accuracy and is easy to perform. The new method using cricoid cuff distance needs further validation in different ICU settings. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a subpopulation of cancer cells that are believed to initiate and drive cancer progression. In animal models, xenotransplanted CSCs have demonstrated the ability to produce tumors. Since their initial isolation in blood cancers, CSCs have been identified in various solid human cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In addition to their tumorigenic properties, dysregulated stem-cell-related signaling pathways-Wnt family member (Wnt), neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (Notch), and hedgehog-have been shown to endow CSCs with characteristics like self-renewal, phenotypic plasticity, and chemoresistance, contributing to recurrence and treatment failure. Consequently, CSCs have become targets for new therapeutic agents, with some currently in different phases of clinical trials. Notably, small molecule inhibitors of the hedgehog signaling pathway, such as vismodegib and glasdegib, have been approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. Other strategies for eradicating CSCs include natural compounds, nano-drug delivery systems, targeting mitochondria and the CSC microenvironment, autophagy, hyperthermia, and immunotherapy. Despite the extensive documentation of CSCs in OSCC since its first demonstration in head and neck (HN) SCC in 2007, none of these novel pharmacological approaches have yet entered clinical trials for OSCC patients. This narrative review summarizes the in vivo and in vitro evidence of CSCs and CSC-related signaling pathways in OSCC, highlighting their role in promoting chemoresistance and immunotherapy resistance. Additionally, it addresses methodological challenges and discusses future research directions to improve experimental systems and advance CSC studies.

AB  - Pr & eacute;cis: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to assess visual cortical activity in patients with primary open angle (POAG) and primary angle closure (PACG) glaucomas. There was decreased activity in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients correlating with the severity of glaucoma. Objective: To evaluate visual cortex activity using fNIRS in POAG and PACG compared with healthy controls. Methods: A total of 30 POAGs, 31 PACGs, and 30 healthy aged-matched controls from a single centre were recruited in this cross-sectional observational pilot study with purposive sampling. The POAG and PACG groups were age-matched but were not matched for disease severity at recruitment. All participants underwent fNIRS testing using a multichannel continuous-wave near-infrared system NIRSport 8x7 device (NIRx Medizintechnik GmbH). The visual cortex activity was evaluated in terms of the maximum amplitude of change in oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) concentration over 10 seconds, and a comparison was done among 3 groups. Both POAG and PACG groups were combined (termed as glaucoma group) to assess the relationship of visual cortical activity with disease severity (by visual field defect (mean deviation) and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness). Results: All participants showed the characteristic response of increased OxyHb and decreased deoxyhemoglobin during stimulus presentation. The maximum amplitude of change in OxyHb concentration over 10 seconds was significantly lower in both POAG and PACG groups compared with control in the right and left middle occipital gyri (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between PACG and POAG. Importantly, there was a negative correlation between the visual cortex activity with the visual field defects (mean deviation; P < 0.05) and a positive correlation with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in the glaucoma group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In patients with glaucoma, a reduction in visual cortical activity was observed, which may be indicative of neuronal degeneration occurring in the occipital cortex. Disease severity in glaucoma appears to be closely correlated with visual cortex activity. fNIRS can serve as a useful neuroimaging modality for assessing the hemodynamic and neurodegenerative changes in glaucoma.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the clinical outcomes and surgical safety between femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (CPCS) in vitrectomized eyes. Methods: A prospective interventional comparative study was conducted at a tertiary eye care center. Sixty consecutive cases requiring cataract surgery following pars plana vitrectomy were allocated into Group 1 (n = 30), who underwent FLACS with intraocular lens implantation, and Group 2 (n = 30), who underwent CPCS with intraocular lens implantation, and followed up for 3 months. Primary outcome measures were intraoperative ultrasonic cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) and intraoperative and postoperative complications. The secondary outcome measures were postoperative changes in endothelial cell count (ECC) and central corneal thickness (CCT). Results: Baseline corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), ECC, and CCT were comparable. Intraoperative CDE was significantly less in the FLACS group (8.11 vs. 15.83 percentage seconds; P = 0.012) with no intraoperative complication in either group. The postoperative CDVA was comparable between the groups with a trend toward earlier visual recovery in the FLACS group. The postoperative day (POD) 1 endothelial cell loss was higher in the CPCS group (7.54% vs. 2.05%), with the mean endothelial cell density being significantly higher in the FLACS group throughout the follow-up period (P < 0.05). POD-1 corneal edema was higher in the CPCS group compared to FLACS with no significant difference on follow-up. Intraoperative migration of silicone oil to the anterior chamber was observed in 40% versus 0% in the CPCS versus FLACS groups, respectively. Conclusion: FLACS can be safely performed in post-vitrectomy eyes with lesser intraoperative ultrasonic energy used, postoperative endothelial cell loss, and change in CCT compared to CPCS.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Rising hypertension from inadequate detection, noncompliance with treatment, and poor control presents a major public health challenge. Previously, adopting the strategy of self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) showed better hypertension detection, control, and medication adherence. However, evidence from India is scarce. Here, we present the trial protocol for the effectiveness of SMBP intervention in hypertension detection, blood pressure (BP) control, and medication adherence in a primary care set-up.Methods:EASE-BP is an open-label randomized trial in two distinct adult populations - part-A self-reported non-hypertensive population (total sample size: 400) and part-B known hypertensive population (total sample size: 332). The two populations will be sampled from two separate villages under the Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System. In both the populations, participants randomized in the intervention arm will receive a validated electronic BP device and will be advised to self-monitor BP for at least twice a month (or more). Those in the control arm will be advised to monitor BP for at least twice a month (or more) at the nearby health center. Participants in both arms will receive education on hypertension and atherosclerotic disease. In addition, adult family members in the households of randomized participants will be encouraged to monitor their BP. All participants and family members will be instructed to maintain a log of BP recordings in a diary that will be provided to them. Data will be collected at baseline and then every month for three-months. The primary outcome in part-A will be the incidence of new cases of hypertension during 3 months follow-up and in part-B will be the difference in SBP and rate of medication adherence at 3 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include (1) uptake of the intervention, (2) any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death, (3) additional yield of new cases of hypertension among the family members, and (4) integrating the intervention into the national programs for long-term noncommunicable disease goals.Conclusion:EASE-BP will help understand if SMBP improves hypertension detection, BP control, and medication adherence. Consequently, this will appraise policymakers on whether provision of BP instruments may be added to the national program for hypertension prevention and control.Trial Registry Number:This trial was registered under Clinical Trial Registry - India with reference number CTRI/2023/02/049949.

KW  - REAL-TIME PCR
AB  - Background: Increasing rates of macrolide and fluroquinolone resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) are being reported worldwide with resultant treatment failure. Aim: We aimed to determine the level of antibiotic resistance of MG in men who have sex with men (MSM) attending a sexually transmitted infections (STIs) clinic in New Delhi, India. Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting MgPa and pdhD genes were performed to detect MG rectal, urogenital or oropharyngeal infections in 180 MSM between January 2022 and June 2023. Macrolide resistance- associated mutations (MRM) and quinolone resistance-associated mutations (QRM) were detected by specific amplification of domain V of 23SrRNA gene and appropriate regions of p arC and gyrA genes respectively followed by sequencing. PCRbased screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection was also performed. Results: A total of 13 (7.2%) MSM were positive for MG infection. The most common site of infection was anorectum (8/13; 61.5%) followed by the urethra (5/13; 38.5%). None of the patients had infection at both the sites, and no oropharyngeal MG infection was detected. CT infection was detected in 37 (20.6%) MSM. Of the 13 MG-infected MSM, 6 (46.2%) were co-infected with CT. MRM and QRM were found in five (46.2%) and two (15.4%) strains, respectively. Both Quinolone resistance mutation (QRM)-harbouring strains also harboured MRM. All the five MG isolates carried the MRM A2071G. Both the QRM isolates co-harboured the parC and gyrA single-nucleotide polymorphisms. There was no correlation between the presence of antibiotic resistance and co-infection with CT (P = 0.52). Limitation: Because all patients in the study were MSM, the high rate of resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones could not be extrapolated for non-MSM patients. Conclusion: This is a report of an initial survey of antibiotic resistance to MG in a country where its diagnosis and treatment are not routinely available. We found a high prevalence of MG-carrying MRM, QRM and dual-class resistance in MSM in the absence of antibiotic exposure. This study mandates the need for both screening and detection of antimicrobial resistance against MG.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of bent ab interno needle goniectomy (BANG) in moderate to severe primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) eyes undergoing phacoemulsification (phaco). Design: Single-arm, prospective, interventional study. Methods: POAG patients with medically uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP), >15 mmHg for moderate and >12 mmHg for severe POAG, with visually significant cataract were recruited. All patients underwent BANG using a 26-gauge needle to excise 30 degrees of the trabecular meshwork, along with phaco. Primary outcome was IOP. Secondary outcomes were success rate, percentage reduction in IOP/antiglaucoma medications (AGMs), and intraoperative complications. Success at 12 months was defined as: criterion A: IOP <15 mmHg for moderate glaucoma or <12 mmHg for severe glaucoma with or without AGMs OR criterion B: reduction in number of AGMs by >1. Results: Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients underwent BANG + phaco. Mean age of the participants was 62.7 +/- 8.4 years and there were 25 males and seven females. At 12 months, a significant decrease was noted in both IOP (from 17.6 +/- 3.6 to 12 +/- 1.6 mmHg, 31.8%; P < 0.001) and AGMs (from 3.7 +/- 0.9 to 2.8 +/- 0.8, 24.3%; P < 0.001). Twenty percent or more reduction in IOP was achieved in 62.5% (20/32) of eyes. Overall success (meeting either of the criteria A or B) at 12 months was achieved in 87.5% eyes. Mild postoperative hyphema was noted in 10 (31.2%) eyes, and two eyes (6.2%) required additional filtration surgery at 7 months. Conclusion: A 30-degree BANG with phaco in patients of POAG appears to be a safe, effective and affordable MIGS for developing countries.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective interventions designed by science which has helped in preventing millions of deaths, especially in children. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was established by World Health Organization (WHO) in 1974 to develop immunization programmes throughout the world with polio, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. The WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR) has a disproportionately high burden of infectious diseases and has greatly benefitted from the EPI as compared to other regions with more than 90 per cent of the population having access to vaccines. The story of vaccines in South-East Asia is a testament to scientific progress, global collaboration, and unwavering commitment to public health. This article aims to discuss the journey of EPI in the WHO SEAR.

The median age of the cohort was 7 years (range: 1-12) and nearly two-thirds (62/95) were males. All acute cases were treated with intravenous pulse followed by tapering oral steroid therapy. All the recurrent entities received azathioprine with rituximab in few. Certain clinical and radiological features of CIS and immune and inflammatory characteristics in CSF were found to be significantly different in monophasic cases compared to first episode of recurrent cases.Conclusions:The CNS ADS show favourable response to immunotherapy. Azathioprine may be an effective long term immunomodulator, particularly in resource limited settings. Certain clinical, radiological and immunological features may differentiate monophasic illness from first episode of recurrent disorder.

AB  - Pain is a common complaint among a spectrum of diseases. Although an ideal objective method of pain assessment is lacking, several validated tools are available for use in clinical research and practice. The tool considerations are based upon the parameters to be assessed and factors specific to patient, disease, and availability of instruments. This review classifies and brings the key aspects of currently available pain assessment tools on a single platform to ease the selection process for researchers/practitioners. The tools utilized for pain assessment were collected from articles available in PubMed and Google Scholar databases and classified into the following domains: unidimensional, multi-dimensional, investigation-based, and computerized algorithm-based tools. Their purpose of use and limitations are reviewed. The unidimensional scales are used to describe only the characteristics of pain, like intensity (e.g. numerical rating scale), type (e.g. neuropathic pain questionnaire), or pattern. In contrast, multi-dimensional tools, like Mc Gill Questionnaire, assess not only pain as an individual symptom but also its influence on physical functioning and general well-being. However, certain components like ethnicity, age, cognitive impairment, sedation, and emotion become a limiting factor in selecting the scale. In addition to these scales, a potential role of parameters such as biopotentials/markers has also been shown in pain assessment.

AB  - Pain is a common complaint among a spectrum of diseases. Although an ideal objective method of pain assessment is lacking, several validated tools are available for use in clinical research and practice. The tool considerations are based upon the parameters to be assessed and factors specific to patient, disease, and availability of instruments. This review classifies and brings the key aspects of currently available pain assessment tools on a single platform to ease the selection process for researchers/practitioners. The tools utilized for pain assessment were collected from articles available in PubMed and Google Scholar databases and classified into the following domains: unidimensional, multi-dimensional, investigation-based, and computerized algorithm-based tools. Their purpose of use and limitations are reviewed. The unidimensional scales are used to describe only the characteristics of pain, like intensity (e.g. numerical rating scale), type (e.g. neuropathic pain questionnaire), or pattern. In contrast, multi-dimensional tools, like Mc Gill Questionnaire, assess not only pain as an individual symptom but also its influence on physical functioning and general well-being. However, certain components like ethnicity, age, cognitive impairment, sedation, and emotion become a limiting factor in selecting the scale. In addition to these scales, a potential role of parameters such as biopotentials/markers has also been shown in pain assessment. Last, artificial intelligence is also being applied in evaluation of pain. Pain measurement is subjective in nature as assessed through questionnaires and observational tools. Currently, multi-dimensional approaches of pain assessment are available, which can lead to precision pain management.

AB  - Sepsis is a major contributor to poor child health outcomes around the world. The high morbidity, mortality, and societal cost associated with paediatric sepsis render it a global health priority, as summarised in Paper 1 of this Series. Sepsis is characterised by a dysregulated host response to infection that manifests as organ failure, and children are uniquely susceptible to sepsis, as discussed in Paper 2. The focus of this third Series paper is quality improvement in paediatric sepsis. The 2017 WHO resolution on sepsis outlined key aims to reduce the burden of sepsis. As of 2024, only a small number of countries have implemented systematic, paediatric-focused quality improvement programmes to raise sepsis awareness, enhance recognition of sepsis, promote timely treatment, and provide long-term support for paediatric sepsis survivors. We examine programme successes and systematic barriers to quality improvement targeting paediatric sepsis. We highlight the need for programme design to consider the entire patient journey, starting with prevention, caregiver awareness, recognition at home, education of the healthcare workforce, development of health-care systems, and establishment of long-term family and survivor support extending beyond the intensive care unit. Building on lessons learnt from existing quality improvement programmes, we outline implementation strategies and measures to enable benchmarking. Ultimately, quality improvement on a global scale can only be accelerated through a global learning platform focusing on paediatric sepsis.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Cervical flexion-induced myelopathy, also known as Hirayama disease (HD), is a lower motor neuron disorder seen mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting the C7-T1 myotomes, presenting as asymmetric weakness with wasting of one or both the distal upper limbs. We aimed to describe the clinical features, electrophysiology, and radiologic features of HD in a tertiary care institute in northern India.Methods:One hundred and forty patients between 2017 and 2022 with clinical and imaging features consistent with HD were retrospectively reviewed from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Comprehensive Neuromuscular Diseases center database.Results:Majority were males with the mean age of onset of illness being 17.8 years. The median duration of the symptoms was 3 (1.5-4) years. Sixty-nine (49%) patients had unilateral involvement, and the disease was actively progressing in 88 (63%) patients at presentation. Two families had history of HD in two (1.4%) siblings. Electromyography showed abnormal findings in the clinically involved limb in all the patients and in the clinically uninvolved limb in 17/50 (34%) patients. Flexion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated forward dural displacement in 134 (96%) patients and asymmetric cord flattening in 124 (88.5%) patients. Disability was graded as mild, moderate, and severe; 12 (13%) had severe disability. The majority were managed conservatively, and four underwent surgery for HD.Conclusion:A high index of suspicion of HD needs to be kept in a young male presenting with distal upper limb weakness and atrophy. Dynamic MRI of the cervical spine in young adults presenting with hand wasting is inevitable. This disease needs to be managed aggressively and early to prevent serious dysfunction and loss of productivity.

KW  - PREDICTION
KW  - RISK
AB  - Background:Timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is challenging. We aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic performance of sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques for the prediction of neonatal sepsis.Methods:We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases using "neonate," "sepsis" and "machine learning" as search terms. We included studies that developed or validated an ML algorithm to predict neonatal sepsis. Those incorporating automated vital-sign data were excluded. Among 5008 records, 74 full-text articles were screened. Two reviewers extracted information as per the CHARMS (CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies) checklist. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guideline extension for diagnostic test accuracy reviews and used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment. Primary outcome was a predictive performance of ML models in terms of sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values. We generated a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics curve for pooled analysis.Results:Of 19 studies (15,984 participants) with 76 ML models, the random forest algorithm was the most employed. The candidate predictors per model ranged from 5 to 93; most included birth weight and gestation. None performed external validation. The risk of bias was high (18 studies). For the prediction of any sepsis (14 studies), pooled sensitivity was 0.87 (95% credible interval: 0.75-0.94) and specificity was 0.89 (95% credible interval: 0.77-0.95). Pooled area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.94 (95% credible interval: 0.92-0.96). All studies, except one, used data from high- or upper-middle-income countries. With unavailable probability thresholds, the performance could not be assessed with sufficient precision.Conclusions:ML techniques have good diagnostic accuracy for neonatal sepsis. The need for the development of context-specific models from high-burden countries is highlighted.

TI  - Serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Endostatin as an Adjunct to Clinical Decision Making in Managing Radiation-induced Changes Post Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Spetzler Martin Grade 3 Arteriovenous Malformations Patients: A Pilot Study
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
KW  - Biomarkers
KW  - GKRS
KW  - Radiation induced changes
KW  - SM grade 3 AVMs
KW  - IMAGING CHANGES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation induced changes (RIC) are the most common complications observed post Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and may be observed within 6e 18 months post procedure. It has been observed that almost one-third of RICs are symptomatic and half of them are persistent. There is no way to predict which patients will develop these changes and to what extent. METHODS: This was a prospective analytical pilot study with the aim of understanding the role of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin as predictive factors for clinically symptomatic RIC in intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of Spetzler Martin (SM) grade 3 being managed with primary GKRS. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were analyzed; 60% of them had a history of bleed. The median volume of AVM nidus was 4.36 mL. One-third of the patients had no imaging changes suggestive of RIC at 1 year follow-up and 2 of the patients had symptomatic RIC needing intervention. Before GKRS, the median values of serum concentration of endostatin and VEGF were 34.98 ng/mL and 168.37 pg/mL, respectively. The serum values of VEGF at 1 month post GKRS was much lower than the pre-GKRS values but not found to be predictive of RIC. No correlation could be observed with the levels of serum endostatin and RIC. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients may develop resistant edema and necrosis post GKRS for intracranial AVMs, which may warrant medical and surgical intervention. Serum biomarkers like VEGF and endostatin may vary in the post GKRS period and can be used to identify at-risk cases, however more studies are needed to decide on appropriate time of sampling and identify clinically relevant predictive factors.

The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India. Methods: This was a prospective contralateral eye study that included patients with myopia and myopic astigmatism seeking refractive correction. The eligibility criteria included normal corneal topography, an epithelial thickness less than 60 microns, a calculated percentage tissue ablation (with 100-microns flap) less than 40%, a calculated residual stromal bed thickness (with 100-microns flap) more than 300 microns, and willingness to participate and follow up. Patients with glaucoma, cataracts, other visually disabling ocular pathologies, and a history of past ocular surgery were excluded. All patients underwent LASIK with 80-microns LASIK in one eye and 100-microns LASIK in the other eye. The patients were followed up for 6 months, and the results were analyzed. Results: The study included 216 eyes of 108 patients. The mean preoperative spherical equivalent in the 80-microns group and the 100-microns group was -3.53 +/- 1.81 and -3.69 +/- 1.32 diopters, respectively (P = 0.78). The mean 6 months decimal postoperative UCVA was 0.98 +/- 0.13 in the 80-microns group and 0.97 +/- 0.14 in the 100-microns group (P = 0.99). The postoperative change in the higher-order aberration profile was comparable in both groups (P = 0.78). The percentage tissue ablation was significantly lower in the 80-microns group (P = 0.002). The incidence of flap micro striae and OBL was higher in the 80-microns group, while neither of these had any visual implications. Conclusion: The study concluded that 80-microns LASIK is an efficacious and safe alternative to 100-micron LASIK, especially useful in patients with higher myopia.

AB  - Objectives Fatty atrophy and fatty infiltration have been considered as limiting factors for rotator cuff repair. The metabolic activity of the muscle can be measured noninvasively by PET. In our study, we aim to compare the metabolic activity between the shoulders with rotator cuff tears and normal shoulders. Methods All the patients with unilateral full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included. The patients were divided into two groups based on fatty atrophy and the metabolic activities of the rotator cuff muscles, trapezius, and deltoid were calculated using an F-18-2-deoxy-d-glucose PET-computed tomography scan for comparison. Results A total of 17 patients were included. The standardized uptake values were compared between the affected shoulder and the normal shoulders. There was a significant increase in uptake in the insertion sites and musculotendinous junctions in the rotator cuff torn group. The standardized uptake values showed no significant difference between the low-grade and high-grade groups. Conclusion Our first hypothesis was also proven wrong; when we found that there was no statistically significant difference in the metabolic activity in muscle bellies of normal shoulders and those with rotator cuff tears. Our second hypothesis was proven wrong when found that there was no statistically significant difference in the metabolic activities of rotator cuff muscles between high-grade and low-grade fatty atrophy groups. The metabolic activities of the middle deltoid and trapezius are inversely related. Based on the findings of our study, fatty atrophy or fatty infiltration alone cannot be considered a limiting factor for rotator cuff repair.

AB  - Introduction: The molecular basis and mechanisms of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas (JNA) pathogenesis are still unknown. Despite being a rare and benign neoplasm, JNA is a locally aggressive and potentially destructive head and neck neoplasm, typically found in young males. The advancement of genome technologies and analytical tools has provided an un-paralleled opportunity to explore the intricacy of JNA. The present study provides the first evidence of the involvement of Y- chromosome genes in JNA. Methods: A total of 13 JNA patients at an advanced disease stage and five age-matched male controls were registered for this study. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis was conducted followed by functional analysis to understand the molecular mechanism of the JNA. Results: WES analysis revealed a high prevalence of mutations in 14 genes within the protein-coding, male-specific region of the Y- chromosome of young males (mean age: 13.8 +/- 2.4) with JNA. These mutations, occurring at 28 distinct positions, were char-acterized as moderate to high impact and were prevalent in nine JNA patients but not in the control group. The most frequently mutated genes were USP9Y and UTY, followed by KDM5D, DDX3Y, and TSPY4. The expression of USP9Y, UTY, and DDX3Y was found to be co-modulated, implying their coordinated regulation as a complex. Furthermore, somatic mutations were detected in genes previously linked to JNA. Conclusion: The wide array of genetic mutations in the Y-chromosome male-specific region, along with the somatic alterations identified in JNA, provides novel insights into JNA pathophysiology.

AB  - Immune-mediated epilepsy (IME) constitutes a substantial proportion of drug-refractory epilepsies. Rapid diagnosis and prompt immunosuppression are required along with antiseizure medications (ASMs). Here we report three unrelated children who presented with fever, encephalopathy, and refractory epilepsy and subsequently tested positive for rare intraneuronal and surface receptor antibodies, namely, contactin-associated protein like 2 (CASPR2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), and paraneoplastic antigen Ma2 (PNMA2). In all of them, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was noncontributory. Electroencephalography showed nonspecific interictal epileptic discharges. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) brain scan revealed abnormality in metabolic pattern with hypermetabolism in basal ganglia, thalami, frontotemporal cortices, and cerebellar hemispheres, consistent with autoimmune encephalitis. Immunosuppression was initiated along with ASMs. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in GAD65 antibody IME and >50% seizure reduction in CASPR2 and PNMA2 antibody IME. A variable degree of behavioral problems persisted in all. Early immunosuppression is warranted in IME, but does not universally guarantee a complete response.

AB  - Background & Aims: : Since the onset of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been significant opportunity to leverage virtual platforms for communication and dissemination of knowledge. An online survey was conducted to examine the viewpoints of World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) leaders concerning the necessity, primary priority areas, and implementation strategies for a virtual global gastroenterology educational program. Methods: : We conducted a survey of leaders of WGO member societies to assess their opinions on creating opportunities for global education using virtual platforms, identifying practical implementation steps and priority educational areas. Results: : Responses were obtained from 57/117 (48.7%) contacted leaders with 56/57 (98.2%) identifying such a need. Five mutually exclusive priority educational topics were proposed in the survey: clinical gastroenterology, endoscopy, nutritional support, research methodology, and professional development. Overall, most participants prioritized clinical gastroenterology (45/57; 78.9%) and endoscopy/hand skills (27/57; 47.3%) as educational topics to be addressed by the virtual global gastroenterology educational program. A majority of WGO member society leaders surveyed favored monthly teaching activities (33/57; 57.8%), ideally carried out between 1500-2100 local time (31/57; 54.3%), ideally with no administrative fees (47/57; 82.4%). Conclusions: : This truly global survey of WGO member societies achieved a good response rate and provides important insights into the need for and scope of future virtual education programs under the aegis of the WGO.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Candidaemia is a potentially life-threatening emergency in the intensive care units (ICUs). Surveillance using common protocols in a large network of hospitals would give meaningful estimates of the burden of candidaemia and central line associated candidaemia in low resource settings. We undertook this study to understand the burden and epidemiology of candidaemia in multiple ICUs of India, leveraging the previously established healthcare-associated infections (HAI) surveillance network. Our aim was also to assess the impact that the pandemic of COVID-19 had on the rates and associated mortality of candidaemia. Methods: This study included adult patients from 67 Indian ICUs in the AIIMS-HAI surveillance network that conducted BSI surveillance in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICUs during and before the COVID-19 pandemic periods. Hospitals identified healthcare-associated candidaemia and central line associated candidaemia and reported clinical and microbiological data to the network as per established and previously published protocols. Results: A total of 401,601 patient days and 126,051 central line days were reported during the study period. A total of 377 events of candidaemia were recorded. The overall rate of candidaemia in our network was 0.93/1000 patient days. The rate of candidaemia in COVID-19 ICUs (2.52/1000 patient days) was significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 ICUs (1.05/patient days) during the pandemic period. The rate of central line associated candidaemia in COVID-19 ICUs (4.53/1000 central line days) was also significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 ICUs (1.73/1000 central line days) during the pandemic period. Mortality in COVID-19 ICUs associated with candidaemia (61%) was higher than that in non-COVID-19 ICUs (41%). A total of 435 Candida spp. were isolated. C. tropicalis (26.7%) was the most common species. C. auris accounted for 17.5% of all isolates and had a high mortality. Conclusion: Patients in ICUs with COVID-19 infections have a much higher risk of candidaemia, CLAC and its associated mortality. Network level data helps in understanding the true burden of candidaemia and will help in framing infection control policies for the country.

AB  - Introduction: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting men globally, with a significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). With the recent therapeutic advancements and improvements in survival, there is a need to understand the determinants of HRQOL in metastatic prostate cancer patients to optimize treatment strategies for quality of life as the number of survivors increases. The aim of this study was to identify clinical variables that affect HRQOL and its domains in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study in patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at a tertiary cancer center in India. Baseline clinical features, treatment details, and completed Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), composed of FACT-general (FACT-G) and prostate cancer-specific concerns subscale (PCS) and FACT-P Trial Outcome Index (FACT-P TOI) questionnaires, were collected. The mean total, as well as individual domain scores, were calculated. Additionally, these were stratified by the current treatment being received by patients. Linear regression was used to identify independent factors affecting HRQOL in these patients. Results: Of the 106 enrolled patients, 84 completed the FACT-P questionnaire and were included in the analysis. The median age was 66 years, and at the time of assessment, 3 patients (3.6%) were receiving androgen deprivation therapy only, 53 patients (63.1%) were on ADT + androgen receptor-targeted agents (ARTAs), and 18 patients (21.4%) patients received ADT + chemotherapy. The mean (+/- standard deviation) of the FACT-P TOI score was 70.33 (+/- 15.16); the PCS subscale was the most affected, followed by functional well-being. Patients on chemotherapy scored significantly higher on PCS, but the composite scores were not significantly different. Univariable regression identified obesity (body mass index > 25 kg/m(2)) and duration of first-line treatment as significant predictors of better HRQOL; however, obesity was the only independent predictor in multivariable analysis (beta = 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 15.0; p = 0.022). Obesity also independently predicted a better FACT-P and its physical well-being domain score and PCS. Conclusion: Prostate cancer patients experience impaired QoL, especially in the prostate cancer-specific and functional well-being domains. Lower BMI is an independent predictor of poor QoL, and this requires efforts to assess the impact of strategies to manage the nutritional status of patients with metastatic disease on QoL outcomes.

AB  - Background:Previous studies have localized the origin of "generalized" spike-wave discharges of idiopathic generalized epilepsies to specific brain regions. Although there are studies in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) which have investigated the origin of spike-wave discharges, reports on the propagation of discharges are sparse.Objective:The current study investigated the propagation of spike-wave discharges in JME, which was investigated by statistically comparing the electroencephalography (EEG)-derived cortical source activity during (a) various phases of spike-wave discharge versus background (eyes closed) activity, and (b) various phases of the first spike wave versus the corresponding phase of subsequent spike waves.Material and Methods:Fourteen patients with JME who had generalized spike/polyspike and slow wave discharges in interictal EEG were included in the study. A total of 179 spike waves (first discernible spike wave - 55; subsequent spike waves - 124) were selected for source localization. Source analysis was carried out using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Statistical analyses to estimate the probability distribution of differences in cortical activity between (a) eight phases of epileptic discharge versus background (eyes closed) activity and (b) phases of the first spike wave versus the corresponding phases of subsequent spike waves were performed by paired t-tests and corrected for multiple testing using LORETA-KEY software.Results:Widespread activation of cortical voxels (more than 94%) was observed during all phases of epileptic discharge except the initial phase (pre-first spike) and terminal phase (post-peak of the subsequent wave). The parietal lobe, which was the most activated lobe during the pre-first spike, was found to be the least activated during the post-peak of first and subsequent waves. More than 93% of voxels in the sublobar region were consistently activated during all eight phases of discharge.Conclusion:The study findings suggest that the activity generated from the restricted brain network involving parietal lobe could be propagated through sublobar structures to cause widespread cortical activation during the subsequent phases of the spike-wave cycle.

TI  - Utility of microRNA analysis in exhaled breath condensate of sarcoidosis and mediastinal tuberculosis patients: a pilot study
T2  - ERJ OPEN RESEARCH
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
KW  - BIOMARKERS
AB  - Background Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis (TB) are the two most common causes of granulomatous mediastinal lymphadenopathy. These often exhibit overlapping clinical and radiological characteristics, rendering accurate diagnosis difficult. MicroRNA (miRNA) analysis is increasingly utilised as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a noninvasive technique for biomarker evaluation in different respiratory conditions. We attempted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in the EBC of sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB patients. Methods EBC was obtained from subjects with a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB. EBC was also obtained from age- and sex-matched control subjects. From EBC, miRNA isolation, cDNA preparation and qPCR array were performed. Differentially expressed miRNAs were shortlisted. Further validation was conducted in the EBC of a new subset. Results Subjects with a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis (50) and TB (50), and control subjects (50) were included. qPCR array from EBC (20 subjects from each group) shortlisted eight differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-126, miR-132, miR-139-3p, miR-139-5p, miR-181c, miR-454, miR-512-3p and miR-362-5p). In the validation set (EBC of 30 subjects from each group), miR-126 and miR-132 were differentially expressed significantly. The miR-126 and miR-132 expression ratio could differentiate sarcoidosis from mediastinal TB with an AUC of 0.618 (82% specificity and 41% sensitivity). Conclusion While EBC miRNA expression is significantly and differently altered in sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB, a simple ratiometric approach failed to provide clinically useful signatures for differentiating between the two in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

TI  - Case Report: Multiple Metastatic Primary Multidrug-Resistant Tubercular Abscesses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
KW  - PYOMYOSITIS
AB  - This case report presents an atypical manifestation of tuberculosis in a 21-year-old male who presented with multiple subcutaneous swellings in the bilateral heel, left elbow, and base of the left third finger for the previous 6 months. The patient also experienced loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss. Despite initial suspicion of bacterial abscesses, antibiotics did not lead to significant improvement. Further investigations revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and findings suggestive of osteomyelitis on imaging. Gene Xpert testing confirmed multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the causative agent. The patient was prescribed a bedaquiline-based multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimen, which resulted in reduction in swelling size. This report highlights the challenges in diagnosing and managing complex cases of primary multiple tubercular abscesses, especially with drug-resistant strains, emphasizing the importance of timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management for successful outcomes.

AB  - Plant microRNAs (miRNA) are regularly consumed orally along with diet, gaining attention for their RNA-based drug potential because of their ability to regulate mammalian gene expression specifically at the post-transcriptional level. Medicinally valued plants are well known for their anti-inflammatory property; however, the contribution of their miRNA in managing inflammation has been less studied. We investigated miRNA from four medicinally valued regularly consumed spices, and validated one of the most potential miRNA 'Clo-miR-14' for its thermal stability, and absorption in the plasma samples of RA patient's by RT-PCR. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the effect of Clo-miR-14 in ameliorating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) like symptoms. Our results suggest that 'Clo-miR-14,' an exogenous miRNA present in Curcuma longa, absorbed through regular diet, has robust thermal stability at 100degree celsius in humans. It significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1 beta, IL-6) and RA-like symptoms, suggesting that plant-based miRNA could be a promising candidate as an RNA-based drug for RA pathogenesis.

TI  - INVESTIGATION OF BIOACTIVE FLAVONOID SOURCED FROM CITRUS FRUITS ON ITS EFFECT UPON CARDIAC HYPERTROPHY: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION
AB  - Objectives:Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive process of the heart. It is a leading cause for heart failure, which in turn has a high mortality rate. Hesperidin (HES) is a bioactive flavanone glycoside with agonistic activity on Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), reported to be an inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy signalling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the cardio-protective effect of this bioactive flavonoid in isoproterenol induced cardiac hypertrophy.Methods:The work was started after getting approval from the institutional animal ethics committee (IAEC). Male albino Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups (n=6) and administered isoproterenol (3 mg/kg/day s.c.) or hesperidin (200 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and isoproterenol or enalapril (30 mg/kg/day p.o.) and isoproterenol or a combination of hesperidin and enalapril for 28 days. On the 29 th day, rats were anaesthetized followed by cannulation of coronary artery to record hemodynamic parameters. Blood sample was collected and heart was excised to evaluate for parameters like biochemical, histopathological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies.Results:Hesperidin significantly normalized heart weight/body weight ratio and cardiomyocyte area in the treated rats. Moreover, hesperidin improved cardiac function and attenuated pathological changes as seen in the heart tissue sections. A decline in the levels of cardiac injury markers (CK-MB, LDH) and inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, IL-6) was observed.Additionally, hesperidin suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis along with an increased PPAR-gamma expression.Conclusion:Hesperidin has a good potential for attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and acts by virtue of its PPAR-gamma agonistic, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant properties.

AB  - Male infertility is an emerging health problem and there is an urgent need to search for therapeutic options. Altered metabolic states such as obesity and metabolic syndrome have been linked with male infertility. Therefore, searching for metabolic biomarkers is vital. Present work aimed to study metabolic alterations in infertile males. The seminal levels of L-Carnitine (LC), Kisspeptin (Kiss1) and Ghrelin (GHRL) were evaluated in 14 infertile and 10 fertile males. Baseline semen analysis was performed for both cases and controls. The levels of LC and Kiss1 were found to be lower in infertile patients as compared to fertile controls and the difference was found to be statistically significant. There was no significant difference observed in GHRL levels between patients and controls. The study presents a preliminary data where LC and Kiss1 levels could possibly studied further for their association with male infertility. But to confirm their association with pathogenesis of male infertility, future studies need to be conducted in larger cohorts.

KW  - miosis
KW  - phakic intra-ocular lens
AB  - We describe and assess the efficiency of a novel technique of placing implantable collamer lens (ICL) footplates in the sulcus in poorly dilated pupils utilizing perioptic holes and two instruments simultaneously (Sinskey hook and ICL manipulator). Twelve eyes of 10 patients underwent ICL implantation through this technique. The technique employs a bimanual approach engaging perioptic holes in the eyes with intraoperative miosis. Perioptic holes were engaged with a Sinskey hook and pulled slightly back, while the footplates were tucked under the iris by using an ICL manipulator. All patients had uneventful surgery. At 1 week follow-up, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA) was -0.01 +/- 0.04 logMAR with a mean vault of 606.17 +/- 108.33 microns. No complications were noted. However, too small a pupil is a limiting factor; this technique can be of use in up to mid-dilated pupils. Bimanual placement of haptics of ICL may represent a safe and effective technique in insufficient mydriasis or intraoperative pupillary miosis.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Functional dissociative seizures (FDS) are very common in neurology clinics, they straddle both neurology and psychiatry. In India, scarce resources and guidelines are available for effectively conveying their diagnosis and management, which leads to a substantial gap in care. We aimed to provide an instructional module for FDS, tailored to clinicians, patients, and caregivers in Hindi, to enhance communication of diagnosis and facilitate suitable management strategies.Methods:The instructional module development process was based on clinical settings and expert opinions. A standard translation process was performed to ensure the linguistic and cultural equivalence. Validation was carried out by a panel of 15 validators, comprising 13 neurologists and two psychiatrists, to identify key psychoeducation components and their significance. They were provided a questionnaire consisting of five questions that were related to completeness, understandability, legibility, clarification, and usefulness of educational material for clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Items were rated using a 5-point Likert scale.Results:There was agreement on four items (Q1, Q3, Q4, and Q5), whereas approximately 85% of the validators agreed on the remaining one item (Q2). The instructional module demonstrated high content validity as indicated by both item level-content validity index (0.98) and scale-level content validity index (0.97), alongside content validity ratio and modified kappa statistics.Conclusions:The developed Hindi instructional module for FDS serves as a valuable tool to enhance the communication of FDS diagnosis and dispel misconceptions. This offers a comprehensive resource for clinicians, patients, and caregivers in India, potentially bridging gap in FDS care.

AB  - Purpose:As per the recent World Health Organization estimates, approximately 2.2 billion people have near and distance vision impairment (VI) globally, and out of this almost 50% is avoidable.Methods:The Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Visual Impairment survey was a cross-sectional study conducted in September 2021, using cluster random sampling in 42 clusters with a cluster size of 140, giving a total of 6000 participants. Two teams comprising of trained optometrists and social workers conducted the ocular examination which included unaided, pinhole, and aided visual acuity assessments followed by examination of the anterior segment and lens. Distance visual acuity was measured using simplified tumbling "E" charts of different sizes for VA of 6/12, 6/18, and 6/60. The lens assessment was done in an un-dilated pupil with torch light by the optometrist.Results:Overall, 6520 individuals aged 6 years and above were enumerated, of whom 5440 (83.4%) were examined. The response rate for examination was better among females (93.1%) than males (73.9%), and it decreased from 93.8% in the age group 6-15 years to 77.1% in the 45+ age group. The prevalence of blindness and VI were 0.18% (95% CI: 0.06-0.29) and 4.19% (95%CI: 3.65-4.72), respectively. The major causes of VI in all age groups were uncorrected refractive error (65.4%), cataract (23.7%), cataract surgical complications (2.6%), corneal opacity (0.4%), and other posterior segment diseases (7.5%). The effective cataract surgical coverage (eCSC) was 61.8%, effective refractive error coverage (eREC) for distance vision was 59.8%, and eREC for near vision was 47.0%.Conclusion:The RAAVI methodology is suitable to measure effective coverage in the general population, both for baseline measurement and periodic monitoring. The 2030 targets for the surveyed district are 90% eCSC and 100% eREC. Such exercises need to be conducted in each district of the country to determine the baseline and target values of effective coverage.

AB  - Background Ataxia telangiectasia is a multisystem disorder with progressive neurodegeneration. Corticosteroids can improve neurological functioning in patients with the disorder but adrenal suppression and symptom recurrence on treatment discontinuation has limited their use, prompting the development of novel steroid delivery systems. The aim of the ATTeST study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-erythrocyte delivery of dexamethasone sodium phosphate compared with placebo in children with ataxia telangiectasia. Methods This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 22 centres in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Tunisia, the UK, and the USA). Eligible participants were children aged 6 years or older weighing more than 15 kg who met clinical criteria for ataxia telangiectasia but who had preserved autonomous gait. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to low-dose (approximately 5-10 mg), or high-dose (approximately 14-22 mg) intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate, or placebo, using an independent interactive web response system, with minimisation for sex and age (6-9 years vs >= 10 years). Intravenous intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate was administered once a month for 6 months. Participants, employees of the sponsor, investigators, all raters of efficacy endpoints, and central reviewers were masked to treatment assignment and dose allocations. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the modified International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (mICARS) from baseline to month 6, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials. gov (NCT02770807) and is complete. Findings Between March 2, 2017, and May 13, 2021, 239 children were assessed for eligibility, of whom 176 were randomly assigned. One patient assigned to high-dose intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate did not initiate treatment. 175 patients received at least one dose of treatment (59 patients received the low dose and 57 received the high dose of intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate, and 59 received placebo). The mITT population comprised 164 participants (56 children in the low-dose group, 54 children in the high-dose group, and 54 in the placebo group). Compared with the placebo group, no differences were identified with regard to change in mICARS score from baseline to 6 months in the low-dose group (least squares mean difference -1<middle dot>37 [95% CI -2<middle dot>932 to 0<middle dot>190]) or the high-dose group (-1<middle dot>40 [-2<middle dot>957 to 0<middle dot>152]; p=0<middle dot>0765). Adverse events were reported in 43 (73%) of 59 participants in the low-dose group, 47 (82%) of 57 participants in the high-dose group, and 43 (73%) of 59 participants in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were observed in six (10%) of 59 participants in the low- dose group, seven (12%) of 57 participants in the high-dose group, and seven (12%) of 59 participants in the placebo group. There were no reports of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hirsutism, or Cushingoid appearance in any of the treatment groups, nor any treatment-related deaths.
   Interpretation Although there were no safety concerns, the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, possibly related to delays in treatment reducing the number of participants who received treatment as outlined in the protocol, and potentially different treatment effects according to age. Studies of intra-erythrocyte delivery of dexamethasone sodium phosphate will continue in participants aged 6-9 years, on the basis of findings from subgroup analyses from this trial.

AB  - Purpose To describe the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the Asia Cornea Society Infectious Keratitis Study (ACSIKS). Methods All bacterial isolates from ACSIKS underwent repeat microbiological identification in a central repository in Singapore. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination was conducted for isolates of P. aeruginosa against thirteen antibiotics from 6 different classes, and categorized based on Clinical Laboratory Standard Institutes' reference ranges. The percentage rates of resistance (non-susceptibility) to each antibiotic included isolates of both intermediate and complete resistance. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes. Results Of the 1493 unique bacterial specimens obtained from ACSIKS, 319 isolates were of P. aeruginosa. The majority of isolates were from centers in India (n = 118, 37%), Singapore (n = 90, 28.2%), Hong Kong (n = 31, 9.7%) and Thailand (n = 30, 9.4%). The cumulative antibiotic resistance rate was the greatest for polymyxin B (100%), ciprofloxacin (17.6%) and moxifloxacin (16.9%), and lowest for cefepime (11.6%) and amikacin (13.5%). Isolates from India demonstrated the highest antibiotic resistance rates of all the centers, and included moxifloxacin (47.5%) and ciprofloxacin (39.8%). Forty-eight of the 59 MDR isolates also originated from India. Antibiotic resistance rates were significantly lower in the other ACSIKS centers, and were typically less than 10%. Conclusions The antibiotic resistance profiles of P. aeruginosa varied between different countries. While it was low for most countries, substantial antibiotic resistance and a significant number of multi-drug resistant isolates were noted in the centers from India.

AB  - Background: The Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dosage (LEDD) calculation algorithms help in capturing and harmonization of Parkinson's Disease (PD) therapies. Analyzing these updates is essential for validating their effectiveness. Objective: To assess updated LEDD conversion factors in capturing the newer therapies in PD and therapy modules in different geographical cohorts. Methods: Data were sourced from 10 Centers from 6 countries representing 2 different continents. The study compared the LEDD conversion factors proposed by Tomlinson et al and Jost et al, alongside investigating demographic disparities. Results: The analysis involved 2943 subjects; 87% (n = 2577) met the UK Brain Bank criteria for PD. The LEDD differed significantly across methodologies (Tomlinson vs. Jost, 598 mg vs 610 mg, P < 0.0001). Geographical disparities highlighted variations in PD onset age (P < 0.0001). Jost and Tomlinson's calculations demonstrated consistency within but significant differences across countries (P < 0.0001).Age at onset revealed statistically significant differences in LEDD requirements (P < 0.0001), which were particularly higher in 21-50 years (718 mg vs 566 mg). This subgroup also demonstrated increased usage of non-Levodopa therapies (P < 0.0001). Men exhibited higher total LEDD (P = 0.001). 34% reported dyskinesia, associated with higher LEDD (756 mg, P < 0.0001). Surgically treated patients also had higher LEDD (P < 0.0001) and a significant difference between Jost and Tomlinson dosages (761 mg vs716mg) reflecting the incorporation of newer therapeutic molecules. Conclusion: This analysis delineates the importance of updated LEDD algorithms and intricacies in the landscape of PD treatment, underscored by geographical, age-related, and gender-specific variations, in real-life management scenarios.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered an ongoing global pandemic, necessitating rapid and accurate diagnostic tools to monitor emerging variants and preparedness for the next outbreak. This study introduces a multidisciplinary approach combining Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and Machine learning to comprehensively characterize and strain-type SARS-CoV-2 variants. FTIR analysis of pharyngeal swabs from different pandemic waves revealed distinct vibrational profiles, particularly in nucleic acid and protein vibrations. The spectral wavenumber range between 1150 and 1240 cm(-1) was identified as the classification marker, distinguishing Healthy (noninfected) and infected samples. Machine learning algorithms, with neural networks exhibiting superior performance, successfully classified SARS-CoV-2 variants with a remarkable accuracy of 98.6%. Neural networks were also able to identify and differentiate a small cohort infected with influenza A variants, H1N1 and H3N2, from SARS-CoV-2-infected and Healthy samples. FTIR measurements further show distinct red shifts in vibrational energy and secondary structural alterations in the spike proteins of more transmissible forms of SARS-CoV-2 variants, providing experimental validation of the computational data. This integrated approach presents a promising avenue for rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 variant identification, enhancing our understanding of viral evolution and aiding in diagnostic advancements, particularly for an infectious disease with unknown etiology.

AB  - <bold>Introduction</bold> Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be one of the deadliest infectious diseases over the centuries, killing more people worldwide than any other single infectious disease. There is an urgent need for additional strategies which can expedite efforts to combat TB including a preventive vaccine. In this endeavour, we have developed a protocol for a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in India that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two TB vaccines; namely, VPM1002 and Immuvac (M.w) (Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii) (MIP) among healthy household contacts (HHCs) of sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. <bold>Methods and analysis</bold> In the three-arm randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial study protocol, a total of 12 000 HHCs (aged 6-99 years) of sputum smear-positive PTB patients will be randomised to receive either of the two vaccine candidates VPM1002 and MIP or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint is the prevention of microbiologically confirmed TB. Secondary endpoints will include (1) prevention against Latent TB infection, (2) incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events in study participants, (3) efficacy of vaccine in prevention of PTB/extra PTB in different age groups (6-18 years, 19-35 years, 36-60 years and above 60 years) and (4) immunogenicity of VPM1002 and MIP at month 2 and month 6 after first vaccination in terms of flow cytometric analysis of M.Tb specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting cytokines and Luminex assays for the presence of different cytokines in the sera and supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures stimulated with whole cell lysates of M.Tb and subsequently similar analysis for the cases who develop TB postvaccination during the follow-up period. <bold>Ethics and dissemination</bold> Ethics committees' approvals have been granted by the Institutional Human Ethics Committees of all participating centres in this study and the names of the ethics committees and approvals are as follows: (1) National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT)-Chennai (including subsites): ECR/135/Inst/TN/2013/RR-19, Approval No. 390/NIRT-Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC)/2018 dated 5 December 2018 (NIRT-Madurai-ECR/1365/Inst/TN/2020; approval dated 8 June 2020; NIRT, Vellore: ECR/1215/Inst/TN/2019; approval dated 26 September 2020); (2) All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi (including subsites)-Institute Ethics Committee, ECR/547/Inst/DL/2014/RR-17 ECR/538/Inst/DL/2014/RR-20; approval No.IEC-385/06-07-2018, approval OP-28/05.04.2019 and SFH- ECR/593/Inst/DL/2014/RR-20 IEC/VMMC/SJH/project/2019-05/25 ; 23 May 2019; (3) National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (NITRD), Delhi: ECR/315/Inst/DL/2013/RR-19; approval IEC-No-NITRD/EC/2019/9004; 8 January 2019; (4) Pune-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and subsite-ECR/23/Inst/MH/2013/RR-19; IEC-NARI/EC/approval/2018/196; 29 May 2018; (5) Regional Medical Research Centre-Bhubaneshwar-ECR/911/Inst/OR-2017/RR-21; approval, dated 25 April 2018; Subsites- AIIMS, Bhubaneshwar ECR/534/Inst/OD/2014/RR-17 and 20 approval No. T/EMF/Pulm.

AB  - Background and rationale: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is one of the major causes of early mortality among children undergoing induction chemotherapy for haematological malignancies. FN occurs in up to 80 % of the children undergoing intensive chemotherapy and FN specific mortality is as high as 10 %. The management of high-risk FN (HR-FN) is by early initiation of broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) which is continued till blood count recovery. Adverse effects of prolonged EAT among children without proven infective focus have questioned the rationale behind the duration of EAT. The non inferiority of early stoppage of EAT in patients with low-risk FN (LR-FN) when afebrile for 48 h, irrespective of marrow recovery, is proven among adults and children. However, there is paucity of data regarding the same in children with HR-FN. This study aims to determine whether early discontinuation of EAT in children with HR-FN without proven infective focus who become afebrile and awaiting marrow recovery, would reduce antibiotic duration and their adverse effects without any negative consequences for patients. Objective: To compare the rates of recurrent fever in paediatric patients (2-18 years) with HR-FN when EAT is continued till marrow recovery (control group) versus when stopped early at defervescence irrespective of marrow recovery (study group). Methodology: This is the study protocol of a phase 3, single centre, randomized, open label, non-inferiority clinical trial. The primary outcome is the rate of fever recurrence among patients with HR-FN, when EAT is stopped early irrespective of marrow recovery (study group) and will be compared to the rate of fever recurrence on continuation of EAT till marrow recovery which is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 500/mm3 3 (control group). Secondary outcomes include the comparison of duration of antibiotic use, mortality rates, hospital re-admission rates, requirement of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics, therapeutic anti-fungal usage and need for organ support between the study and the control groups. A total of 280 children with acute leukaemia undergoing EAT for grade 3 or severe FN (ANC <500/mu L) without clinico-laboratory evidence of infective foci are being randomized in the ratio of 1:1 between the study and the control group after defervescence for 48 h. The patients will be followed up for primary outcome (fever recurrence) till the end of induction period (day 35) or recovery of ANC >= 500/mm( 3) whichever is earlier. Expected outcome: ESAT-HR FN study is the first large phase 3 randomised study to assess the impact of early stoppage of EAT irrespective of marrow recovery among a homogenous paediatric cohort of HR-FN in the setting of induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. This study will be seminal in addressing the duration of EAT in HR-FN among children without infective foci and if proven to be non-inferior this strategy will help to reduce the adverse effects from prolonged antibiotic use, the emergence of drug resistance, decrease hospital stay length and overall health care costs.

AB  - Timely diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is of paramount importance to improve survival. The Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition invited national and international experts to identify and review important management and research questions. These covered the definition, age appropriate stepwise workup for the etiology, non-invasive diagnosis and management of cerebral edema, prognostic scores, criteria for listing for liver transplantation (LT) and bridging therapies in PALF. Statements and recommendations based on evidences assessed using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system were developed, deliberated and critically reappraised by circulation. The final consensus recommendations along with relevant published background information are presented here. We expect that these recommendations would be followed by the pediatric and adult medical fraternity to improve the outcomes of PALF patients.

AB  - Introduction: Cyst formation after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a rare, delayed but important complication. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment is essential for good outcome. Methods: We analysed our institute's Gamma knife treatment records from 2008 to 2023 and analysed AVM treated patients by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Patients with cyst formation and with adequate follow up were identified. Clinical details, management and prognosis of these patients was studied in detail along with prior literature review. Results: A total of 921 AVM patients were treated in the above period and 7 patients were identified with cyst formation. The mean nidus volume was 12.98 ml, the mean radio surgical marginal dose was 23.57 Gy and maximal dose 47.21 Gy. The mean interval gap between SRS and cyst detection was 6.45 years. The mean volume of cyst cavity formed was 47.85 ml. Patients presented either with features of raised intracranial pressure (3) or focal neurological deficits (3) or seizures (1). 3 patients had achieved angiographic nidus obliteration at the time of cyst detection. Treatment was mostly on surgical lines with cyst fenestration(2 patients), excision (3 patients) and emergency decompressive craniectomy (1 patient). 1 patient required additional Ommaya insertion. Conservative management was followed for 1 patient. Residual nidus was treated either by concomitant excision or embolization or redo GKRS. Favourable outcome was seen in 6 out of 7 patients (85.71%) post cyst management with symptomatic and radiological improvement whereas 1 patient (14.28%) died due to refractory status epilepticus secondary to malignant cerebral edema. Conclusion: Cyst formation after GKRS for AVM treatment is an often-neglected complication due to its low incidence and often long latency period. Long term follow up of patients is hence necessary for prompt recognition. Diagnostic DSA should be done in all patients with cysts to look for residual nidus. Asymptomatic ones can be followed up conservatively while surgical treatment is required for symptomatic cases. Ventricular diversion like Ommaya or cystoperitoneal shunt may be necessary in some cases. Treatment outcome is usually favourable provided timely detection is done.

AB  - Lipid nanoparticles have been recognized as a powerful weapon for delivering various imaging and therapeutic agents to the localized solid tumors, especially brain tumors individually or in combination. Promisingly, lipid-based nanosystems have been considered as safe delivery systems which are even approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). One recent spotlight of lipid nanoparticles as COVID-19 mRNA vaccines where lipid nanoparticles play an important role in effectively protecting and delivering mRNA to the desired cells. As of now, successive progress in lipid-based nanocarriers, viz., nanoliposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, ionizable lipid nanostructures, etc., with better biochemical and biophysical stabilities, has been noticed and reported. Moreover, lipid nanostructures have been considered as versatile therapeutics platforms for a variety of diseases due to their biocompatibility, ability to protect and deliver therapeutics to the localized site, and better reproducibility and reliability. However, lipid nanoparticles still face morphological and biochemical changes upon their in vivo administration. These changes alter the specific biological and pathological response of lipid nanoparticles during their personalized brain tumor theranostics. Second, lipid nanomedicine still faces major challenges of zero premature leakage of loaded cargo, long-term colloidal stability, and off targeting. Herein, various lipid-based nanomedicines for brain tumor imaging and therapeutics "theranostics" have been reviewed and summarized considering major aspects of preclinical and clinical studies. On the other hand, engineering and biological challenges of lipid theranostics systems with relevant advantages and guidelines for clinical practice for different brain tumors have also been discussed. This review provides in-depth knowledge of lipid nanoparticle-based theranostics agents for brain tumor imaging and therapeutics.

TI  - A cascade training protocol for schoolteachers on oral health: Investigating the influence of primary and secondary mentors
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background Oral health holds paramount importance for overall well-being, particularly among school-aged children, where inadequate oral health can cause significant discomfort and impede educational performance. Despite its critical nature, oral health awareness and practices within Indian school communities remain suboptimal. There exists an urgent necessity for efficacious educational initiatives to bridge this gap and foster oral health awareness among both schoolteachers and students.Protocol This monitored training introduces a pioneering cascade model training initiative aimed at evaluating its impact on enhancing oral health knowledge among schoolteachers and students in Indian schools. A total of 100 school teachers from 50 Centre government schools will undergo training in two distinct sessions. Following this, two teachers from each school will be selected to further train 24 class monitors from grades 6-9, who will subsequently impart knowledge to approximately 40 students per class. This phase of the training will be ongoing, ensuring training consistency through online supervision and active participation of the expert team in training activities with newly designated master trainers. Pre- and post-training assessments will be conducted at each level to gauge the monitored training's effectiveness. The entire training is projected to conclude within a year.Discussion This cascade model monitored training initiative represents a novel approach in promoting oral health awareness in Indian schools, marking a pioneering endeavor in this domain. Through this program, we aim to empower 1200 class monitors as master trainers and reach approximately 24,000 school students across 480 supervised training sessions. The establishment of master trainers through a cascade process, coupled with the engagement of the CDER expert team, ensures accurate dissemination of information at every stage. The comprehensive evaluation facilitated by pre- and post-training assessments at each level further enhances the program's effectiveness, laying a solid foundation for future oral health initiatives within school communities.

AB  - Introduction: This study conducts the first meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the aggregated risk of malignancy associated with each category of the Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology (PSC) system for reporting respiratory cytology. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords "(Lung, Respiratory specimens) AND (Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology System)." Articles were assessed for risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. After excluding inadequate samples, sensitivity and specificity for various cut-off points. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves and diagnostic odds ratios were pooled to assess diagnostic accuracy. Results: Five studies, totaling 3,489 cases, were included. Sensitivity and specificity for the "Atypical and higher risk categories" considered positive were 60% (95% CI, 51-68%) and 87% (95% CI, 81-92%), respectively. For the "Suspicious for malignancy and higher risk categories" considered positive, sensitivity and specificity were 49% (95% CI, 40-58%) and 95% (95% CI, 92-97%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the "Malignant" category considered positive for malignancy were 42% (95% CI, 33-52%) and 97% (95% CI, 92-99%), respectively. The pooled area under the curve ranged from 68 to 75% for each cut-off. Conclusion: This meta-analysis underscores the PSC system's accuracy in reporting respiratory cytology. It highlights the diagnostic importance of the "Suspicious" and "Malignant" categories in identifying malignancy, and the utility of the "Atypical" category for initial screening. These findings support the PSC system's role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making in respiratory cytology.

AB  - Variant anatomy in the axillary region is of great clinical significance. It is one of the most frequently accessed regions for radical dissection surgery. During routine dissection of embalmed cadavers, we found a rare case of two accessory muscular slips emerging from the lateral border of latissimus dorsi (LD) and the inferolateral border of pectoralis major (PM), crossing the neurovascular structures in the axilla and merging distally together to the brachial fascia at the upper end of humerus below the bicipital groove. The accessory slip from LD is commonly referred to as the "axillary arch" in literature. We identified the accessory slip from the PM crossing over the axilla as pectoralis quartus. These aberrant slips can cause neurovascular compression in the axilla and can have clinical implications. Prior knowledge of the variant anatomy is the key to successful surgery in the axilla, thereby avoiding inadvertent injuries and post-operative complications.

AB  - Hypoxic insult to the fetal brain causes loss of vulnerable premyelinating oligodendrocytes and arrested oligodendrocyte differentiation. Astrocytes influence oligodendrocyte differentiation and the astrocytic response to hypoxia could affect oligodendrocyte maturation under hypoxia. To identify pathways by which astrocytes influence oligodendroglial maturation in hypoxic injury, human fetal neural stem cell-derived astrocytes were exposed to 0.2 % oxygen for 48 hours. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the upregulation of the cholesterolbiosynthesis pathway in hypoxia-exposed astrocytes. Hypoxia-exposed primary astrocytes and astrocytic cell line (SVG) showed increased expression of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), squalene epoxidase (SQLE), apolipoprotein E (apoE) and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) on qPCR and Western blot. Hypoxic SVG also showed increased cholesterol content in cells and culture supernatants and increased cell surface expression of ABCA1. Interestingly hypoxia-exposed premyelinating oligodendrocytes (Mo3.13) showed reduced cholesterol along with decreased expression of HMGCR and SQLE on qPCR and Western blot. Exogenous cholesterol increased the differentiation of Mo3.13 as measured by increased expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) on flow cytometry. Hypoxia exposure resulted in increased cholesterol transport from astrocytes to oligodendrocytes in cocultures with BODIPY-cholesterol labelled SVG and membrane-labelled Mo3.13. As exogenous cholesterol enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation, our findings indicate that increased cholesterol synthesis by astrocytes and transport to oligodendrocytes could supplement oligodendroglial maturation in conditions of hypoxic brain injury in neonates.

AB  - Background: Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative commensal of human gut. Surprisingly, the role of E. coli in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been explored until now. Methods: Human gut microbiota composition and meta-gut resistome were evaluated using metagenomics. Antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli isolates against different class of antibiotics was investigated. Further, the genome sequence analysis of E. coli isolates was performed to gain insight into the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanism and virulence factors. Gut proteome of UC and non-UC was examined to understand the effect of resistant bacteria on host physiology. Results: In UC patients, meta-gut resistome was found to be dominated by AMR genes (829) compared to healthy controls (HC) [518]. The metagenome study revealed a higher prevalence of AMR genes in the rural population (378 in HC; 607 in UC) compared to the urban (340 in HC; 578 in UC). Approximately, 40% of all E. coli isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR), with higher prevalence in UC (43.75%) compared to HC (33.33%). Up-regulated expression of antimicrobial human proteins (lactotransferrin, azurocidin, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and neutrophil defensin 3) and inflammatory mediator (Protein S100-A9 and Protein S100-A8) suggest microbial infection in UC gut. Conclusions: In addition to the conventional culturomics method, a multi-omics strategy provides deeper insights into the disease etiology, emergence of MDR pathobionts, and their roles in the disruption of the healthy gut environment in UC patients.

AB  - Introduction: Pediatric orbital tumors encompass a wide spectrum of neoplasms, many of which are malignant small round cell tumors with overlapping histology. Sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations are undifferentiated round cell sarcomas (URCS) characterized by BCOR rearrangements or internal tandem duplications, having distinct clinical features. Being previously unrecognized in the orbit, they have potential for misdiagnosis. Patients: We describe two cases of orbital sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations. Results: Both girls, 8 and 16 months of age, respectively, presented with progressive proptosis. Both tumors showed sheets of round to ovoid cells with monomorphic nuclei and frequent mitoses. Delicate branching capillaries and myxoid stroma were absent. Diffuse BCOR, cyclin D1, and SATB2 immunopositivity was present. Conclusion: Orbital sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations are extremely rare. Pathologists should have high index of suspicion for novel genetically defined entities in the differential diagnosis of pediatric orbital URCS and perform appropriate ancillary tests for accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Background: & objective: : The existence of visually identical cryptic Aspergillus species that can be distinguished only by molecular techniques is becoming more widely acknowledged. For the majority of antifungal drugs, these are known to exhibit a greater minimal inhibitory concentration in vitro. For the purpose of receiving the proper care, it is crucial to identify these species at right time. Our aim in this work is to identify and describe the Aspergillus species that are cryptic from all of the clinical samples. Methods: Routine samples from inpatients and outpatients received in department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, showing growth of Aspergillus species were included in this study. Phenotypic and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation- Time of Flight identified isolates were analysed for cryptic species, by PCR and ITS/f3 - tubulin sequencing. In accordance with CLSI recommendations, antifungal susceptibility testing was conducted using micro broth dilution. Results: Of the 94 isolates, 54 A. fumigatus, , 34 A. flavus, , 3 A. nidulans, , 2 A. terreus, and 1 A. niger were morphologically identified. MALDI-TOF misidentified 2 A. nidulans isolates and 1 A, stellatus isolate. The f3 - tubulin sequence analysis revealed that 2 isolates (2.08 %) were cryptic, one was A. stellatus and another one was A. tubingensis. .

AB  - Introduction The increasing interest in teledentistry since the COVID-19 pandemic warrants an evaluation of dentists' willingness to adopt it. This study aimed to develop a questionnaire to assess dentist's intention to use teledentistry and the associated factors. Methods A literature search was used to identify items for the questionnaire. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was adopted as framework. A Delphi panel was constituted of researchers with relevant publications and the International Association of Dental Research e-Oral Health Network members. Three Delphi consultations were conducted to establish consensus on items. Consensus was set at 80% agreement and content validity ratio (CVR), reaffirmed iteratively. Results Nineteen out of 25 (76%) invited experts participated in the first round, 17 in the second and 15 in the third. The preliminary questionnaire had 81 items in three sections, reduced to 66, 45 and 33 items in the first, second and third rounds. After revision, the final version comprised eight items assessing dentists' backgrounds in Sect. 1, seven items identifying teledentistry uses in Sect. 2, and 17 items assessing intention to use teledentistry and its determinants in seven dimensions in Sect. 3. The initial CVR was 0.45, which increased to 0.80 at the end of the third round. Conclusion A survey tool was developed to assess the acceptance of teledentistry, and its determinants based on the UTAUT2 framework through consensus among teledentistry experts. The tool had excellent validity and needs further evaluation of its psychometric properties.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of individuals affected by bone pathologies globally has sparked catastrophic concerns. Ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fractures alone impact an estimated 1.71 billion people worldwide. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in interacting with the host through the synthesis of a diverse range of metabolites called gut-associated metabolites (GAMs), which originate from external dietary substrates or endogenous host compounds. Many metabolic disorders have been linked to alterations in the gut microbiota's activity and composition. The development of metabolic illnesses has been linked to certain microbiota-derived metabolites, such as branched-chain amino acids, bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan, trimethylamine N-oxide, and indole derivatives. Moreover, the modulation of gut microbiota through biotics (prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics) presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Biotics selectively promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, thereby enhancing the production of GAMs with potential beneficial effects on bone metabolism. Understanding the intricate interplay between GAMs, and bone-associated genes through molecular informatics holds significant promise for early diagnosis, prognosis, and novel treatment strategies for various bone disorders.

AB  - Objectives: The study compared real-time motor cortex excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-derived parameters between children with epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS) and age-matched neurotypical controls. The EE-SWAS group received steroids as standard of care and were longitudinally followed for three months. Materials & Methods: Children aged 5-12 years with immunotherapy-naive EE-SWAS (spike-wave-index >= 50 %) and neurotypical controls were enrolled. Cognitive and behavioral assessments were performed using valid psychometric tools. Real-time motor cortex excitability was assessed by measuring resting motor threshold (RMT), short intra-cortical inhibition (SICI) and long intra-cortical inhibition (LICI) in both groups. In EE-SWAS group, a follow up evaluation with TMS at 4- and 12-week intervals, EEG, and neurobehavioral assessments at 12-weeks were performed to assess the effect of steroids on cortical excitability and to determine electroclinical outcome. Results: Forty-eight children with suspected EE-SWAS and 26 neurotypical controls were screened; 20 were enrolled in each group. Children with EE-SWAS (mean age: 8.05 +/- 1.76 years) had cognitive and behavioral problems (20/20), and ongoing seizures (12/20). At baseline, the dominant motor cortex was significantly inhibited in the EE-SWAS group compared to neurotypical children{RMT(%)[86.3 +/- 6.96 vs 58.05 +/- 4.71(p < 0.0001)]; LICI(%)[55.05 +/- 4.39 vs 73.9 +/- 3.75(p < 0.0001)]; SICI(%)[39.2 +/- 4.36 vs 55.45 +/- 4.78(p < 0.0001)]}. Reversal of motor cortex inhibition was sequentially observed in EE-SWAS group at 4- and 12-week follow-ups{(RMT[4, 12 weeks]: 71.45 +/- 9.83, 63.45 +/- 8.48); (LICI[4, 12 weeks]: 66.00 +/- 6.26, 74.50 +/- 5.36); (SICI[4, 12 weeks]: 49.35 +/- 6.24, 56.05 +/- 5.57)}[repeated-measures ANOVA: p < 0.0001]. Conclusion: Motor cortex is remotely inhibited in EE-SWAS, which may contribute to neurobehavioral impairment. Steroids can disinhibit/reverse the epilepsy-induced motor cortex inhibition leading to improvement in neurobehavior.

AB  - Regarding medico-legal malpractice suits, lawyers and insurers focus on informed consent documentation. Unfortunately, there is no standard protocol for obtaining informed consent for platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections. The objective of the present study was to create a pre-designed, evidence-based informed consent form specifically for PRP injections. The current evidence on the medico-legal implications of PRP injections was accessed, as well as informed consent in general and specifically informed consent in PRP injections. Additionally, we interviewed orthopaedic surgeons and patients who had undergone PRP injections in the past year using a semi-structured approach. A legally valid and evidence-based informed consent form for PRP injections ensures rights, encouraging open communication and transparency between the patient and surgeon. Moreover, if a lawsuit arose, informed consent would be a critical document in surgeons' defence and would withstand scrutiny from lawyers and the judiciary. An evidence-based informed consent form for PRP injections was elaborated and reviewed by a legal expert to ensure adherence to legal proprieties. The final form of the informed consent for PRP injection was administered for one year and validated at our institution.

AB  - Background: India relies primarily on direct smear microscopy for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. However, the low sensitivity of smear microscopy emphasizes the need to improve its performance. We recently described the development of 'TBDetect' kit which showed improved performance over direct smear microscopy at National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) in India. Methods: The present study was aimed to assess the operational feasibility of 'TBDetect' microscopy in field settings. This was evaluated by (i) assessing the performance of 'TBDetect' microscopy vs. LED-fluorescence microscopy (LED-FM) on consecutive presumptive pulmonary TB patients (n = 5300) who attended Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs, n = 13) under 4 NRLs at Bhubaneswar, Bhopal, Chennai, and New Delhi, and (ii) obtaining feedback from Scientists (n = 10) and laboratory technicians (n = 42) using semi-structured questionnaires under the following parameters: feasibility of initiation of 'TBDetect' microscopy in DMCs, sample preparation and testing, training, time-to-result, logistics, and troubleshooting. A scoring questionnaire was also used to assess 'TBDetect' microscopy vs. LED-FM and statistical significance of the scores was calculated using paired t-test. Results: The overall positivity of 'TBDetect' microscopy was 10.32% (547/5300) vs. 8.96% (475/5300) of LED-FM at all sites and the increment in positivity was significant (p = 0.019). In addition, 'TBDetect' microscopy yielded an increment in smear grade status over LED-FM (p = 0.043). The feedback from the study-in-charge and kit users indicated that 'TBDetect' microscopy was easily adapted in point-of-care settings. An analysis of scoring feedback suggested that it was easy to perform and observe in comparison to LED-FM (p < 0.005). Conclusions: This study established the feasibility of 'TBDetect' microscopy in field settings.

AB  - Objective(s): To evaluate and compare diagnostic performance of ultrasound-based reporting systems IOTA SR, ADNEX, GIRADS, ORADS for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Study design: A prospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital's Obstetrics and Gynaecology department evaluated pre-operative ultrasound imaging for adnexal masses in 80 cases, comparing various reporting systems' sensitivity and specificity against histopathology as gold standard using STATA version 17.0 for data analysis. Results: Among the 80 masses, 55 % (44/80) were confirmed as benign on histopathology, while 45 % were identified as malignant. The sensitivity and specificity of SR was 100 % (95 %CI: 90.0-100) and 97.1 % (95 %CI: 84.7-99.9) respectively. Eleven masses (13.8 %) were inconclusive, reducing specificity to 75 % (95 % CI:59.7-86.8). In ADNEX optimal cut-off for risk of malignancy was 34.1 % with sensitivity of 86.1 % (95% CI: 70.5-95.3) and specificity of 90.9% (95% CI: 78.3-97.5). Considering GIRADS 4-5 and risk threshold of >= 10 % (ORADS 4-5) as predictors of malignancy sensitivity was 100 % (95 %CI: 90.3-100) and specificity was 70.5 % (95 %CI: 54.8-83.2) for GIRADS and ORADS. All reporting systems were comparable (p = 0.7). ADNEX identified 72.7 % (8/11) of inconclusive cases, outperforming GIRADS/ORADS which correctly classified 27.2 % (3/ 11) cases. When applied to misclassified GIRADS/ORADS 4-5 category, ADNEX demonstrated superior performance by correctly classifying 76.9% (10/13) masses, while SR achieved correct classification in only 38.5% (5/ 13) masses. Conclusion(s): All classification systems showed comparable accuracy in malignancy risk identification on imaging. GIRADS/ORADS tended to overestimate malignancy risk. The present study recommends a two-step strategy, leveraging higher specificity of ADNEX model for improved stratification of adnexal masses.

AB  - The possible vulnerability of the male reproductive system to environmental pollutants such as air pollution necessitates a thorough investigation of the underlying mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of male reproductive function. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of the filtered fraction of diesel exhaust (predominantly comprising gases) on male reproductive function in Wistar rat model. Adult male rats were randomly assigned into three groups (n=8/group): Control (unexposed) group (CG-A), the Clean air group in WBE chamber (CAG-A), and Filtered diesel exhaust group in WBE chamber (FDG-A). The exposure protocol for CAG-A and FDG-A was 6 h/day x 5d/week x 6 weeks,evaluation of sperm parameters, testicular histopathology, quantification of hormones (testosterone, LH, FSH, 17(3-Estradiol, and prolactin), and GST levels were performed. Results showed that WBE to FDE leads to a significant decline in sperm concentration (p=0.008, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.014, CAG-A vs FDG-A), motility (p=0.008, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.029, CAG-A vs FDG-A), serum testosterone (p=0.024, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.007, CAG-A vs FDG-A), testicular testosterone (p=0.008, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.028, CAG-A vs FDG-A), 17(3-Estradiol (p=0.007, CG-A vs FDG-A), and GST levels (p=0.0002, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.0019, CAG-A vs FDG-A). These findings demonstrate the disruption of testosterone-estradiol balance in the intratesticular milieu without significant alterations in other principal pituitary hormones in adult rats exposed to FDE. The predominant presence of gaseous components in FDE can cause testicular damage due to oxidative imbalance. This underscores the causality of FDE exposure and impaired male reproductive outcomes.

AB  - Background Quality of chronic care for cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains suboptimal worldwide. The Collaborative Quality ImProvement (C-QIP) trial aims to develop and test the feasibility and clinical effect of a multicomponent strategy among patients with prevalent CVD in India. Methods The C-QIP is a clinic-based, open randomized trial of a multicomponent intervention vs usual care that was locally developed and adapted for use in Indian settings through rigorous formative research guided by Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The C-QIP intervention consisted of 5 components: 1) electronic health records and decision support system for clinicians, 2) trained nonphysician health workers (NPHW), 3) text-message based lifestyle reminders, 4) patient education materials, 5) quarterly audit and feedback reports. Patients with CVD (ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) attending outpatient CVD clinics were recruited from September 2022 to September 2023 and were randomized to the intervention or usual care arm for at least 12 months follow-up. The co-primary outcomes are implementation feasibility, fidelity (ie, dose delivered and dose received), acceptability, adoption and appropriateness, measured at multiple levels: patient, provider and clinic site-level, The secondary outcomes include prescription of guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) (provider-level), and adherence to prescribed therapy, change in mean blood pressure (BP) and LDL-cholesterol between the intervention and control groups (patient-level). In addition, a trial-based process and economic evaluations will be performed using standard guidelines. Results We recruited 410 socio-demographically diverse patients with CVD from 4 hospitals in India. Mean (SD) age was 57.5 (11.7) years, and 73.0% were males. Self-reported history of hypertension (48.5%) and diabetes (41.5%) was common. At baseline, mean (SD) BP was 127.9 (18.2) /76.2 (11.6) mm Hg, mean (SD) LDLc: 80.3 (37.3) mg/dl and mean (SD) HbA1c: 6.8% (1.6%). At baseline, the GDMT varied from 62.4% for patients with ischemic heart disease, 48.6% for ischemic stroke and 36.1% for heart failure. Conclusion This study will establish the feasibility of delivering contextually relevant, and evidence-based C-QIP strategy and assess whether it is acceptable to the target populations. The study results will inform a larger scale confirmatory trial of a comprehensive CVD care model in low-resource settings.

AB  - Introduction People with diabetes are at risk of developing chronic kidney disease. However, limited data are available to quantify their risk of kidney function decline in South Asia. This study evaluates the rate and predictors of kidney function decline among people with type 2 diabetes in South Asia.Research design and methods We analyzed data from the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) Trial to quantify the rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in people with type 2 diabetes (n=1146) over 2.5 years of follow-up. The CARRS Trial evaluated a multicomponent intervention of decision-supported electronic health records and non-physician care coordinator to improve diabetes management at 10 diabetes clinics in India and Pakistan. We used linear mixed models to estimate eGFR slope among all participants and tested the association of eGFR slope with demographic, disease-related, and self-care parameters, accounting for randomization and site.Results The mean age of participants was 54.2 years, with a median duration of diabetes of 7.0 years (IQR: 3.0 - 12.0) and median CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) eGFR of 83.6 (IQR: 67.7 to 97.9) mL/min/1.73 m2. The overall mean eGFR slope was -1.33/mL/min/1.73 m2/year. There were no differences in the eGFR slope by treatment assignment to intervention versus usual care. In the adjusted regression model, pre-existing diabetic retinopathy (slope difference: -2.11; 95% CI: -3.45 to -0.77), previous cardiovascular disease (-1.93; 95% CI: -3.45 to -0.40), and statins use (-0.87; 95% CI: -1.65 to -0.10) were associated with faster eGFR decline.Conclusions People with diabetes receiving care at urban diabetes clinics in South Asia experienced annual eGFR decline at two times higher rate than that reported from other contemporary international diabetes cohorts. Risk factors for faster decline were similar to those previously established, and thus care delivery models must put an additional emphasis on kidney protective therapies among subgroups with microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications.Trial registration number NCT01212328.

AB  - The avascular nature of cartilage tissue limits inherent regenerative capacity to counter any damage and this has become a substantial burden to the health of individuals. As a result, there is a high demand to repair and regenerate cartilage. Existing tissue engineering approaches for cartilage regeneration typically produce either microporous or nano-fibrous scaffolds lacking the desired biological outcome due to lack of biomimetic dual architecture of microporous construct with nano-fibrous interconnected structures like the native cartilage. Most of these scaffolds also fail to suppress ROS generation and provide sustained bioenergetics to cells, resulting in the loss of metabolic activity under avascular microenvironment of cartilage. A dual architecture microporous construct with nano-fibrous interconnected network of cellulose aerogel reinforced with arginine-coated graphene oxide (CNF-GO-Arg aerogel) was developed for cartilage regeneration. The designed dual-architectured CNF-GO-Arg aerogel using dual ice templating assembly demonstrates 80 % strain recovery ability under compression. The release of Arginine from CNF-GO-Arg aerogel supported 41 % reduction in intracellular ROS activity and promoted chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs by shifting mitochondrial bioenergetics towards oxidative phosphorylation indicated by JC-1 dye staining. Overall developed CNF-GO-Arg aerogel provided multifunctionality via biomimetic morphology, cellular bioenergetics, and suppressed ROS generation to address the need for regeneration of cartilage.

TI  - WHO global research priorities for sexually transmitted infections
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are widespread worldwide and negatively affect sexual and reproductive health. Gaps in evidence and in available tools have long hindered STI programmes and policies, particularly in resourcelimited settings. In 2022, WHO initiated a research prioritisation process to identify the most important STI research areas to address the global public health need. Using an adapted Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology including two global stakeholder surveys, the process identified 40 priority STI research needs. The top priorities centred on developing and implementing affordable, feasible, rapid point-of-care STI diagnostic tests and new treatments, especially for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and syphilis; designing new multipurpose prevention technologies and vaccines for STIs; and collecting improved STI epidemiologic data on both infection and disease outcomes. The priorities also included innovative programmatic approaches, such as new STI communication and partner management strategies. An additional six research areas related to mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) reflect the need for STIrelated research during disease outbreaks where sexual transmission can have a key role. These STI research priorities provide a call to action for focus, investment, and innovation to address existing roadblocks in STI prevention, control, and management to advance sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing for all.

AB  - Objective: Although previous studies have described phenomenological diagnoses, they lacked description of aetiological spectrum in patients visiting movement disorders (MD) service. Herein, we classify the MD phenomenology and describe aetiology wise distribution of each phenomenology in patients visiting a tertiary care movement disorders service. Methods: Collected information included demographic profile (age of onset, age at presentation, gender, duration of illness before presentation), predominant MD phenomenology [such as parkinsonism, dystonia, ataxia, tremor, chorea, ballism, myoclonus, tics, stereotypy, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and others], diagnostic evaluations and detected aetiology. Results: This observational study included 1140 MD patients over a span of 5 years. The median (IQR) age of onset was 49 (35-60) years and age at presentation was 54 (40-65) years, with median duration of illness being 36 (18-72) months. Nearly two-third of patients were males (M:F=731:409). Parkinsonism (n=494, 43.3%) was the most common MD phenomenology observed, followed by dystonia (n=219, 19.2 %), ataxia (n=125, 11 %), tremor (n=118, 10.4 %), myoclonus (n=73, 6.4 %), chorea (n=40, 3.5 %), spasticity (n=22, 1.9 %), tics (n=8, 0.7 %), and RLS (n=8, 0.7 %). Thirty-three (2.9 %) patients were grouped under miscellaneous MDs. Overall, neurodegenerative disorders (57.4 %) were the most common cause of MDs. Parkinson's disease, genetic dystonia, essential tremor, genetic ataxias, hemifacial spasm, and Huntington's disease were the most common aetiologies for parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, ataxia, myoclonus, and chorea, respectively. Conclusion: Parkinsonism was the most common phenomenology observed in MD patients, and was followed by dystonia, ataxia and tremor. Neurodegenerative disorders were the most common aetiology detected.

AB  - Importance More than 150 million people in India need mental health care but few have access to affordable care, especially in rural areas. Objective To determine whether a multifaceted intervention involving a digital health care model along with a community-based antistigma campaign leads to reduced depression risk and lower mental health-related stigma among adults residing in rural India. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel, cluster randomized, usual care-controlled trial was conducted from September 2020 to December 2021 with blinded follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months at 44 rural primary health centers across 3 districts in Haryana and Andhra Pradesh states in India. Adults aged 18 years and older at high risk of depression or self-harm defined by either a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) score of 10 or greater, a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7) score of 10 or greater, or a score of 2 or greater on the self-harm/suicide risk question on the PHQ-9. A second cohort of adults not at high risk were selected randomly from the remaining screened population. Data were cleaned and analyzed from April 2022 to February 2023. Interventions The 12-month intervention included a community-based antistigma campaign involving all participants and a digital mental health intervention involving only participants at high risk. Primary health care workers were trained to identify and manage participants at high risk using the Mental Health Gap Action Programme guidelines from the World Health Organization. Main Outcomes and Measures The 2 coprimary outcomes assessed at 12 months were mean PHQ-9 scores in the high-risk cohort and mean behavior scores in the combined high-risk and non-high-risk cohorts using the Mental Health Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior scale. Results Altogether, 9928 participants were recruited (3365 at high risk and 6563 not at high risk; 5638 [57%] female and 4290 [43%] male; mean [SD] age, 43 [16] years) with 9057 (91.2%) followed up at 12 months. Mean PHQ-9 scores at 12 months for the high-risk cohort were lower in the intervention vs control groups (2.77 vs 4.48; mean difference, -1.71; 95% CI, -2.53 to -0.89; P < .001). The remission rate in the high-risk cohort (PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores <5 and no risk of self-harm) was higher in the intervention vs control group (74.7% vs 50.6%; odds ratio [OR], 2.88; 95% CI, 1.53 to 5.42; P = .001). Across both cohorts, there was no difference in 12-month behavior scores in the intervention vs control group (17.39 vs 17.74; mean difference, -0.35; 95% CI, -1.11 to 0.41; P = .36). Conclusions and Relevance A multifaceted intervention was effective in reducing depression risk but did not improve intended help-seeking behaviors for mental illness.

AB  - PurposeIntensive care units (ICUs) have significant palliative care needs but lack a reliable care framework. This umbrella review addresses them by synthesising palliative care practices provided at end-of-life to critically ill patients and their families before, during, and after ICU admission.MethodsSeven databases were systematically searched for systematic reviews, and the umbrella review was conducted according to the guidelines laid out by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).ResultsOut of 3122 initial records identified, 40 systematic reviews were included in the synthesis. Six key themes were generated that reflect the palliative and end-of-life care practices in the ICUs and their outcomes. Effective communication and accurate prognostications enabled families to make informed decisions, cope with uncertainty, ease distress, and shorten ICU stays. Inter-team discussions and agreement on a plan are essential before discussing care goals. Recording care preferences prevents unnecessary end-of-life treatments. Exceptional end-of-life care should include symptom management, family support, hydration and nutrition optimisation, avoidance of unhelpful treatments, and bereavement support. Evaluating end-of-life care quality is critical and can be accomplished by seeking family feedback or conducting a survey.ConclusionThis umbrella review encapsulates current palliative care practices in ICUs, influencing patient and family outcomes and providing insights into developing an appropriate care framework for critically ill patients needing end-of-life care and their families.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of insulin resistance and its association with change in serum anti-seizure medication (ASM) level and their pharmacokinetic, body composition and metabolic hormones after six months of levetiracetam (LEV) exposure in persons with epilepsy (PWE) in comparison to valproate (VPA). Methods: This prospective-longitudinal study included clinically diagnosed PWE on VPA or LEV monotherapy (for<3 months). At enrolment, body weight/composition, BMI were measured and blood samples were collected for assessing metabolic dysfunctions by estimation of serum insulin, insulin resistance [in terms of Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)], leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile along with ASMs level. Subjects were followed up for six months and all the above parameters were reassessed. Results: A total of 150 PWE were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 105 number of subjects were enrolled (n = 35 in VPA and n = 70 in LEV group). Out of them, 92 subjects (n = 32 in VPA; n = 60 in LEV) completed six months follow-up. After six months, serum insulin level increased significantly in VPA group compared to baseline p < 0.001). Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR>2.5) was observed in 14.28 % of PWE in VPA group. Significantly higher percentage-change in body-weight (p = 0.003), leptin and decreased adiponectin were found in VPA-group compared to baseline ((p = 0.003, 0.02, 0.001, <0.001, respectively). These changes were independent of serum level or pharmacokinetic of VPA. On the other hand, no such changes were observed in LEV-group despite increased serum LEV level and altered pharmacokinetic parameters after six months. Conclusion: Six months treatment with VPA resulted in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunctions in PWE. These alterations were not correlated with change in VPA serum level. These changes were not observed in LEV therapy suggesting its better safety profile. This may be considered while prescribing the ASM like VPA and LEV in adult patients with obesity or insulin resistance and diabetes.

AB  - BackgroundCurrently, there is no automated method for assessing cleanliness in video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Our objectives were to automate the process of evaluating and collecting medical scores of VCE frames according to the existing KOrea-CanaDA (KODA) scoring system by developing an easy-to-use mobile application called artificial intelligence-KODA (AI-KODA) score, as well as to determine the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the KODA score among three readers for prospective AI applications, and check the efficacy of the application.MethodFrom the 28 patient capsule videos considered, 1539 sequential frames were selected at five-minute intervals, and 634 random frames were selected at random intervals during small bowel transit. The frames were processed and shifted to AI-KODA. Three readers (gastroenterology fellows), who had been trained in reading VCE, rated 2173 frames in duplicate four weeks apart after completing the training module on AI-KODA. The scores were saved automatically in real time. Reliability was assessed for each video using estimate of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Then, the AI dataset was developed using the frames and their respective scores, and it was subjected to automatic classification of the scores via the random forest and the k-nearest neighbors classifiers.ResultsFor sequential frames, ICCs for inter-rater variability were 'excellent' to 'good' among the three readers, while ICCs for intra-rater variability were 'good' to 'moderate'. For random frames, ICCs for inter-rater and intra-rater variability were 'excellent' among the three readers. The overall accuracy achieved was up to 61% for the random forest classifier and 62.38% for the k-nearest neighbors classifier.ConclusionsAI-KODA automates the process of scoring VCE frames based on the existing KODA score. It saves time in cleanliness assessment and is user-friendly for research and clinical use. Comprehensive benchmarking of the AI dataset is in process.

AB  - Hepatic factors secreted by the liver promote homeostasis and are pivotal for maintaining the liver-gut axis. Bile acid metabolism is one such example wherein, bile acid synthesis occurs in the liver and its biotransformation happens in the intestine. Dysfunctional interactions between the liver and the intestine stimulate varied pathological outcomes through its bidirectional portal communication. Indeed, aberrant bile acid metabolism has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation remain obscure. Here, we identify a novel hepatic gene program regulated by Rela and Stat3 that accentuates the inflammation in an acute experimental colitis model. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of Rela and Stat3 reduces the levels of primary bile acids in both the liver and the gut and shows a restricted colitogenic phenotype. On supplementation of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), knock-out mice exhibit enhanced colitis-induced alterations. This study provides persuasive evidence for the development of multi-organ strategies for treating IBD and identifies a hepatocyte-specific Rela-Stat3 network as a promising therapeutic target.

AB  - Objective: Compare the efficacy and safety of daily versus fortnightly oral vitamin D-3 in treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children aged 1-10 years. Design: Open labelled randomized controlled trial. Patients: Eighty children with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency were randomized into group daily (D) and group bolus (B) [40 in each group] to receive oral vitamin D-3, 4000 IU daily or 60,000 IU fortnightly for 12 weeks respectively. Both groups received daily oral calcium of 500 mg/day. Measurements: Serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, urine calcium: creatinine ratio and radiological score were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, 74 children were available for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of both regimens. Results: Both regimens led to a significant increase in Ca and P levels and a fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no intergroup difference. At 4- and 12-week assessments, all children in both treatment arms achieved 25(OH)D level in sufficiency range, with no significant difference in their geometric mean. Both regimens were associated with asymptomatic transient hypercalcemia [group D-51.4% vs. group B-34.3%; p -0.14] and hypercalciuria (5.7%) in group D that resolved spontaneously on follow-up. Results: Both regimens led to a significant increase in Ca and P levels and a fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no intergroup difference. At 4- and 12-week assessments, all children in both treatment arms achieved 25(OH)D level in sufficiency range, with no significant difference in their geometric mean. Both regimens were associated with asymptomatic transient hypercalcemia [group D-51.4% vs. group B-34.3%; p -0.14] and hypercalciuria (5.7%) in group D that resolved spontaneously on follow-up. Conclusions: Daily and fortnightly oral vitamin D3 in similar cumulative doses are efficacious for treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children (1-10 years). Treated children should be monitored for serum 25(OH)D, Ca and urinary calcium creatinine ratio.

AB  - Background Rare disorders comprise of similar to 7500 different conditions affecting multiple systems. Diagnosis of rare diseases is complex due to dearth of specialized medical professionals, testing labs and limited therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data on the prevalence of rare diseases in different populations. India being home to a large population comprising of 4600 population groups, of which several thousand are endogamous, is likely to have a high burden of rare diseases. The present study provides a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients with rare genetic diseases identified at a tertiary genetic test centre in India.
   Results Overall, 3294 patients with 305 rare diseases were identified in the present study cohort. These were categorized into 14 disease groups based on the major organ/ organ system affected. Highest number of rare diseases (D = 149/305, 48.9%) were identified in the neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental (NMND) group followed by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) (D = 47/305; 15.4%). Majority patients in the present cohort (N = 1992, 61%) were diagnosed under IEM group, of which Gaucher disease constituted maximum cases (N = 224, 11.2%). Under the NMND group, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (N = 291/885, 32.9%), trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (N = 242/885; 27.3%) and spinal muscular atrophy (N = 141/885, 15.9%) were the most common. Majority cases of beta-thalassemia (N = 120/149, 80.5%) and cystic fibrosis (N = 74/75, 98.7%) under the haematological and pulmonary groups were observed, respectively. Founder variants were identified for Tay-Sachs disease and mucopolysaccharidosis IVA diseases. Recurrent variants for Gaucher disease (GBA:c.1448T > C), beta-thalassemia (HBB:c.92.+5G > C), non-syndromic hearing loss (GJB2:c.71G > A), albinism (TYR:c.832 C > T), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CYP21A2:c.29-13 C > G) and progressive pseudo rheumatoid dysplasia (CCN6:c.298T > A) were observed in the present study.
   Conclusion The present retrospective study of rare disease patients diagnosed at a tertiary genetic test centre provides first insight into the distribution of rare genetic diseases across the country. This information will likely aid in drafting future health policies, including newborn screening programs, development of target specific panel for affordable diagnosis of rare diseases and eventually build a platform for devising novel treatment strategies for rare diseases.

AB  - Hemoptysis in the pediatric population, while infrequent, poses significant challenges for both the family and healthcare practitioners. The severity of hemoptysis dictates management decisions. Most cases being mild and self-limiting are treated conservatively. However, "life-threatening hemoptysis" may occur, and is defined as any degree of blood loss that endangers the airway and is arbitrarily considered to be > 8 ml/kg in 24 h in children. It requires prompt airway management and resuscitation followed by a tailored approach consisting of bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT), interventional radiology, and/or surgery depending on the patient 's clinical status and cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Bronchial arteries are hypertrophied in myriad conditions and account for 90-95% cases of hemoptysis due to their systemic pressure levels; the rest being contributed by pulmonary artery pathologies. Despite similar pathogenic mechanisms, the etiologies of pediatric hemoptysis differ from those in adults, with acute lower respiratory tract infections being the predominant cause. Imaging plays a crucial role in identifying the source and cause of hemorrhage. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has emerged as a prime modality in the diagnostic evaluation of hemoptysis and provides a roadmap for potential interventional procedures. This article discusses the etiopathogenesis of hemoptysis along with a brief mention of the diagnostic modalities. It provides a structured reporting format and uses it to illustrate the imaging features in hemoptysis, with emphasis on CT angiography. The key findings in the lung parenchyma, airways, bronchial and non-bronchial systemic collaterals, and pulmonary arteries are elaborated upon. It further addresses the nuances of interventional management, particularly emphasizing the applications of bronchial artery embolization and pulmonary artery embolization in the pediatric population. The article also underscores the potential complications and factors influencing recurrence rates.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) has emerged as the most common malignancy among females. The genomic profile of BC is diverse in nature and complex due to heterogeneity among various geographically different ethnic groups. The primary objective of this study was to carry out a comprehensive mutational analysis of Indian BC cases by performing whole exome sequencing. The cohort included patients with a median age of 48 years. TTN, TP53, MUC16, SYNE1, and OBSCN were the frequently altered genes found in our cohort. The PIK3CA and KLC3 genes are driver genes implicated in various cellular functions and cargo transportation through microtubules, respectively. Except for CCDC168 and PIK3CA, several gene pairings were found to be significantly linked with co-occurrence. Irrespective of their hormonal receptor status, RTK/RAS was observed with frequently altered signaling pathways. Further analysis of the mutational signature revealed that SBS13, SBS6, and SBS29 were mainly observed in our cohort. This study supplements the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and provides new therapeutic options for the improved management of BC.

AB  - Background and aim Bone marrow stem cells (BM-SCs) and their progeny play a central role in tissue repair and regeneration. In patients with chronic liver failure, bone marrow (BM) reserve is severally compromised and they showed marked defects in the resolution of injury and infection, leading to liver failure and the onset of decompensation. Whether BM failure is the cause or consequence of liver failure during cirrhosis is not known. In this study, we aimed to determine the underlying relationship between BM failure and regeneration failure in cirrhosis.Methodology C57Bl/6(J) mice were used to develop chronic liver injury through intra-peritoneal administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 15 weeks (0.1-0.5 ml/kg). Animals were sacrificed to study the transition of cirrhosis and BM defects. To restore the BM-SC reserve; healthy BM cells were infused via intra-BM infusion and assessed for changes in liver injury, regeneration, and BM-SC reserve.Results Using a CCl4-induced animal - model of cirrhosis, we showed the loss of BM-SCs reserve occurred before regeneration failure and the onset of non-acute decompensation. Intra-BM infusion of healthy BM cells induced the repopulation of native hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in cirrhotic BM. Restoring BM-HSCs reserve augments liver macrophage-mediated clearance of infection and inflammation dampens neutrophil-mediated inflammation, accelerates fibrosis regression, enhances hepatocyte proliferation, and delays the onset of non-acute decompensation.Conclusion These findings suggest that loss of BM-HSCs reserve underlies the compromised innate immune function of the liver, drives regeneration failure, and the onset of non-acute decompensation. We further provide the proof-of-concept that rejuvenating BM-HSC reserve can serve as a potential therapeutic approach for preventing regeneration failure and transition to decompensated cirrhosis.

T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
AB  - SQSTM1 (Sequestosome 1) also known as p62, plays several important physiological roles in the cell. It regulates autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis and can further lead to metabolic reprogramming. Pathogenic variants in SQSTM1 gene are known to cause Neurodegeneration with ataxia, dystonia, and gaze palsy in autosomal recessive inheritance fashion. We report here, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line (IGIBi010-A) carrying a novel homozygous frameshift variant in SQSTM1 i.e. p.Leu251SerfsTer4. In future, this iPSC line will be used as a resource to elucidate the molecular pathway, targeting strategies for disease biology derived by variation in SQSTM1 gene.

AB  - Introduction: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), arising from nasopharyngeal epithelium is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is common in South China, South East Asia and North East India. The aim and objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of EBV in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of clinically suspected NPC patients, correlate the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with histopathology findings, and to determine the utility of tissue EBV DNA as a diagnostic bio-marker. Materials and methods: 31 FFPE tissue samples were collected from clinically suspected NPC patients from April 2018-December 2019. Histopathological diagnosis was done by examination of Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slides. Presence of EBV was detected by EBNA-1 PCR. IHC was performed using EBV Latent Membrane Protein 1. Results: Of the 31 clinically suspected NPC cases, 15 (48.4 %) were histopathological confirmed NPC. Of these15, 13 (86.6 %) were non-keratinising undifferentiated NPC, and one each were keratinising NPC and non-keratinising differentiated NPC respectively. EBV EBNA1 PCR was positive in 35.5 % (11/31) of clinically suspected NPC cases. Of the 11 PCR positive cases, 9 (81.8 %) were histopathological confirmed NPC. Of the 31 clinically suspected NPC cases, IHC was indicated in 23 biopsies. Of which, 12 (52.2 %) were positive for LMP1 in the abnormal cells. Of the 12 IHC positive samples, 10 were NPC cases. Conclusion: EBV DNA as an indicator towards NPC among clinically suspected cases had a sensitivity of 60 % and specificity of 87.5 %. In this study, addition of EBV DNA detection by PCR from FFPE tissue sections could confirm EBV association in 20 % of cases where it was not detected by EBV LMP1 IHC, thus helped in increasing the detection of EBV positivity in NPC cases. Early diagnosis of NPC will improve the cure rate and hence reduce the morbidity and mortality rates.

AB  - PURPOSE To evaluate the incidence of rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) in fellow eyes of patients with unilateral primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) and to identify risk factors for IOP increase over long-term follow-up.<br /> METHODS The medical records of unilateral PCG patients who had completed at least 5 years of follow-up were reviewed retrospectively. The incidence of developing ocular hypertension / glaucoma in fellow eyes was analyzed. Fellow eye progressors were those which showed an increase in optic nerve cupping by at least 0.2 since the first presentation or had IOP of >21 mm Hg on two occasions. The risk factors for progression that were analyzed included IOP, visual acuity, axial length, central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal diameters (CD), presence or absence of angle dysgenesis on high-resolution anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), and morphology of aqueous outflow pathways.<br /> RESULTS After a median follow-up of 8.2 years (range, 5-25.5) progression to bilateral disease was found in 17 of 54 patients (32%), of whom 8 (15%) developed ocular hypertension and 9 (17%) developed glaucoma in the fellow eye. Among the unaffected fellow eyes, those with a larger CD (>12 mm), measured after at least 5 years' follow-up, were ten times more likely to progress (P P = 0.01; OR = 9.5 [95% CI, 1.7-54.3]). The presence of a patent supraciliary channel was significantly more frequently associated in fellow eyes compared with affected eyes on AS-OCT (OR = 1.4 [95% CI, 0.46-4.68]).<br /> CONCLUSIONS One-third of unaffected fellow eyes of unilateral PCG eventually progress over time, most often after 5 years. Larger CD at follow-up in the fellow eye is strongly predictive for progression.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) interacting protein kinases (Mnk1 and Mnk2) mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E is an important translation initiation control, in Mnk-mediated oncogenic activity and other disease conditions. Thus, Mnk kinases are an important target for therapy. Trypanosomatids are a class of kinetoplastids, some of which are protozoan parasites and cause diseases in humans. While protein translation initiation is well understood in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, there is a lack of sufficient structural information of this process in trypanosomatids. Here, we report that trypanosomatids have one orthologue of Mnk kinase with low overall sequence homology but high homology in the kinase domain and an additional C-terminal domain containing putative calmodulin binding site(s). We show that while many of the domains and motifs are conserved, homology modeling/structure prediction, docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggest that trypanosomatid kMnk kinases, kinase domains are present in DFG-in conformation as opposed to the auto-inhibited DFD-out conformation of un-phosphorylated human Mnk1. Furthermore, we observed that several regulatory features are different in trypanosomatid kMnk kinases. Our study indicates that mechanism and regulation in the kinase domain of trypanosomatid kMnks are likely to be altered, and that they can be important drug targets.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) uses sophisticated algorithms to "learn" from large volumes of data. This could be used to optimise recruitment of blood donors through predictive modelling of future blood supply, based on previous donation and transfusion demand. We sought to assess utilisation of predictive modelling and AI blood establishments (BE) and conducted predictive modelling to illustrate its use. A BE survey of data modelling and AI was disseminated to the International Society of Blood transfusion members. Additional anonymzed data were obtained from Italy, Singapore and the United States (US) to build predictive models for each region, using January 2018 through August 2019 data to determine likelihood of donation within a prescribed number of months. Donations were from March 2020 to June 2021. Ninety ISBT members responded to the survey. Predictive modelling was used by 33 (36.7%) respondents and 12 (13.3%) reported AI use. Forty-four (48.9%) indicated their institutions do not utilise predictive modelling nor AI to predict transfusion demand or optimise donor recruitment. In the predictive modelling case study involving three sites, the most important variable for predicting donor return was number of previous donations for Italy and the US, and donation frequency for Singapore. Donation rates declined in each region during COVID-19. Throughout the observation period the predictive model was able to consistently identify those individuals who were most likely to return to donate blood. The majority of BE do not use predictive modelling and AI. The effectiveness of predictive model in determining likelihood of donor return was validated; implementation of this method could prove useful for BE operations.

AB  - The methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice is a well- established model. Our study aims to elucidate the factors influencing liver pathology in the MCD mouse model by examining physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes using histology, molecular techniques, and OMICS approaches (lipidomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard chow diet, a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet, or an MCD diet for 10 weeks. The MCD diet resulted in reduced body weight and fat mass, along with decreased plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels. However, it notably induced steatosis, inflammation, and alterations in gene expression associated with lipogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, and the synthesis of apolipoproteins, sphingolipids, ceramides, and carboxylesterases. Lipid analysis revealed significant changes in plasma and tissues: most ceramide non-hydroxy-sphingosine lipids significantly decreased in the liver and plasma but increased in the adipose tissue of MCD diet-fed animals. Oxidized glycerophospholipids mostly increased in the liver but decreased in the adipose tissue of the MCD diet-fed group. The gut microbiome of the MCD diet-fed group showed an increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Metabolomic profiling demonstrated that the MCD diet significantly altered amino acid biosynthesis, metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism pathways in plasma, liver, fecal, and cecal samples. LC-MS data indicated higher total plasma bile acid intensity and reduced fecal glycohyodeoxycholic acid intensity in the MCD diet group. This study demonstrates that although the MCD diet induces hepatic steatosis, the mechanisms underlying NASH in this model differ from those in human NASH pathology.

AB  - Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) derived from tRNAs are known as tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). These tsRNAs are further categorized into tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and tRNA halves (tiRNAs), which play significant roles in the various molecular mechanisms underlying certain human diseases. However, the generation of tsRNAs and their potential roles during Dengue virus (DENV) infection is not yet known. Here, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify the generation and alterations in tsRNAs expression profiles of DENV-infected Huh7 cells. Upon DENV infection, tRNA fragmentation was found to be increased. We identified a significant number of differentially expressed tsRNAs during DENV infection. Interestingly, the 3 ' tRF population showed upregulation, while the i-tRF population exhibited downregulation. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed to analyze the impact of differentially expressed tsRNAs on DENV pathogenesis. Our results suggest that differentially expressed tsRNAs are involved in transcriptional regulation via RNA polymerase II promoter and metabolic pathways. Overall, our study contributes significantly to our understanding of the roles played by tsRNAs in the complex dynamics of DENV infection.

AB  - Objective: There is limited information on population-specific norms of trabecular-bone-score (TBS) and its associated factors. Here, we provide norms of TBS in Asian-Indians and its relationship with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and intact-parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Participants and Measurements: TBS, bone-mineral-density (BMD), and vertebral-fractures (VFs) were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 923 healthy Asian-Indians (aged 20-60 years). Serum 25(OH)D, iPTH, T4/TSH,, glycosylated-haemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured and associations with TBS assessed using multivariable linear regression. Subjects with BMD Z-score <= -2.0 or >= 2.0 at any sites, VFs, TSH > 10.0 or <0.05 <mu>IU/ml, blood-glucose >11.1 mmol/L or HbA1c > 8.0% were excluded for generating Asian-Indian norms. Results: TBS norms were generated in 744 healthy Asian-Indians (M:F,389:385). The cut-offs generated for 'normal', 'partially-degraded', and 'degraded' TBS were <bold>></bold>1.305, 1.204-1.305 and <1.204, respectively. Mean TBS was lower in females than males (p < .001). There was 75% congruency in TBS categories between Asian-Indian and existing norms. Specificity (97.8 vs. 77.9%, p < .001) and diagnostic-accuracy (97.8% vs. 78.4%, p < .001) of TBS to detect osteoporosis were higher with Asian-Indian norms. The sensitivity of 'partially-degraded' TBS to diagnose osteopenia was also higher with Asian-Indian norms. In multivariable regression, gender, body-mass-index (BMI), BMD-L-1-L-4, serum PTH, daily dietary-calorie intake and calcium intake were associated with TBS. Though 25(OH)D inversely correlated with PTH, 25(OH)D was not associated with TBS. Conclusion: This study provides norms for TBS in Asian-Indians with gender-specific differences. Increasing age and higher BMI were associated with lower TBS. Associations of TBS with circulating PTH and/or 25(OH)D need confirmation in further studies.

AB  - Background: Addiction can alter neural processes during rest and cognitive performance. Subjects with addictive disorders exhibit preoccupation and anticipation for the psychoactive substance when idle and cognitive deficits, during tasks. Methods: 128 channel EEG was recorded in sixty subjects (30, with alcohol, opioid and internet addiction; 30 controls) during rest and while performing working memory task to ascertain underlying differences in cortical activity between the groups while at rest and during performance of the task. Artifactually clean data was then subjected to source analysis using sLORETA software in both the groups. Results: EEG cortical source analysis in subjects with addictive disorders showed significant activation of areas of Default Mode Network (DMN) and reduced activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC), an area known to be involved in executive function, during performance of task. However, control subjects demonstrated significantly reduced activation in areas of DMN; and increased activation of DLPFC during task performance. Conclusion: Inability to suppress DMN inhibits reallocation of neural resources to areas of executive functioning leading to working memory deficits in subjects with addictive disorder.

AB  - Native T1 mapping is a non-invasive technique used for early detection of diffused myocardial abnormalities, and it provides baseline tissue characterization. Post-contrast T1 mapping enhances tissue differentiation, enables extracellular volume (ECV) calculation, and improves myocardial viability assessment. Accurate and precise segmenting of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium on T1 maps is crucial for assessing myocardial tissue characteristics and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study presents a deep learning (DL)-based pipeline for automatically segmenting LV myocardium on T1 maps and automatic computation of radial T1 and ECV values. The study employs a multicentric dataset consisting of retrospective multiparametric MRI data of 332 subjects to develop and assess the performance of the proposed method. The study compared DL architectures U-Net and Deep Res U-Net for LV myocardium segmentation, which achieved a dice similarity coefficient of 0.84 +/- 0.43 and 0.85 +/- 0.03, respectively. The dice similarity coefficients computed for radial sub-segmentation of the LV myocardium on basal, mid-cavity, and apical slices were 0.77 +/- 0.21, 0.81 +/- 0.17, and 0.61 +/- 0.14, respectively. The t-test performed between ground truth vs. predicted values of native T1, post-contrast T1, and ECV showed no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) for any of the radial sub-segments. The proposed DL method leverages the use of quantitative T1 maps for automatic LV myocardium segmentation and accurately computing radial T1 and ECV values, highlighting its potential for assisting radiologists in objective cardiac assessment and, hence, in CVD diagnostics.

AB  - Recent studies report the overall incidence of distal femur fractures as 8.7/100,000/year. This incidence is expected to rise with high energy motor vehicle collisions and elderly osteoporotic fractures in native and prosthetic knees keep increasing. These fractures are more common in males in the younger age spectrum while females predominate for elderly osteoporotic fractures. Surgical treatment is recommended for these fractures to maintain articular congruity, enable early joint motion and assisted ambulation. Over the last two decades, development of minimally invasive and quadriceps sparing surgical approaches, availability of angle stable implants have helped achieve predictable healing and early return to function in these patients. Currently, laterally positioned locked plate is the implant of choice across all fracture patterns. Retrograde with capital implantation of intramedullary nails with provision for multiplanar distal locking is preferred for extra-articular and partial articular fractures. Even with these advancements, nonunion after distal femur fracture fixation can be as high as 19%. Further recent research has helped us understand the biomechanical limitations and healing problems with lateral locked plate fixation and intramedullary nails. This has lead to development of more robust constructs such as nail-plate and double plate constructs aiming for improved construct strength and to minimise failures. Early results with these combination constructs have shown promise in high risk situations such as fractures with extensive metaphyseal fragmentation, osteoporosis and periprosthetic fractures. These constructs however, run the risk of being over stiff and can inhibit healing if not kept balanced. The ideal stiffness that is needed for fracture healing is not clearly known and current research in this domain has lead to the development of smart implants which are expected to evolve and may help improve clinical results in future.

AB  - PurposeThe saphenous nerve is a predominantly sensory nerve. It is the longest nerve of the body which supplies the skin of the medial side of the leg and foot as far as the ball of the great toe. We present here an unusual motor branch of the saphenous nerve to the sartorius muscle.MethodInstitutional guidelines for use of human cadaver were followed. Routine dissection of the lower limbs for undergraduate medical teaching was performed in a 67 years old female cadaver employing standard methods. Relevant gross features of the variations were photographed. H&E staining of relevant structure was done and photomicrographed.ResultsThe unusual motor branch to Sartorius was observed in the right thigh. The branch was given off in the lower third of the thigh after the saphenous nerve exited the adductor canal. The branch was distinctly seen entering the substance of the sartorius. The structure was confirmed to be a peripheral nerve by histological examination. The saphenous nerve then descended between the sartorius and gracilis tendons, pierced the fascia lata and became cutaneous.ConclusionThe motor branch to the sartorius muscle is a very rare branch whose knowledge is important for clinicians as it can get damaged during arthroscopy and other knee surgery or during adductor canal block.

AB  - BackgroundThe associations of vegetarian diets with risks for site-specific cancers have not been estimated reliably due to the low number of vegetarians in previous studies. Therefore, the Cancer Risk in Vegetarians Consortium was established. The aim is to describe and compare the baseline characteristics between non-vegetarian and vegetarian diet groups and between the collaborating studies.MethodsWe harmonised individual-level data from 11 prospective cohort studies from Western Europe, North America, South Asia and East Asia. Comparisons of food intakes, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were made between diet groups and between cohorts using descriptive statistics.Results2.3 million participants were included; 66% women and 34% men, with mean ages at recruitment of 57 (SD: 7.8) and 57 (8.6) years, respectively. There were 2.1 million meat eaters, 60,903 poultry eaters, 44,780 pescatarians, 81,165 vegetarians, and 14,167 vegans. Food intake differences between the diet groups varied across the cohorts; for example, fruit and vegetable intakes were generally higher in vegetarians than in meat eaters in all the cohorts except in China. BMI was generally lower in vegetarians, particularly vegans, except for the cohorts in India and China. In general, but with some exceptions, vegetarians were also more likely to be highly educated and physically active and less likely to smoke. In the available resurveys, stability of diet groups was high in all the cohorts except in China.ConclusionsFood intakes and lifestyle factors of both non-vegetarians and vegetarians varied markedly across the individual cohorts, which may be due to differences in both culture and socioeconomic status, as well as differences in questionnaire design. Therefore, care is needed in the interpretation of the impacts of vegetarian diets on cancer risk.

AB  - Introduction: Associations between markers of impaired kidney function and adverse outcomes among South Asians is understudied and could differ from existing data derived mostly from North American or European cohorts. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of 9797 participants from the ongoing cardiometabolic risk reduction study in South Asia, India. We examined the associations between baseline spot urine albumin-to-creatinine (UACR) ratio and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimating equations with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for baseline age, sex, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, tobacco, history of cardiovascular disease, and cholesterol. Additionally, we calculated population attributable fraction (PAF) for both markers. Results: Over a median 7-year follow-up, with 66,909 person-years, 791 deaths occurred. At baseline, the weighted prevalence of UACR >= 30 mg/g and eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) was 6.6% and 1.6%, respectively. The risk for mortality was increased with higher UACR (10-30 hazard ratio [HR]: 1.6 [1.2-2.1]), 30-300 HR: 2.4 [1.8-3.1]), and >= 300 (HR: 6.0 [3.8-9.4] relative to UACR <10 mg/g). Risk for mortality was also higher with lower eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) (44-30; HR: 4.5 [2.5-8.3] and <30 HR: 7.0 [3.7-13.0], relative to 90-104 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). PAF for mortality because of UACR >= 30 mg/g and eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were 24.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Single-time point assessment of UACR >= 30 mg/g or eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) portends higher mortality risk among urban South Asians. Because albuminuria is common and associated with accelerated decline in GFR, screening and targeted efforts to reduce albuminuria are warranted.

AB  - The global demographic and epidemiological transition have led to a rapidly increasing burden of cancer, particularly among older adults. There are scant data on the prevalence and demographic pattern of cancer in older Indian persons. This was a multicentric observational study conducted between January 2019 and December 2020. Data were retrieved from existing electronic databases to gather information on two key variables: the total number of patients registered with oncologists and the number of patients aged 60 years and above. The primary objective was to determine the percentage of older adults among patients with cancer served by these hospitals. Secondary objectives included understanding the prevalence of different types of cancer in the older population, and the sex- and geographic distribution of cancer in older Indian patients. We included 272,488 patients with cancer from 17 institutes across India. Among them, 97,962 individuals (36 %) were aged 60 years and above. The proportion of older adults varied between 20.6 % and 53.6 % across the participating institutes. The median age of the older patients with cancer was 67 (interquartile range, 63-72) years. Of the 54,281 patients for whom the details regarding sex were available, 32,243 (59.4 %) were male. Of the 56,903 older patients, head and neck malignancies were the most prevalent, accounting for 11,158 cases (19.6 %), followed by breast cancer (6260 cases, 11 %), genitourinary cancers (6242 cases, 10.9 %), lung cancers (6082 cases, 10.7 %), hepatopancreaticobiliary (6074, 10.7 %), and hematological malignancies (5226 cases, 9.2 %). Over one-third of Indian patients with cancer are aged 60 years and above, with a male predominance. Head and neck, breast, and genitourinary cancers are the most prevalent in this age group. Characterizing the burden of cancer in older adults is crucial to enable tailored interventions and additional research to improve the care and support for this vulnerable population.

AB  - Context:Concerns about brolucizumab's (Pagenax (R)) association with intraocular inflammation (IOI) limit its use despite its cost-effectiveness and efficacy. This multicentric study analyzes IOI incidence across 21 tertiary eyecare centers in India since its introduction in October 2020.Purpose:To determine the real-world incidence rate of IOI in Indian patients secondary to intravitreal brolucizumab across 21 tertiary eye care centers in India.Settings and Design:Retrospective multicentric, survey-based study.Methods:Data including number of patients treated, clinical indications, side effects encountered, and IOI case details was collected via Google Forms in 21 Indian tertiary eye care centers since October 2020. Mean, median, frequency, and standard deviation were calculated for statistical analysis.Results:All centers used pro re nata protocol for brolucizumab injections with a minimum injection interval of 8 weeks. The incidence of IOI was 0.79% (21 events out of 2655 eyes). Treatment indications included idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and off-label uses. IOI was experienced after the first injection (57%) in majority of cases with a median onset of 14 days (range: 1-65 days). IOI was mild in 28.5%, moderate in 33%, and severe in 38% of cases. Eighteen out of 21 IOI eyes recovered preinjection best corrected visual acuity or better.Conclusions:Our study found a lower IOI incidence (0.79%) with brolucizumab (Pagenax) in Indian patients compared to previously reported literature. IOI events were mostly mild to moderate, and post-treatment, most patients improved or maintained BCVA. Larger prospective multicentric studies with PRN dosing protocol are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - The recently re-emerged mpox (monkeypox) virus that causes mpox disease is a member of genus Orthopoxvirus and has unprecedentedly spread worldwide. Numerous studies have contributed to our understanding of its evolution, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations. The current outbreak of the mpox virus depicts its novel route of transmission as a new variant. However, the exact reason for its transition from an epidemic to a pandemic remains unclear. Furthermore, other poxviruses such as vaccinia virus, variola virus, and cowpox virus, also belong to the same genus, Orthopoxvirus. In the present review, our objective was to summarize the evidence on evolution, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of mpox virus and its related poxviruses. The present review would aid in a better understanding of the current circulating mpox virus and its differences from other poxviruses. In addition, the shared genetic factors contributing to virulence in these Orthopoxvirus highlight their evolutionary connections and genetic similarities. While they exhibit differences in virulence, studying these genetic relationships is crucial for understanding their biology, pathogenicity, and the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapeutics to curb mpox disease.

AB  - Emerging evidence shows increased humoral response post-omicron surge, but research on T cell responses is limited. This study investigated the durability, magnitude, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific T cell responses in 216 two-dose vaccinated individuals pre- and post-omicron surge. Post-surge samples showed enhanced T cell responses, indicating widespread asymptomatic exposure to omicron. Further analysis of 105 individuals with multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 through boosters or infections showed that post-omicron, two-dose vaccinated individuals had T cell responses comparable to those of COVID-19 convalescents or boosted individuals. Additionally, we report cross-reactive T cell responses against omicron sub-variants, including BA2.86, remained strong, with preserved frequencies of spike-specific stem-cell-like memory T cells. In silico prediction indicates that mutated epitopes of JN.1 and KP.2 retain over 95.6% of their HLA binding capability. Overall, our data suggests that T cell responses are sustained, enhanced, and cross-reactive against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants following symptomatic or asymptomatic omicron infection.

AB  - The escalating global threat of climate change is becoming more evident. The climate crisis intersects with another major challenge: lung cancer. With Asia already bearing half the global cancer burden, the impact of climate-related events on health and on lung cancer care specifically are profound. There can potentially be critical implications on the overall landscape of lung cancer care-from screening and early detection, to management and treatment. In 2022, the deadliest flooding events occurred in India and Pakistan. Extreme weather events such as cyclones and typhoons cause damage to healthcare facilities and disrupt transportation networks. These impede access to vital treatments, causing delays, thus worsening patients' conditions. Most low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have disparities in healthcare infrastructure, resources, and workforce distribution that result in limited access to comprehensive care. This fragmented healthcare system in many Asian countries pose additional challenges. Adaptation and mitigation strategies are crucial for minimizing these impacts on cancer care. Addressing this complex interplay demands urgent, collaborative, and multidisciplinary efforts to safeguard healthcare and ensure access to uninterrupted care amid climate-related challenges.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of surveys have analyzed the impact virus spreading on the everyday medical practice, including neurosurgery. However, none have examined the perceptions of neurosurgeons towards the pandemic, their life changes, and the strategies they implemented to be able to deal with their patients in such a difficult time.
   METHODS: From April 2021 to May 2021 a modified Delphi method was used to construct, pilot, and refine the questionnaire focused on the evolution of global neurosurgical practice during the pandemic. This survey was distributed among 1000 neurosurgeons; the responses were then collected and critically analyzed.
   RESULTS: Outpatient department practices changed with a rapid rise in teleservices. 63.9% of respondents reported that they have changed their OT practices to emergency cases with occasional elective cases. 40.0% of respondents and 47.9% of their family members reported to have suffered from COVID-19. 56.2% of the respondents reported having felt depressed in the last 1 year. 40.9% of respondents reported having faced financial difficulties. 80.6% of the respondents found online webinars to be a good source of learning. 47.8% of respondents tried to improve their neurosurgical knowledge while 31.6% spent the extra time in research activities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Progressive increase in operative waiting lists, preferential use of telemedicine, reduction in tendency to complete stoppage of physical clinic services and drop in the use of PPE kits were evident. Respondents' age had an impact on how the clinical services and operative practices have evolved. Financial concerns overshadow mental health.

AB  - Background Novel interfascial plane blocks like PEricapsular Nerve Group (PENG) and SupraInguinal Fascia Iliaca (SIFI) blocks are effective for management of hip fracture pain. We compared the difference in the distribution of the dye injected and nerves stained by the addition of the SIFI block to the PENG block. Methods A total of 24 designated dye injections were performed in eight soft-embalmed cadavers. Under ultrasound guidance 20 ml green ink injected bilaterally in PENG block and 30 ml methylene blue dye was injected in the SIFI block on the right side. The cadavers were dissected 24 h later to assess the extent of dye spread. Results Extensive spread of dyes was seen on both side of iliacus muscle on the right side, but blue dye was not visible medial to the psoas tendon. The subcostal and iliohypogastric nerves were stained green in the infra-inguinal region. On the left side (PENG alone), the anterior division of the obturator, femoral and saphenous nerve (7/8) and iliohypogastric nerves (3/8) were stained in the infrainguinal region. In the suprainguinal region, the femoral nerve (5/8), accessory obturator nerve (3/8), lateral femoral cutaneous (1/8) and nerve to rectus femoris (4/8) were stained. The main obturator nerve trunk was spared with both injections while its anterior branch and accessory obturator nerve were stained with the PENG injection. Conclusion The study findings indicate that combined PENG + SIFI injections lead to an extensive craniocaudal and longitudinal spread along the iliacus muscle. We perceive that the combination of these two injections will have a superior clinical outcome.

AB  - Objective: We determined whether endoscopic thyroidectomy (ET) is associated with better health-related quality of life (QoL) compared with open thyroidectomy.
   Methods: We randomly assigned 28 patients aged older than 18 years, Bethesda IV or less on cytology and gland volume of <40 mL to undergo hemithyroidectomy through either open or endoscopic (axillo-breast approach/bilateral axillo-breast approach) technique. The primary outcome was QoL scores on the Short Form-36 and Thyroid-Specific Questionnaire at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postsurgery. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications, hospital stay, and pain scores.
   Results: The generic QoL scores based on Short Form-36 were statistically nonsignificant between the two groups. QoL scores based on Thyroid-Specific Questionnaire were statistically significant (P < 0.05) favoring open thyroidectomy in the following domains: (1) numbness at 2, 6, and 12 weeks (P = 0.04, 0.004, and 0.005, respectively), (2) shoulder impairment at 2 weeks (P = 0.017), and (3) favoring ET in cosmesis at 6 and 12 weeks (P = 0.037 and 0.02, respectively). ET has longer operative time (104.6 +/- 25.4 vs 123 +/- 8.9 min; P = 0.03), longer hospital stays (2.8 +/- 0.4 vs 2.4 +/- 0.5; P = 0.056) and higher pain scores at 2 and 6 weeks (P = 0.007 and 0.012, respectively) but decreased intraoperative bleeding (33.5 +/- 6.4 vs 29.1 +/- 3.7 mL; P = 0.037).
   Conclusion: ET has higher cosmetic satisfaction, increased numbness, and shoulder movement impairment during short-term postsurgery follow-up. Both techniques are similar in impacting general physical, mental, and social health-related QoL.

Methods A total of 573 PUO patients were included in this ambispective study, with a mean age of 39.40 +/- 4.6 years. Patients underwent FDG PET/CT scans using dedicated hybrid scanners. PET/CT data were interpreted by experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The study analyzed the guidance provided by FDG PET/CT for appropriate biopsy sites and assessed concordance between PET/CT findings and histopathological examination. Results Out of the 573 patients, a final diagnosis was reached for 219 patients, including malignancy, infectious causes, noninfectious inflammatory causes (NIID), and precancerous conditions. FDG PET/CT played a crucial role in guiding clinicians to appropriate biopsy sites, contributing to a higher diagnostic yield. Concordance between PET/CT findings and histopathological examination emphasized the noninvasive diagnostic potential of PET/CT in identifying underlying causes of PUO. Overall, FDG PET/CT contributed to guiding the appropriate site of biopsy or concordance of the first differential diagnosis with the final diagnosis in 50.05% of cases. Conclusion This study highlights the valuable role of FDG PET/CT in providing a targeted approach for diagnosing PUO, showcasing its potential in guiding clinicians towards appropriate biopsy sites and improving the diagnostic yield. The findings underscore the importance of integrating FDG PET/CT into the diagnostic pathway for PUO, ultimately enhancing patient management and outcomes. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate these results and refine the integration of FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of PUO. Copyright (c) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background:Endoscopic approach has come up as a safe and feasible procedure for thyroidectomy with better cosmetic outcomes. However, concerns over its safety in terms of nerve injury and postoperative voice changes remain. This prospective study evaluated the role of vocal cord function assessment using laryngeal examination and voice analysis in patients who underwent endoscopic hemithyroidectomy either by the trans-oral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) or the bilateral axillobreast approach (BABA).Methods:Thirty-nine consecutive patients were randomly allocated to either of the 2 groups of endoscopic hemithyroidectomy; 19 in TOETVA and 20 in the BABA groups. Vocal cord function was assessed subjectively using the GRBAS scale and objectively by acoustic analysis of parameters such as jitter, shimmer, mean frequency (F0), noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), and maximum phonatory time (MPT) at baseline, postoperative day 10, and 3 months after surgery.Results:There were no significant differences in mean GRBAS scores and values of mean frequency, jitter and shimmer between the 2 groups and on postoperative day 10 and at 3 months compared with baseline. The mean NHR and MPT showed no differences between the 2 procedures. However, there was a significant decrease in their values on day 10 postsurgery, compared with baseline. These values returned to their baseline at 3 months. The other operative parameters were comparable between the 2 groups, except for the shorter mean operative time in the TOETVA group.Conclusions:Perioperative quantitative voice parameters were comparable with no statistically significant difference between the 2 techniques of endoscopic thyroidectomy.

AB  - BackgroundWhile previously considered a transient condition, with no lasting adverse impact, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is now a well-established risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The risk of developing T2DM appears to be particularly high in the first few years after childbirth, providing a compelling case for early intervention. This review provides an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce incidence of T2DM in women with a recent history of GDM.MethodsThe search was conducted on October 20, 2023 with an annual surveillance planned for the next 5 years to maintain a living systematic review. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of any type in women within 5 years of GDM-complicated pregnancy that reported outcomes of T2DM diagnosis or measures of dysglycemia with a follow-up of at least 12 months.ResultsSeventeen studies met our inclusion criteria and have been included in this review. There were 3 pharmacological and 14 lifestyle interventions. Intervention was not associated with significant reduction in the primary outcome of T2DM (risk ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-1.41; p = 0.41; I2 = 79%) compared with the control group (placebo or usual care). However, meta-analysis of the four studies reporting hazard ratios suggested a reduction in diabetes incidence (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI: 0.48-0.97; p = 0.03; I2 = 31%).ConclusionThis review provides equivocal evidence about the efficacy of interventions to reduce the risk of T2DM in women within 5 years of GDM-complicated pregnancy and highlights the need for further studies, including pharmacotherapy. imageConclusionThis review provides equivocal evidence about the efficacy of interventions to reduce the risk of T2DM in women within 5 years of GDM-complicated pregnancy and highlights the need for further studies, including pharmacotherapy. image
   HighlightsGDM is now a well-established risk factor for developing T2DM. This risk appears to be particularly high in the first few years after childbirth, providing a compelling case for early intervention. This review found equivocal evidence about the efficacy of preventive interventions on development of T2DM in women with a recent (within 5 years) history of GDM.

AB  - Non-tumorous kidney diseases include a variety of conditions affecting both the structure and function of the kidneys, thereby causing a range of health-related problems. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as a potential diagnostic tool, offering a multifaceted approach to evaluating non-tumorous kidney diseases. Its clinical significance extends beyond its conventional role in cancer imaging, enabling a comprehensive assessment of renal structure and function. This review explores the diverse applications of PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of non-cancerous kidney diseases. It examines PET/CT's role in assessing acute kidney injuries, including acute pyelonephritis and other forms of nephritis, as well as chronic conditions such as immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the review delves into PET/CT's utility in evaluating complications in renal transplant recipients, identifying renal histiocytosis and detecting renal amyloidosis. The current review aims to promote further research and technological advancements to popularize PET/CT's clinical utility in diagnosing and treating non-tumorous kidney diseases.

AB  - Context.-ALK - ALK and ROS1 rearrangements are essential biomarkers to be tested in advanced lung adenocarcinomas. While D5F3 Ventana assay is a companion diagnostic for anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeted - targeted therapy, immunohistochemistry is only a screening tool for detecting ROS1 rearrangement. Confirmation by cytogenetic or molecular techniques is necessary. Objective.-To - To evaluate the utility of ALK and ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization as a complement to immunohistochemistry in routine predictive biomarker testing algorithms. Design.-The study was ambispective, spanning 4.5 years during which lung adenocarcinoma samples were subjected to EGFR mutation testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction and ALK/ROS1 rearrangement testing by immunohistochemistry (Ventana D5F3 assay for anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein; manual assay with D4D6 clone for Ros proto-oncogene 1 protein). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed in all anaplastic lymphoma kinase equivocal and Ros protooncogene 1 immunopositive cases. Results.- Of 1874 samples included, EGFR mutations were detected in 27% (481 of 1796). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunohistochemistry was positive in 10% (174 of 1719) and equivocal in 3% (58 of 1719) of samples tested. ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization showed 81% (77 of 95) concordance with immunohistochemistry. Ros protooncogene 1 immunopositivity was noted in 13% (190 of 1425) of cases, with hybridization-confirmed rearrangements in 19.3% (26 of 135) of samples, all of which showed diffuse, strong- to moderate-intensity, cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. Ros proto-oncogene 1 protein overexpression without rearrangement was significantly common in EGFR-- mutant and ALK-rearranged adenocarcinomas. Conclusions. - Immunostaining is a robust method for ALK-- rearrangement testing, with fluorescence in situ hybridization adding value in the rare equivocal stained case. ROS1- rearrangement testing is more cost-effective if immunohistochemistry is followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization after excluding EGFR-mutant and ALK-rearranged adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Antifungal drug resistance in filamentous fungi, particularly Aspergillus species, is increasing worldwide. Therefore, new antifungal drugs or combinations of drugs are urgently required to overcome this public health situation. In the present study, we examined the antifungal activity of vancomycin-functionalized AuNPs. These functionalized AuNPs were characterized, and their antifungal activity and associated killing mechanism were investigated using conventional methodologies against the conidia of A. fumigatus and A. flavus. The differential antifungal activity of vancomycin-functionalized Au-NPs against the conidia of Aspergillus species is dependent on structural differences in the conidial cell wall. The results demonstrated potent fungicidal activity against A. fumigatus, with a MIC value of 4.68 mu g/mL, 93% germination inhibition, and 38.4% killing rate within 8 h of exposure. However, the activity against A. flavus was fungistatic; a MIC value of 18.7 mu g/mL and 35% conidial germination inhibition, followed by 28.4% killing rate, were noted under similar conditions. Furthermore, endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was 37.4 and 23.1% in conidial populations of A. fumigatus and A. flavus, respectively. Raman spectroscopy analysis confirmed the possible (but not confirmed) binding of functionalized AuNPs with the chitin and galactomannan components of the cell wall. A potential strategy that involves the exploration of antibacterial drugs using AuNPs as efficient drug carriers may also be appropriate for countering emerging drug resistance in filamentous fungi.

AB  - BackgroundIn this substudy of the Value of Gated-SPECT MPI for Ischemia- Guided PCI of non-culprit vessels in STEMI Patients with Multi vessel Disease after primary PCI trial after primary PCI we aim to assess if infarct size affects conventional measures of dyssynchrony at rest. Additionally, we explore if there is an independent correlation of stress-inducible ischemia with dyssynchrony at rest.MethodsThe 48 patients with imaging at randomization were analyzed. Gated-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI with vasodilator stress and technetium-99m-labeled tracers was performed. The phase histogram bandwidth (HBW), phase SD, and entropy were obtained with the QGS software. Correlation between dyssynchrony at rest and infarct size and inducible ischemia was performed using the Spearman test.ResultsAccording to normal database limits dyssynchrony parameters at rest were abnormal for men. In women only HBW was abnormal. Correlation between the summed rest score with dyssynchrony was significant only for entropy (P = 0.035). No correlation was observed for dyssynchrony and stress-induced ischemia.ConclusionEntropy, as a measure of dyssynchrony, has potential in the assessment of patients with STEMI and multivessel disease after primary PCI. Smaller residual myocardial scars in PCI-reperfused patients with STEMI may contribute to the lack of correlation between dyssynchrony at rest and infarct size and stress-induced ischemia, respectively.

TI  - A pre-6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line model reveals the mechanism of thalidomide therapy-related 6-cell leukemogenesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
KW  - B-CELL
KW  - IKZF1
AB  - Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative, is prescribed as maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). Patients with MM receiving lenalidomide were found to develop a distinct therapy-related B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the molecular mechanism by which lenalidomide drives B-ALL is unknown. We show that thalidomide treatment of B cell lines increased CD34 expression and fi bronectin adhesion. This resembled the effects of Ikzf1 loss of function mutations in B-ALL. IKZF1 is a transcription factor that can act as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor depending upon the target loci. In our experiments, thalidomide-induced degradation of IKZF1 increased the expression of its transcriptional repression targets Itga5 and CD34 explaining the increased adhesion and stemness. Strikingly, withdrawal of thalidomide lead to the mis-localization of IKZF1 to the cytoplasm. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation data showed a long-term effect of thalidomide treatment on IKZF1 target loci. This included decreased chromatin occupancy at early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) and Spi1 (PU.1). Consequently, B-cell lineage specifying transcription factors including Pax5, Spi1 and EBF1 were downregulated even after 7 days of thalidomide withdrawal. Our study thus provides a molecular mechanism of thalidomide-induced BALL whereby thalidomide alters the chromatin occupancy of IKZF1 at key B-cell lineage transcription factors leading to a persistent block in B-cell differentiation.

AB  - Background & objectives: Timely detection of population with beta-thalassemia trait (BTT) followed by genetic counselling is an advocated method of preventing the birth of a child with beta-thalassemia major. In this study we aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Gazelle, a point-of-care (POC) testing device, in screening for BTT in hospital laboratory setting. Methods: Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidelines were followed in developing study design, recruiting study participants and sample size calculation for the current research. A consecutive sample of 446 participants was recruited for this study and was tested for the reference test Gazelle as well as the gold standard cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (CE-HPLC). Low serum ferritin levels are known to interfere with the production of HbA2 and in turn lead to false negative results. Hence, the study population was divided into two categories with respect to a cut off value of 15ng/dl of serum ferritin and the results were analyzed. Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy of Gazelle for detecting BTT was found to be 95.3 per cent with a confidence interval (CI) of (92.9 - 97.1) and the sensitivity was 94.5 per cent with a 95% CI of (84.8 - 98.8). When analyzed by the serum ferritin level the diagnostic accuracy was found to be 94.7 per cent (91.1% - 97.1%) and 95.7 per cent (91.8% - 98.1%) for participants with serum ferritin level as > 15 ng/ml and < 15 ng/ml, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: This study found Gazelle to be a good screening tool for beta-thalassemia trait with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. However, it is recommended that the final confirmation of the diagnosis done by a diagnostic test like HPLC or Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE).

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the visual outcome of mini-scleral contact lenses (MSLs) in keratoconus following the resolution of acute hydrops. Methods: This was a prospective observational case series of patients of healed hydrops in keratoconus fitted with an MSL (Keracare, Acculens, Lakewood, CO) who were managed for acute hydrops medically or surgically at least 3 months prior. Uncorrected visual acuity, best spectacles-corrected visual acuity, best lens-corrected visual acuity, topographic indices, keratometric indices, contact lens parameters, and ocular aberrometric changes were evaluated. All patients were followed up for at least 3 months. Results: Eighteen eyes of 17 patients were included in the analysis. The mean post-hydrops topographic values of the eyes included flat keratometric value (K1) 64.93 +/- 10.88 (range 44.30-93.40) diopters (D), steep keratometric value (K2) 70.41 +/- 10.92 D (range 45.8-98.6 D), and Kmax of 79.53 +/- 17.73 D (range 50-130.2). The final mini-scleral lens's mean dioptric power was -8.56 +/- 3.96 D (range -18 to -4). Visual acuity significantly improved from post-hydrops resolution uncorrected visual acuity of 1.5 +/- 0.71 logMAR to 0.79 +/- 0.18 logMAR best spectacles-corrected visual acuity to 0.27 +/- 0.01 logMAR best lens-corrected visual acuity (P-value <0.0001). Similarly, there was considerable improvement in corneal aberrometric values after wearing an MSL. At the 3-month follow-up, 15 patients (16 eyes) were compliant to contact lens use with a minimum of 6 to 8 hr daily while two patients (2 eyes) were poorly compliant. Conclusions: A MSL is a valuable option for visual rehabilitation in keratoconus following the resolution of acute hydrops.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychophysical understanding of a slip stimulus applied at the fingertips. We hypothesized that the perception of slip and its characteristics, such as slip distance and slip speed depends on the interaction between slip direction, slip distance, and slip speed. We developed a novel slip induction device to simulate the artificial sense of slip for prehensile grasps. We conducted a psychophysical experiment on eight healthy subjects. The experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of slip direction on slip perception as well as on the perception of slip distance and slip speed. A series of psychophysical questions were asked at the end of the slip stimulus to record the subjective responses of the participants. The average perceptual accuracy (PA) (%) was used to quantify the subject responses. We showed that the perception of slip during a prehensile grasp is independent of slip direction, but slip direction significantly modulates the perception of slip distance and slip speed. We also observed that a significant interaction exists between slip distance and slip speed in the upward slip direction. It was also observed that the average PA was significantly different for various combinations of slip distance and slip speed in the upward slip direction. This study clearly establishes an interaction between the slip direction, slip distance, and slip speed for prehensile grasps. Our findings may have a direct impact on grip function assessment and rehabilitation for individuals with sensorimotor deficits.

KW  - child to adult care
KW  - pediatric neurosurgery
AB  - In India, adult neurosurgeons are required to care for children regularly because the concept of dedicated pediatric specialty care is not yet entirely established in the subcontinent. Likewise, pediatric neurosurgeons do not exclusively offer their services to the young, but they also provide care to adult patients with neurosurgical disorders. This creates a medical system where the transition between specialties is not often a formal and recognized aspect of neurosurgical care because most neurosurgeons provide care for patients of all ages. Additionally, there are very few teams geared toward caring for conditions in children that merit lifelong medical support, with spina bifida (SB) being one of them. Since there are no focused or structured pediatric programs on a large scale, developing a multidisciplinary clinic for adults becomes challenging. A pragmatic approach using technology-based education, supported by an organized system or a coordinator, may be a new strategy. A new system utilizing telemedicine and smartphones for established patients maybe an alternative option for SB children in India. During virtual video conferences, an established patient may benefit from multispecialty care and education toward a smooth transition that avoids significant issues with time, transportation, or financial constraints. Achieving a seamless transition among allied specialists from the pediatric to adult systems is a utopia. The current system in the subcontinent may be improved, with an opportunity to develop smooth transition care between coordinated specialists (who simultaneously treat children and adults). Learning from various global SB management styles, the Indian transition situation may offer another model in the near future.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to examine the sources of stress among first-year medical students; the frequency of their coping strategies; the factors associated with specific stressors and specific coping strategies adopted by the participants.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study with 409 first-year students at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam. The Vietnamese versions of the Higher Education Stress Inventory (V_HESI) and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (V_Brief COPE) were validated and were used as measurement instruments for participants' sources of stress and coping strategies frequencies. The survey comprised questions of socioeconomic status, stress-related issues, the six sources of stress (using the V_HESI), and the nine coping strategies (using the V_Brief COPE).Results Among the six sources of stress, "Worries about future competence/endurance" had the highest mean score (3.02 +/- 0.64), while "Mismatch in professional role expectations" had the lowest score (1.60 +/- 0.53). "Financial concerns" and "Academic workloads" were also significant sources of stress. Regarding coping strategies, Self-distraction was most frequently adopted by the participants (2.80 +/- 0.68). Problem-solving (2.72 +/- 0.53) and seeking Social support (2.62 +/- 0.70) were also common adaptive strategies. Avoidance (1.87 +/- 0.55) and substance-use (1.27 +/- 0.55) were the least frequent strategies. Students who experienced acute stress event were more likely to have financial concerns compared to others. Substance use was positively associated with stressors from "Mismatch in professional role expectations", "Non-supportive educational environment", "Having physical issues" and "Having part-time job". Self-blame was more frequent among students with "Worries about future competence/endurance", "Financial concerns", and "Academic workload". Male student tended to adopt humor strategy (beta = 0.19, p = 0.02), while less likely to utilize religious practices (beta = -0.21, p = 0.01).Conclusions Two-thirds of the participants reported moderate to high levels of stress. "Worries about future competence/endurance" was the most concerned stressor, followed by "Academic workload", and "Financial concerns". The first-year medical students reported high frequency of utilization "Self-distraction", "Problem-solving" and "Social support" when confronting stress. The findings may help inform the school management to better support students' well-being.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and is characterized by low levels of acetyl and butyrylcholine, increased oxidative stress, inflammation, accumulation of metals, and aggregations of A beta and tau proteins. Current treatments for AD provide only symptomatic relief without impacting the pathological hallmarks of the disease. In our ongoing efforts to develop naturally inspired novel multitarget molecules for AD, through extensive medicinal chemistry efforts, we have developed 13a, harboring the key functional groups to provide not only symptomatic relief but also targeting oxidative stress, able to chelate iron, inhibiting NLRP3, and A beta(1-42) aggregation in various AD models. 13a exhibited promising anticholinesterase activity against AChE (IC50 = 0.59 +/- 0.19 mu M) and BChE (IC50 = 5.02 +/- 0.14 mu M) with excellent antioxidant properties in DPPH assay (IC50 = 5.88 +/- 0.21 mu M) over ferulic acid (56.49 +/- 0.62 mu M). The molecular docking and dynamic simulations further corroborated the enzyme inhibition studies and confirmed the stability of these complexes. Importantly, in the PAMPA-BBB assay, 13a turned out to be a promising molecule that can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Notably, 13a also exhibited iron-chelating properties. Furthermore, 13a effectively inhibited self- and metal-induced A beta(1-42) aggregation. It is worth mentioning that 13a demonstrated no symptom of cytotoxicity up to 30 mu M concentration in PC-12 cells. Additionally, 13a inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome and mitigated mitochondrial-induced reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential damage triggered by LPS and ATP in HMC-3 cells. 13a could effectively reduce mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the Drosophila model of AD. Finally, 13a was found to be efficacious in reversing memory impairment in a scopolamine-induced AD mouse model in the in vivo studies. In ex vivo assessments, 13a notably modulates the levels of superoxide, catalase, and malondialdehyde along with AChE and BChE. These findings revealed that 13a holds promise as a potential candidate for further development in AD management.

AB  - Pantothenate synthetase protein plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), which is a crucial molecule involved in a number of cellular processes including the metabolism of fatty acid, energy production, and the synthesis of various biomolecules, which is necessary for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Therefore, inhibiting this protein could disrupt CoA synthesis, leading to the impairment of vital metabolic processes within the bacterium, ultimately inhibiting its growth and survival. This study employed molecular docking, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to identify promising phytochemical compounds targeting pantothenate synthetase for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Among 239 compounds, the top three (rutin, sesamin, and catechin gallate) were selected, with binding energy values ranging from -11 to -10.3 kcal/mol, and the selected complexes showed RMSD (<3 & Aring;) for 100 ns MD simulation time. Furthermore, molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations affirmed the stability of these three selected phytochemicals with binding energy ranges from -82.24 +/- 9.35 to -66.83 +/- 4.5 kcal/mol. Hence, these identified natural plant-derived compounds as potential inhibitors of pantothenate synthetase could be used to inhibit TB infection in humans.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a grave public health concern and is considered the foremost contributor to human mortality resulting from infectious disease. Due to the stringent clonality and extremely restricted genomic diversity, conventional methods prove inefficient for in-depth exploration of minor genomic variations and the evolutionary dynamics operating in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) populations. Until now, the majority of reviews have primarily focused on delineating the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in predicting antibiotic resistant genes, surveillance of drug resistance strains, and M.tb lineage classifications. Despite the growing use of next generation sequencing (NGS) and WGS analysis in TB research, there are limited studies that provide a comprehensive summary of there role in studying macroevolution, minor genetic variations, assessing mixed TB infections, and tracking transmission networks at an individual level. This highlights the need for systematic effort to fully explore the potential of WGS and its associated tools in advancing our understanding of TB epidemiology and disease transmission. We delve into the recent bioinformatics pipelines and NGS strategies that leverage various genetic features and simultaneous exploration of host-pathogen protein expression profile to decipher the genetic heterogeneity and host-pathogen interaction dynamics of the M.tb infections. This review highlights the potential benefits and limitations of NGS and bioinformatics tools and discusses their role in TB detection and epidemiology. Overall, this review could be a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians interested in NGS-based approaches in TB research.

AB  - AimsUrothelial carcinoma (UC) demonstrates significant molecular and histologic heterogeneity. The WHO 2022 classification has hinted at adding molecular signatures to the morphologic diagnosis. As morphology and associated molecular repertoire may potentially translate to choices of and response to therapy and relapse rate, broader acceptability of recognizing these key features among uropathologists is needed. This prompted an international survey to ascertain the practice patterns in classical/subtype UC among uropathologists across the globe.Methods and ResultsA survey instrument was shared among 98 uropathologists using SurveyMonkey software. Anonymized respondent data were analysed. The response rate was 85%. A majority were in concordance with the profiles of luminal (93%) and basal (82%) types. Opinion on the FGFR3 testing platform was variable. While 95% concurred that TERT promoter mutation is the key driver in UC, 72% had the opinion that APOBEC mutagenesis is the main signature in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Uropathologists have divergent opinions on MIBC and ERCC2 mutations. Among the participants, 94% would quantify aggressive micropapillary and sarcomatoid histology, while 88% would reevaluate another transurethral resection of the bladder tumour specimen in nonmuscle invasive tumour with micropapillary, small cell, or sarcomatoid histology. A leading number agreed to specific molecular signatures of micropapillary (93%), plasmacytoid (97%), and small cell (86%) subtypes. Ninety-six percent of participants agreed that a small-cell component portends a more aggressive course and should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 63% would perform HER2/neu testing only on oncologist's request in advanced tumours. Ninety percent agreed that microsatellite instability testing, although not a standard protocol, should be considered in young patients with upper tract UC. Eighty-six percent agreed that UC with high tumour mutational burden would be a better candidate for immunotherapy.ConclusionIn the era of precision medicine, enhanced understanding of molecular heterogeneity of UC will contribute to better therapeutic options, novel biomarker discovery, innovative management protocols, and outcomes. Our survey provides a broad perspective of pathologists' perceptions and experience regarding incorporation of histomolecular approaches to "personalize" therapy. Due to variable clinical adoption, there is a need for additional data using uniform study criteria. This will drive generation of best practice guidelines in this area for widespread and consistent clinical utility.

AB  - Background Supratentorial intraventricular tumors, encompassing lateral and third ventricular tumors, are uncommon intracranial neoplasms, typically slow-growing and benign, manifesting symptoms only upon reaching a substantial size. This study aims to identify optimal surgical approaches, assess the prevalence and characteristics of these tumors, and evaluate postoperative outcomes among pediatric and adult age groups.
   Methods A retrospective comparative study at a tertiary care hospital from January 2014 to June 2020 included 165 patients (68 pediatrics, 97 adults) meeting inclusion criteria for intraventricular tumor management. Data covered demographic factors, clinical history, neurological assessments, neuroimaging, surgical approaches, histopathological diagnoses, immunohistochemical features, adjuvant therapies, follow-up status, postoperative complications, and morbidity/mortality.
   Results Ventricular tumor incidence showed male preponderance in both adults (M:F = 1.2:1) and pediatrics (M:F = 3:1). Lateral ventricles were the most common location. Pediatric cases exhibited more frequent calcifications on computed tomography scans (35.6% vs. 29.5%). Grade II and III tumors were more prevalent in adults within the lateral ventricle (27.1 and 1.9%) compared with pediatrics (6.5 and 8.4%). The third ventricle predominantly featured benign lesions, with pediatric patients experiencing significantly longer hospital stays (16.12 +/- 21.94 days vs. 9.58 +/- 6.21 days) (p = 0.006). Adults and pediatric patients showed a significant difference in high-grade lateral ventricle tumors ( p -value = 0.002).
   Conclusions Supratentorial ventricular tumors are relatively more prevalent in children than adults, presenting challenges due to size and bleeding risks. Surgical resection is the primary treatment, with a focus on the optimal approach for gross total excision to reduce recurrence risk.

AB  - Maxillofacial prosthesis play an important role in the rehabilitation of patients with facial defects resulting from trauma, surgery or congenital anomalies. This review article discusses different categories of materials including acrylic resin, vinyl polymer, chlorinated polyethylene, polyurethane and silicone elastomers and highlights their advantages and limitations. In particular, the current materials used in maxillofacial prosthetics, i.e. silicone material, RTV (room-temperature vulcanized) silicone and HTV (high-temperature vulcanized) silicone are highlighted focusing on the prevailing challenges and their physico-mechanical properties for maxillofacial prosthesis application. Finally, the effect of tropical climate and further perspectives on RTV and HTV based maxillofacial materials are critically discussed to motivate potential research in this area.

AB  - Olfml3 is a microglia-specific protein whose role in neuroinflammation is elusive. In silico analysis was conducted to characterize the Olfml3 protein, followed by molecular docking and MD simulation to check possible interaction with Iba1. Further, expression and co-localization analysis was performed in the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory mice brains. Results suggest that Olfml3 physically interacts with Iba1. Olfml3 and Iba1 expression increases during neuroinflammation in mice brains. Olfml3 was observed to co-localize with Iba1, and the number of Olfml3 and Iba1 dual-positive cells increased in the brain of the neuroinflammatory mice model. Thus, Olfml3 could potentially participate in microglia functions by interacting with Iba1.

AB  - Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare autoimmune disorder where autoantibodies target the desmosomal proteins resulting in blistering of oral mucosa and skin. While the pathogenesis of PV is mainly mediated by the adaptive immune system, key players of innate immunity are also emerging. This study outlines the phenotypic as well as functional attributes of NK cells in PV. Through in-depth analysis using flow cytometry we identified an increase in the frequency of CD56+ + CD3-- NK cells and their subtypes in periphery. Along with this there is an increased frequency of IFN gamma+ gamma + CD56 bright CD16dim dim NK cells. mRNA expression of sorted NK cells for differentially expressed genes, particularly key transcription factors such as T-bet and EOMES, as well as surface receptors like NKG2D and KIR2D, and the cytokine IFN gamma, gamma, displayed significant upregulation. A significant activation of NK cells was seen in the disease state. The levels of perforin and IFN gamma gamma were significantly elevated in the culture supernatants of patients. Additionally, a significantly higher cytotoxicity of NK cells in PV was observed. In lesioned tissues of PV, NK related markers were significantly increased. Lastly, we observed NK cells using confocal microscopy in the tissue biopsies of patients which showed significant infiltration of CD56+ + CD3-- NK cells at the lesional sites. This study aimed to shed light on the pivotal role of NK cells in the immunopathology of PV, offering a thorough understanding of their behaviour and changes in expression which might help in contributing to the development of novel therapeutics.

AB  - BackgroundSpinal arteriovenous shunts and spinal dysraphism both have a different underlying cause, disease spectrum and developmental process; hence, these entities rarely coexist in a patient. Here, we reported four cases of coexistence of adult-onset spinal arteriovenous shunt and spinal dysraphism in the same patient along with their therapeutic embolisation. Additionally, we conducted an extensive literature review to explore the potential theories and explanations for this coexistence.MethodsWe retrospectively searched our imaging database from January 2015 to December 2023 to identify instances of spinal arteriovenous shunts occurring in patients with spinal dysraphism or neural tube defect disorders. MRI and angiographic imaging, clinical presentation, treatment and follow-up were analysed.ResultsFour patients with arteriovenous fistula/shunt and spinal dysraphism were included in the study. The mean age of presentation was 35.5 years. The most common symptoms were sensory disturbance and motor weakness. Arteriovenous fistula or shunt was located at the lumber region in one patient and at the sacral region in three cases. Two patients have a prior history of surgery in first decade. Two patients were treated with glue embolisation. The internal iliac artery was a common feeder in all cases.ConclusionsThe rare coexistence of neural tube defects with spinal vascular abnormalities should be considered when assessing a middle-aged patient with neural tube defect and myelopathy. Correct diagnosis can help in treatment planning and thereby improve prognosis.

AB  - Introduction The treatment approach for recently diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations primarily relies on confirming the tissue diagnosis as non-squamous NSCLC. This routine clinical practice of tissue diagnosis imposes several barriers and delays in turnaround time (TAT) for biomarker testing, significantly delaying the time to treatment. The objective of this study is to investigate the 'plasma first' approach for detection of EGFR mutation in advanced stage treatment na & iuml;ve NSCLC patients. Methods We prospectively collected blood samples of treatment na & iuml;ve patients with clinical and radiological suspicion of advanced stage NSCLC prior to obtaining tissue biopsy. Plasma cfDNA was tested for EGFR mutation using two different methods. We compared the sensitivity and TAT of liquid biopsy with tissue biopsy. Results In total, we analyzed plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of 236 patients suspected of having advanced NSCLC for EGFR mutations. We observed a notably shorter turnaround time (TAT) of 3 days, which was significantly quicker compared to the 12-day TAT for tissue biopsy (p < 0.05). The ddPCR method had a sensitivity of 82.8%, which was higher than 66.34% sensitivity of ARMS-PCR. The current study also highlights that there is no significant difference in the clinical outcome of the patients whether treated based on liquid biopsy only or tissue biopsy (median progression-free survival of 11.56 vs. 11.9 months; p = 0.94). Conclusions Utilizing a 'plasma first' strategy, given its shorter turnaround time, strong positive concordance and comparable outcomes to tissue biopsy, emerges as a highly specific and reliable method for detecting EGFR mutations in advanced-stage NSCLC.

AB  - PurposeThis study evaluates the efficacy of SISCOS (Subtraction ictal-interictal SPECT coregistered to SPECT) in localizing the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), comparing its predictive performance with MRI and post-surgical outcomes based on ILAE classification.Methods84 patients with drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) who were operated and had histopathology consistent with FCD, were included in the study. All patients had undergone a complete work-up including SISCOS and MRI for EZ localization, followed by discussion in the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery meeting prior to surgery. Ictal & interictal perfusion SPECT studies were performed with Tc-99 m Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer (Tc-99 m ECD) followed by SISCOS analysis using SPM2 and Bioimage Suite 2.6. Concordance for localization was determined by comparing with the surgical resection site and post-surgical outcomes were assessed using the ILAE classification.ResultsThe concordance for EZ localization demonstrated by SISCOS was 73.8% and MRI was 82.1%. 52 patients (61.9%) had good surgical outcome and 31(59%) of these were FCD type 2. In patients with discordant MRI findings, SISCOS was able to provide localisation in 86% (13/15), with 69.2% showing good surgical outcomes. Sensitivity of SISCOS and MRI was 73% (95% CI = 59-84.8%) and 78% (95% CI = 67.5-90.3%) respectively with no significant difference between the two. In FCD type I, both SISCOS and MRI revealed a similar a sensitivity of 76.4% (95%CI = 50.1-93.2%). Concordant cases exhibited higher seizure-free odds ratios for both modalities.ConclusionSISCOS is effective in localizing the EZ in FCD patients, comparable to MRI. Integrating SISCOS and MRI enhances lesion detection, especially in MRI discordant cases. A comprehensive diagnostic approach utilizing SISCOS and MRI can optimize the non-invasive pre-surgical assessment in DRE thereby guiding surgical decision-making in a resource-limited setting.

AB  - BackgroundHousehold air pollution arising from combustion of unclean fuels during cooking activities causes serious respiratory health effects. This study investigated patterns of household cooking fuel use and its effect on respiratory health status of women and children.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in rural households of Ballabgarh, Haryana during December 2019 to January 2020 among 18-45 years old women and their children having age between 6 and 59 months. A total of 450 households were selected using simple random sampling. Cooking fuel use was categorised as unclean (Wood, dung cakes, crop residues) and clean (LPG and electricity). The classification of mixed fuel use (predominantly unclean or clean) was based upon duration of unclean fuel use >= 2.5 h per day. The clinical history and physical examination was done using a semi-structured questionnaire. Assessment of respiratory health status of women participants was done using peak expiratory flow meter and presence of pneumonia in children was evaluated as per Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) guidelines.ResultsOverall use of unclean cooking fuels was predominant in 59.6% of households and 71.8% of households had mixed fuel use. Only clean fuel use was in 11.3% of households. Nasal stuffiness, breathing difficulty and cough were observed among 13.1%, 10.5% and 8.5% among women while the common respiratory symptoms in children were cough (27.8%) and runny nose (22.9%). As compared to clean fuels, women using unclean fuels were more likely to have any respiratory symptom (aOR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.5-6.0) and impaired pulmonary functions (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-2.9). Cooking fuel use was not associated with respiratory symptoms and presence of pneumonia in children living in the households.ConclusionCooking with unclean fuel continues to be prevalent in the households of rural Ballabgarh and adversely affects the respiratory health of women indicating strengthening of initiatives promoting clean fuel use.

AB  - The presence of a normal large blood vessel (LBV) in a tumor region can impact the evaluation of quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) parameters and tumor classification. Hence, there is a need for automatic removal of LBVs from brain tissues including intratumoral regions for achieving an objective assessment of tumors. This retrospective study included 103 histopathologically confirmed brain tumor patients who underwent MRI, including DCE-MRI data acquisition. Quantitative DCE-MRI analysis was performed for computing various parameters such as wash-out slope (Slope-2), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood plasma volume fraction (Vp), and volume transfer constant (K-trans). An approach based on data-clustering algorithm, morphological operations, and quantitative DCE-MRI maps was proposed for the segmentation of normal LBVs in brain tissues, including the tumor region. Here, three widely used data-clustering algorithms were evaluated on two types of quantitative maps: (a) Slope-2, and (b) a new proposed combination of rCBV and Slope-2 maps. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-MRI hyperintense lesions were also automatically segmented using deep learning-based architecture. The accuracy of LBV segmentation was qualitatively assessed blindly by two experienced observers, and Likert scoring was also obtained from each individual and compared using Cohen's Kappa test, and multiple statistical features from quantitative DCE-MRI parameters were obtained in the segmented tumor. t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed for comparing the effect of removal of LBVs on parameters as well as on tumor grading. k-means clustering exhibited better accuracy and computational efficiency. Tumors, in particular high-grade gliomas (HGGs), showed a high contrast compared with normal tissues (relative % difference = 18.5%) on quantitative maps after the removal of LBVs. Statistical features (95(th) percentile values) of all parameters in the tumor region showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between with and without LBV maps. Similar results were obtained for the ROC curve analysis for differentiation between low-grade gliomas and HGGs. Moreover, after the removal of LBVs, the rCBV, rCBF, and Vp maps show better visualization of tumor regions.

AB  - Objectives: Perimarginal nodes (PMN) lie in close relationship with marginal mandibular nerve (MMN), in the lymphatic drainage pathway of gingivo-buccal cancers (GBC), above the lower border of mandible and remain unaddressed in conventional neck dissection. We have aimed to define the boundaries of perimarginal node dissection, explore incidence of PMN metastasis and its correlation with histopathological characteristics. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on 112 consecutive patients of GB carcinoma. PMN dissection was performed in an anatomically defined quadrangle. Prospective clinical characteristics included subsite, tumor and nodal stage, location of primary and clinical skin involvement. Histopathological characteristics analyzed included grade, size, pathological tumor, nodal stage, skin and/or bone involvement, depth of invasion, Brandwein Gensler histological risk score and lympho-vascular emboli. MMN function was graded at 3 and 6 months post-operatively. Results: The PMN were identified histologically in 75.89 % patients. 15.2 % patients harboured metastasis in PMN. 16.7% patients had clinically occult metastasis with 11.7% having isolated PMN metastasis. None of the pre-operative clinical factors was found to be significant in predicting incidence of metastasis. Higher nodal burden (p = 0.01) and pathological skin involvement (p = 0.03) were found statistically significant on multivariable analysis. At 6 months follow-up, none of the patients had any MMN functional deformity at rest. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of occult PMN metastasis from gingivo-buccal complex cancer. High nodal stage and pathological skin involvement are independent predictors for PMN metastasis. PMN dissection must be performed in all cases of GB cancer.

AB  - BackgroundSurgery is the primary treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but microscopic residual disease may be unavoidable. Preclinical studies have shown that volatile anesthetics might suppress host immunity and promote a pro-malignant environment that supports cancer cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, whereas propofol may preserve cell-mediated immunity and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. However, clinical evidence that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) can reduce tumor recurrence after curative resection remains inconsistent due to the retrospective observational nature of previous studies. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that the recurrence-free survival (RFS) after curative resection of NSCLC is higher in patients who received TIVA than volatile anesthetics (GAS) in this multicenter randomized trial.MethodsThis double-blind, randomized trial will enroll patients at 22 international sites, subject to study registration, institutional review board approval, and patient written informed consent. Eligible patients are adult patients undergoing lung resection surgery with curative intent for NSCLC. Exclusion criteria will be contraindications to study drugs, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status IV or higher, or preexisting distant metastasis or malignant tumor in other organs. At each study site, enrolled subjects will be randomly allocated into the TIVA and GAS groups with a 1:1 ratio. This pragmatic trial does not standardize any aspect of patient care. However, potential confounders will be balanced between the study arms. The primary outcome will be RFS. Secondary outcomes will be overall survival and complications within postoperative 7 days. Enrollment of 5384 patients will provide 80% power to detect a 3% treatment effect (hazard ratio of 0.83) at alpha 0.05 for RFS at 3 years.DiscussionConfirmation of the study hypothesis would demonstrate that a relatively minor and low-cost alteration in anesthetic management has the potential to reduce cancer recurrence risk in NSCLC, an ultimately fatal complication. Rejection of the hypothesis would end the ongoing debate about the relationship between cancer recurrence and anesthetic management.Trial registrationThe study protocol was prospectively registered at the Clinical trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov, NCT06330038, principal investigator: Hyun Joo Ahn; date of first public release: March 25, 2024) before the recruitment of the first participant.

AB  - PurposeThe current study explores the application of 3D U-Net architectures combined with Inception and ResNet modules for precise lung nodule detection through deep learning-based segmentation technique. This investigation is motivated by the objective of developing a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for effective diagnosis and prognostication of lung nodules in clinical settings.MethodsThe proposed method trained four different 3D U-Net models on the retrospective dataset obtained from AIIMS Delhi. To augment the training dataset, affine transformations and intensity transforms were utilized. Preprocessing steps included CT scan voxel resampling, intensity normalization, and lung parenchyma segmentation. Model optimization utilized a hybrid loss function that combined Dice Loss and Focal Loss. The model performance of all four 3D U-Nets was evaluated patient-wise using dice coefficient and Jaccard coefficient, then averaged to obtain the average volumetric dice coefficient (DSCavg) and average Jaccard coefficient (IoUavg) on a test dataset comprising 53 CT scans. Additionally, an ensemble approach (Model-V) was utilized featuring 3D U-Net (Model-I), ResNet (Model-II), and Inception (Model-III) 3D U-Net architectures, combined with two distinct patch sizes for further investigation.ResultsThe ensemble of models obtained the highest DSCavg of 0.84 +/- 0.05 and IoUavg of 0.74 +/- 0.06 on the test dataset, compared against individual models. It mitigated false positives, overestimations, and underestimations observed in individual U-Net models. Moreover, the ensemble of models reduced average false positives per scan in the test dataset (1.57 nodules/scan) compared to individual models (2.69-3.39 nodules/scan).ConclusionsThe suggested ensemble approach presents a strong and effective strategy for automatically detecting and delineating lung nodules, potentially aiding CAD systems in clinical settings. This approach could assist radiologists in laborious and meticulous lung nodule detection tasks in CT scans, improving lung cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.

AB  - Informed by the almost unimaginable unmet need for cardiac surgery in the developing regions of the world, leading surgeons, cardiologists, editors in chief of the major cardiothoracic journals as well as representatives of medical industry and government convened in December 2017 to address this unacceptable disparity in access to care. The ensuing "Cape Town Declaration" constituted a clarion call to cardiac surgical societies to jointly advocate the strengthening of sustainable, local cardiac surgical capacity in the developing world. The Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance (CSIA) was thus created, comprising The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery (ASCVTS), the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the World Heart Federation (WHF). The guiding principle was advocacy for sustainable cardiac surgical capacity in low-income countries. As a first step, a global needs assessment confirmed rheumatic heart disease as the overwhelming pathology requiring cardiac surgery in these regions. Subsequently, CSIA published a request for proposals to support fledgling programs that could demonstrate the backing by their governments and health care institution. Out of 11 applicants, and following an evaluation of the sites, including site visits to the 3 finalists, Mozambique and Rwanda were selected as the first Pilot Sites. Subsequently, a mentorship and training agreement was completed between Mozambique and the University of Cape Town, a middle-income country with a comparable burden of rheumatic heart disease. The agreement entails regular video calls between the heart teams, targeted training across all aspects of cardiac surgery, as well as on-site presence of mentoring teams for complex cases with the strict observance of "assisting only." In Rwanda, Team Heart, a US and Rwanda-based non-governmental organization (NGO) that has been performing cardiac surgery in Rwanda and helping to train the cardiac surgery workforce since 2008, has agreed to continue providing mentorship for the local team and to assist in the establishment of independent cardiac surgery with all that entails. This involves intermittent virtual conferences between Rwandan and US cardiologists for surgical case selection. Five years after CSIA was founded, its "Seal of Approval" for the sustainability of endorsed programs in Mozambique and Rwanda has resulted in higher case numbers, a stronger government commitment, significant upgrades of infrastructure, the nurturing of generous consumable donations by industry and the commencement of negotiations

AB  - Aims: Patient satisfaction is associated with positive diabetes outcomes. However, there are no identified studies that evaluate both patient- and clinic-level predictors influencing diabetes care satisfaction longitudinally. Methods: Data from the INtegrating DEPrEssioN and Diabetes treatmENT trial was used to perform the analysis. We used fixed and random effects models to assess whether and how changes in patient-level predictors (treatment assignment, depression symptom severity, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, LDL cholesterol, and haemoglobin A1C) from 0 to 24 months and clinic-level predictors (visit frequency, visit cost, number of specialists, wait time, time spent with healthcare provider, and receiving verbal reminders) measured at 24 months influence diabetes care satisfaction from 0 to 24 months. Results: Model 1 (patient-level predictors) accounted for 7% of the change in diabetes satisfaction and there was a significant negative relationship between change in depressive symptoms and care satisfaction (beta = -0.23, SE = 0.12, p < 0.05). Within Model 1, 2% of the variance was explained by clinic-level predictors. Model 2 included both patient- and clinic-level predictors and accounted for 18% of the change in diabetes care satisfaction. Within Model 2, 9% of the variance was attributed to clinic-level predictors. There was also a cross-level interaction where the change in depression had less of an impact on the change in satisfaction for those who received a verbal reminder (beta = -0.11, SE = 0.21, p = 0.34) compared with those who did not receive a reminder (beta = -0.62, SE = 0.08, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Increased burden of depressive symptoms influences diabetes care satisfaction. Clinic-level predictors also significantly influence diabetes care satisfaction and can reduce dissatisfaction in primary care, specifically, reminder calls from clinic staff.

AB  - BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive among the tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), and has a dismal prognosis. Altered metabolism, especially the increased rate of aerobic glycolysis promotes rapid proliferation of GBM cells. Here, we investigated the role of aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family member A1 (ALDH5A1), a mitochondrial enzyme in the aspect of GBM metabolism. We also studied the regulatory mechanisms of altered ALDH5A1 expression in GBM.Approach and resultsWe show that ALDH5A1 is significantly downregulated in GBM patients in a grade dependent manner as compared to control brain and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis. It is significantly downregulated under hypoxia and is a direct target of the hypoxia induced microRNA: miR-210. Ectopic overexpression of ALDH5A1 in GBM cell lines U-87 MG and T98G markedly reduced their proliferation, 3D spheroid forming ability, and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ALDH5A1 upregulation increased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and reduced the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of GBM cells while miR-210 overexpression showed the opposite. A significant downregulation in the transcript levels of LDHA, PDK1, and SLC2A1; coupled with lower glucose uptake and lactate production upon ALDH5A1 overexpression reveals that ALDH5A1 significantly reduces the glycolytic capacity of GBM cells. Total ATP generated in 24 h was more when miR-210 was overexpressed, while a slight decrease in ATP formation was observed upon ALDH5A1 upregulation. Interestingly, we also observed that ALDH5A1 expression is elevated and miR-210 levels are downregulated in IDH-mutant glioma as compared to its wild-type form.ConclusionOverall, our findings suggest that miR-210 mediated downregulation of ALDH5A1 plays a critical role in tumor metabolism and helps maintaining a high glycolytic phenotype in GBM.

AB  - Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), genes similar to estrogen receptors, are identified as hormone-responsive systems associated with the ERR subfamily. These hormone-responsive systems facilitate oncometabolic programs to nourish cancer cell growth, a central node at the interface of cellular energy metabolism and cancer. Several independent studies have implicated ERR isoforms like ERR alpha, ERR beta, and ERR gamma in the pathways of cancer development and progression. The construction of tissue-specific ERR transgenic or knockout mice and the application of synthetic ligands have precisely indicated the critical and diverse role of ERR gamma than other isoforms. ERR gamma, plays a critical and diverse role, enabling switching metabolism to oncometabolism in favor of cancer cells, making it a "hot target" in cancer therapy. ERR gamma expression is correlated with the clinical status of diverse cancer types and various cancer tissue treatments. The dual feature of ERR gamma raises interest in understanding its biogenesis and function in different tissues. This review aims to describe the structural organization of ERRs, their central occupancy at the interface of cancer and metabolism, and their biogenesis and expression profile across different cancers. It concludes that ERR gamma has potential as a clinical marker in cancer prognosis and a novel non-conventional therapeutic target.

AB  - Epilepsy, affecting approximately 1% of the global population, manifests as recurring seizures and is heavily influenced by genetic factors. Recent advancements in genetic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of epilepsy's genetic landscape. Key studies, such as the discovery of mutations in ion channels (e.g., SCN1A and SCN2A), neurotransmitter receptors (e.g., GABRA1), and synaptic proteins (e.g., SYNGAP1, KCNQ2), have illuminated critical pathways underlying epilepsy susceptibility and pathogenesis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified specific genetic variations linked to epilepsy risk, such as variants near SCN1A and PCDH7, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and enabling personalized treatment strategies. Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (e.g., MBD5), histone modifications (e.g., HDACs), and noncoding RNAs (e.g., miR-134), play pivotal roles in altering gene expression and synaptic plasticity, contributing to epileptogenesis. These discoveries offer promising avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving outcomes for epilepsy patients. Genetic testing has become essential in clinical practice, facilitating precise diagnosis and tailored management approaches based on individual genetic profiles. Furthermore, insights into epigenetic regulation suggest novel therapeutic targets for developing more effective epilepsy treatments. In summary, this review highlights significant progress in understanding the genetic and epigenetic foundations of epilepsy. By integrating findings from key studies and specifying genes involved in epigenetic modifications, we underscore the potential for advanced therapeutic strategies in this complex neurological disorder, emphasizing the importance of personalized medicine approaches in epilepsy management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and consequences of augmentation cystoplasty in adult patients with small capacity bladder due to genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB). METHODS After approval of the institutional ethical committee, we retrospectively analyzed the database of adult patients with small capacity bladder due to GUTB treated by augmentation cystoplasty from January 2010 to December 2022 at our center. The patients were followed up at 6 weeks postoperatively, then every 3 months for first year and 6 months in second year, and then annually. Patients were assessed for symptoms, renal function, blood biochemistry levels, and ultrasound KUB at each follow-up visit. RESULTS A total of 40 patients underwent augmentation cystoplasty were included. All patients underwent augmentation cystoplasty either with ileum (n = 35) or sigmoid colon (n = 5). On longterm follow-up, there was statistically significant improvement in bladder capacity, decrease in voiding frequency (P = .00), decrease in eGFR (P = .02) and increase in serum creatinine (P = .02). Significant complications were wound infection 4 (10%), intestinal obstruction 1(2.5%), urinary tract infection 6 (15%), bladder stone 2 (5%), mucus retention 3 (7.5%), hypocalcemia with metabolic acidosis 2 (5%) and need of intermittent catheterization in 11 (27.5%) patients. CONCLUSION Multidrug therapy with judicious reconstructive surgery is the optimal treatment modality for GUTB with cicatrization sequelae. In GUTB, augmentation cystoplasty is a safe procedure and strict long-term follow-up is needed to prevent complications. UROLOGY 189: 119-125, 2024. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a structured therapeutic communication module on psychological distress and perceived needs among caregivers of critically ill patients. Background: Caregivers of critically ill patients experience intense psychological distress, and their needs often go unexpressed or unidentified. Structured therapeutic communication enables nurses to explore and fulfill these needs. Method: A mixed-method study was conducted among 30 caregivers of critically ill patients. During phase one, a qualitative interview was conducted, and a structured therapeutic communication module was developed based on Hildegard Peplau's Interpersonal Relations Theory. In the second phase, one group pre-test and post-test design was adopted. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a Semi-structured interview schedule were used to assess psychological distress and perceived needs, respectively. Results: Half of (50 %) the caregivers reported a high level of anxiety before intervention, with a mean of 11.30 (SD: 4.0), and 66.7 % of them had a high level of depression, with a mean of 12.03 (SD: 0.08). There was a statistically significant difference in anxiety (CI: 0.451-2.016) and depression (CI: 0.261-1.538) before and after the intervention. The qualitative analysis revealed unmet needs perceived by caregivers. Conclusion: Using a structured therapeutic communication module helps nurses to alleviate the psychological distress experienced by caregivers of CCU patients. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses need to be sensitive to the unexpressed needs of caregivers of critically ill patients. The structured therapeutic communication modules can be integrated into routine nursing care practice to ensure family-centered care.

AB  - Stromal-epithelial communication is an absolute necessity when it comes to the morphogenesis and pathogenesis of solid tissues, including the prostate and breast. So far, signalling pathways of several growth factors have been investigated. Besides such chemical factors, non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs have recently gained much interest because of their variety and complexity of action. Prostate and breast tissues being highly responsive to steroid hormones such as androgen and estrogen, respectively, it is not surprising that a huge set of available literature critically investigated the interplay between such hormones and miRNAs, especially in carcinogenesis. This review showcases our effort to highlight hormonally-related miRNAs that also somehow perturb the regular stromal-epithelial interactions during carcinogenesis in the prostate and breast. In future, we look forward to exploring how hormonal changes in the tissue microenvironment bring about miRNA-mediated changes in stromal-epithelial interactome in carcinogenesis and cancer progression.

AB  - We describe the histological organisation and mucin content in the digestive tract of the stream catfish Pseudecheneis sulcatus. The aim is to find the modifications of the digestive tract in relation to food resources of its habitat. The oesophageal mucosa consists of stratified squamous epithelium with many mucous-secreting cells. The thick muscularis contains an inner longitudinal and outer circular, striated muscle cells. The stomach is Jshaped and shows 6-7 thick mucosal folds that are separated from the submucosa by an organised muscularis mucosae. The mucosa consists of superficial cells with mucin granules, and deeper simple tubular gastric glands in cardia and fundus, but absent in pyloric region. The glandular epithelium shows oxynticopeptic cells containing zymogen granules and abundant tubulo-vesicular bodies. We provide evidence that the latter arise by budding from smooth endoplasmic reticulum and reach the apical cytoplasm. The anterior intestine shows longer mucosal folds with goblet cells (GC). GC are more in the posterior intestine and highest in the rectum. Myenteric neurons with myelinated and non-myelinated axons innervate the intrinsic musculature from stomach to rectum. Many stem cells are evident in the basal intestinal epithelium. They show darker nuclei and undifferentiated organelles. Mucin histochemistry reveals the predominance of neutral mucin (PAS+ positive) from oesophagus to rectum, and neutral and acidic mucin (alcian blue+, pH 2.5) in the posterior intestine to the rectum, with few GC colocalizing both. Ultrastructural features suggest that the species is adapted to omnivory and this is reflected in the predominance of neutral mucin in the digestive tract.

AB  - Neurexins are key adhesion proteins that coordinate extracellular and intracellular synaptic components. Nonetheless, the low abundance of these multidomain proteins has complicated any localization and structure-function studies. Here we combine an ALFA tag (AT)/nanobody (NbALFA) tool with classic genetics, cell biology and electrophysiology to examine the distribution and function of the Drosophila Nrx-1 in vivo. We generate full-length and Delta PDZ ALFA-tagged Nrx-1 variants and find that the PDZ binding motif is key to Nrx-1 surface expression. A PDZ binding motif provided in trans, via genetically encoded cytosolic NbALFA-PDZ chimera, fully restores the synaptic localization and function of Nrx Delta PDZ-AT. Using cytosolic NbALFA-mScarlet intrabody, we achieve compartment-specific detection of endogenous Nrx-1, track live Nrx-1 transport along the motor neuron axons, and demonstrate that Nrx-1 co-migrates with Rab2-positive vesicles. Our findings illustrate the versatility of the ALFA system and pave the way towards dissecting functional domains of complex proteins in vivo.
   It is challenging to localize synaptic proteins and dissect their functional domains in vivo. Here, the authors use the ALFA tag system to examine the trafficking and distribution of Drosophila Neurexin-1 and the role of the PDZ binding motif, and to accomplish its functional reconstitution in vivo.

AB  - In the pursuit of advancing sustainable agriculture through innovative biotechnological approaches, our research focuses on the transformative potential of nanoparticle-mediated cargo delivery via sonoporation that can potentially create reversible pores in plasma membranes and rigid cell walls, which in turn enhances the gene transfection efficiency. In this research study, we fabricated core-shell piezoelectric nanoparticles - specifically, barium titanate nanoparticles (BTNPs) encased in a silica shell, exhibiting an approximate diameter of 60 nm. These engineered nanoparticles were specifically crafted to proficiently transport nucleic acids into suspension cells of both monocots and dicots, employing the technique of sonoporation. In this study, we conducted comparative analyses between BTNPs and SNPs, employing the latter as a control, with the objective of establishing a highly efficient system for delivering diverse cargoes into plant suspension cells. The DNA adsorption capacity was around 40.1 mu g per mg of BTNP@SiO2. By keeping the intensity and frequency constant, time variations have been optimized for both type of cells by taking cell viability into consideration. At 160 W intensity and frequency of 40 kHz, the best ultrasonic treatment for transfection is obtained as 5 and 8 min for dicot and monocot cells, respectively. GUS quantitative analysis shows that in the presence of ultrasound, piezoelectric nanoparticles have enhanced the transfection efficiency in comparison to baseline naked pDNA delivery by 56.9 +/- 2.29 and 72.6 +/- 3.01% in dicot and monocot suspension cells, respectively. Our findings not only demonstrate the enhanced transfection efficiency of piezoelectric nanoparticles, but also underscore the significance of this approach for genotype-independent transfection. By offering a universal and streamlined method that is effective across various plant genotypes, this research presents a significant step forward in the field of plant genetic engineering. The genotype-independent transfection potential of our methodology has the power to transform the way genetic material is delivered into plant cells, with profound implications for addressing global challenges in agriculture and plant biology.

After removing 4 duplicate publications, 12 were found relevant to simulation and training in colorectal diseases. One publication relevant to the topic was added from literature, thirteen articles were studied.ResultsOf these, 5; 1; 4; and 3 were on inanimate models; animate model; 3D reconstructions; and training, respectively. Simulation models are available for posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. The same inanimate model was used in five articles. The animate model was based on a chicken cadaver. 3D models have been made for personalized preoperative assessment and to understand the imaging in anorectal malformation. One 3D model was made by regeneration of organoid epithelium. Training modules were made to evaluate surgical dissection, standardize surgical techniques, and improve proficiency.ConclusionSimulation models are an important tool for teaching the steps of surgery and discussing the nuances of operative complications among mentors and peers. With advances in this field, the development of high-fidelity models, more training modules, and consensus on surgical techniques will benefit surgical training.

AB  - AimTo study the published literature on robotic-assisted pull-through procedures for anorectal malformation.MethodA PubMed search was done on 10th April 2024, with the words "robotic AND Anorectal malformation". The articles were screened for relevance and the data were compiled on the safety, feasibility, technical details, and limitations of robotic-assisted procedures in children for anorectal malformation.ResultsThe search robotic and anorectal malformation gave ten articles. Two were excluded as they were not relevant. Two articles were added from cross-reference. Ten publications on robotic-assisted procedures for anorectal malformation were studied, describing procedures in thirty-three cases. The youngest child operated was 3 months old. All except one case were done in males. Most articles were from the US and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The principles involved in robotic-assisted anorectoplasty (RAARP) were the same as that of laparoscopic procedures. Complications reported included pelvic abscess, epididymo-orchitis, and stricture of pelvic tunnel or conversion to open. The magnification and endo-wrist technology of robotics facilitated the sharp dissection and ligation at origin of fistula. The mean operating time was 228.7 min (docking and console time), shortest being 86 min and mean hospital stay was 7 days. The number of ports used varied from 3 to 4 with 8.5 mm being the most commonly used umbilical port and 8 mm as working ports, although in one article, a 12 mm port was used for telescope. The prolonged operating time and cost are the two factors to be addressed in RAARP.ConclusionRobotic surgery is feasible in infants with ARM and safe in expert hands. Robotics is a very effective tool with its better ergonomics, tremor filtration, 3D magnification, and dexterity. Increasing awareness and referral to high-volume centers can tide over the cost factor, and good training of the surgeons can reduce the operative time.

AB  - Introduction: Overall, 30-40% patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis [ASUC] fail intravenous [IV] steroids, requiring medical rescue therapy/colectomy. Low baseline albumin predicts steroid non-response, and exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN] has been shown to improve steroid response and albumin levels. Albumin infusion, due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, might further improve steroid response in ASUC, which was evaluated in the present study. Methods: In this open-label, randomised, controlled trial, patients with ASUC were randomised in 1:1 ratio to either albumin + standard of care [SOC] + EEN [Albumin arm] or SOC + EEN [SOC arm], over January 2021-February 2023. Both arms received 5 days of EEN with 400 mg IV hydrocortisone/day. Patients in the Albumin arm were administered 5 days of 20% weight/volume [w/v] intravenous albumin [100 ml]. Primary outcome was first, steroid failure [need for rescue medical therapy or colectomy] and second, proportion of patients with adverse events. Results: In all, 61 patients [albumin: 30, SOC: 31][mean age 31.6 +/- 0.4 years, male 57.4%], were included. Baseline characteristics were comparable. There was no difference in steroid failure between Albumin and SOC arms (10/30 [33.33%] vs 13/31[41.94%], p = 0.49). No adverse events were reported with albumin infusions. Colectomy rate [10% vs 9.68%, p = 1], response to salvage medical therapy [88.89% vs 76.92%, p = 0.62] and median [interquartile range] duration of hospitalisation [10.5 [7-16] vs 10 [7-20], p = 0.43] were also comparable. The long-term composite outcome of colectomy and re-admission rates was numerically higher in the Albumin than the SOC arm [37.04% vs 17.86%, p > 0.05], although this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: There was no benefit of intravenous albumin infusion as an adjunct to IV steroids and EEN in patients with ASUC.

AB  - Background: Diabetic nephropathy represents a significant microvascular complication of diabetes, characterized by extracellular matrix accumulation, loss of cell-cell junctions, microalbuminuria, and diminished creatinine clearance. Despite its prevalence, therapeutic options dedicated to this condition are currently lacking. Natural products like bioflavonoids have garnered attention for their potential therapeutic benefits. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a bioflavonoid combination, including ginger extract, soy extract, and hesperetin, in a diabetic rat model. Methods: Diabetes was initiated in the rat pups via intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin on the fifth postnatal day. After six weeks, rats exhibiting blood sugar levels exceeding 160 mg/dL were allocated into diabetic control and treatment groups, with eight animals each. A subset of rats received citrate buffer as a control. The treatment group received the bioflavonoid combination orally for twenty-four weeks. Various parameters, including glycemic levels, urinary parameters, antioxidant status, mRNA expression via Western blot, gel zymography, and immunohistochemistry, were assessed at the study's conclusion. Results: The bioflavonoid combination demonstrated significant reductions in hyperglycemia and various urinary parameters compared to controls. Notably, it modulated MMP-9/TIMP-1 expression, upregulated GLUT-4, and downregulated TGF-8. Additionally, the combination enhanced total antioxidant capacity, indicating potential antioxidative benefits. Conclusions: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of a bioflavonoid combination (ginger extract, soy extract, and hesperetin) in improving renal function in diabetic nephropathy. By modulating key factors such as MMP-9/TIMP-1, TGF-8, and GLUT-4, this combination presents a promising avenue for further exploration in managing diabetic nephropathy. These findings underscore the importance of natural products as potential therapeutic agents in addressing diabetic complications.

AB  - Adipocyte characterization and assessing membrane proteins using flow cytometry has been proven to be challenging as adipocytes are fragile, especially in subjects with high BMI. We overcame these challenges through a protocol optimizing tissue digestion time by reducing intermediate steps to minimize adipocyte friction and breakage. We avoided requirement for specialized instrument configuration and used a modified gating strategy to prevent inclusion of lipid droplets during analysis. Up to 90% of the cell population were available in the gating area. We checked the expression level of ABCA1, a membrane protein reaffirming adipocyte selection. In summary, this protocol requires lesser tissue sample improving feasibility and cost efficiency. Thus, our flow cytometry method is an improvement for studying adipocyte membrane characteristics.
   Adipocyte characterization and assessing membrane proteins using flow cytometry has been challenging as adipocytes are fragile, especially in high BMI subjects. By lowering the adipocyte friction at multiple steps, the protocol significantly reduces the adipocyte breakage, which is a critical concern for the big and fragile adipocytes. We modified the standard adipocyte isolation and flow cytometry protocol on a flow analyzer. We reduced the number of steps and made it more user-friendly, without the requirement for any specific instrument add-ons.

AB  - Mosquitoes are important vectors for the transmission of several infectious diseases that lead to huge morbidity and mortality. The exhaustive use of synthetic insecticides has led to widespread resistance and environmental pollution. Using essential oils and nano-emulsions as novel insecticides is a promising alternative approach for controlling vector borne diseases. In the current study, Lantana camara EO and NE were evaluated for their larvicidal and pupicidal activities against Anopheles culicifacies. The inhibitory effect of EO and NE on AChE, NSE (alpha/beta), and GST was also evaluated and compared. GC-MS analysis of oil displayed 61 major peaks. The stable nano-emulsion with an observed hydrodynamic diameter of 147.62 nm was formed using the o/w method. The nano-emulsion exhibited good larvicidal (LC50 50.35 ppm and LC90 222.84 ppm) and pupicidal (LC50 54.82 ppm and LC90 174.58 ppm) activities. Biochemical evaluations revealed that LCEO and LCNE inhibited AChE, NSE (alpha/beta), and GST, displaying LCNE to be a potent binder to AChE and NSE enzyme, whereas LCEO showed higher binding potency towards GST. The nano-emulsion provides us with novel opportunities to target different mosquito enzymes with improved insecticidal efficacy. Due to its natural origin, it can be further developed as a safer and more potent larvicide/insecticide capable of combating emerging insecticide resistance.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Data are limited on the genetic profile of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) from developing countries. Here, we report one of the first study on genetic profile of patients with suspected PCD from India. In this prospective cross-sectional study, we enrolled 162 children with suspected PCD. We recorded clinical features, relevant laboratory tests for PCD and performed whole exome sequencing (WES). We are reporting 67 patients here who had positive variant/s on WES. We had 117 variants in 40 genes among 67 patients. Among the 108 unique variants, 33 were categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP). We had nine novel variants in out cohort. The 29 definite PCD cases, diagnosed by composite reference standards, had variants in 16 genes namely LRRC6/DNAAF11 (5), DNAH5 (3), CCDC39 (3), HYDIN (3), DNAH11 (2), CCDC40 (2), CCDC65 (2) and one each DNAAF3, DNAAF2, CFAP300, RPGR, CCDC103, CCDC114, SPAG1, DNAI1, and DNAH14. To conclude, we identified 108 unique variants in 40 genes among 67 patients. The common genes involved in definite cases of PCD in Indian patients were LRRC6, DNAH5, CCDC39, and HYDIN. Our findings suggest a need to develop a separate genetic panel for PCD in the Indian population.

KW  - PROGRESSION
KW  - APOPTOSIS
AB  - The interaction between stromal and tumor cells in tumor microenvironment is a crucial factor in Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) progression and therapy resistance. We have identified a long non-coding RNA, CERS6-AS1, upregulated in MCL and associated with poor overall survival. CERS6-AS1 expression was elevated in primary MCL within stromal microenvironment and in a subset of MCL cells adhered to stromal layer. These stromal-adhered MCL-subsets exhibited cancer stem cell signatures than suspension counterparts. Mechanistically, we found that downregulating CERS6-AS1 in MCL reduced Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor-1 (FGFR1), expression attributed to loss of its interaction with RNA-binding protein nucleolin. In addition, using in-silico approach, we have discovered a direct interaction between nucleolin and 5'UTR of FGFR1, thereby regulating FGFR1 transcript stability. We discovered a positive association of CERS6-AS1 with cancer stem cell signatures, and Wnt signaling. Building on these, we explored potential therapeutic strategies where combining nucleolin-targeting agent with FGFR1 inhibition significantly contributed to reversing cancer stem cell signatures and abrogated primary MCL cell growth on stromal layer. These findings provide mechanistic insights into regulatory network involving CERS6-AS1, nucleolin, and FGFR1 axis-associated crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cell interaction and highlights therapeutic potential of targeting a non-coding RNA in MCL.

AB  - Objective: Although several surgical techniques have been developed for treatment of gingival recession (GR), the underlying wound healing process remains relatively unexplored. This systematic review aimed to investigate the expression of wound healing markers in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) before and after surgical treatment of GR. Design: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting changes in the expression of GCF markers following any root coverage surgical procedure were identified from 4 electronic databases and manual searches followed by data extraction and result synthesis. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Overall certainty of evidence was summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Results: Four RCTs comprising 100 patients and investigating 15 biomarkers were included. Post-surgery, GCF levels of cytokines and inflammatory proteins were raised during the first 2 -10 days of healing. MMP-8 levels increased during the first week followed by a gradual decline. RoB was found to be high for all studies and the overall certainty of evidence was very low. Conclusion: A limited number of studies with large methodological variations precluded reliable conclusions. Well-designed studies powered for GCF markers ' levels that follow a standardized protocol for GCF sampling and processing are needed to draw conclusive evidence.

AB  - Gestational diabetes remains the most common medical disorder in pregnancy, with short-term and long-term consequences for mothers and offspring. New insights into pathophysiology and management suggest that the current gestational diabetes treatment approach should expand from a focus on late gestational diabetes to a personalised, integrated life course approach from preconception to postpartum and beyond. Early pregnancy lifestyle intervention could prevent late gestational diabetes. Early gestational diabetes diagnosis and treatment has been shown to be beneficial, especially when identified before 14 weeks of gestation. Early gestational diabetes screening now requires strategies for integration into routine antenatal care, alongside efforts to reduce variation in gestational diabetes care, across settings that differ between, and within, countries. Following gestational diabetes, an oral glucose tolerance test should be performed 6-12 weeks postpartum to assess the glycaemic state. Subsequent regular screening for both dysglycaemia and cardiometabolic disease is recommended, which can be incorporated alongside other family health activities. Diabetes prevention programmes for women with previous gestational diabetes might be enhanced using shared decision making and precision medicine. At all stages in this life course approach, across both high-resource and low-resource settings, a more systematic process for identifying and overcoming barriers to preventative care and treatment is needed to reduce the current global burden of gestational diabetes.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) and iNOS are crucial host factors in innate immunity against intracellular pathogens. However, the role of NO in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection in humans remains controversial, unlike in the murine model of TB. To investigate this, levels of NO, iNOS, and L-arginine, as well as the NOS2A gene polymorphism rs57234985 at the promoter region of NOS2A, were evaluated in pulmonary TB (PTB) patients and their household contacts (HHCs). Increased levels of NO and iNOS expression in HHCs indicated exposure to M. tb infection which was confirmed by higher levels of iNOS and NO in Mantoux-positive individuals. Furthermore, higher levels of arginine were detected in HHCs, suggesting its potential role in promoting optimal NO synthesis. PTB patients had higher levels of these analytes due to ongoing active infection. Interestingly, iNOS and NO levels were inversely related to bacterial burden, suggesting their antimicrobial role. NOS2A gene polymorphism was found to be associated with disease susceptibility, with the TT genotype linked to increased iNOS expression. To conclude, iNOS plays a crucial role in controlling early M. tb infection in HHCs by inducing optimal NO production with help of L-arginine. Further longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the role of these host factors upon disease activation.

AB  - Objective: Pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (pACC) is rare, and prognostic stratification remains challenging. We aimed to confirm the prognostic value of the previously published pediatric scoring system (pS-GRAS) in an international multicenter cohort. Design: Analysis of pS-GRAS items of pACC from 6 countries in collaboration of ENSAT-PACT, GPOH-MET, and IC-PACT. Methods: We received patient data of the pS-GRAS items including survival information from 9 centers. PS-GRAS score was calculated as a sum of tumor stage (1 = 0; 2-3 = 1; 4 = 2 points), grade (Ki67 index: 0%-9% = 0; 10%-19% = 1; >= 20% = 2 points), resection status (R0 = 0; RX/R1/R2 = 1 point), age (<4 years = 0; >= 4 years = 1 point), and hormone production (androgen production = 0; glucocorticoid-/mixed-/no-hormone production = 1 point) generating 8 scores and 4 groups (1: 0-2, 2: 3-4, 3: 5, 4: 6-7). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: We included 268 patients with median age of 4 years. The analysis of the pS-GRAS score showed a significantly favorable prognosis in patients with a lower scoring compared to higher scoring groups (5-year OS: Group 1 98%; group 2 87% [hazard ratio {HR} of death 3.6, 95% CI of HR 1.6-8.2]; group 3 43% [HR of death 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-4.4]; group 4: OS 18% [HR of death 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.7]). In the multivariable analysis, age (HR of death 3.5, 95% CI 1.8-7.0), resection status (HR of death 5.5, 95% CI 2.7-11.1), tumor stage (HR of death 1.9, 95% CI of HR 1.2-3.0), and Ki67 index (HR of death 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) remained strong independent outcome predictors. Especially infants < 4 years showed more often low-risk constellations with a better OS for all tumor stages. Conclusion In an international multicenter study, we confirmed that the pS-GRAS score is strongly associated with overall survival among patients with pACC. Age, resection status, stage, and Ki67 index are important parameters for risk stratification.

AB  - Radiotherapy (RT) and immunotherapy (IT) are the powerful tools for cancer treatment which act through the stimulation of immune response, and evidence suggest that combinatorial actions of these therapies may augment each other's beneficial effect through complex synergistic mechanisms. These molecular strategies are designed to target rapidly dividing cancer cells by either directly or indirectly inducing DNA damage. However, when cells detect DNA damage, they activate a range of signalling pathways known as the DNA damage response (DDR) to repair. Strategies are being developed to interfere with the DDR pathways in cancer cells to ensure their damage-induced degeneration. The stability of a cell's genetic material is largely dependent on the efficacy of DNA repair and therefore, an in-depth understanding of DNA damages and repair mechanism(s) in cancer cells is important to develop a promising therapeutic strategies for ensuring the efficacy of damage-induced tumor cell death. In recent years, a wide range of small molecule drugs have been developed which are currently being employed to combat the DNA repair deficiencies associated with tumor cells. Sequential or concurrent use of these two modalities significantly enhances the anti-tumor response, however with a concurrent probability of increased incidence of symptomatic adverse effects. With advent of newer IT agents, and administration of higher doses of radiation per fraction, such effects are more difficult to predict owing to the paucity of randomized trial data. It is well established that anti cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), anti- Programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1), anti-Programmed cell death one ligand 1 (PD-L1) can be safely administered with RT and many studies have demonstrated survival benefit with such combination for patients with metastatic malignancy. However, the biology of radioimmunotherapy (RT/IT) is still an open area where research need to be focused to determine optimum dosage specially the interaction of the RT/IT pathways to determine optimum dosing schedule. In the current article we have summarised the possible intracellular immunological events that might be triggered when RT and IT modalities are combined with the DDR antagonists and highlighted present clinical practices, outcome, and toxicity profile of this novel treatment strategy.

AB  - Importance Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains a public health issue in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there are few large studies enrolling individuals from multiple endemic countries. Objective To assess the risk and predictors of major patient-important clinical outcomes in patients with clinical RHD. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter, hospital-based, prospective observational study including 138 sites in 24 RHD-endemic LMICs. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cause-specific mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, stroke, recurrent rheumatic fever, and infective endocarditis. This study analyzed event rates by World Bank country income groups and determined the predictors of mortality using multivariable Cox models. Results Between August 2016 and May 2022, a total of 13 696 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 43.2 years and 72% were women. Data on vital status were available for 12 967 participants (94.7%) at the end of follow-up. Over a median duration of 3.2 years (41 478 patient-years), 1943 patients died (15% overall; 4.7% per patient-year). Most deaths were due to vascular causes (1312 [67.5%]), mainly HF or sudden cardiac death. The number of patients undergoing valve surgery (604 [4.4%]) and HF hospitalization (2% per year) was low. Strokes were infrequent (0.6% per year) and recurrent rheumatic fever was rare. Markers of severe valve disease, such as congestive HF (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.50-1.87]; P < .001), pulmonary hypertension (HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.37-1.69]; P < .001), and atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.15-1.46]; P < .001) were associated with increased mortality. Treatment with surgery (HR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.12-0.44]; P < .001) or valvuloplasty (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.06-0.95]; P = .042) were associated with lower mortality. Higher country income level was associated with lower mortality after adjustment for patient-level factors. Conclusions and Relevance Mortality in RHD is high and is correlated with the severity of valve disease. Valve surgery and valvuloplasty were associated with substantially lower mortality. Study findings suggest a greater need to improve access to surgical and interventional care, in addition to the current approaches focused on antibiotic prophylaxis and anticoagulation.

AB  - Background: Home-based psychosocial care has the potential to improving outcomes in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders (SCZ). There is lack of India data for such care in early psychosis. We developed the "Saksham" programme, a bespoke self-managed home-based psychosocial care model, available in two formats: manual-based and mobile-application based. With the anticipated success of recruitment of early psychosis cases in our setting, we plan to test the such intervention in this population in future trials.<br /> Aim: To assess the feasibility of the Saksham programme intervention in people with SCZ and its clinical efficacy as an adjunct to treatment as usual. Methods: Seventy-five patient-caregiver pairs (total n=150) were recruited. Patients received either: treatmentas-usual (TAU) (n=25), manual-based Saksham intervention+TAU (n=25), or app-based Saksham intervention+TAU (n=25). Feasibility (i.e. acceptability, practicality, demand, implementation and integration) was assessed at three-months. Participants were assessed for psychopathology, illness-severity, cognition, functioning, disability, and caregiver-coping at baseline, one-month, and three-month. The percentage changes over time were compared across three groups. Results: More found the mobile application-based intervention acceptable and easy-to-use than the manual-based intervention (92 % vs 68 %, and 76 % vs 68 %, respectively). Psychopathology and caregiver-burden improved significantly in all three groups (p<0.05). Cognition, disability, functioning, and caregiver burden improved significantly in the two Saksham intervention groups, with greater improvement in the Saksham app group (p<0.05).<br /> Conclusion: Home-based intervention is feasible and acceptable in a low-resource setting, with preliminary evidence for effectiveness. These findings need corroboration with randomised controlled trials in early psychosis to ameliorate course of illness.

AB  - Background: The onset of psychosis brings unfamiliar experiences that can be disturbing for patients and their caregivers. Few studies from India (only one from North India) have examined these experiences from the perspective of the patient and caregiver. We explored experiences of first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and their caregivers within a North Indian context. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2019 with ten FEP patients and their caregivers (total n=20) receiving out-patient care in a tertiary care centre. Topic guides focused on concerns/complaints, symptoms, help-seeking, and barriers and facilitators to treatment. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Main categories of responses from patients and caregivers included: initial complaints for seeking help, initial emotional response, barriers to seeking treatment, perceived dysfunction and improvement, experienced stigma, understanding about illness, early follow-up, preventive measures and awareness programs. Caregivers undergo myriad of emotional reactions including anger, anxiety, guilt, and confusion. Symptoms other than psychotic symptoms were the primary complaint upon seeking help, and there was lack of understanding about the psychosocial model of care (role of medications acknowledged with little awareness regarding psychosocial interventions in recovery). Persisting occupational dysfunction despite perceived symptomatic improvement was described by both patients and caregivers. Conclusion: North Indian patients with FEP lack awareness of symptoms. Therefore, onus for seeking help often falls on their caregivers. Psychoeducation from first contact with services and increasing awareness about psychotic illness within the community might help address lack of awareness about symptoms, mental health services, early signs of relapse, and importance of psychosocial interventions in achieving functional recovery.

AB  - The liveliness of a human potentially depends on his/her smooth movability. To accomplish the work of daily life, the joints of the body need to be healthy. However, the occurrence of Rheumatoid arthritis and Osteoarthritis has a significant prevalence towards the immovability of humankind. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA) mostly affect the joints of the hand and knee which result in lifelong pain, inability to climb, walk, etc. In the early stages, these diseases attack the synovial membrane and synovial fluid, and further it destroys the soft tissues and bone structure. By early diagnosis, we can start the treatment in the early stage which may cure these diseases with such extreme consequences. As per clinical studies of previous literature, it is observed that synovial fluid imbalance appears in the early stage of such diseases and Hyaluronic Acid (HA) concentration also decreases for that. Therefore, estimation of HA is a significant key to arthritis disease classification and grading. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid framework for classification of arthritic knee joints based on the analysis of the discontinuous appearances of the HA concentration using infrared imaging technology. To meet up the specific necessities, firstly we have proposed a modified K-Means clustering algorithm for extraction of the region of interest (ROI) i.e., the knee joint surface. Secondly, a mathematical formulation is proposed to calculate the concentration of HA from the segmented ROIs. This experimental process was implemented on the publicly available IR (Infrared) Knee Joint Dataset and for further evaluation of the novelty of mathematical formulation, we have extended the proposed work to the classification of healthy and arthritis affected knee joints depending on significant discriminative characteristics of the HA concentration with respect to the existing significant imaging features. Experimental results and analysis demonstrates that concentration of HA has the dominant potential for classifying healthy and arthritic knee joints using infrared holistic images. Our experimental analysis reveals that estimation and combination of the HA concentration features with conventional handcrafted and deep features increases the classification performance with an average accuracy of 91% and 97.22% respectively as compared to the each individual feature sets.

AB  - Background The ethnic diversity of India provides a unique opportunity to study the history of the origin of mutations of genetic disorders. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 27B (SCA27B), a recently identified dominantly inherited cerebellar disorder is caused by GAA-repeat expansions in intron 1 of Fibroblast Growth Factor 14 (FGF14). Predominantly reported in the European population, we aimed to screen this mutation and study the founder haplotype of SCA27B in Indian ataxia patients.
   Methods We have undertaken screening of GAA repeats in a large Indian cohort of similar to 1400 uncharacterised ataxia patients and kindreds and long-read sequencing-based GAA repeat length assessment. High throughput genotyping-based haplotype analysis was also performed. We utilized similar to 1000 Indian genomes to study the GAA at-risk expansion alleles.
   Findings We report a high frequency of 1.83% (n = 23) of SCA27B in the uncharacterized Indian ataxia cohort. We observed several biallelic GAA expansion mutations (n = 5) with younger disease onset. We observed a risk haplotype (AATCCGTGG) flanking the FGF14-GAA locus over a 74 kb region in linkage disequilibrium. We further studied the frequency of this risk haplotype across diverse geographical population groups. The highest prevalence of the risk haplotype was observed in the European population (29.9%) followed by Indians (21.5%). The observed risk haplotype has existed through similar to 1100 generations (similar to 22,000 years), assuming a correlated genealogy.
   Interpretation This study provides valuable insights into SCA27B and its Upper Paleolithic origin in the Indian subcontinent. The high occurrence of biallelic expansion is probably relevant to the endogamous nature of the Indian population.

AB  - Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) is difficult to diagnose due to paucibacillary nature of disease. Current study evaluated accuracy of Truenat MTB and MTB-Rif Dx (TN), for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin. Samples were collected from 2103 treatment naive adults with presumptive EPTB, and tested by smear microscopy, liquid culture (LC) (MGIT-960) and GeneXpert MTB/RIF (GX) (Microbiological Reference Standards, MRS). TN results were compared to MRS and Composite Reference Standards (CRS, Microbiology, histopathology, radiology, clinical features prompting decision to treat, response to treatment). CRS grouped patients into 551 confirmed, 1096 unconfirmed, and 409 as unlikely TB. TN sensitivity and specificity was 73.7% and 90.4% against GX. Against LC, Overall sensitivity of GX was 67.6%, while that of TN was 62.3%. Highest sensitivity by TN was observed in pus samples (89%) and highest specificity (92%) in CSF samples, similar to GX. TN sensitivity was better in fluid and biopsy samples and slightly inferior for lymph node aspirates compared to GX. TN sensitivity for RIF resistance detection was slightly superior to GX. TN and GX results were further compared to Clinical Reference Standards. TN detected 170 TB patients initiated on treatment missed by GX, while GX detected 113 such patients missed by TN. Of 124 samples with RIF resistance discordance between GX and TN, GX reported 103/124 as sensitive, 3/124 as indeterminate and 18 as resistant (13/18 samples had low/very low DNA load) while TN reported RIF resistance indeterminate in 103/111 low/very low DNA load samples. Due to paucibacillary nature of EPTB samples, culture yield was poor and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing failed to resolve the discordance. The study establishes TN at par with GX and can be utilized for quick and accurate diagnosis of EPTB.

AB  - Background Low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (LPP) is an attempt to improve laparoscopic surgery. Lower pressure causes lesser inflammation and better hemodynamics. There is a lack of literature comparing inflammatory markers in LPP with deep NMB to standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (SPP) with moderate NMB in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methodology This was a single institutional prospective randomized control trial. Participants included all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gall stone disease. Participants were divided into 2 groups group A and B. Group A-Low-pressure group in which pneumoperitoneum pressure was kept low (8-10 mmHg) with deep Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and Group B-Normal pressure group (12-14 mmHg) with moderate NMB. A convenience sample size of 80 with 40 in each group was selected. Lab investigations like CBC, LFT, RFT and serum IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF alpha levels were measured at base line and 24 h after surgery and compared using appropriate statistical tests. Other parameters like length of hospital stay, post-operative pain score, conversion rate (low-pressure to standard pressure), and complications were also compared. Results Eighty participants were analysed with 40 in each group. Baseline characteristics and investigations were statistically similar. Difference (post-operative-pre-operative) of inflammatory markers were compared between both groups. Numerically there was a slightly higher rise in most of the inflammatory markers (TLC, ESR, CRP, IL-6, TNF alpha) in Group B compared to Group A but not statistically significant. Albumin showed significant fall (p < 0.001) in Group B compared to Group A. Post-operative pain was also significantly less (p < 0.001) in Group A compared to Group B at 6 h and 24 h. There were no differences in length of hospital stay and incidence of complications. There was no conversion from low-pressure to standard pressure. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed under low-pressure pneumoperitoneum with deep NMB may have lesser inflammation and lesser post-operative pain compared to standard pressure pneumoperitoneum with moderate NMB. Future studies with larger sample size need to be designed to support these findings.

AB  - Background: Obesity is among the leading public health threats globally. Over the last few years, visceral adiposity index (VAI), and body adiposity index (BAI), derived from anthropometric, and biochemical measures, have gained importance as a measure of obesity. However, unlike other common indices like body mass index, and waist circumference, the genetic predisposition of VAI, and BAI under-examined. Methods: 2265 sib-pairs from Indian Migration Study were used for examining the association of genetic variants from the Cardio-Metabochip array with VAI, and BAI. Mixed linear regression models were run, and all inferences were based on the within-sib component of the Fulker's association models. Gene-environment/lifestyle interaction analyses were also undertaken. Results: rs6659428 at LOC400796 | SEC16B (beta = 0.26, SE = 0.05), and rs7611535 at DRD3 | LOC645180 (beta = 0.18, SE = 0.04) were associated with VAI at suggestive significance value of <8.21 x 10(-6). For BAI, rs73300702 at JAZF1-AS1 (beta = 0.27, SE = 0.06), was the top hit at p value < 8.21 x 10(-6). Further, rs6659428 showed marginal effect modification with rural/urban location (beta = 0.26, SE = 0.13, p value = 0.047), and rs73300702 with physical activity (beta = -0.29,SE = 0.14, p value = 0.034). Conclusion: We report three novel genetic loci for VAI, and BAI in Indians that are important indicators of adiposity. These findings need to be replicated and validated with larger samples from different ethnicities. Further, functional studies for understanding the biological mechanisms of these adiposity indices need to be undertaken to understand the underlying pathophysiology.

AB  - Despite progress in reducing the infant mortality in India, the neonatal mortality decline has been slower, necessitating concerted efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal-3. A promising strategy aiming to prevent neonatal sepsis in high-risk, vulnerable, low birth weight neonates through an innovative intervention includes probiotic supplementation. This article communicates the decision by the ProSPoNS trial investigators to establish a Central Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC) as an addendum to the protocol published in Trials in 2021 for the purpose of clarifying the primary outcome. In the published protocol, the study hypothesis and primary objective are based on "sepsis," the primary outcome has been specified as sepsis/PSBI, whereas the sample size estimation was performed based on the "physician diagnosed sepsis." To align all the three above, the investigators meeting, held on 17th-18th August 2023, at MGIMS Sevagram, Wardha, deliberated and unanimously agreed that "physician diagnosed sepsis" is the primary study outcome which includes sepsis/PSBI. The CEAC, chaired by an external subject expert and members including trial statistician, a microbiologist, and all site principal investigators will employ four criteria to determine "physician diagnosed sepsis": (1) blood culture status, (2) sepsis screen status, (3) PSBI/non-PSBI signs and symptoms, and (4) the clinical course for each sickness event. Importantly, this clarification maintains consistency with the approved study protocol (Protocol No. 5/7/915/2012 version 3.1 dated 14 Feb 2020), emphasizing the commitment to methodological transparency and adherence to predefined standards. The decision to utilize the guidance of a CEAC is recommended as the gold standard in multicentric complex clinical trials to achieve consistency and accuracy in assessment of outcomes.Trial registrationClinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) CTRI/2019/05/019197.

AB  - A complex structure known as a biofilm is formed when a variety of bacterial colonies or a single type of cell in a group sticks to a surface. The extracellular polymeric compounds that encase these cells, often consisting of proteins, eDNA, and polysaccharides, exhibit strong antibiotic resistance. Concerns about biofilm in the pharmaceutical industry, public health, and medical fields have sparked a lot of interest, as antibiotic resistance is a unique capacity exhibited by these biofilm-producing bacteria, which increases morbidity and death. Biofilm formation is a complicated process that is controlled by several variables. Insights into the processes to target for the therapy have been gained from multiple attempts to dissect the biofilm formation process. Targeting pathogens within a biofilm is profitable because the bacterial pathogens become considerably more resistant to drugs in the biofilm state. Although biofilm-mediated infections can be lessened using the currently available medications, there has been a lot of focus on the development of new approaches, such as bioinformatics tools, for both treating and preventing the production of biofilms. Technologies such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, nanotherapeutics and proteomics are also used to develop novel anti-biofilm agents. These techniques help to identify small compounds that can be used to inhibit important biofilm regulators. The field of appropriate control strategies to avoid biofilm formation is expanding quickly because of this spurred study. As a result, the current article addresses our current knowledge of how biofilms form, the mechanisms by which bacteria in biofilms resist antibiotics, and cutting-edge treatment approaches for infections caused by biofilms. Furthermore, we have showcased current ongoing research utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to combat bacterial biofilm infections, particularly those brought on by lethal drug-resistant pathogens, concluded the article with a novel hypothesis and aspirations, and acknowledged certain limitations.

AB  - Purpose: In chronic hyperglycemia, the advanced glycation end product (AGE) interacts with its receptor (RAGE) and contributes to impaired wound healing by inducing oxidative stress, generating dysfunctional macrophages, and prolonging the inflammatory response. Additionally, uncontrolled levels of proteases, including metallomatrix protease-9 (MMP-9), in the diabetic wound bed degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and biological cues that augment healing. A multifunctional antimicrobial hydrogel (Immuno-gel) containing RAGE and MMP-9 inhibitors can regulate the wound microenvironment and promote scar-free healing. Results: Immuno-gel was characterized and the wound healing efficacy was determined in vitro cell culture and in vivo diabetic Wistar rat wound model using ELISA, Western blot, and Immunofluorescence staining. The Immuno-gel exhibited a highly porous morphology with excellent in vitro cytocompatibility. AGE-stimulated macrophages treated with the Immuno-gel released higher levels of pro-healing cytokines in vitro . In the hydrogel-wound interface of diabetic Wistar rats, Immuno-gel treatment significantly reduced MMP-9 and NF-KB expression and enhanced pro-healing (M2) macrophage population and pro-healing cytokines. Conclusion: Altogether, this study suggests that Immuno-gel simultaneously attenuates macrophage dysfunction through the inhibition of AGE/RAGE signaling and reduces MMP-9 overexpression, both of which favor scar-free healing. The combinatorial treatment with RAGE and MMP-9 inhibitors via Immuno-gel simultaneously modulates the diabetic wound microenvironment, making it a promising novel treatment to accelerate diabetic wound healing.

AB  - PurposeCardiac perfusion MRI is vital for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and risk stratification, with anomalies serving as markers of underlying ischemic pathologies. AI-assisted methods and tools enable accurate and efficient left ventricular (LV) myocardium segmentation on all DCE-MRI timeframes, offering a solution to the challenges posed by the multidimensional nature of the data. This study aims to develop and assess an automated method for LV myocardial segmentation on DCE-MRI data of a local hospital.MethodsThe study consists of retrospective DCE-MRI data from 55 subjects acquired at the local hospital using a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The dataset included subjects with and without cardiac abnormalities. The timepoint for the reference frame (post-contrast LV myocardium) was identified using standard deviation across the temporal sequences. Iterative image registration of other temporal images with respect to this reference image was performed using Maxwell's demons algorithm. The registered stack was fed to the model built using the U-Net framework for predicting the LV myocardium at all timeframes of DCE-MRI.ResultsThe mean and standard deviation of the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for myocardial segmentation using pre-trained network Net_cine is 0.78 +/- 0.04, and for the fine-tuned network Net_dyn which predicts mask on all timeframes individually, it is 0.78 +/- 0.03. The DSC for Net_dyn ranged from 0.71 to 0.93. The average DSC achieved for the reference frame is 0.82 +/- 0.06.ConclusionThe study proposed a fast and fully automated AI-assisted method to segment LV myocardium on all timeframes of DCE-MRI data. The method is robust, and its performance is independent of the intra-temporal sequence registration and can easily accommodate timeframes with potential registration errors.

AB  - Th17/Treg cell balance is essential for immune homeostasis and when disrupted, is associated with the occurrence and development of inflammation in numerous autoimmune diseases. However, its contribution in pathophysiology of uveitis remains unexplored. In this study, we deciphered the role of Th17/Treg cell balance in autoimmune uveitis subjects. Using flow cytometry, we detected the frequencies and absolute count of both Th17 and Treg cells in the aqueous humor and peripheral blood of patients and healthy controls. Our results for the first time reveal a significant increase (p < 0.01 and p < 0.005) in Th17 population alongside a significant decrease (p < 0.001 and p < 0.003) in Treg cell population in both the aqueous humor and PBMCs of uveitis patients. Further we analyzed the expression of Th17-Treg associated genes and cytokines via qPCR and ELISA respectively. These findings align with our flow cytometry results, as evident by a significant (p < 0.002) upregulation of IL-17 and a concurrent down regulation of IL-10 at transcriptional levels. Moreover, IL-17A cytokine was found to be substantially high (p < 0.001) and IL-10 (p < 0.02) down regulated in serum. Interestingly, we demonstrated a significant correlation of Th17/Treg cells in aqueous humor with those in peripheral blood. Conclusively, our results suggest the pivotal role of Th17/Treg cell axis in the immuno-pathophysiology of human uveitis. Further we propose the therapeutic potential of targeting this novel axis for ameliorating the disease burden associated with uveitis.

AB  - Introduction and HypothesisPregnancy is associated with an increase in pelvic floor dysfunction. Yoga, an ancient Indian practice involving asanas (physical postures), pranayam (breathing patterns) and meditation, can help women to control their pelvic floor muscles. However, the literature to support yoga as a remedy for pelvic floor dysfunction is lacking. We hypothesized that yoga could be an important method in improving pelvic floor dysfunction in pregnancy.MethodsIn a randomised control study, 200 pregnant women matched for age, weight, parity and physical activity were randomised at the 13- to 20-week period of gestation into two groups: group I (n = 100, undergoing yoga therapy) and group II (n = 100, given usual antenatal care). A trained instructor provided two physical sessions, each lasting for 60 min and further online sessions for 5 days a week for 3 months. The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) questionnaire was used to assess the primary outcome at recruitment, 32 weeks (antenatal), 1 week and 6 weeks post-partum in both groups.ResultsIn the 200 women randomised and matched for age and parity, there were no complications seen throughout the pregnancy and none of the patients was lost to follow-up in either group. The proportion of women exhibiting a decline in PFDI-20 scores was greater in group 1 (24%) than in group 2 (8%). The mean difference of scores between recruitment and 6 weeks post-partum was statistically significant (p value = 0.0026).ConclusionsYoga in pregnancy significantly improves pelvic floor dysfunction in an easy manner with no proven adverse effects.

AB  - Cervical cancer is still the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide even after introduction of vaccine against Human papillomavirus (HPV), due to low vaccine coverage, especially in the developing world. Cervical cancer is primarily treated by Chemo/Radiotherapy, depending on the disease stage, with Carboplatin/Cisplatin-based drug regime. These drugs being non-specific, target rapidly dividing cells, including normal cells, so safer options are needed for lower off-target toxicity. Natural products offer an attractive option compared to synthetic drugs due to their well-established safety profile and capacity to target multiple oncogenic hallmarks of cancer like inflammation, angiogenesis, etc. In the current study, we investigated the effect of Bergenin (C-glycoside of 4-O-methylgallic acid), a natural polyphenol compound that is isolated from medicinal plants such as Bergenia crassifolia, Caesalpinia digyna, and Flueggea leucopyrus. Bergenin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, and wound healing properties but its anticancer potential has been realized only recently. We performed a proteomic analysis of cervical carcinoma cells treated with bergenin and found it to influence multiple hallmarks of cancers, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor suppressor proteins. It was also involved in many different cellular processes unrelated to cancer, as shown by our proteomic analysis. Further analysis showed bergenin to be a potent-angiogenic agent by reducing key angiogenic proteins like Galectin 3 and MMP-9 (Matrix Metalloprotease 9) in cervical carcinoma cells. Further understanding of this interaction was carried out using molecular docking analysis, which indicated MMP-9 has more affinity for bergenin as compared to Galectin-3. Cumulatively, our data provide novel insight into the anti-angiogenic mechanism of bergenin in cervical carcinoma cells by modulation of multiple angiogenic proteins like Galectin-3 and MMP-9 which warrant its further development as an anticancer agent in cervical cancer.

KW  - Scoring system
AB  - Background Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard of care for symptomatic gall stone disease. A good scoring system is necessary to standardize the reporting. Our aim was to develop and validate an objective scoring system, the Surgical Cholecystectomy Score (SCS) to grade the difficulty of LC. Methods The study was conducted in a single surgical unit at a tertiary care hospital in two phases from January 2017 to April 2021. Retrospective data was analysed and the difficulty of each procedure was graded according to the modified Nassar's scoring system. Significant preoperative and intraoperative data obtained was given a weightage score. In phase II, these scores were validated on a prospective cohort. Each procedure was classified either as easy, moderately difficult or difficult. Statistical analysis A univariate analysis was performed on the data followed by a multivariate regression analysis. Bidirectional stepwise selection was done to select the most significant variables. The Beta /Schneeweiss scoring system was used to generate a rounded risk score. Results Data of 800 patients was retrieved and graded. 10 intraoperative parameters were found to be significant. Each variable was assigned a rounded risk score. The final SCS range for intraoperative parameters was 0-15. The scoring system was validated on a cohort of 249 LC.In the final scoring, cut off SCS of > 8 was found to correlate with difficult procedures. Score of < 2 was equivalent to easy LC. A score between 2 and 8 indicated moderate difficulty. The area under ROC curve was 0.98 and 0.92 for the intraoperative score indicating that the score was an excellent measure of the difficulty level of LCs. Results Data of 800 patients was retrieved and graded. 10 intraoperative parameters were found to be significant. Each variable was assigned a rounded risk score. The final SCS range for intraoperative parameters was 0-15. The scoring system was validated on a cohort of 249 LC.In the final scoring, cut off SCS of > 8 was found to correlate with difficult procedures. Score of < 2 was equivalent to easy LC. A score between 2 and 8 indicated moderate difficulty. The area under ROC curve was 0.98 and 0.92 for the intraoperative score indicating that the score was an excellent measure of the difficulty level of LCs. Conclusion The scoring system developed in this study has shown an excellent correlation with the difficulty of LC. It needs to be validated in different cohorts and across multiple centers further.

AB  - The term "urban-rural divide" encompasses several dimensions and has remained an important concern for any country. The economic disparity; lack of infrastructure; dearth of medical specialists; limited opportunities to education, training, and health care; lower level of sanitation; and isolating effect of geographical location deepens this gap, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). This article gives an overview of the rural-urban differences in terms of facilities related to neurocritical care (NCC) in LMICs. Issues related to common clinical conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, myasthenia gravis, epilepsy, tubercular meningitis, and tracheostomy are also discussed. To facilitate delivery of NCC in resource-limited settings, proposed strategies include strengthening preventive measures, focusing on basics, having a multidisciplinary approach, promoting training and education, and conducting cost-effective research and collaborative efforts. The rural areas of LMICs bear the maximum impact because of their limited access to preventive health services, high incidence of acquired brain injury, inability to have timely management of neurological emergencies, and scarcity of specialist services in a resource-deprived health center. An increase in the health budget allocation for rural areas, NCC education and training of the workforce, and provision of telemedicine services for rapid diagnosis, management, and neurorehabilitation are some of the steps that can be quite helpful.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) and resection of pituitary adenomas are considered the gold standard treatment for Cushing disease (CD). Even with various recent advances in management, disease persistence and recurrence are common in these patients. The remission rate in the global population after surgery has been reported to vary widely from 64% to 93%. This study aims to determine the various clinical, biochemical, radiological, and histological factors that correlate with persistence and recurrence in patients with CD. This study also aims to understand the clinicopathological significance of EGFR-MAPK, NF-kappa B, and SHH pathway activation and to study the protein expression of activation markers of these pathways (i.e., c-Fos, c-Jun, GLI-1, pMEK, NR4A1, and p44) in functioning corticotroph pituitary adenomas. METHODS: From January 2009 to September 2022, the clinical data of 167 patients who underwent surgical treatment (n = 174 surgeries) for CD with a median follow-up of 8.1 years (range, 1-13.29 years) were ambispectively analyzed. The preoperative clinical, biochemical, and radiological features, operative findings, postoperative clinical and biochemical data, and histopathological and molecular profiles were retrieved from the electronic medical records. The patients were followed up to assess their remission status. RESULTS: Among the 174 surgeries performed, 140 were primary surgeries, 22 were revision surgeries, 24 surgeries were for pediatric patients, and 12 surgeries were for patients with Nelson syndrome. In the primary surgery cohort, 74.3% were female, and the average age was 28.73 +/- 10.15 years. Of the primary surgery cohort, 75% of the patients experienced remission compared with 47.4% after revision surgery. The remission rate for the pediatric patients was 55.5%. The postoperative day 1 plasma cortisol (P < 0.001; area under the curve, 0.8894; range, 0.8087-0.9701) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (P < 0.001; area under the curve, 0.9; range, 0.7386-1) levels were seen to be strong independent predictors of remission in the primary surgery cohort. The remission rate after endoscopic TSS was greater than that after microscopic TSS in patients undergoing primary surgery (81.08% vs. 57.14%; P = 0.008). The presence of adenoma on histopathological examination (HPE) was also a strong predictor of disease remission (P = 0.020). On stratifying by surgical approach and HPE, microscopically operated patients without histopathological evidence of adenoma had significantly higher odds of nonremission (odds ratio, 38.1; 95% confidence interval, 4.2- 348.3) compared with endoscopically operated patients with adenoma found on HPE. A lower immunoreactivity score for NR4A1 was found to correlate with higher remission rates (P = 0.074). However, none of the molecular markers studied (i.e., c-Fos, c-Jun, GLI-1, pMEK, and p44) showed a significant correlation with the preoperative cortisol values. CONCLUSIONS: The remission rate after primary surgery is higher than that after revision surgery and is lower for pediatric patients than for adults. The postoperative day 1 plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are strong independent predictors of remission in the primary surgery cohort. An endoscopic approach with histopathological evidence of adenoma is associated with a higher remission rate; thus, endoscopy should be the approach of choice for these patients with the goal of identification of an adenoma on HPE.

AB  - Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is linked to uncontrolled diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, iron overload, corticosteroid therapy, and neutropenia. This study evaluated a commercial real-time PCR system's effectiveness in detecting Mucorales from nasal swabs in 50 high-risk patients. Nasal swab PCR showed 30% positivity, compared to 8% with KOH microscopy. Despite its improved sensitivity, nasal swab PCR has limitations, highlighting the importance of established sampling methods in mucormycosis diagnosis. Participants were predominantly male (64%), with diabetes (78%) and amphotericin B use (96%). Prior COVID-19 was 42%, with 30% positive for Mucorales by PCR, compared to 8% with KOH microscopy.

AB  - Aging is a complex process that features a functional decline in many organelles. Various factors influence the aging process, such as chromosomal abnormalities, epigenetic changes, telomere shortening, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction significantly impacts aging because mitochondria regulate cellular energy, oxidative balance, and calcium levels. Mitochondrial integrity is maintained by mitophagy, which helps maintain cellular homeostasis, prevents ROS production, and protects against mtDNA damage. However, increased calcium uptake and oxidative stress can disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential and permeability, leading to the apoptotic cascade. This disruption causes increased production of free radicals, leading to oxidative modification and accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations, which contribute to cellular dysfunction and aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting from structural and functional changes, is linked to age-related degenerative diseases. This review focuses on mitochondrial dysfunction, its implications in aging and age-related disorders, and potential anti-aging strategies through targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.
   The figure shows the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy on stem cells leading to aging.

AB  - Pituitary carcinoma is a rare entity comprising 0.1-0.2% of all pituitary tumors and presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Intraspinal drop metastasis in these tumors is even rarer. We report a case of a prolactin secreting pituitary carcinoma with intracranial metastasis and multiple intraspinal drop metastasis. This is the first case where (68)Gallium labelled [1,4,7,10 - tetraazacyclododecane - 1,4,7,10 - tetraacetic acid] -1- NaI3 - octreotide (Ga-68-DOTANOC) whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) has been used in a case of malignant prolactinoma, in an attempt to ascertain the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression on tumor cells. Through this paper, we suggest that SSTR targeted radionuclide therapy could have a potential role in aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary carcinomas similar to the promising role of lutetium-labelled peptides in inoperable or metastasized gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).

AB  - Purpose: To compare Supine versus Prone positioning in fresh rhegmatogenous retinal detachments treated with vitrectomy and gas tamponade. Methods: This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of 72 eyes with fresh rhegmatogenous retinal detachment that underwent 25-gauge vitrectomy: 37 eyes were allotted supine position and 35 were allotted prone position. Cases were evaluated for single-surgery reattachment rates, best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, cataract formation, and any complications. The patients were followed up for a period of 3 months. Results: Both groups had similar demographics, and no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of extent of retinal detachment, position, and number of breaks. The anatomical success after single surgery was 97.3% in the Supine group and 94.3% in the Prone group (P = 0.609). The best-corrected visual acuity at the end of 3 months was 0.44 +/- 0.27 in the Supine group and 0.35 +/- 0.27 in the Prone group (P = 0.119) with a significant increase in best-corrected visual acuity preoperatively from 0.11 +/- 0.22 and 0.13 +/- 0.22 in Supine and Prone groups, respectively (P = <0.001). The intraocular pressure in the two groups was comparable at each follow-up. The rates of cataract formation were also similar in the two groups-60% and 53.8% in Supine and Prone groups, respectively (P = 1.00). Complications such as spikes in intraocular pressure, epiretinal membrane formation, and cystoid macular edema were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Rates of retinal reattachment were comparable in both groups showing that supine position is equally safe and effective for adequate tamponade.

AB  - Purpose: To study ultra-widefield indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) patterns in central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was undertaken on 30 patients aged 20 to 60 years with CSC at the retina clinic of a tertiary care center. Of them, 43 eyes were affected by CSC, whereas 17 eyes were unaffected as the bilateral disease was observed in 13 patients. All patients were evaluated for best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, detailed slit-lamp bio-microscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, ultra-widefield imaging for pseudo color photograph, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and ICGA, and macular swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) characteristics. Results: The mean age of patients was 41.43 +/- 8.81 years (range: 25-59 years). The median log MAR visual acuity in CSC eyes was 0.30 (range: 0.17-1.0), whereas it was 0 in non-CSC fellow eyes (P < 0.001). Pachy-vessels and late hyperpermeability on ultra-widefield ICGA were observed in all eyes. Vortex vein anastomosis was present in 93% of the affected eyes versus 88.2% in unaffected fellow eyes (P = 0.61). Disc and posterior poles were the sites of the maximum number of anastomoses in both affected and unaffected eyes (P = 0.77). Asymmetry in vortex vein drainage of the macula was present in 88.4% of affected eyes and 88.2% of unaffected eyes. Conclusion: Studying the ICGA findings in CSC patients emphasized the role of choroidal circulation in pathogenesis as Pachy vessels were observed in all eyes affected with CSC and even fellow eyes of patients. Vortex vein anastomosis around the disc or posterior pole and asymmetric drainage from the macula were noted and could be contributing to CSC pathology.

AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is prevalent in patients with acute stroke. Although AKI is linked to poor clinical outcomes, data about its incidence and effect on stroke outcomes is limited. Methods: This was a prospective observational study carried out at a single tertiary care center that analyzed the data of 204 consecutive subjects with acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. Considering serum creatinine at admission as the baseline, AKI was defined as a rise in serum creatinine value of 0.3 mg/dl over 48 h or a percentage increase of at least 50% from baseline over 7 days during hospitalization. The primary outcome was to measure the prevalence of AKI in patients with acute stroke. Secondary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, duration of hospital stay, need for dialysis, and comparison of outcomes in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. For both the stroke subtypes, we employed a multivariate logistic regression model, with AKI and hospital mortality being the outcomes. Covariates included gender, age, ventilatory requirement, duration of hospital stay, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission. Results: There were 144 cases of ischemic stroke with 12 deaths (8.3%) and 60 cases of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with 22 deaths (36.7%). The mean age was 55 years, 72.6% were males, and AKI complicated 34% of ischemic stroke and 66.7% of ICH hospitalizations. AKI was linked to increased hospital mortality from ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] 27.21, 95% CI 3.39-218.13) and hemorrhagic stroke (OR 5.12, 95% CI 1.29-20.28) in multivariate analysis stratified by stroke type. Conclusions: AKI complicates stroke frequently and increases hospital mortality. Additional studies are required to assess if the association is causal and if remedies to prevent AKI would decrease mortality.

AB  - Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of cutaneous application of 0.1% tacrolimus eye ointment over the skin of the upper eyelid in chronic vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC).Methods:A prospective, longitudinal, noncomparative, open-label clinical study of moderate-to-severe grade steroid-dependent VKC was performed. Study participants were initiated on adjunct therapy of cutaneous application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment twice daily on the upper eyelid skin. Ocular surface evaluation parameters, meibomian gland imaging, intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and clinical disease severity scoring were performed to assess clinical response at baseline and month 3 of therapy. Tear levels of tacrolimus were measured at month 3 using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and correlated with the clinical score.Results:Palpebral form of VKC was observed in 85% of the cases, with positive family history in 5%, atopy in 7.5%, and keratoconus in 11.25%. Clinical assessment revealed improvement in 97.5% patients with discontinuation of concomitant topical steroids in 64% of patients. There were no changes in visual acuity, intraocular pressure, or ocular surface evaluation after therapy. Tacrolimus was detected in the tears of all our study patients after cutaneous application over the upper eyelid skin, proving its bioavailability with mean tear tacrolimus levels of 6.55 +/- 21.43 ng/mL. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate negative correlation between the clinical score and tacrolimus concentration (Spearman correlation coefficient: -0.34, P = 0.002).Conclusions:Cutaneous tacrolimus 0.1% ointment over the upper eyelid skin is an efficacious alternative method of application in treatment of VKC, with no resultant ocular irritation.

AB  - BackgroundMicrovascular inflammation (MVI) can occur in biopsies showing T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), but it is not well established that T-cells can directly mediate microvascular injury (TCMR-MVI).MethodsThis was a cross sectional RNAseq based Banff Human Organ Transplant (BHOT) gene expression (GE) analysis. The objective of this study was to probe the molecular signature of TCMR-MVI in comparison with C4d+, DSA+ antibody mediated rejection (ABMR), stable renal function (STA), and TCMR without MVI. Transcriptome analysis utilized CLC genomic workbench and R-studio software.ResultsNo gene set was specific for any diagnostic category, and all were expressed at low levels in STA biopsies. BHOT gene set scores could differentiate ABMR from TCMR and TCMR-MVI, but not TCMR from TCMR-MVI. TCMR-MVI underexpressed several genes associated with ABMR including DSATs, ENDAT, immunoglobulin genes, ADAMDEC1, PECAM1 and NK cell transcripts (MYBL1, GNLY), but overexpressed C3, NKBBIZ, and LTF. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the expression of these genes in TCMR-MVI versus TCMR. This indicates that the GE profile of TCMR MVI aligns more closely with TCMR than ABMR. The limitations of classifying biopsies using the binary ABMR-TCMR algorithm, and the occurrence of common pathogenesis mechanisms amongst different rejection phenotype was highlighted by the frequent presence of molecular mixed rejection.ConclusionsT-cell mediated mechanisms play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MVI. GE was broadly different between rejection phenotypes, but molecular scores varied substantially between biopsies with the same Banff grade. It was not always possible to achieve precise molecular score-based diagnostic categorization of individual patients.

AB  - Background and Aims:Assessment of the severity of substance use disorders (SUDs) in a culture-sensitive manner can help gauge the current condition of the substance user and assess change with time. The present study aimed to develop a scale for the assessment of the severity of SUDs in the Indian clinical context. Methods:Based upon the review of literature on previously available instruments and a consultative meeting of experts, a clinician-rated scale was developed that finally comprised 41 items. A briefer 5-item scale with current and lifetime versions was also developed. The scales were applied to patients with SUDs at six different clinical sites. Results:The instrument was applied to 720 patients (98.2% males, mean age: 34.6 years). The Cronbach's alpha of the full scale was 0.852. The inter-rater reliability Pearson correlation coefficient of the full-scale was r = 0.821 (P < 0.001), and the intra-class correlation coefficient single measure was 0.800 (95% confidence interval: 0.724-0.956). A four-factor solution was suggested to be the most tenable. The mean application duration of the full scale was 13.4 minutes, and that of the briefer version was 2 minutes. Conclusion:This validated scale could be a potentially useful assessment measure for the severity of SUDs in the Indian context. The utility lies in the simplicity of administration and scoring and the balance between brevity and thorough assessment.

AB  - Background:Traboulsi syndrome is a sporadic autosomal recessive disorder. Very few cases reported and no surgical treatment has been described.Purpose:The purpose of the study was to describe the surgical treatment of a case of Traboulsi syndrome with intercalary staphyloma.Synopsis:Traboulsi syndrome[1-3] is a type of spontaneous filtering bleb. The case was of a 31-year-old lady with a flat anterior chamber and large intercalary staphyloma, with a subluxated clear lens. Liberal peritomy was done. The staphyloma was cut and the displaced lens was delivered through it. It was closed with 7-0 vicryl continuous suture. A cross-linked cornea was used after removing the Descemet membrane. It was modified to match the crescentic shape of the limbus by using 11 and 6 mm trephine. Two wedge-shaped defects were created and tissue was excised between them, which were then sutured to increase the arc radius. A peripheral flange at the corneal edge was created. A pocket was created in the host cornea to accommodate the donor corneal flange. The donor cornea was tucked in and the graft was sutured. The sclera was used to suture another side prophylactically, making a 360-degree encirclage. The patient got ambulatory vision postsurgery. The use of the cornea as biological encirclage has not been described previously.Highlights:Using a cross-linked cornea.

AB  - Aqueous humor outflow (AHO) pathways are the main site of resistance causing elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma, especially primary open-angle glaucoma patients. With the recently introduced technique of aqueous angiography (AA); functional, real time assessment of AHO from proximal (trabecuar meshwork) to distal pathways under physiological conditions has been made possible. AHO pathways are segmental, and AA can identify high-flow region (increased angiographic signals) and low flow region (decreased angiographic signals) in an individual. With the introduction of canal-based minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS), the assessment of AHO can help guide the placement of stents/incisions during MIGS procedures. This can allow individualized and targeted MIGS procedures in glaucoma patients for better results. Based on the density of AHO pathways visualized on AA, surgeons can decide whether to perform MIGS or conventional glaucoma surgery for improved outcomes for the patient. Immediate intraoperative assessment for functionality of the MIGS procedure performed is possible with AA, allowing for surgical adjustments of MIGS procedure in the same sitting, if needed. This review provides a summary of the studies performed with AA to date, with a special focus on Indian patients. It covers the basics and clinical applications of AA for improving surgical outcomes in glaucoma patients.

AB  - This review is intended to familiarize readers with an emerging group of fungal infections that mostly manifest in immunocompetent individuals. This group was initially considered endemic to the tropics, but increasing worldwide prevalence has been reported. The organisms have been divided into dominant non-invasive forms and dominant invasive forms for ease of understanding. The non-invasive organisms include the group Entomophthoromycota, under which two genera Basidiobolus and Conidiobolus, have been identified as human pathogens. They present with plaques in the extremities and rhinofacial region, respectively. The invasive organisms are dematiaceous fungi (phaeohypomycosis), which includes Cladophialophora and Exophiala among others. They cause invasion of deep tissues, with the central nervous system being the most common target. The mycology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment options have been summarized in brief. The clinical presentation, imaging manifestations, differentiation from other common infections and malignancies that show similar features have been detailed. {GRAPHIACAL ABSTRACT}

AB  - Introduction:Breast cancer in India is phenotypically different with locally advanced breast cancers (LABCs) forming 30-50% of all cases. Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), among other things has contributed to surgeons using breast conservation surgery (BCS) in very selected patients with good results. Herein, we describe the oncological outcomes of BCS in LABC patients undergoing surgery post NACT.Patients and Methods:This is an ambispective observational cohort study conducted between January 1996 and December 2019 after approval by Institute Ethics Committee, to study the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in patients with LABC undergoing BCS post NACT. The secondary objectives were to ascertain the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and factors associated with IBTR in these patients. Patients were staged according to the anatomic American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) VIII Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) classification and clinic-demographic, pathologic, treatment, and follow-up details were noted.Results:Out of 822 patients with LABC, 71 patients undergoing BCS post NACT were included. Average tumor size at presentation was 6.43 cm. The most common T stage was T3 (57.7%) and N stage was N1 (53.5%). The most common stage group was IIIB in 40.8%. Around 75% received anthracycline-based NACT with 28.2% having a complete clinical response. A pathological complete response was seen in 16 patients (22.5%). The mean follow-up duration was 6.14 years. A total of 25 patients had recurrences: five patients had IBTR (7%) and four had a local with regional recurrence. Two, 5, and 10 years OS were 94.0, 83.8, and 61.9%, respectively, and DFS were 87.8, 67.1, and 50.6%, respectively. A higher clinical T stage was associated with poor DFS (p = 0.01). The risk of IBTR was not found to significantly correlate with any of the standard prognostic factors.Conclusion:BCS post NACT in suitably selected patients of LABC is a safe and viable option without adversely affecting oncological outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To develop machine learning (ML) models, using pre and intraoperative surgical parameters, for predicting trabeculectomy outcomes in the eyes of patients with juvenile-onset primary open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) undergoing primary surgery. Subjects: The study included 207 JOAG patients from a single center who met the following criteria: diagnosed between 10 and 40 years of age, with an IOP of >22 mmHg in the eyes on two or more occasions, open angle on gonioscopy in both eyes, with glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and requiring a trabeculectomy for IOP control. Only the patients with a minimum 5-year follow-up after surgery were included in the study. Methods: A successful surgical outcome was defined as IOP <= 18 mmHg (criterion A) or 50% reduction in IOP from baseline (criterion B) 5 years after trabeculectomy. Feature selection techniques were used to select the most important contributory parameters, and tenfold cross-validation was used to evaluate model performance. The ML models were evaluated, compared, and prioritized based on their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) index, and mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The prioritized models were further optimized by tuning the hyperparameters, and feature contributions were evaluated. In addition, an unbiased relationship analysis among the parameters was performed for clinical utility. Results: Age at diagnosis, preoperative baseline IOP, duration of preoperative medical treatment, Tenon's thickness, scleral fistulation technique, and intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) use, were identified as the main contributing parameters for developing efficient models. The three models developed for a consensus-based outcome to predict trabeculectomy success showed an accuracy of >86%, sensitivity of >90%, and specificity of >74%, using tenfold cross-validation. The use of intraoperative MMC and a punch for scleral fistulation compared to the traditional excision with scissors were significantly associated with long-term success of trabeculectomy. Conclusion: Optimizing surgical parameters by using these ML models might reduce surgical failures associated with trabeculectomy and provide more realistic expectations regarding surgical outcomes in young patients.

AB  - Background:The aim of this survey was to understand institutional spine surgery practices and their concordance with published best practices/recommendations.Methods:Using a global internet-based survey examining perioperative spine surgery practice, reported institutional spine pathway elements (n=139) were compared with the level of evidence published in guideline recommendations. The concordance of clinical practice with guidelines was categorized as poor (<= 20%), fair (21%-40%), moderate (41%-60%), good (61%-80%), or very good (81%-100%).Results:Seventy-two of 409 (17.6%) institutional contacts started the survey, of which 31 (7.6%) completed the survey. Six (19.4%) of the completed surveys were from respondents in low/middle-income countries, and 25 (80.6%) were from respondents in high-income countries. Forty-one incomplete surveys were not included in the final analysis, as most were less than 40% complete. Five of 139 (3.6%) reported elements had very good concordance for the entire cohort; hospitals with spine surgery pathways reported 18 elements with very good concordance, whereas institutions without spine surgery pathways reported only 1 element with very good concordance. Reported spine pathways included between 7 and 47 separate pathway elements. There were 87 unique elements in the reviewed pathways. Only 3 of 87 (3.4%) elements with high-quality evidence demonstrated very good practice concordance.Conclusions:This global survey-based study identified practice variation and low adoption rates of high-quality evidence in the care of patients undergoing complex spine surgery.

AB  - Background: Infection-related movement disorders (IRMD) present a complex diagnostic challenge due to the broad phenotypic spectrum, the variety of possible infectious aetiologies, and the complicated underlying mechanisms. Yet, a comprehensive framework for classifying IRMD is lacking. Methods: An international consensus panel under the directives of the Movement Disorders Society InfectionRelated Movement Disorders Study Group developed a comprehensive definition and a consensus classification system. Case scenarios were used for validation. Results: A definition for IRMD and a two-axis-based classification system consisting of six descriptors are proposed, intended as tools for researchers and clinicians. Collected information on clinical characteristics, investigational findings, the infectious organism and presumed pathogenesis facilitate the evaluation of diagnostic certainty. Conclusion: The proposed framework will serve for optimised diagnostic algorithms, systematic aggregation of informative datasets across studies, and ultimately improved care and outcome of patients with IRMDs.

AB  - Opioid prescriptions for chronic non-cancer pain raise concerns of addiction risks. Understanding the nuanced intersection of chronic pain and opioid use is crucial in clinical settings. We present four case studies from two tertiary care hospitals illustrating the phenomenon of "pseudoaddiction" in CNCP referred to addiction specialists for management. Each case involves complex pain presentations like pancreatitis, avascular necrosis, and SLE intertwined with escalating opioid demands. Management involved psychoeducation, CBT, and opioid substitution, resulting in reduced pain and need for opioids. Differentiating between addiction and uncontrolled pain is crucial for tailored management, emphasizing individualized care for improved outcomes.

AB  - Background:Patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs) are at an increased risk of developing functional symptoms associated with eating, speaking, and breathing along with symptoms caused by a fungating tumour (e.g., cosmetic change, malodor, and bleeding). These may substantially reduce their physical functioning and quality of life (QoL). This observational study aimed to find out the QoL in patients with HNC in a tertiary care oncology centre.Methods:A prospective observational study was conducted in adult patients diagnosed with HNC. The patients were divided depending upon their disease extent into early, advanced, and very advanced local disease. The physical, cognitive, emotional, financial and social domains were assessed using a validated Hindi version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of cancer (EORTC)- QoL 30 and EORTC H&N 35 at baseline and 3 months.Results:A total of 100 patients were assessed with a mean age of 49.3 +/- 12.4 years. Most of the patients had carcinoma buccal mucosa (42%) followed by carcinoma tongue (17%). The patients experienced difficulties with physical functioning and deterioration in emotional functioning. Pain and fatigue were the major problematic symptoms especially in advanced disease patients resulting in poor QoL. There was a significant improvement in various domains of QoL at 3 months follow-up in those with advanced disease. The fatigue scores at baseline and follow-up showed a positive correlation with other symptoms.Conclusion:Patients with HNC have a high symptom burden that leads to poor QoL. Appropriate palliative care interventions help to decrease symptom burden and prevent deterioration of their QoL in patients with HNC.

AB  - Background: Effective Cataract Surgical Coverage (eCSC) is a core outcomes domain indicator to assess accessibility and quality of eye care services with limited available information. Purpose: To generate baseline estimates of eCSC for India. Methods: We performed the analysis of data pooled from Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness surveys conducted in 31 districts of India during 2015-2019 among persons aged 50+ years. eCSC was calculated at various thresholds, the primary being operable cataract at best corrected visual acuity <6/12, good outcome at presenting visual acuity of 6/12. Results: Age-sex standardized and weighed eCSC in India was 36.7% (95% CI: 33.6, 39.9), and cataract surgical coverage (CSC) was 57.3% (95% CI: 53.3, 61.2), a relative quality gap in cataract surgery being 36.0%. eCSC in males was higher at 38.0% than females (35.6%). eCSC increased with education from 31.0% in illiterate participants to 59.7% in class 10 educated. On multivariate analysis, rural setting, increasing age, and residence in eastern or northeastern zones of India continued to be associated with poor/worse eCSC, while female gender was associated with higher eCSC. District-wide variations in eCSC were observed. Conclusion: Developmental factors have an important bearing on eCSC in India. Geographical variations point toward the need for targeted, locally relevant strategies.

AB  - The Prp19 complex (Prp19C), also named NineTeen Complex (NTC), is conserved from yeast to human and functions in many different processes such as genome stability, splicing, and transcription elongation. In the latter, Prp19C ensures TREX occupancy at transcribed genes. TREX, in turn, couples transcription to nuclear mRNA export by recruiting the mRNA exporter to transcribed genes and consequently to nascent mRNAs. Here, we assess the function of the nonessential Prp19C subunit Syf2 and the nonessential Prp19C-associated protein Cwc15 in the interaction of Prp19C and TREX with the transcription machinery, Prp19C and TREX occupancy, and transcription elongation. Whereas both proteins are important for Prp19C-TREX interaction, Syf2 is needed for full Prp19C occupancy, and Cwc15 is important for the interaction of Prp19C with RNA polymerase II and TREX occupancy. These partially overlapping functions are corroborated by a genetic interaction between Delta cwc15 and Delta syf2. Finally, Cwc15 also interacts genetically with the transcription elongation factor Dst1 and functions in transcription elongation. In summary, we uncover novel roles of the Prp19C component Syf2 and the Prp19C-associated protein Cwc15 in Prp19C's function in transcription elongation.

AB  - Objective We evaluated ductal closure rates in preterm neonates with hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) who received paracetamol (PCM) as first-line therapy. Methods In this retrospective chart review, we included inborn preterm (< 37 weeks) neonates (January 2017-December 2021) with hsPDA (ductal diameter > 1.5 mm and left atrium-to-aortic root ratio (La/Ao > 1.4) who were treated with oral or intravenous PCM. Primary outcome was hsPDA closure (defined as small or no PDA) following 3-day treatment. Secondary outcomes were need for retreatment and surgical ligation, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and in-hospital morbidities. Results Out of 2784 preterm births, 117 neonates were diagnosed with hsPDA. Out of 96 neonates who received PCM in the first course, 20 died before the completing the first course. The median (IQR) gestation and birth weight of neonates who received PCM were 28 (26, 29) weeks and 841 (714, 1039) g, respectively. Out of 76 neonates who completed treatment with first course of PCM (57 intravenous, 19 oral), 43 (56.6%) achieved successful closure and five (6.6%) developed PH. 14 neonates received a second course of PCM; 10 achieved closure of hsPDA while one expired. Conclusion Paracetamol is associated with successful closure of hsPDA in 56.6% of preterm neonates after one course and 70% of preemies after two courses

KW  - CONFIDENCE
AB  - Purpose:To assess whether medical undergraduates can be trained to effectively screen diabetic retinopathy (DR) by statistical comparison with a retina specialist at a tertiary eye care center in India.Methods:Three final-year undergraduate medical students, having completed ophthalmology department rotation, received training from a retina specialist for grading DR, following which they were asked to grade a set of 50 fundus photographs centered on the macula with a view of 50 degrees as sight-threatening DR (STDR), diabetic macular edema, and grade of DR. Agreement among the undergraduates and retina specialist was determined with the help of Cohen's Kappa coefficient.Results:Kappa coefficient between undergraduates for detection of STDR ranged from 0.695 to 0.817 and between each student and the retina specialist ranged from 0.663 to 0.712. The sensitivity and specificity for undergraduates' and retina specialist's detection of STDR were 93.93%-96.96% and 60%, respectively.Conclusion:There was substantial agreement among the undergraduates as well as between the undergraduates and the retina specialist for the detection of STDR. Undergraduates also detected STDR with a high sensitivity. This study outlines the feasibility of training undergraduate students for screening DR.

AB  - Purpose:To investigate the morphological types and delineate the clinical and surgical variables associated with VAO in children undergoing pediatric cataract surgery.Methods:We included 33 eyes of 28 children who developed clinically significant visual axis opacification (VAO) after congenital or developmental cataract surgery. All eyes underwent a comprehensive examination under anesthesia followed by a membranectomy to clear the visual axis. We classified VAO into three subgroups: fibrotic, proliferative, and combined morphologies. We reviewed and analyzed the retrospective data and the findings during membranectomy to identify the etiological variables associated with various morphologies of VAO.Results:The median age at primary surgery was 7 (2-96) months. The median interval from primary surgery to the first documentation of VAO was 6 (1-22) months. Younger children developed VAO sooner than older children. VAO was fibrotic in 11 eyes (33%), proliferative in 18 eyes (54.5%), and combined in four eyes (12.12%). Most children with fibrotic VAO belonged to economically disadvantaged sections of society (P = 0.04).Conclusion:Lower age at primary surgery was the predominant risk factor for the development of VAO. Besides primary posterior capsulotomy and adequate anterior vitrectomy, a strict adherence to anti- inflammatory measures and follow up in necessary to prevent the occurrence of VAO. A close follow-up facilitates early detection and management, which can prevent the onset of visually impairing amblyopia.

AB  - Purpose: To estimate the magnitude, determinants, and causes of visual impairment (VI) and blindness among people >40 years. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, 2,968 people >40 years from 34 clusters were examined. A cluster random sampling method with a compact segment sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Prevalence of any VI (presenting visual acuity (PVA) <6/12 in better eye), severe VI (PVA <6/60 - 3/60), and blindness (PVA <3/60 in better eye) were expressed as percentage with 95% confidence interval. Logistic regression was performed to determine the risk factors associated with blindness. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the participants was 54.6 years (Standard deviation +/- 11.2 years). The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe visual impairment was 14.2% (12.95-15.49), 13.7% (12.46-14.97), and 0.7% (0.47-1.12), respectively. The prevalence of blindness was 1.3% (0.94-1.79, n = 39). The overall prevalence of VI (presenting Visual Acuity <6/12) was 12.0% (95% CI: 10.8-13.2%). The major causes of VI were cataract (78.08%), refractive error (12.07%), and optic atrophy (2.22%), and corneal opacity (2.22%) and the major cause of blindness was cataract (77.27%). Blindness was strongly associated with increasing age- OR 17.1 (95% CI: 4.9-59.8) for people >70 years, and OR 7.6 (95% CI: 2.2-26.5) for people aged between 60 and 69 years compared to those aged 41-50 years and people living near coastal regions (Within 50 km of coast) (OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.6-7.3). Conclusion: Blindness and vision impairment are of public health concern in this geographic region. Eye care services need to be augmented to address this challenge.

AB  - Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by fever-triggered focal or hemiclonic seizures at onset with various associated comorbidities like intellectual disability, gait abnormalities, and behavioral issues. It typically advances to drug-refractory epilepsy with multiple seizure semiology. In this review, we give a focused narrative on the treatment aspects of DS. We searched the PubMed database for articles on DS. More than 500 articles were reviewed, of which 55 relevant articles are included in this review. ClinicalTrials.gov database was also accessed for data on ongoing trials. Majority are caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Valproate and clobazam are the most commonly used traditional antiseizure medications. Stiripentol, fenfluramine, and cannabidiol are recently approved drugs with promising results. Ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation are commonly tried nonpharmacologic modalities that have shown significant responses. Antisense oligonucleotides and viral vector-mediated gene transfer therapies are on the horizon. This review outlines the current existing treatment rationale, evidence for newly approved drugs, and the future scope of gene therapy in DS.

AB  - Purpose: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular tumor in pediatric age group. The role of genetics has been explored in predicting survival prognosis, but its role in predicting globe salvage remains largely unexplored. We hereby aim to isolate cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from aqueous humor (AH) in RB eyes and validate its use for genetic studies. Methods: AH was obtained from 26 eyes undergoing enucleation (arm A) or intravitreal chemotherapy (arm B). Isolation of cfDNA was done using QIAamp (R) Circulating Nucleic Acid kit, and the cfDNA was utilized for targeted sequencing of RB1 gene. Results: We could isolate cfDNA in all eyes (72% unilateral and 28% bilateral) with a distribution peak between 140 and 160 bp and a mean concentration of 27.75 ng/mu l for arm A and 14 ng/mu l for arm B. Targeted sequencing done on four samples showed RB1 gene mutations, namely, inframe deletion (c. 78-80del, p.Pro29del), start-loss mutation (c.1A>T, p.Met1?), nonsense mutations (c.2236G>T, p.Glu746Ter), (c.1659T>A, p.Cys553Ter), and (c.2065C>T, p.Gln689Ter), and novel missense mutations (c.672C>A, p.Asp224Glu) and c.692C>T (p.Pro231Leu). Genetic profile of cfDNA extracted from AH and genomic DNA from the tumor tissue was comparable. Conclusion: Our study supports the previous reports that AH may be used as a source of tumor-derived cfDNA. This is the first report from South Asia on isolation and genetic analysis of cfDNA from AH of RB eyes and, therefore, a big step forward in paving the role of tumor genetics in RB. Further studies are required to elucidate concordance between the tumor and AH genetic profile.

TI  - Clinicodemographic profile of orbital exenteration in a tertiary eye care center - A 20-year experience
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - Extraocular retinoblastoma
KW  - eyelid malignancy
KW  - mucormycosis

KW  - rhabdomyosarcoma
KW  - PATTERN
AB  - Purpose:This study aimed to determine the clinical indications for orbital exenteration, demographic profile of these patients, and clinicopathologic correlations in the current times and to compare these results with previous published data.Methods:It was a retrospective study. All exenterations performed at a tertiary eye care center over a period of 20 years (from January 2001 to June 2020) were retrospectively evaluated. Patient records were reviewed to obtain demographic data, presenting symptoms and their duration, laterality, and clinical and histopathologic diagnosis.Results:A total of 352 cases (males:females = 222:130) who underwent exenteration were identified. Patients age ranged from 11 months to 87 years (mean: 43.86 years, median: 50 years). The most common indication for exenteration was found to be eyelid malignancy in 54.36%, followed by retinoblastoma in 18.75% and primary orbital tumors in 14.49%. Out of 156 cases of eyelid malignancies requiring exenteration, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the most common histologic subtype (n = 94, 60.26%), followed by sebaceous gland carcinoma (n = 40, 25.64%) and basal cell carcinoma (n = 20, 12.82%). The most common primary orbital tumors requiring exenteration were adenocystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland in adults and rhabdomyosarcoma in the pediatric age group. Benign conditions requiring exenteration included fulminant fungal orbital infections and lymphangioma among others.Conclusion:The number of exenterations performed have significantly increased in terms of absolute numbers. However, the ratio of exenteration to other tumor-related surgeries, mainly excision biopsy, has reduced compared to that reported from a previous study. The most common indication in our study remains eyelid malignancy followed by intraocular malignancy. However, SCC has emerged as the most common tumor histologic subtype requiring exenterations.

AB  - Background:Psychological factors have a key role in affecting the clinical outcome of a disease. Studies have found an alteration in the immune system and endocrine function in patients with psychological stress. Cancer patients often display these symptoms. This study aims to find out the prevalence and factors affecting the presence of preoperative depression, anxiety, and stress in cancer patients by using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-42 (DASS 42). Methods:Three hundred and sixty patients were included in the study who were posted for cancer surgery. They were required to answer a questionnaire where details were collected about the sociodemographic and economic background, type of cancer and treatment received, details about the presence of pain, and if the patient is on any analgesics. Data were analyzed using Stata version 16, and multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression. Results:The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 16.11%, 32.5%, and 12.78%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that marital status and type of surgery proposed predicted depression; anxiety was significantly contributed by the type of surgery proposed and analgesic the patient is taking; whereas marital status, type of surgery proposed, and analgesic the patient is taking predicted stress. Conclusion:Married patients are more likely to suffer from depression and stress. Patients undergoing palliative surgery will be prone to all kinds of negative emotions including depression, anxiety, and stress. The type of analgesics, which the patent is taking as prescribed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) ladder for cancer pain also significantly influences anxiety and stress.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
KW  - Cutaneous sclerosis
KW  - pigmentation
KW  - systemic sclerosis
KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Background: Pigmentary changes of the skin in systemic sclerosis in the form of diffuse hyperpigmentation and salt-and-pepper pigmentation are well documented in the literature; however, its association with disease severity and extent of underlying internal organ involvement has not been well studied. Aims: To assess the correlation between morphology and extent of pigmentary changes with the degree of cutaneous sclerosis and frequency and degree of major organ involvement. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital from December 2014 to November 2016. Consecutive patients of systemic sclerosis attending the outpatient department were screened, and patients satisfying the diagnosis as per the American Rheumatism Association criteria were recruited. Skin sclerosis was quantified using modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS), whereas pigmentary changes were calculated in terms of percentage of body surface area involved by rule-of-nine method. Investigations were carried out depending on organ involvement and as per respective specialty consultations with focus on pulmonary, cardiac, and gastrointestinal systems. Results: Of the 50 patients recruited, all had cutaneous involvement in the form of binding down of skin, followed by pigmentary changes. MRSS was significantly higher in patients with any pigmentary alteration (P = 0.03) compared to those without any pigmentary changes. There was a rising trend in between the MRSS severity and the proportion of patients with hyperpigmentation, and it was statistically significant (P = 0.04). Among systemic involvement, lung was involved in the form of interstitial lung disease in 94% patients (n = 47). However, skin pigmentation of any type was associated with lower high-resolution computed tomography scores (P = 0.02). Conclusion: This study shows that in systemic sclerosis patients presenting with pigmentary skin manifestations, cutaneous sclerosis is significantly higher.

AB  - Background:The utility of serum as a specimen for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation detection and to select patients most likely to benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is unclear. Methods:EGFR mutations (exons 19, 20, 21) were determined in the serum (n = 247) and tissue (n = 170) of treatment-na & iuml;ve adenocarcinoma patients using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) technique. The prognostic value of EGFR in serum was evaluated following treatment based on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results:EGFR mutations in exon 19 and/or exon 21 were detected in 79/247 (31.9%) patients in serum and 52/170 (30.6%) patients in tissue. The presence of EGFR mutations in serum or tissue was significantly associated with OS, and the presence of EGFR mutations in serum, but not in tissue, showed a significant association with longer PFS. In patients who received gefitinib, those who were mutation positive in tissue or serum had a significantly better OS and PFS compared with mutation-negative patients. The OS and PFS of patients with detectable EGFR mutations both in serum and in tissue were significantly better than in patients without mutations in either specimen. Patients with mutations in both serum and tissue had a 70% lower risk of overall mortality and 46% lower risk of disease progression compared to patients with mutations only in tissue but not in the serum. Conclusion:Serum EGFR detection demonstrates good prognostic value for the response after treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and may be a promising specimen for liquid biopsy for selecting patients most likely to benefit from TKI therapy.

AB  - We report the case of a 48 year old man brought-in-dead to the trauma unit following an alleged accidental fall from a multi-storied building. Autopsy findings were consistent with traumatic injuries to the head, chest and spine. Incidentally, a bit of the diaphragm with a pearly white lobulated mass over the pleural surface was observed. Histopathological examination detected a calcifying fibrous pseudotumour (CFPT), confirmed by positive immunostaining for cluster of differentiation protein-34 (CD34) and vimentin (focally). CFPTs are slow-growing pseudotumours that are clinically benign with extremely low rate of recurrence and this might just be the first reported case of CFPT on the diaphragm. This shall further aid clinicians to diagnose these rare yet significant soft tissue tumors in uncommon sites.

AB  - Background and Aims: Tenecteplase is used as the standard of care treatment for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients within 4.5 h of symptom onset. Documented reports were less certain to claim the benefits of it in an extended window period. EAST-AIS (CTRI/2022/03/040718) trial is designed to determine the success rate of thrombolysis in an extended window period for good clinical outcomes. Study Design: It is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of tenecteplase administered within 4.5-24 h of stroke onset (with or without large vessel occlusion) based on evidence of salvageable tissue through baseline computed tomography perfusion (CTP) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Criteria of patient inclusion are as follows: patients of both genders (male and female), age >18 years, pre-stroke modified Ranking Scale (mRS) <2, baseline NIHSS >5, CTP showing penumbra-ischemic core ratio >1.8, absolute difference in volume >10 ml, and ischemic core volume <70 ml. The sample size for the study is 100 patients: 50 in the tenecteplase arm (0.25 mg/kg body weight; maximum- 25 mg) and 50 in the placebo arm (controls). Study Outcomes: The study's primary objective is safety endpoints along with the efficacy of tenecteplase assessed using the mRS score at 90 days of stroke onset. Conclusion: The result obtained from EAST-AIS will determine the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase injection administered 4.5-24 h following the symptom onset for AIS patients within the territory of Internal Carotid Artery (ICA), Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), or Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) occlusion.

AB  - Background:Nomophobia or no-mobile-phone phobia, defined as the fear of being unable to use or being unreachable via one's mobile phone. The pervasive concern has varied bio-psychosocial and clinical implications in an individual's life. Nomophobia is currently in an exploratory phase.Methods:A scoping review was conducted to systematically map the relevant evidence and literature on nomophobia. The review of scholarly literature spanning from January 2010 to May 2023 employed a narrative synthesis methodology to succinctly encapsulate the research findings. Additionally, it encompassed a meticulous examination and visual representation of studies, detailing both the frequency of investigation into specific variables and the instances in which said variables exhibited a statistically significant association with nomophobia.Results:A thorough examination of 92 studies revealed a total of 133 variables spanning demographic, lifestyle-related, academic, smartphone-related, psychosocial, and clinical domains. Notably, 42.86% of these variables have only been investigated in a single research study, underscoring the imperative for replication to enhance the generalizability, validity, and applicability of research findings. Moreover, the review identifies Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) by Yildirim and Correia as the most widely used tool for measuring the severity of nomophobia.Conclusion:There is a crucial need for homogeneity and consistency in reporting nomophobia scores and establishing corresponding gradations indicative of functional ramifications or clinical severity of nomophobia. The findings elucidate significant research gaps in existing literature on nomophobia, hold implications for further synthesis of data, and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of nomophobia; ensuring superior diagnostic accuracy and precision, and facilitating successful delivery of targeted interventions.

AB  - Transverse root fracture (TRF) is classified as a cervical, middle or apical third root fracture on a periapical radiograph. The International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) suggests that cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) should be considered, when conventional radiographs provide 'insufficient' information for diagnosis and treatment planning. Considering that CBCT can divulge additional information, it would be beneficial to have a clinically pertinent three-dimensional classification for TRF. The proposed alphanumeric classification includes the traumatised tooth number, describes the number of TRF, the facial and lingual location of each fracture line on the anatomic root, and its position relative to the crest of the alveolar bone. Further, diastasis, displacement of the coronal fragment and status of the alveolar bone at the site of TRF are also documented. This comprehensive classification system would provide a standard format for reporting, aid in referral communication and can be applied for future outcome studies on TRF.

AB  - Current advances in the understanding of the lung cancer landscape have drastically changed the approach to treating a patient with lung carcinoma. The field has progressed from analyzing single gene to using advanced techniques like next-generation sequencing and microarray technology. While a tumor tissue sample is considered the gold standard, it has several limitations. The limitations of invasive procedures, long processing periods, inaccessibility, and sample inadequacy are being addressed by sampling biofluids, termed 'liquid biopsy,' which offers a less invasive and more accessible way to obtain tumor-related information. Liquid biopsy has transformed the care of lung cancer patients by directly targeting somatic alterations from tumors. This article provides insights into the biology, technical aspects, limitations, and practical applications of 'liquid biopsy,' focusing on cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA in the context of lung cancer.

AB  - Background & objectives: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with a higher risk of malignancy, which is attributed to disease behaviour and the usage of immunosuppressants. The burden of malignancy in CD is scarcely reported from Asia. We report real-world data on CD-related malignancy from a northern Indian cohort.Methods: This retrospective analysis included individuals with CD who were followed up at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from 2005 to 2021. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used to calculate the relative risk of malignancy in CD affected individuals compared to the general population.Results: In this study, 952 study participants were included, with a mean age at diagnosis of 36.9 +/- 15.11 yr; 61.1 per cent were male. The median follow-up duration was 34 months [IQR (interquartile range): 19-73]. Most study participants received steroids (76.7%), immunomodulators (68.7%), or anti-TNF therapy (10.8%). The overall incidence of malignancy was 1.05 per cent, indicating a 10.45 times higher risk in CD [SIR: 10.45; 95% Confidence interval (CI):4.98-17.96]. Eight out of 826, 1 of 106 and 1 of 25 study participants developed malignancy in the first, second and third decades, respectively. The cumulative risk of malignancy was 2.7, 5.5, and 13.4 per cent in the first, second, and third decades, respectively. Regarding bowel malignancies, one study participant each developed ileocaecal adenocarcinoma, anorectal adenocarcinoma, malignant rectal fibrous histiocytoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Extraintestinal malignancies included single cases each of follicular neoplasia of the thyroid, neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreatic tail, breast cancer, hepatocellular cancer, oral cancer, and prostate cancer. No cases of lymphoma or skin malignancy were reported.Interpretation & conclusions: At 30 yr, the cumulative risk of malignancy among Indian CD-affected individuals was 13.4 per cent, with a SIR of 10.45 (95% CI: 4.98- 17.96). The risk increased with increasing age at disease onset and duration.

AB  - In this paper, we aim to create fully biodegradable glyconanoparticles formed via self-assembly of glycopolymers, comprising of biodegradable aliphatic polyester conjugated with mannose moiety. To accomplish the goal, a series of random copolymers comprised of poly(propargyl glycolide-co-lactide) were synthesized. Alkyne moiety of the poly (propargyl glycolide) component was then clicked with mannose ethyl azide to produce amphiphilic glycopolymers in good yield (60-75 %). The glycopolymers were then self-assembled to form glyconanoparticles of 15-23 nm size in dry state and 78-88 nm size in hydrated state (hydrodynamic diameter). The copolymers were characterized by NMR and FTIR, whereas the nanoparticles were thoroughly characterized by DLS, FESEM, and HR-TEM and explored for their lectin binding efficiency. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments suggest a stronger binding efficiency of glyconanoparticles towards mannose-specific lectin such as Concanavalin A, as compared to its corresponding glycopolymers (-2 fold) and monomeric mannose unit (-7fold) as well. Moreover, curcumin was selected as the model drug to be encapsulated (-76 % encapsulation efficiency) and released (74 % in 24 h) from the glyconanoparticles. Apart from these, excellent haemocompatibility, cell viability, and cellular uptake of the nanoparticles (more than 80 % cells showed uptake of the nanoparticles), further supported their potential as drug carriers having sugar as a targeting moiety.

AB  - Background: Radiosurgery plays an important role as a treatment modality for intracranial meningiomas. Perfusion MR imaging can be performed by using arterial spin-labeling (ASL) which is a relatively new and advanced technique.
   Objectives: To assess the changes in perfusion parameters on ASL perfusion MRI in intracranial meningioma after radiosurgery and correlate with histopathological grade of meningioma.
   Materials and Methods: In this Prospective study done at the our institute over a period of 20 months (Jan 2016-Aug 2017), patients with intracranial meningiomas had perfusion MRI with ASL sequence on GE Optima 450W (R), 1.5T MRI (GE Medical Systems) prior to GKT and at 6 months after GKT were included in the study.
   Results: Twenty-seven patients were included in this study. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) was higher in angiomatous meningiomas. Though mean values of average CBF, maximum, minimum, and SD derived from the ASL MR perfusion were relatively higher in post GKT group as compared to those obtained in pre-GKT but it was not clinically significant. Mean baseline volume of whole cohort was 5.71 cm(3) and decreased significantly post GKT in a follow up of 6 months to 5.59 cm3 (P value 0.0018). On comparing volumes of primary and secondary group, volumes were not found be significantly decreased in primary group (P value = 0.1361), 0.1361), but significantly reduced in secondary group (7.13 vs 7.034 cm(3)) (P value of = 0.0038).
   Conclusion: Our preliminary observations support ASL as a sensitive MRI sequence for the evaluation of meningioma perfusion patterns.

Approximately 20%-30% of patients present with weight loss failure or reflux following SG, which might require reoperative surgery. We present the surgical outcomes and complications following reoperative bariatric surgery at a tertiary care centre.
   Patients and Methods: Prospectively collected data of all patients undergoing reoperative bariatric surgery from 2008 to 2021 were analysed retrospectively. Weight loss, resolution of comorbidities and complications following reoperative surgery were evaluated.
   Results: Twenty-six patients were included in the study. The mean age was 38.8 (10.8) years. The primary procedure performed was laparoscopic SG in all cases. Nine patients underwent Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (one banded RYGB) and 14 underwent one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) (three-banded OAGB). Three patients underwent resleeve. The most common indication was weight loss failure (65.3%). Fifteen patients were diagnosed to have hiatal hernia intraoperatively and concomitant repair was performed. The mean body mass index before revision surgery was 42.7 (9.8). It was 32.6 (5.7) kg/m(2) and 33.0 (6.1) kg/m(2) at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Age and pre-revision surgery excess weight correlated with weight loss (r = -0.79 and r = 0.99, respectively). Leak and bleeding occurred in one and two patients, respectively. There were two band-related complications and one 30-day mortality.
   Conclusion: Re-operative bariatric surgery following SG has adequate weight loss with acceptable complication rates. Band placement in re-operative surgery might lead to a higher complication rate.

AB  - Histiocytic disorders mostly occur as de-novo nodal or extranodal benign masses with rare secondary malignant transformation. A 10-year-old female presented with 10-cm cervical swelling since 9 months associated with fever. Computed tomography revealed left cervical lymphadenopathy and bilateral lung nodules. Lymph node excision biopsy showed effacement of architecture by atypical histiocytes with marked nuclear pleomorphism and frequent mitosis. Focal areas showed mature histiocytes with emperipolesis. The cells were immunopositive for CD68, CD163, and S100 (focal), whereas they were negative for Langerin and CD1a. The Ki67 proliferative index was 30%. A diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma in a background of Rosai-Dorfman disease was made.

AB  - Background: Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a prevalent and distressing occurrence in 60-80% of individuals who have undergone amputations. Recent research underscores the significance of maladaptive cortical plasticity in the genesis of PLP, emphasizing the importance of targeting cortical areas for therapeutic interventions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive tool for cortical stimulation, demonstrates effectiveness in treating various chronic pain conditions of neuropathic origin. Nevertheless, there exists a limited body of research investigating the application of rTMS as a therapeutic intervention specifically for managing PLP. Notably, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a crucial role in central pain processing, suggesting its potential as a key therapeutic target in PLP treatment. There is a lack of adequate data regarding the effectiveness of DLPFC-targeting rTMS in alleviating the pain experienced by PLP patients. Objective: In this study, our aim was to investigate the impact of 10 sessions of DLPFC-targeting rTMS on the pain status of individuals experiencing PLP. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Traumatic amputees reporting to the tertiary care center with PLP. Methods: The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee (IECPG-299/27.04.2022) and registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2022/07/043938). Nineteen patients suffering from PLP were recruited and randomized into real or sham rTMS groups. In the real rTMS group, patients received 10 sessions of rTMS at the DLPFC contralateral to the amputation site. The rTMS, administered at 90% of the resting motor threshold (RMT), was delivered as 8 trains of 150 pulses per train at the rate of one Hz and an inter-train interval of 60 seconds. The total number of pulses per session was 1,200. The sham group received 10 sessions of sham rTMS through the perpendicular placement of an rTMS coil over the DLPFC. These sessions lasted for the same duration and included the same sounds as the real group but involved no active stimulation. The patients' pain status was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline, at the end of each session of real or sham rTMS and at the 15th, 30th, and 60th day after the the completion of real or sham therapy. Results: A significant decrease in VAS scores was noted after 10 sessions of real rTMS that targeted the DLPFC, in contrast to the sham rTMS group. The real rTMS group's reduction in VAS scores also persisted during the follow-up. Limitations: A few patients had to drop out due to physical restrictions and financial constraints. Consequently, only a small number of individuals were able to complete the study protocol successfully. Conclusion: A regimen of 10 sessions of real rTMS of the DLPFC was associated with significant pain relief in patients with PLP, and the effects were sustained for 2 months. Therefore, the present study shows that rTMS of the DLPFC has potential as an effective therapeutic intervention for sustained pain relief in PLP patients.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the effect of topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (brinzolamide) versus placebo on visual function and waveforms in infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS). Design: Prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study. Methods: Setting- A tertiary eye care center. Patients- Cases of idiopathic INS with and without abnormal head posture aged >= 10 years who had not received previous treatment for nystagmus. Intervention- Patients were randomized into two groups. Group 1 was given placebo for 3 months, and after a washout period of 7 days started on topical brinzolamide for the next 3 months. In group 2, the order was reversed. The drops were administered topically three times (every 8 hours) in both eyes. Outcome measure- Binocular best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the ETDRS chart, eXpanded nystagmus acuity function (NAFX) score and INS waveforms obtained from eye movement recordings, intraocular pressure (IOP) by Goldmann applanation tonometer, near stereopsis by TNO stereo test, and change in abnormal head posture before and after intervention in the null position. Results: A total of 29 cases completed the study (23 with abnormal head posture; 6 without abnormal head posture) .A significant improvement was noted in INS waveform characteristics, mean NAFX score (P < 0.001), and mean binocular visual acuity (P < 0.001) with topical brinzolamide in comparison to baseline as well as placebo. No significant change in head position and stereopsis was noted. No side effects were reported with 3 months of brinzolamide therapy. Conclusions: While brinzolamide shows improvement in visual acuity and NAFX score in idiopathic INS, its clinical significance needs further evidence.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesRegulatory requirement of fixed holding time (6 h) of whole blood (WB) at room temperature, that is, 22-24 degrees C (RT) results in sub-optimal component separation. The aim was to evaluate the platelet concentrates (PC) prepared by both platelet rich plasma (PRP) and buffy coat (BC) methods after overnight hold (18-24 h) at RT.Materials and MethodsA prospective experimental study was performed. A total of 48 WB units collected were divided into four groups (12 each) control-1 (C1) and test-1 (T1) for PRP and control-2 (C2) and test-2 (T2) for the BC method. Control groups were processed within 6 h, and in test groups, components were prepared after overnight hold, followed by evaluation of quality parameters.ResultsIrrespective of the method used, all PCs had similar volume, platelet yield, swirling, no bacterial contamination, RBC contamination, PaO2 and PaCO2 levels. PCs in the T1 group had significant differences in glucose and MPV values on d1, which were resolved by d5 of storage. PCs in T2 has significant differences in pH, glucose, and MPV levels throughout storage. PRBC in test and control groups had similar quality parameters till d42 of storage. FFPs in all tests were noninferior to the concurrent control groups till 3 months of storage.ConclusionOvernight holding of WB had no lasting deleterious changes. Though a few biochemical parameters in the test groups were significantly different, they can be accepted to improve the logistics of component separation. Overall PRP method seemed to have a better result than the BC method after an overnight hold.

AB  - Introduction Anaemia is a disease of public health importance with multi-causal pathways. Previous literature suggests the role of indoor air pollution (IAP) on haemoglobin levels, but this has been studied less due to logistic constraints. A high proportion of the population in developing countries, including India, still depends on unclean fuel, which exacerbates IAP. The objective was to study the association between anaemia and IAP among the older Indian adult population (>= 45 years) as per gender. Methods Our study analysed the nationally representative dataset of the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI 2017-18, Wave-1). We have documented the association of anaemia (outcome variable) with IAP (explanatory variable). To reduce the confounding effects of demographic and socioeconomic; health related and behavioural covariates; propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted. Nested multilevel regression modelling was conducted. States and union territories were categorised cross tabulated as low, middle and high as per anaemia and IAP exposure. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SATA version 17 was used for analysis. Results More than half (52.52%) of the participants were exposed to IAP (male (53.55%) > female (51.63%)). The odds of having anaemia was significantly 1.19 times higher (AOR 1.19 (1.09-1.31)) among participants using unclean/ solid fuel. The adjusted odds were significantly higher among participants exposed to pollution-generating sources (AOR 1.30; 1.18-1.43), and household indoor smoking (AOR 1.17 (1.07-1.29). The odds of having anaemia were significantly higher (AOR 1.26; 1.15-1.38) among participants exposed to IAP, which was higher in males (AOR 1.36; 1.15-1.61) than females (AOR 1.21; 1.08-1.35). Empowered Action Group (EAG) states like Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar had both high anaemia and IAP exposure. Conclusion This study established the positive association of anaemia with indoor air pollution among older Indian adults through a nationally representative large dataset. The association was higher among men. Further research is recommended to understand detailed causation and to establish temporality. It is a high time to implement positive intervention nationally to decrease solid/ unclean fuel usage, vulnerable ventilation, indoor smoking, IAP and health hazards associated with these with more focused actions towards EAG states.

AB  - Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in human serum in a stable form. Circulating miRNAs are increasingly recognized as promising biomarkers for early cancer detection. The aim of this study was to identify serum miRNAs as biomarkers for periampullary adenocarcinoma (PAC). Patients and methods: 68 patients with PAC and 50 healthy controls (HCs) subjects were recruited in this study. The expression levels of 11 selected miRNAs were determined in serum samples using the SYBR-green quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic potential of serum miRNAs. Results: The expression levels of three miRNAs (miR-215-5p, miR-192-5p, and miR-378a-5p) were significantly upregulated in the serum samples derived from the PAC patients compared with those from the HC (p < 0.001). The ROC analysis showed that all three significantly altered miRNAs (miR-215-5p, miR-192-5p, and miR-378a5p) could potentially discriminate patients with PAC from HC with AUC value of 0.771 (95% CI: 0.684-0.843), 0.877 (95% CI: 0.799-0.927) and 0.768 (95% CI: 0.674-0.853) respectively. Further comparisons showed that these three serum miRNAs (miR-215-5p, miR-192-5p, and miR-378a-5p) can strongly discriminate early-stage PAC patients from HC with an AUC value of 0.802 (95% CI: 0.719-0.886), 0.870 (95% CI: 0.793-0.974) and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.706-0.880) respectively, may aid in early detection of PAC. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings demonstrated that these three serum miRNAs (miR-215-5p, miR-1925p, and miR-378a-5p) may serve as noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of PAC.

AB  - Background India is a large and populous country where reliable data on headache disorders are relatively scarce. This study in northern India (Delhi and National Capital Territory Region [NCR], including surrounding districts in the States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan) continues the series of population-based studies within the Global Campaign against Headache and follows an earlier study, using the same protocol and questionnaire, in the southern State of Karnataka. Methods This cross-sectional study used the Global Campaign's established methodology. Biologically unrelated Indian nationals aged 18-65 years were included through multistage random sampling in both urban and rural areas of NCR. Interviews at unannounced household visits followed the structured Headache-Attributed Restriction, Disability, Social Handicap and Impaired Participation (HARDSHIP) questionnaire in its original English version or in the validated Hindi version. Demographic enquiry was followed by a neutral headache screening question and diagnostic questions based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders edition 3 (ICHD-3), which focused on each respondent's most bothersome headache. Questions about headache yesterday (HY) enabled estimation of 1-day prevalence. A diagnostic algorithm first identified participants reporting headache on >= 15 days/month (H15+), diagnosing probable medication-overuse headache (pMOH) in those also reporting acute medication use on >= 15 days/month, and "other H15+" in those not. To all others, the algorithm applied ICHD-3 criteria in the order definite migraine, definite tension-type headache (TTH), probable migraine, probable TTH. Definite and probable diagnoses were combined. Results Adjusted for age, gender and habitation, 1-year prevalences were 26.3% for migraine, 34.1% for TTH, 3.0% for pMOH and 4.5% for other H15+. Female preponderance was seen in all headache types except TTH: migraine 35.7% vs. 15.1% (aOR = 3.3; p < 0.001); pMOH 4.3% vs. 0.7% (aOR = 5.1; p < 0.001); other H15 + 5.9% vs. 2.3% (aOR = 2.5; p = 0.08). One-day prevalence of (any) headache was 12.0%, based on reported HY. One-day prevalence predicted from 1-year prevalence and mean recalled headache frequency over 3 months was slightly lower (10.5%). Conclusions The prevalences of migraine and TTH in Delhi and NCR substantially exceed global means. They closely match those in the Karnataka study: migraine 25.2%, TTH 35.1%. We argue that these estimates can reasonably be extrapolated to all India.

A qualitative inquiry was employed to understand the perceived benefits and challenges of research collaborations by biomedical scientists from India (Global South [GS] country) and the Global North (GN). In-depth interviews were conducted with 47 biomedical scientists from India and 06 from the GN. The data was analyzed using the grounded theory approach. Complementarity of skills and resources, access to funds, improved quality of work, an opportunity to conduct multi-centric studies, development of collaborative networks, better and larger number of publications, mutual learning, opportunity to work with credible researchers, address common interests, leverage interpersonal and trusted relationships and larger societal good were some of the critical factors for eagerness of participants in joint scientific endeavors. However, the challenging aspects of dissent and disagreements were the power imbalance between the collaborators, the development of a trust deficit, and local administrative issues. The challenges reported in the current publication, also echoed in several previous publications can be surmounted and negotiated amicably when the rules of the game, law of the land, sharing of the credits, and interest of the collaborating parties are addressed and agreed up in a fair and just manner before the start of the collaboration. Overall biomedical partnerships are complex collaborations with its challenges, the processes are dynamic and outcomes are emergent. This requires constant and proactive evolution of the preparation, implementation and sustainability of the collaborative efforts be it national or international.

AB  - CD40 agonist antibodies (alpha CD40) have shown promising anti-tumor response in both preclinical and early clinical studies. However, its systemic administration is associated with immune- and hepato-toxicities which hampers its clinical usage. In addition, alpha CD40 showed low tumor retention and induced PD-L1 expression which makes tumor microenvironment (TME) immunosuppressive. To overcome these issues, in this study, we have developed a multifunctional Immunosome where alpha CD40 is conjugated on the surface and RRX-001, a small molecule immunomodulator was encapsulated inside it. Immunosomes showed higher tumor accumulation till 96 h of administration and displayed sustained release of alpha CD40 in vivo. . Immunosomes significantly delayed tumor growth and showed tumor free survival in mice bearing GL-261 glioblastoma by increasing the population of CD45+CD8+ + CD8 + T cells, CD45+CD20+ + CD20 + B cells, CD45+CD11c+ + CD11c + DCs and F4/80+CD86+ + CD86 + cells in TME. Immunosome significantly reduced the population of T-regulatory cells, M2 macrophage, and MDSCs and lowered the PD-L1 expression. Moreover, Immunosomes significantly enhanced the levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-2) over Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) which supported anti-tumor response. Most interestingly, Immunosomes averted the in vivo toxicities associated with free alpha CD40 by lowering the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), IL-6, IL-1 alpha and reduced the degree of liver damage. In addition, Immunosomes treated long-term surviving mice showed tumor specific immune memory response which prevented tumor growth upon rechallenge. Our results suggested that this novel formulation can be further explored in clinics to improve in vivo o anti-tumor efficacy of alpha CD40 with long-lasting tumor specific immunity while reducing the associated toxicities.

AB  - Heat shock proteins are a widely distributed group of proteins. It is constitutively expressed in almost all organisms and shows little variation throughout evolution. Previously, HSPs, particularly Hsp70, were recognized as molecular chaperones that aid in the proper three-dimensional folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in cells. Recently, researchers have focused on the potential induction of immune cells, including macrophages, antigen-specific CD8+ + cytotoxic T cells, and PBMCs. It induces the expression of CC chemokines such as MIP-1 alpha and RANTES, which are responsible for the chemotactic movement and migration of immune cells at the site of infection to neutralize foreign particles in vivo and in vitro in several cell lines but their effect on tumor-associated macrophages is still not known. These cytokines are also known to influence the movement of several immune cells, including CD8+ + cytotoxic T cells, toward inflammatory sites. Therefore, the effect of tumor-derived autologous Hsp70 on the expression of MIP-l alpha and RANTES in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was investigated. Our results indicated that Hsp70 treatment-induced MIP-l alpha and RANTES expression was significantly greater in TAMs than in NMOs. According to the literature, the CC chemokine shares the same receptor, CCR5, as HIV does for their action, and therefore could provide better completion to the virus for ligand binding. Furthermore, Hsp70-preactivated TAMs induced increased IL-2 and IFN-gamma expression in T cells during coculture for 48 h and upregulated the antitumor immune response of the host. Therefore, the outcome of our study could be useful for developing a better approach to restricting the growth and progression of tumors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the operative parameters and complication rates between the umbilical (UMB) and right upper quadrant (RUQ) skin incisions for Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy for the treatment of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus databases were systematically searched. The studies where any one of the main outcomes of interest, i.e., operative time, wound infection rate, mucosal perforation rate were reported were eligible for inclusion. The statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Fifteen studies comprising 2964 infants were included. As compared to the UMB group, the RUQ group showed a significantly lower mean operative time (p = 0.0004), wound infection rate (p < 0.0001) and mucosal perforation rate (p = 0.02). Although UMB incision produces an almost undetectable scar, this approach results in significantly more complications. Therefore, the risks and benefits must be weighed and discussed with the caregivers in deciding the surgical approach in patients with IHPS. However, due to a poor methodological quality of nine out of fifteen studies, further studies need to be conducted for an optimal comparison between the two groups.

TI  - Efficacy of tofacitinib as an induction agent in severe alopecia areata compared with oral betamethasone weekly pulse
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
AB  - A few studies have looked at the efficacy of tofacitinib in severe alopecia areata (AA), characterized by >= 50% scalp hair loss. Here, we aimed to assess retrospective data for the role of tofacitinib as an induction agent in severe AA, compared with the standard oral mini-pulse (OMP). Tofacitinib holds promise as an induction agent for patients with severe AA, comparable with OMP. However, when patients respond inadequately to tofacitinib, a trial of pulse steroids may be considered.

AB  - Introduction There is limited literature on digital ischemia in systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report the prevalence, associations and outcome of digital infarcts and gangrene from the Indian SLE inception cohort (INSPIRE).Methods From the web-based database of INSPIRE, we extracted information for patients with 'Digital Infarct' and 'Digital gangrene' at enrolment into cohort, together considered as critical peripheral ischemia (CPI); all others were controls. We describe the associations of CPI with SLE clinical phenotype, autoantibodies, and disease activity at enrolment. We also report short term outcomes viz. Digital tissue loss and early mortality up to 6 months and recurrence of digital ischemic events in cases till date.Results Of 2503 SLE patients enrolled into the INSPIRE cohort, we identified 75 (2.9%) patients with CPI, 72 (96%) women and 6 (8%) children. Of them, 55 (73.3%) had digital gangrene and 21 (28%) patients had digital infarcts. Majority of digital gangrene resulted in amputation distal to terminal phalanx (63.6%). Multivariable analysis showed that pulmonary hypertension AOR [6.34 (1.99, 20.2)], coexistent thrombosis AOR [27.8 (15.7, 48.7)], triple antiphospholipid antibody positivity AOR [5.36 (1.67, 16.9)] and the presence of anti-Scl-70-antibody AOR [5.59 (1.86, 16.7)] were more likely while patients with class 3 or 4 lupus nephritis AOR [0.37 (0.15, 0.95)] and anti-nucleosome antibodies AOR [0.47 (0.23, 0.99)] were less likely to be associated with CPI. SLEDAI and short-term mortality were similar between cases and controls.Conclusions CPI occurred in a higher proportion (2.9%) of SLE patients in the INSPIRE cohort as compared to earlier reports. Both prothrombotic state and vasculopathy contribute to its occurrence.

AB  - Background: In people with lower limb amputation (LLA), the loss of limb structures and peripheral motor and sensory systems result in significant mobility challenges, including impaired postural stability. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the dual -task interference (DTI) on postural control and dual -task interference on cognition during static and dynamic balance in people with LLA and compare the same with controls . The secondary objective of this study was to compare the DTI on postural control and DTI on cognition between LLA of different etiology. Design: Cross-sectional observational study Methodology: Fifteen people with unilateral LLA and 15 age and gender -matched controls participated in this study at a tertiary care hospital. The outcome measures used were anterior -posterior stability index (APSI), medial -lateral stability index, and overall stability index (OSI) using Biodex Balance System and a cognitive task parameter, namely correct response rate in serial seven subtraction test. Quantitative variables were compared using a Wilcoxon rank -sum test. Spearman 's correlation test was used to establish the correlation between the DTI on cognition and the DTI on postural control. Results: DTI on postural control during static balance was significantly higher in people with LLA than controls (APSI, OSI). No significant difference was observed in DTI on postural control during dynamic balance. No significant difference was observed in DTI on cognition during static and dynamic balance. A significant negative correlation was observed between DTI on cognition and DTI on postural control (APSI) during static balance people with LLA. Significance: In people with unilateral LLA, the addition of a cognitive task results in significant deterioration of sagittal plane postural control during static balance but not during dynamic balance due to the over -allocation of resources to a cognitive task.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) constitute an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and India is no exception to this trend. With the ongoing aging of the population in India, there is a notable surge in the prevalence and impact of CVDs among older adults. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge concerning the prevalence, risk factors, and management of CVDs in the context of Indian older adults. The incidence of CVDs in India is not only alarming but also exhibits an upward trajectory with advancing age. Primary risk factors contributing to the elevated incidence among older adults include hypertension (HT), diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor dietary habits. Additionally, stress and genetic predisposition emerge as noteworthy contributors to CVDs in this population. Effectively identifying and managing these risk factors among older adults in India is imperative to alleviate the burden of these diseases and enhance overall quality of life. Strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of CVDs in the country necessitate a comprehensive approach, integrating lifestyle interventions, public health initiatives, and a robust healthcare system. In summary, CVDs represent a significant health concern in both rural and urban areas of India. However, variations exist in the prevalence, risk factors, and accessibility to healthcare between these regions. Therefore, addressing the prevalence of CVDs in India necessitates a complex, multidimensional strategy that takes into account the unique opportunities and challenges that come with living in both rural and urban areas.

AB  - Cellulases from GH9 family show endo-, exo- or processive endocellulase activity, but the reason behind the variation is unclear. A GH9 recombinant endoglucanase, AtGH9C-CBM3A-CBM3B from Acetivibrio thermocellus was structurally characterized for conformation, binding and dynamics assessment. Modeled AtGH9C-CBM3A-CBM3B depicted (alpha/alpha)(6)-barrel structure with Asp98, Asp101 and Glu489 acting as catalytic triad. CD results revealed 25.2 % alpha-helix, 18.4 % beta-sheet and rest 56.4 % of random coils, corroborating with predictions from PSIPRED and SOPMA. MD simulation of AtGH9C-CBM3A-CBM3B bound cellotetraose showed structural stability and global compactness with lowered RMSD values (1.5 nm) as compared with only AtGH9C-CBM3A-CBM3B (1.8 nm) for 200 ns. Higher fluctuation in RMSF values in far-positioned CBM3B pointed to its redundancy in substrate binding. Docking studies showed maximum binding with cellotetraose (Delta G = -5.05 kcal/mol), with reduced affinity towards ligands with degree of polymerization (DP) lower (DP < 4) or higher than 4 (DP > 4). Processivity index displayed the enzyme to be processive with loop 3 (342-379 aa) possibly blocking the non-reducing end of cellulose chain, resulting in cellotetraose release. SAXS analysis of AtGH9C-CBM3A-CBM3B at 5 mg/mL displayed monodispersed state with fist-and-elbow shape in solution. Negative zeta potential of -24 mV at 5 mg/mL indicated stability and free from aggregation.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the current evidence on various aspects of fluid therapy such as type, volume, and timing of fluid bolus administration in children with septic shock. Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials including children less than 18 years of age admitted to the pediatric emergency and intensive care unit with severe infection and shock requiring fluid resuscitation. The intervention included balanced crystalloids (BC) vs normal saline (NS), colloids vs NS, restricted vs liberal fluid bolus, and slow vs fast fluid bolus. The primary outcome was mortality rate. Of the 219 citations retrieved, 12 trials (3526 children with severe infection with or without malaria and shock) were included. The pooled results found no significant difference in the mortality rate between groups comparing balanced crystalloids (BC) vs normal saline (NS), colloids vs NS, restricted vs liberal fluid bolus, and slow vs fast fluid bolus. The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) was significantly less in the BC group compared to the NS group. The certainty of evidence for mortality was of "moderate certainty" in the BC vs NS group, and was of "very low certainty" for the other two groups.Conclusions: The current meta-analysis found no significant difference in the mortality rate between the types of resuscitation fluid, and their speed or volume of administration. However, a significantly decreased risk of AKI was found in the BC group. More evidence is needed regarding the speed and volume of administration of fluid boluses in critically ill children.Prospero registration: CRD42020209066.What is known:center dot Balanced crystalloids (BC) may be better than normal saline (NS) for fluid resuscitation in critically ill children.What is new:center dot BC are better than NS for fluid resuscitation in critically ill children as they decrease AKI and hyperchloremia.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate comprehensive bone health among young Indian women, including bone mass, microarchitecture, and turnover, in relation to their non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) status. Methods This cross-sectional study (May 2018-November 2019) recruited women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normoglycemia in their index pregnancy, who were at least 6 months postpartum. All participants underwent abdominal ultrasonography for determination of NAFLD status (grades 2 and 3: severe NAFLD) and transient elastography (FibroScan) for hepatic fibrosis (LSM >6 kPa). Bone mass was assessed by DXA, bone microarchitecture with trabecular bone score {TBS} (low TBS <= 1.310) and bone turnover with markers of bone formation (osteocalcin and P1NP), and resorption (CTX). Results Bone mineral density (BMD) at femoral neck (p = 0.026) and total hip (p = 0.007) was significantly higher among women with NAFLD (n = 170) compared to those without (n = 124). There was no significant difference in bone turnover markers between the two groups. The presence of NAFLD [adjusted OR: 1.82 (1.07, 3.11)] was associated with low TBS, with a greater strength of association among women with severe NAFLD [adjusted OR: 2.97 (1.12, 7.88)]. However, these associations were attenuated and no longer significant after additionally adjusting for BMI. Women with NAFLD and hepatic fibrosis manifested significantly higher BMD at lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip (p < 0.001 for all) and significantly lower bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, p = 0.009 and CTX, p = 0.029), however, the association with low TBS was not observed. Conclusion Among young Indian women, NAFLD is associated with increased bone mass and impaired bone microarchitecture, and hepatic fibrosis with increased bone mass and reduced bone turnover.

AB  - Background: Fever in children is one of the most common reasons for outpatient visits as well as in-patient evaluation, often causing anxiety among parents and caregivers. Fever can be a standalone feature or be associated with other localising symptoms and signs like rash, lymphadenopathy, or any other organ system involvement with or without a focus of infection. The etiologies of fever vary depending on the clinical setting and epidemiology. India being a tropical country, sees a distinct spectrum of tropical infections. Physicians need to stay updated on the prevalent diseases in their region and the unique factors that may influence the clinical presentations and course of fever in the cohort of children they manage. The challenge lies in balancing the benefit of early treatment for severe diseases versus the harms of unnecessary investigations and treatment for self-resolving illnesses. Objectives: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of fever in children, covering its etiology, clinical features, and management strategies. This review offers an algorithmic approach to fever tailored to the Indian setting to guide physicians in identifying the disease based on clinical symptoms and signs, ordering essential laboratory investigations, and initiating appropriate management promptly. Content: The review categorises fever into various segments like fever with localising signs like rash, lymphadenopathy, fever due to infection localised to a particular organ system, and fever without a focus including fever of unknown origin. It delves into the diverse etiological factors contributing to fever in each of these categories, encompassing infectious and non-infectious origins. It gives pointers to identify the etiology from history, examination, and confirm them with judicious use of diagnostic investigations with emphasis on identifying the red flag signs that require immediate attention, especially in vulnerable groups like neonates and young infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2016, the Lipid Association of India (LAI) developed a cardiovascular risk assessment algorithm and defined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in Indians. The recent refinements in the role of various risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis in prediction of ASCVD risk necessitated updating the risk algorithm and treatment goals. METHODS: The LAI core committee held twenty-one meetings and webinars from June 2022 to July 2023 with experts across India and critically reviewed the latest evidence regarding the strategies for ASCVD risk prediction and the benefits and modalities for intensive lipid lowering. Based on the expert consensus and extensive review of published data, consensus statement IV was commissioned. RESULTS: The young age of onset and a more aggressive nature of ASCVD in Indians necessitates emphasis on lifetime ASCVD risk instead of the conventional 10-year risk. It also demands early institution of aggressive preventive measures to protect the young population prior to development of ASCVD events. Wide availability and low cost of statins in India enable implementation of effective LDL-C-lowering therapy in individuals at high risk of ASCVD. Subjects with any evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis are likely to benefit the most from early aggressive interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This document presents the updated risk stratification and treatment algorithm and describes the rationale for each modification. The intent of these updated recommendations is to modernize management of dyslipidemia in Indian patients with the goal of reducing the epidemic of ASCVD among Indians in Asia and worldwide.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed to develop a prediction model for identifying a woman with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at high risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) post-birth. Methods: Utilising data from 1299 women in the Lifestyle Intervention IN Gestational Diabetes (LIVING) study, two models were developed: one for pregnancy and another for postpartum. Key predictors included glucose test results, medical history, and biometric indicators. Results: Of the initial cohort, 124 women developed T2DM within three years. The study identified seven predictors for the antenatal T2DM risk prediction model and four for the postnatal one. The models demonstrated good to excellent predictive ability, with Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.80) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.88) for the antenatal and postnatal models, respectively. Both models underwent rigorous validation, showing minimal optimism in predictive capability. Antenatal model, considering the Youden index optimal cut-off point of 0.096, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were measured as 70.97%, 70.81%, and 70.82%, respectively. For the postnatal model, considering the cut-off point 0.086, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were measured as 81.40%, 75.60%, and 76.10%, respectively. Conclusions: These models are effective for predicting T2DM risk in women with GDM, although external validation is recommended before widespread application. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Digestive midgut protease activity in fifth instar larvae (L-5) of Helicoverpa armigera was investigated under controlled conditions, where, an artificial diet containing different concentrations (0.005 mu g/g - 0.3 mu g/g) of Cry1Ac (Crystalline a-endotoxin from class A, subclass c) toxin was fed. Here, the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton seeds were used as Cry1Ac toxin source that was determined using Envirologix ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit. The results showed an increase in the general midgut proteases as well as specific proteases activity linked to enzymes such as trypsin-, chymotrypsin-, elastase-, and leucine aminopeptidase-like with the increasing toxin content of the diet. However, carboxypeptidase-A and carboxypeptidase-B protease activity remained unaltered as a consequence of the incorporation of Cry1Ac toxin in the diet, which is also reported to be absent in midgut of H. armigera as evident in the control group.

AB  - The growing incidence of bone injuries has elevated the demand for Titanium-based orthopedic implants, yet implant-associated infections and loosening remain significant contributors to implant failure in orthopedic surgeries. The present study addressed the issue of aseptic and septic loosening of Ti-6Al-4V orthopedic implants using a bidirectional strategy of developing extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicking electrospun nanofiber coating composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-Gelatin-Quercetin (PGQ) with concomitant antibacterial and osteoinductive property on Ti-6Al-4V surface. The polymeric nanofiber coating of PVA-Gelatin (PG) blend on the Ti-6Al-4V showed ECM mimicking morphology confirmed by SEM with desirable strong adhesion in accordance with ASTM D3359:3B over the implant surface. The physiochemical characterizations of the coated nanofibers performed by FTIR and contact angle measurement confirmed presence of hydrophilic PG coating on Ti-6Al-4V surface. Reinforcement of Quercetin, a natural polyphenol with promising antibacterial and osteogenic potential in PG nanofibers and coating on Ti-6Al-4V imparted antibacterial and osteogenic properties. Quercetin-loaded PGQ nanofibers showed a biphasic release pattern with initial burst release of Quercetin from the implant surface providing the required protection with early microbial infections from Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), whereas steady controlled release of Quercetin from Ti-PGQ implant supported alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Ca-P mineral deposition by osteoblast. The Quercetin concentration of 0.1% (w/v) showed the overall optimum cellular response compared to 0.05 and 0.2% concentration. These findings reflect substantial progress in employing Quercetin-loaded nanofiber-coated Ti-6Al-4V to potentially lower aseptic and septic loosening risks in bone tissue engineering.

AB  - While cortical regions involved in processing binocular disparities have been studied extensively, little is known on how the human visual system adapts to changing disparity magnitudes. In this paper, we investigate causal mechanisms of coarse and fine binocular disparity processing using fMRI with a clinically validated, custom anaglyph-based stimulus. We make use of Granger causality and graph measures to reveal the existence of distinct rich and diverse clubs across different disparity magnitudes. We demonstrate that Middle Temporal area (MT) plays a specialized role with overlapping rich and diverse characteristics. Next, we show that subtle interhemispheric differences exist across various brain regions, despite an overall right hemisphere dominance. Finally, we pass the graph measures through the decision tree and found that the diverse clubs outperform rich clubs in decoding disparity magnitudes. Our study sets the stage for conducting further investigations on binocular disparity processing, particularly in the context of neuro-ophthalmic disorders with binocular impairments.

AB  - Background: Standard assessment and management protocols exist for first episode psychosis (FEP) in high income countries. Due to cultural and resource differences, these need to be modified for application in low-and middle-income countries. Aims: To assess the applicability of standard assessment and management protocols across two cohorts of FEP patients in North and South India by examining trajectories of psychopathology, functioning, quality of life and family burden in both. Method: FEP patients at two sites (108 at AIIMS, North India, and 115 at SCARF, South India) were assessed using structured instruments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Standard management protocols consisted of treatment with antipsychotics and psychoeducation for patients and their families. Generalised estimating equation (GEE) modelling was carried out to test for changes in outcomes both across and between sites at follow-up. Results: There was an overall significant improvement in both cohorts for psychopathology and other outcome measures. The trajectories of improvement differed between the two sites with steeper improvement in non- affective psychosis in the first three months at SCARF, and affective symptoms in the first three months at AIIMS. The reduction in family burden and improvement in quality of life were greater at AIIMS than at SCARF during the first three months. Conclusions: Despite variations in cultural contexts and norms, it is possible to implement FEP standard assessment and management protocols in North and South India. Preliminary findings indicate that FEP services lead to significant improvements in psychopathology, functioning, quality of life, and family burden within these contexts.

AB  - Hyperspectral quantitative phase microscopy (HS-QPM) involves the acquisition of phase images across narrow spectral bands, which enables wavelength-dependent study of different biological samples. In the present work, a compact Linnik-type HS-QPM system is developed to reduce the instability and complexity associated with conventional HS-QPM techniques. The use of a single objective lens for both reference and sample arms makes the setup compact. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated by evaluating the HS phase map of both industrial and biological specimens. Phase maps of exfoliated cheek cells at different wavelengths are stacked to form a HS phase cube, adding spectral dimensionality to spatial phase distribution. Analysis of wavelength response of different cellular components are performed using principal component analysis to identify dominant spectral features present in the HS phase dataset. Findings of the study emphasize on the efficiency and effectiveness of HS-QPM for advancing cellular characterization in biomedical research and clinical applications.
   The challenges posed by using of two nonidentical microscope objective (MO) in two arms of a Linnik type interferometer are resolved by using a single MO based compact Linnik interferometer. Hyperspectral quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) is performed using the developed setup, which enables advanced classification of different cellular components. image

AB  - Purpose To non-invasively quantify pancreatic fibrosis and grade severity of chronic pancreatitis (CP) on dual-energy CT (DECT) and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Methods We included 72 patients (mean age:30years; 59 men) with suspected or confirmed CP from December 2019 to December 2021 graded as equivocal(n = 20), mild(n = 18), and moderate-marked(n = 34) using composite imaging and endoscopic ultrasound criteria. Study patients underwent multiphasic DECT and mpMRI of the abdomen. Normalized iodine concentration(NIC) and fat fraction(FF) on 6-minute delayed DECT, and T1 relaxation time(T1Rt), extracellular volume fraction(ECVf), intravoxel incoherent motion-based perfusion fraction(PF), and magnetization transfer ratio(MTR) on mpMRI of pancreas were compared. 20 renal donors(for DECT) and 20 patients with renal mass(for mpMRI) served as controls. Results NIC of pancreas in controls and progressive grades of CP were 0.24 +/- 0.05, 0.80 +/- 0.18, 1.06 +/- 0.23, 1.40 +/- 0.36, FF were 9.28 +/- 5.89, 14.19 +/- 5.29, 17.31 +/- 5.99, 29.32 +/- 12.22, T1Rt were 590.11 +/- 61.13, 801.93 +/- 211.01, 1006.79 +/- 352.18, 1388.01 +/- 312.23ms, ECVf were 0.07 +/- 0.03, 0.30 +/- 0.12, 0.41 +/- 0.12, 0.53 +/- 0.13, PF were 0.38 +/- 0.04, 0.28 +/- 0.07, 0.25 +/- 0.09, 0.21 +/- 0.05 and MTR were 0.12 +/- 0.03, 0.15 +/- 0.06, 0.21 +/- 0.07, 0.26 +/- 0.06, respectively. There were significant differences for all quantitative parameters between controls and mild CP; for NIC, PF, and ECVf between controls and progressive CP grades (p < 0.05). Area under curve for NIC, FF, T1Rt, ECVf, PF, and MTR in differentiating controls and mild CP were 1.00, 0.86, 0.95, 1.00, 0.90 and 0.84 respectively and for NIC, FF, ECVf and PF in differentiating controls and equivocal CP were 1.00, 0.76, 0.95 and 0.92 respectively. Conclusion DECT and mpMRI were useful in quantifying pancreatic fibrosis and grading the severity of CP. NIC was the most accurate marker.

AB  - HOXA9 transcription factor is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and is involved in the regulation of their differentiation and maturation to various blood cells. HOXA9 is linked to various leukemia and is a marker for poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This protein has a conserved DNA-binding homeodomain and a transactivation domain. We show that this N-terminal transactivation domain is intrinsically disordered and inhibits DNA-binding by the homeodomain. Using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation, we show that the hexapeptide 197AANWLH202 in the disordered region transiently occludes the DNA-binding interface. The hexapeptide also forms a rigid segment, as determined by NMR dynamics, in an otherwise flexible disordered region. Interestingly, this hexapeptide is known to mediate the interaction of HOXA9 and its TALE partner proteins, such as PBX1, and help in cooperative DNA binding. Mutation of tryptophan to alanine in the hexapeptide abrogates the DNA-binding auto-inhibition. We propose that the disordered transactivation region plays a dual role in the regulation of HOXA9 function. In the absence of TALE partners, it inhibits DNA binding, and in the presence of TALE partners it interacts with the TALE protein and facilitates the cooperative DNA binding by the HOX-TALE complex.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by A beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Chronic inflammation and synaptic dysfunction lead to disease progression and cognitive decline. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are implicated in AD progression by facilitating the spread of pathological proteins and inflammatory cytokines. This study investigates synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation protein markers in plasma-derived sEVs (PsEVs), their association with Amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, and their correlation with AD progression. Methods A total of 90 [AD = 35, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) = 25, and healthy age-matched controls (AMC) = 30] participants were recruited. PsEVs were isolated using a chemical precipitation method, and their morphology was characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Using nanoparticle tracking analysis, the size and concentration of PsEVs were determined. Antibody-based validation of PsEVs was done using CD63, CD81, TSG101, and L1CAM antibodies. Synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation were evaluated with synaptophysin, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and GFAP antibodies. AD-specific markers, amyloid-beta (1-42), and p-Tau were examined within PsEVs using Western blot and ELISA. Results Our findings reveal higher concentrations of PsEVs in AD and MCI compared to AMC (p < 0.0001). Amyloid-beta (1-42) expression within PsEVs is significantly elevated in MCI and AD compared to AMC. We could also differentiate between the amyloid-beta (1-42) expression in AD and MCI. Similarly, PsEVs-derived p-Tau exhibited elevated expression in MCI compared with AMC, which is further increased in AD. Synaptophysin exhibited downregulated expression in PsEVs from MCI to AD (p = 0.047) compared to AMC, whereas IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and GFAP showed increased expression in MCI and AD compared to AMC. The correlation between the neuropsychological tests and PsEVs-derived proteins (which included markers for synaptic integrity, neuroinflammation, and disease pathology) was also performed in our study. The increased number of PsEVs correlates with disease pathological markers, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Conclusions Elevated PsEVs, upregulated amyloid-beta (1-42), and p-Tau expression show high diagnostic accuracy in AD. The downregulated synaptophysin expression and upregulated neuroinflammatory markers in AD and MCI patients suggest potential synaptic degeneration and neuroinflammation. These findings support the potential of PsEV-associated biomarkers for AD diagnosis and highlight synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation in disease progression.

TI  - MolDy: molecular dynamics simulation made easy
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Motivation Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational experiment that is crucial for understanding the structure of biological macro and micro molecules, their folding, and the inter-molecular interactions. Accurate knowledge of these structural features is the cornerstone in drug development and elucidating macromolecules functions. The open-source GROMACS biomolecular MD simulation program is recognized as a reliable and frequently used simulation program for its precision. However, the user requires expertise, and scripting skills to carrying out MD simulations.Results We have developed an end-to-end interactive MD simulation application, MolDy for Gromacs. This front-end application provides a customizable user interface integrated with the Python and Perl-based logical backend connecting the Linux shell and Gromacs software. The tool performs analysis and provides the user with simulation trajectories and graphical representations of relevant biophysical parameters. The advantages of MolDy are (i) user-friendly, does not requiring the researcher to have prior knowledge of Linux; (ii) easy installation by a single command; (iii) freely available for academic research; (iv) can run with minimum configuration of operating systems; (v) has valid default prefilled parameters for beginners, and at the same time provides scope for modifications for expert users.Availability and implementation MolDy is available freely as compressed source code files with user manual for installation and operation on GitHub: https://github.com/AIBResearchMolDy/Moldyv01.git and on https://aibresearch.com/innovations.

AB  - Early childhood is foundational for optimal and inclusive lifelong learning, health and well-being. Young children with disabilities face substantial risks of sub-optimal early childhood development (ECD), requiring targeted support to ensure equitable access to lifelong learning opportunities, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Although the Sustainable Development Goals, 2015-2030 (SDGs) emphasise inclusive education for children under 5 years with disabilities, there is no global strategy for achieving this goal since the launch of the SDGs. This paper explores a global ECD framework for children with disabilities based on a review of national ECD programmes from different world regions and relevant global ECD reports published since 2015. Available evidence suggests that any ECD strategy for young children with disabilities should consists of a twin-track approach, strong legislative support, guidelines for early intervention, family involvement, designated coordinating agencies, performance indicators, workforce recruitment and training, as well as explicit funding mechanisms and monitoring systems. This approach reinforces parental rights and liberty to choose appropriate support pathway for their children. We conclude that without a global disability-focussed ECD strategy that incorporates these key features under a dedicated global leadership, the SDGs vision and commitment for the world's children with disabilities are unlikely to be realised.

AB  - The study aims to develop a novel methodology to demonstrate the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and nystagmus by caloric stimulation in an undergraduate medical physiology laboratory. The experimental setup involved two sets of electrodes: one set positioned laterally to both eyes, and another set positioned vertically over either the right or left eye. The caloric method is used to stimulate ears, which involves irrigation of warm (44 degrees C) and cold (30 degrees C) water into the ears while maintaining a temperature difference of approximately +/- 7 degrees C from the body temperature. The changes in chorioretinal potential were calibrated to angular displacement by a two-point calibration method, and angular velocity was derived after taking the first-time derivative. The results obtained from the digital data acquisition system were compared to the traditional instrument used in our Otorhinolaryngology Department [Interacoustics Videonystagmography (VNG) System for hospitals, medical grade] for the normal subject's data. No significant differences in angular velocity were noted (P > 0.05). The cold stimuli elicit a more pronounced VOR compared to the warm stimuli. It has been consistently observed that the onset of nystagmus occurs approximately 20 s after irrigation, reaching its peak intensity between 45 and 90 s, and gradually diminishing until it ceases after approximately 200 s. Our developed methodology enables the recording and quantification of nystagmus using easily accessible equipment. This study serves the goal of visualizing the physiological process of VOR and thereby fulfills the goal of an effective teaching tool for demonstrating to undergraduate medical students.

AB  - Cardiac channelopathies are a group of heritable disorders that affect the heart's electrical activity due to genetic variations present in genes coding for ion channels. With the advent of new sequencing technologies, molecular diagnosis of these disorders in patients has paved the way for early identification, therapeutic management and family screening. The objective of this retrospective study was to understand the efficacy of whole-genome sequencing in diagnosing patients with suspected cardiac channelopathies who were reported negative after whole exome sequencing and analysis. We employed a 3-tier analysis approach to identify nonsynonymous variations and loss-of-function variations missed by exome sequencing, and structural variations that are better resolved only by sequencing whole genomes. By performing whole genome sequencing and analyzing 25 exome-negative cardiac channelopathy patients, we identified 3 pathogenic variations. These include a heterozygous likely pathogenic nonsynonymous variation, CACNA1C:NM_000719:exon19:c.C2570G:p. P857R, which causes autosomal dominant long QT syndrome in the absence of Timothy syndrome, a heterozygous loss-of-function variation CASQ2:NM_001232.4:c.420+2T>C classified as pathogenic, and a 9.2 kb structural variation that spans exon 2 of the KCNQ1 gene, which is likely to cause Jervell-Lange-Nielssen syndrome. In addition, we also identified a loss-of-function variation and 16 structural variations of unknown significance (VUS). Further studies are required to elucidate the role of these identified VUS in gene regulation and decipher the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of these disorders. Our present study serves as a pilot for understanding the utility of WGS over clinical exomes in diagnosing cardiac channelopathy disorders.

AB  - Professional society and expert guidelines recommend the achievement of glycaemic, blood pressure, and cholesterol targets to prevent the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. The WHO Diabetes Compact recommends that countries meet and monitor these targets for diabetes management. Surveillance-ie, continuous, systematic measurement, analysis, and interpretation of data-is a crucial component of public health. In this Personal View, we use the case of India as an illustration of the challenges and future directions needed for a diabetes surveillance system that documents national progress and persistent gaps. To address the growing burdens of diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases, the Government of India has launched programmes such as the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non -Communicable Diseases. Different surveys have provided estimates of the diabetes care continuum of awareness, treatment, and control at the national, state, and, very recently, district level. We reviewed the literature to analyse how these surveys have varied in both their data collection methods and the reported estimates of the diabetes care continuum. We propose an integrated surveillance and monitoring framework to augment decentralised decision making, leveraging the complementary strengths of different surveys and electronic health record databases, such as data obtained by the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases, and building on methodological advances in model-based small-area estimation and data fusion. Such a framework could aid state and district administrators in monitoring the progress of diabetes screening and management initiatives, and benchmarking against national and global standards in all countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 and its interactions with sociodemographic characteristics on cognitive measures in South Asians from the Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI-DAD). METHODS: Linear regression was used to assess the association between APOE epsilon 4 and global- and domain-specific cognitive function in 2563 participants (mean age 69.6 +/- 7.3 years; 53% female). Effect modification by age, sex, and education were explored using interaction terms and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: APOE epsilon 4 was inversely associated with most cognitive measures (p < 0.05). This association was stronger with advancing age for the Hindi Mental State Examination (HMSE) score (beta(epsilon 4xage) = -0.44, p = 0.03), orientation (beta(epsilon 4xage) = -0.07, p = 0.01), and language/fluency (beta(epsilon 4xage) = -0.07, p = 0.01), as well as in females for memory (beta(epsilon 4xmale) = 0.17, p = 0.02) and language/fluency (beta(epsilon 4xmale) = 0.12, p = 0.03). DISCUSSION: APOE epsilon 4 is associated with lower cognitive function in South Asians from India, with a more pronounced impact observed in females and older individuals. Highlights APOE epsilon 4 carriers had lower global and domain-specific cognitive performance. Females and older individuals may be more susceptible to epsilon 4 effects. For most cognitive measures, there was no interaction between epsilon 4 and education.

AB  - An automated scoring system for cleanliness assessment during video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is presently lacking. The present study focused on developing an approach to automatically assess the cleanliness in VCE frames as per the latest scoring i.e., Korea-Canada (KODA). Initially, an easy-to-use mobile application called artificial intelligence-KODA (AI-KODA) score was developed to collect a multi-label image dataset of twenty-eight patient capsule videos. Three readers (gastroenterology fellows), who had been trained in reading VCE, rated this dataset in a duplicate manner. The labels were saved automatically in real-time. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were checked. The developed dataset was then randomly split into train:validate:test ratio of 70:20:10 and 60:20:20. It was followed by a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation of three multi-label classification tasks using ten machine learning and two deep learning algorithms. Reliability estimation was found to be overall good among the three readers. Overall, random forest classifier achieved the best evaluation metrics, followed by Adaboost, KNeighbours, and Gaussian naive bayes in the machine learning-based classification tasks. Deep learning algorithms outperformed the machine learning-based classification tasks for only VM labels. Thorough analysis indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to save time in cleanliness assessment and is user-friendly for research and clinical use. Further research is required for the improvement of intra-rater reliability of KODA, and the development of automated multi-task classification in this field.

AB  - Laser-driven micro/nano-texturing is a remarkably efficient and cost-effective technique, having diverse applicability in the realm of photonics, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics. Here, we demonstrate the high-intensity nanosecond laser-matter interactions for periodic micro/nanostructures on silicon, exclusively to emphasize the effects of laser parameters for large-scale integration. A wide range of periodic structure rapid fabrication over a wafer level is systematically studied for optimised parameters using nanosecond laser pulses (1064 nm, 50 ns) at different pulse repetition rates ranging from 10 to 40 kHz. A comprehensive understanding based on physical, structural, and optical studies reveals a strong correlation between the formation of nano/microstructure morphology and the laser parameters. The laser-matter interactions result in trench-like periodic patterns, formation of nanostructure agglomerations as light-trap-centres on the silicon surface. Such nano/micro periodic structures provide a dominant reduction in reflection losses of up to 80 % over a broad UV-NIR spectral region. The studies further demonstrate that the periodic structural patterns could also be potentially utilised for large-scale optical diffraction applications. In addition, the extra layer coating of Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) on the textured silicon further reduces the reflection losses, which is an added advantage of integrated silicon technology. The present work could open a commercial pathway for the rapid fabrication of nanosecond laser-based nanotexturing and periodic grating structures, enabling significantly reduced reflection and improved light trapping in large-scale Silicon-based applications due to its speed, repeatability, and high precision.

AB  - Sonomyography (SMG) is a noninvasive technique that uses ultrasound imaging to detect the dynamic activity of muscles. Wearable SMG systems have recently gained popularity due to their potential as human-computer interfaces for their superior performance compared with conventional methods. This article demonstrates real-time positional proportional control of multiple gestures using a multiplexed eight-channel wearable SMG system. The amplitude-mode ultrasound signals from the SMG system were utilized to detect muscle activity from the forearm of eight healthy individuals. The derived SMG signals were used to control the on-screen position of the cursor. A target achievement task was performed to analyze the performance of our SMG-based human-machine interface. Our wearable SMG system provided accurate, stable, and intuitive control in real time by achieving an average success rate greater than 80% with all gestures. Furthermore, the wearable SMG system's abilities to detect volitional movement and decode movement kinematic information from SMG trajectories using standard performance metrics were evaluated. Our results provide insights to validate SMG as an intuitive human-machine interface.

AB  - High-performance thermoplastic composites of polyketones [poly-aryl-ether-ketone (PAEK), poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), poly-ether-ketone-ketone (PEKK)] reinforced with continuous carbon fiber (CF) were consolidated using towpreg produced by multi-scale aqueous dispersion coating technique. An intra-matrix trend of composite strength and void fraction was studied to identify the composite with maximum strength free of voids for each polyketone matrix. The CF/PAEK composite with a flexural strength of similar to 2047 MPa and ILSS of similar to 99 MPa with a fiber volume fraction of similar to 67% had the maximum strength free of voids among CF/PAEK composite and all polyketone composites studied. The highest crystallinity (34.5%), and the highest amount of hydrogen bonding and bonds formed between CF, PI nanoparticle, and PAEK explained the origin of strength in CF/PAEK composite. The maximum strength among CF/PEEK and CF/PEKK composite free of voids had a flexural strength of similar to 1861 MPa, similar to 1981 MPa; ILSS of similar to 74 MPa, similar to 60 MPa; fiber volume fraction of similar to 61% and similar to 65%, respectively. The polyimide (PI) nanoparticles layer on CF formed the fiber matrix interface, supported hydrogen bonding in all polyketone composites, and formed bonds with CF and matrices of PAEK and PEEK establishing a synergistic effect.

AB  - Background: Maternal malnutrition affects the somatic growth of the fetus and subsequent adverse events during infancy and childhood period. Though trials have been conducted on multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplements initiated during the preconception period, there is no collated evidence on this. Materials and methods: We performed a systematic review of published trials with the application of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). The searches were conducted until 30 September 2023. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5 software. The primary objective was to compare the effect of preconception MMN vs. iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation on newborn anthropometric parameters at birth. Results: Of the 11,832 total citations retrieved, 12 studies with data from 11,391 participants [Intervention = 5,767; Control = 5,624] were included. For the primary outcome, there was no significant difference in the birth weight [MD, 35.61 (95% CI, -7.83 to 79.06), p = 0.11], birth length [MD, 0.19 (95% CI, -0.03 to 0.42), p = 0.09], and head circumference [MD, -0.25 (95% CI, -0.64 to -0.14), p = 0.22] between the MMN and control groups. For all the secondary outcomes [except for small for gestational age (SGA) and low birth weight (LBW)], the difference between the MMN and control groups was not significant. The GRADE evidence generated for all the outcomes varied from "very low to moderate certainty." Conclusion: A "very low certainty" of evidence suggests that MMN supplementation may not be better than routine IFA supplementation in improving newborn anthropometric parameters (weight, length, and head circumference). The adverse events resulting from the supplementation were not significant. We need better quality uniformly designed RCTs before any firm recommendation can be made.

AB  - Introduction: Current molecular research has shown the several oncogenic pathways that give rise to the peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise defined (PTCL, NOS) subtypes, which alter prognosis and might have predictive value. This study was conducted to assess the immunohistochemistry (IHC) algorithm by Amador et al for the subtyping of PTCL, NOS and determine its applicability in relation to the clinicopathological profile. Methods: This study included 43 patients with PTCL, NOS diagnosis. Following the use of IHC for the transcription factors GATA3, TBX21, CCR4, and CXCR3, two pathologists subtyped the samples. Comprehensive clinicopathological correlation was carried out. Results: Applying the algorithm of Amador et al., cases were classified into GATA3 (20), TBX21 (15), and unclassified (8) subtypes. No significant association with clinical parameters of subtypes or CD4/ CD8 positivity was observed. Although a higher proportion of cases in the TBX21 subgroup showed a polymorphic population compared with the GATA3 subgroup, which had a monomorphic population, no significant p-value (0.111) was observed. Two Lennert lymphomas were classified into the GATA3 subgroup. Multivariate analysis showed no significant difference in overall survival (p-value = 0.105) and progression-free survival (p-value = 0.0509) between IHC-defined subtypes; trends indicate that overall survival and progression-free survival are worse in the GATA3 subgroup. Conclusion: Although the algorithm is reproducible, a proportion of cases remains unclassifiable and may require additional investigation and gene expression profiling. The GATA3 subgroup was found to have a monomorphic population with a poor overall prognosis and thus requires a larger sample size for validation.

AB  - Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based brain morphometric changes in unilateral 6hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model can be elucidated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), study of alterations in gray matter volume and Machine Learning (ML) based analyses. Methods: We investigated gray matter atrophy in 6-OHDA induced PD model as compared to sham control using statistical and ML based analysis. VBM and atlas -based volumetric analysis was carried out at regional level. Support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithms wherein features (volume) extracted from (a) each of the 150 brain regions (b) statistically signi ficant features (only) and (c) volumes of each cluster identi fied after application of VBM (VBM_Vol) were used for training the decision model. The lesion of the 6-OHDA model was validated by estimating the net contralateral rotational behaviour by the injection of apomorphine drug and motor impairment was assessed by rotarod and open field test. Results and discussion: In PD, gray matter volume (GMV) atrophy was noted in bilateral cortical and subcortical brain regions, especially in the internal capsule, substantia nigra, midbrain, primary motor cortex and basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in comparison with sham control. Behavioural results revealed an impairment in motor performance. SVM analysis showed 100% classi fication accuracy, sensitivity and speci ficity at both 3 and 7 weeks using VBM_Vol. Conclusion: Unilateral 6-OHDA induced GMV changes in both hemispheres at 7th week may be associated with progression of the disease in the PD model. SVM based approaches provide an increased classi fication accuracy to elucidate GMV atrophy.

AB  - Protein stability is a fundamental prerequisite in both experimental and therapeutic applications. Current advancements in high throughput experimental techniques and functional ontology approaches have elucidated that impairment in the structure and stability of proteins is intricately associated with the cause and cure of several diseases. Therefore, it is paramount to deeply understand the physical and molecular confounding factors governing the stability of proteins. In this review article, we comprehensively investigated the evolution of protein stability, examining its emergence over time, its relationship with organizational aspects and the experimental methods used to understand it. Furthermore, we have also emphasized the role of Epigenetics and its interplay with post-translational modifications (PTMs) in regulating the stability of proteins.

AB  - BackgroundThoracic trauma frequently includes a pneumothorax, hemothorax, or hemopneumothorax, which may necessitate an Intercostal drainage (ICD) for air and fluid evacuation to improve breathing and circulatory function. It is a simple and life-saving procedure; nevertheless, it carries morbidity, even after its removal. Efforts have been made continuously to shorten the duration of ICD, but mostly in non-trauma patients. In this study, we evaluated the impact of negative pleural suction over the duration of ICD.MethodsThis study was a prospective randomized controlled interventional trial conducted at Level 1 Trauma Centre. Thoracic trauma patients with ICD, who met the inclusion criteria (sample size 70) were randomized into two groups, the first group with negative pleural suction up to -20 cm H2O, and the second group as conventional, i.e. ICD connected to underwater seal container only. The primary objective was to compare the duration of ICDs and the secondary objectives were the length of hospital stay and various complications of thoracic trauma.ResultsDuration of ICD was measured in median days with minimum & maximum days. For the negative suction group, it was 4 days (2-16 days); for the conventional group, it was also 4 days (2-17 days). There was also no significant difference among both groups in length of hospital stay.ConclusionThe beneficial effect of negative pleural suction to ICD could not be demonstrated over the duration of ICD and hospital stay. In both groups, there was no significant difference in complication rates like recurrent pneumothorax, retained hemothorax, persistent air leak, and empyema.Level of evidenceTherapeutic Study, Level IITrial registrationThis trial was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) with registration no.

AB  - Objective: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) plays a crucial role in embryo implantation and in maintenance of pregnancy. An immuno-contraceptive approach involves the use of a recombinant hCG beta-LTB vaccine formulated with adjuvant Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), to prevent pregnancy without disturbing ovulation, hormonal profiles, and menstrual cycles in women. The present work in mice was designed to address issues encountered in clinical trials conducted with hCG beta-LTB vaccine, with focus on two primary concerns. Firstly, it aimed to determine the optimal vaccine dosage required to induce a high level of anti-hCG antibodies. Secondly, it aimed to assess the safety profile of the vaccine, specifically injection site reactions in the form of nodules, observed in some of the subjects.Methods and Results: Studies undertaken indicate that a 2 mu g dose of the protein version of the vaccine, administered in mice through the intramuscular route, can induce high anti-hCG titres. Furthermore, administering a booster dose enhances the antibody response. Our findings suggest that the concentration and frequency of administration of the adjuvant MIP can also be reduced without compromising vaccine efficacy.Conclusion: The issue of nodule formation at the injection site can be mitigated either by administering the vaccine along with MIP intramuscularly or injecting hCG vaccine and MIP at separate intradermal sites. Thus, protein vaccine administered at a 2 mu g dose via the intramuscular route addresses both efficacy and safety concerns.
   The Phase I/II clinical trials initiated with the recombinant hCG vaccine in women revealed inadequate antibody titres in all subjects, alongside the development of nodules at the injection sites in some participants. Studies were undertaken in mice to propose potential strategies for mitigating injection site reactions and enhancing the antibody response. It was concluded that the optimum dose of the protein version of the vaccine to get high antibody titres, is 2 mu g administered intramuscularly while upholding safety standards.

AB  - Context: Noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) was introduced as a new entity replacing the diagnosis of noninvasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Significant variability in the incidence of NIFTP diagnosed in different world regions has been reported. Objective: To investigate the rate of adoption of NIFTP, change in practice patterns, and uniformity in applying diagnostic criteria among pathologists practicing in different regions. Methods: Two surveys distributed to pathologists of the International Endocrine Pathology Discussion Group with multiple-choice questions on NIFTP adoption into pathology practice and whole slide images of 5 tumors to collect information on nuclear score and diagnosis. Forty-eight endocrine pathologists, including 24 from North America, 8 from Europe, and 16 from Asia/Oceania completed the first survey and 38 the second survey. Results: A 94% adoption rate of NIFTP by the pathologists was found. Yet, the frequency of rendering NIFTP diagnosis was significantly higher in North America than in other regions (P = .009). While the highest concordance was found in diagnosing lesions with mildly or well-developed PTC-like nuclei, there was significant variability in nuclear scoring and diagnosing NIFTP for tumors with moderate nuclear changes (nuclear score 2) (case 2, P < .05). Pathologists practicing in North America and Europe showed a tendency for lower thresholds for PTC-like nuclei and NIFTP than those practicing in Asia/Oceania. Conclusion: Despite a high adoption rate of NIFTP across geographic regions, NIFTP is diagnosed more often by pathologists in North America. Significant differences remain in diagnosing intermediate PTC-like nuclei and respectively NIFTP, with more conservative nuclear scoring in Asia/Oceania, which may explain the geographic differences in NIFTP incidence.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an approaching, progressive public health crisis which presently lacks an effective treatment. Various non-invasive novel therapies like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation have shown potential to improve cognitive performance in AD patients. In the present study, the effect of extremely low intensity magnetic field (MF) stimulation on neurogenesis and cortical electrical activity was explored. Adult Wistar rats were divided into Sham, AD and AD + MF groups. Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected intracerebroventricularly, at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight for developing AD model. The AD rats were then exposed to MF (17.96 mu T) from 8th day of STZ treatment until 15th day, followed by cognitive assessments and electrocortical recording. In brain tissue samples, cresyl violet staining and BrdU immunohistochemistry were done. MF exposure, improved passive avoidance and recognition memory, attenuated neuronal degeneration and enhanced cell proliferation (BrdU positive cells) in comparison to AD rats. It also significantly restores delta wave power from frontal lobe. Our results suggest that early -stage MF exposure could be an asset for AD research and open new avenues in slowing down the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Stem cell plays an important role in the clinical field. However, the effective delivery of stem cells to the targeted site relies on the efficient homing of the cells to the site of injury. In view of that, fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles stick out due to their wide range of enabling functions including cellular homing and tracking. The present study unravels the synthesis of polymer-coated biocompatible and fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (FMNPs) by a single-step hydrothermal synthesis method. Importantly, the facile method developed the biological super nanoparticles consisting of the magnetic core, which is surrounded by the fluorescent nanodotdecorated polymeric shell. The synthesized particles showed an amorphous nature, and superparamagnetic properties, with efficient fluorescence properties of emission at the blue range (similar to 410 nm). The FMNP labeling showed the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) homing to the desired site in the presence of an external magnetic field. The in-house synthesized nanoparticles showed significant cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility in vitro as well as in vivo conditions owing to their surface coating. This unprecedented work advances the efficient internalization of FMNPs in MSCs and their enhanced migration potential provides a breakthrough in stem cell delivery for therapeutic applications.
   Statement of significance: The bi-modal fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles hold a promising role in the biomedical field for mesenchymal stem cell homing and tracking. Hence, in this study, for the first time, we have synthesized the fluorescent magnetic nanoparticle with polymer coating via an easy single-step method. The nanoparticle with a polymer coat enhanced the biocompatibility and effortless internalization of the nanoparticle into mesenchymal stem cells without hampering the native stem cell properties. Furthermore, the enhanced migration potential of such magnetized stem cells and their homing at the target site by applying an external magnetic field opened up avenues for the smart delivery of mesenchymal stem cells at complex sites such as retina for the tissue regeneration.

AB  - Celiac disease is one of the most common life-long disorders worldwide, with a prevalence mostly ranging between 0.7% and 2.9% in the general population and a higher frequency in females and well-de fi ned at -risk groups, such as relatives of affected individuals and patients with autoimmune comorbidities. Increasing clinical detection is facilitated by improving awareness, implementation of a case - fi nding approach, and serology availability for screening at -risk patients, among other factors. Nevertheless, due to huge clinical variability, many celiac disease cases still escape diagnosis in most countries, unless actively searched by proactive policies. The burden of celiac disease is increasing, as is the need for better longitudinal care. Pediatric screening of the general population could represent the road ahead for an ef fi cient intervention of secondary prevention aimed to reduce the social and health burden of celiac disease. This review analyses the epidemiology of celiac disease continent by continent, discusses current strategies to improve the detection of celiac disease, and highlights challenges related to the burden of celiac disease globally.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is a highly contagious respiratory disease with widespread societal impact. The symptoms range from cough, fever, and pneumonia to complications affecting various organs, including the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. Despite various ongoing efforts, no effective drug has been developed to stop the spread of the virus. Although various types of medications used to treat bacterial and viral diseases have previously been employed to treat COVID-19 patients, their side effects have also been observed. The way SARS-CoV-2 infects the human body is very specific, as its spike protein plays an important role. The S subunit of virus spike protein cleaved by human proteases, such as furin protein, is an initial and important step for its internalization into a human host. Keeping this context, we attempted to inhibit the furin using phytochemicals that could produce minimal side effects. For this, we screened 408 natural phytochemicals from various plants having antiviral properties, against furin protein, and molecular docking and dynamics simulations were performed. Based on the binding score, the top three compounds (robustaflavone, withanolide, and amentoflavone) were selected for further validation. MM/GBSA energy calculations revealed that withanolide has the lowest binding energy of -57.2 kcal/mol followed by robustaflavone and amentoflavone with a binding energy of -45.2 kcal/mol and -39.68 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, ADME analysis showed drug-like properties for these three lead compounds. Hence, these natural compounds robustaflavone, withanolide, and amentoflavone, may have therapeutic potential for the management of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting furin.

AB  - IntroductionA significant proportion of breast cancer cases are hereditary and are potentially preventable. However, adoption of the preventive measures remains a significant challenge, particularly because of to lack of knowledge and awareness in low- to middle-income countries.MethodsThis prospective study conducted at a high-volume tertiary care cancer center in North India to assess the knowledge, awareness, and attitudes of female breast cancer patients and impact of a brief educational intervention. The study involved three phases: pre-interventional assessment, educational intervention, and post-interventional assessment utilizing a structured questionnaire.ResultsThe study involved 300 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients; 16.7% were familial. At the outset, 87.0% patients had low knowledge of risk factors, 90.3% about screening, and 32.7% about treatment. Awareness levels were low: 13.7% aware of familial risk and 2.7% of breast cancer genes. Affordability of genetic testing was low (15.2%), and interest in testing for self and family members was limited (32.0% and 26.3%). Following educational intervention, a significant positive percentage change was noticed in knowledge (risk factors: 12.8%, screening: 36.2%, treatment: 82%), awareness (familial risk: 66.7%, BRCA gene: 12.3%), and attitude (testing for self: 17.8%, family: 19.5%).ConclusionsThis study highlights the significant knowledge gaps among breast cancer patients regarding genetics. The educational intervention led to notable improvements in knowledge, awareness, and attitudes, underscoring the importance of tailored patient education in breast cancer care.

AB  - Recent studies have shed light on disrupted collagen signaling in Gliomas, yet the regulatory landscape remains largely unexplored. This study enquired into the role of polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 modification, a key epigenetic factor in glioma. Using in-house data, we identified miRNAs downregulated in glioblastoma (GBM) with the potential to regulate Collagen VI family genes. Notably, miR-3189 emerged as a prime PRC2 target. Its expression was significantly downregulated in Indian GBM patients as well as other glioma cohorts. Mechanistic insights, involving Luciferase assays, mutagenesis, and Western blot analysis, confirmed direct targeting of Collagen VI member COL6A2 by miR-3189-3p. Functional assays demonstrated that miR-3189-3p restrained GBM malignancy by inhibiting proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conversely, COL6A2 overexpressed in GBM patients, countered miR-3189, and promoted the malignant phenotype. Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted EMT enrichment in GBM patients with elevated COL6A2 expression, carrying prognostic implications. This study uncovers intricate interactions between two epigenetic regulators-H3K27me3 and miR-3189-working synergistically to modulate Collagen VI gene; thus, influencing the malignancy of GBM. Targeting this H3K27me3|miR-3189-3p|COL6A2 axis presents a potential therapeutic avenue against GBM.
   This study unveils the epigenetic control of miR-3189 via the PRC2 complex. miR-3189 targets Collagen VI family member COL6A2 and regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process of glioblastoma (GBM). Collectively, the PRC2/miR-3189/COL6A2 axis presents potential therapeutic and prognostic implications in GBM. image

AB  - Informed by the almost unimaginable unmet need for cardiac surgery in the developing regions of the world, leading surgeons, cardiologists, editors in chief of the major cardiothoracic journals as well as representatives of medical industry and government convened in December 2017 to address this unacceptable disparity in access to care. The ensuing "Cape Town Declaration" constituted a clarion call to cardiac surgical societies to jointly advocate the strengthening of sustainable, local cardiac surgical capacity in the developing world. The Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance (CSIA) was thus created, comprising The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery (ASCVTS), the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the World Heart Federation (WHF). The guiding principle was advocacy for sustainable cardiac surgical capacity in low-income countries. As a first step, a global needs assessment confirmed rheumatic heart disease as the overwhelming pathology requiring cardiac surgery in these regions. Subsequently, CSIA published a request for proposals to support fledgling programmes that could demonstrate the backing by their governments and health care institution. Out of 11 applicants, and following an evaluation of the sites, including site visits to the 3 finalists, Mozambique and Rwanda were selected as the first Pilot Sites. Subsequently, a mentorship and training agreement was completed between Mozambique and the University of Cape Town, a middle-income country with a comparable burden of rheumatic heart disease. The agreement entails regular video calls between the heart teams, targeted training across all aspects of cardiac surgery, as well as on-site presence of mentoring teams for complex cases with the strict observance of 'assisting only'. In Rwanda, Team Heart, a US and Rwanda-based non-governmental organization (NGO) that has been performing cardiac surgery in Rwanda and helping to train the cardiac surgery workforce since 2008, has agreed to continue providing mentorship for the local team and to assist in the establishment of independent cardiac surgery with all that entails. This involves intermittent virtual conferences between Rwandan and US cardiologists for surgical case selection. Five years after CSIA was founded, its 'Seal of Approval' for the sustainability of endorsed programmes in Mozambique and Rwanda has resulted in higher case numbers, a stronger government commitment, significant upgrades of infrastructure, the nurturing of generous consumable donations by industry and the commencement of negotiations with global donors for major grants. Extending the CSIA Seal to additional deserving programmes could further align the international cardiac surgical community with the principle of local cardiac surgery capacity-building in developing countries.
   Large parts of the world have still no access to life-saving heart surgery [1-5].

AB  - The aim of this perspective is to promote the theory of salutogenesis as a novel approach to addressing ophthalmologic inflammatory conditions, illustrating several concepts in which it is based upon and how they can be applied to medical practice. This theory can better contextualize why patients with similar demographics and exposures are not uniform in their clinical presentations. Stressors in daily life can contribute to a state of ill-health and there are various factors that help alleviate their negative impact. These alleviating factors are significantly impaired in people with poor vision, one of the most common presentations of ophthalmologic conditions. Salutogenic principles can guide the treatment of eye conditions to be more respectful of patient autonomy amidst shifting expectations of the doctor-patient relationship. Being able to take ownership of their health and feeling that their cultural beliefs were considered improves compliance and subsequently gives more optimal outcomes. Population-level policy interventions could also utilize salutogenic principles to identify previously overlooked domains that can be addressed. We identified several papers about salutogenesis in an ophthalmological context and acknowledged the relatively few studies on this topic at present and offer directions in which we can explore further in subsequent studies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the role of thiol/disulfide homeostasis (TDH) parameters as an indicator of oxidative stress in acute appendicitis (AA). PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically searched. Studies reporting on TDH in AA (both complicated and uncomplicated cases) were included. The comparator group were healthy controls. The TDH domain was compared between the groups using anti-oxidant parameters, namely native thiol and total thiol levels, and native thiol/total thiol ratio; and oxidant parameters, namely disulfide level, disulfide/native thiol ratio, and disulfide/total thiol ratio. The statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Eleven studies with a total of 926 subjects, comprising 457 patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, 147 with complicated appendicitis, and 322 healthy controls were included. Our study demonstrated significantly increased oxidative stress in AA as compared to healthy controls in all TDH parameters and significantly lower total thiol levels in complicated AA as compared to uncomplicated AA. Due to a poor methodological quality in five out of eleven studies, future prospective studies with adequate power are essential to validate these observations and refine the diagnostic approaches to AA.

AB  - Background: Metformin (MET), by boosting immunity, has been suggested as a host-adjunctive therapy to antituberculosis treatment (ATT). Methods: We evaluated whether adding MET to the standard ATT can alter the host chemokine response. We investigated the influence of metformin on the plasma levels of a wide panel of chemokines in a group of active tuberculosis patients before treatment, at 2nd month of ATT and at 6-months of ATT as part of our clinical study to examine the effect of metformin on ATT. Results: Our results demonstrated that addition of metformin resulted in diminished CC (CCL1 and CCL3) and CXC (CXCL-2 and CXCL-10) chemokines in MET arm as compared to non-MET arm at the 2nd month and 6th month of ATT. In addition to this, MET arm showed significantly diminished chemokines in individuals with high bacterial burden and cavitary disease. Conclusion: Our current data suggest that metformin alters chemokines responses that could potentially curb excessive inflammation during ATT.

AB  - Yoga nidra (YN) practice aims to induce a deeply relaxed state akin to sleep while maintaining heightened awareness. Despite the growing interest in its clinical applications, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural correlates of the practice of YN remains largely unexplored. In this fMRI investigation, we aim to discover the differences between wakeful resting states and states attained during YN practice. The study included individuals experienced in meditation and/or yogic practices, referred to as 'meditators' (n = 30), and novice controls (n = 31). The GLM analysis, based on audio instructions, demonstrated activation related to auditory cues without concurrent default mode network (DMN) deactivation. DMN seed based functional connectivity (FC) analysis revealed significant reductions in connectivity among meditators during YN as compared to controls. We did not find differences between the two groups during the pre and post resting state scans. Moreover, when DMN-FC was compared between the YN state and resting state, meditators showed distinct decoupling, whereas controls showed increased DMN-FC. Finally, participants exhibit a remarkable correlation between reduced DMN connectivity during YN and self-reported hours of cumulative meditation and yoga practice. Together, these results suggest a unique neural modulation of the DMN in meditators during YN which results in being restful yet aware, aligned with their subjective experience of the practice. The study deepens our understanding of the neural mechanisms of YN, revealing distinct DMN connectivity decoupling in meditators and its relationship with meditation and yoga experience. These findings have interdisciplinary implications for neuroscience, psychology, and yogic disciplines.

AB  - Background Medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol can be provided up to 63 days' gestation in India. This accounts for 67.5 percent of all abortions in the country. We conducted an assessment to determine the availability of medical abortion medicines, specifically the combi-pack, in India.Methods We applied the World Health Organization landscape assessment protocol at the national level. The assessment protocol included a five-step adaptation of an existing availability framework, including online data collection, desk review, country-level key informant interviews, and an analysis to identify barriers and opportunities to improve medical abortion availability. The assessment was conducted between August and March 2021.Results Medicines for medical abortion are included in the national essential drug list and available with prescription in India. The assessment identified 42 combi-pack products developed by 35 manufacturers. The quality of medical abortion medicines is regulated by national authorities; but as health is devolved to states, there are significant inter-state variations. This is seen across financing, procurement, manufacturing, and monitoring mechanisms for quality assurance of medical abortion medicines prior to distribution. There is a need to strengthen supply chain systems, ensure consistent availability of trained providers and build community awareness on use of medical abortion medicines for early abortions, at the time of the assessment.Conclusion Opportunities to improve availability and quality of medical abortion medicines exist. For example, uniform implementation of regulatory standards, greater emphasis on quality-assurance during manufacturing, and standardizing of procurement and supply chain systems across states. Regular in-service training of providers on medical abortion is required. Finally, innovations in evidence dissemination and community engagement about the recently amended abortion law are needed.
   Medical abortion is popular in India and benefits from a liberal legal context. It is important to understand the availability of quality abortion medicines in the country. Using the World Health Organization country assessment protocol and availability framework for medical abortion medicines we examined the availability of these medicines from supply to demand. We used this information to identify opportunities for increasing availability of quality-assured medical abortion medicines. We found that the context for medical abortion varies across states. Strengthening procurement and supply chain management, with a greater emphasis on quality-assurance and regulation of manufacturing should be instituted at the state-level. Training is also needed to increase provider knowledge of the latest national guidelines and laws to ensure respectful and person-centered services. Finally, the public should be informed about medical abortion as a safe and effective choice, especially for early abortions.

AB  - Esophageal cancer (EC) is significantly influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME) and altered signaling pathways. Downregulating these pathways in EC is essential for suppressing tumor development, preventing metastasis, and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This approach can increase tumor sensitivity to treatments, enhance patient outcomes, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation and spread. The TME, comprising cellular and non-cellular elements surrounding the tumor, significantly influences EC's development, course, and treatment responsiveness. Understanding the complex relationships within the TME is crucial for developing successful EC treatments. Immunotherapy is a vital TME treatment for EC. However, the heterogeneity within the TME limits the application of anticancer drugs outside clinical settings. Therefore, identifying reliable microenvironmental biomarkers that can detect therapeutic responses before initiating therapy is crucial. Combining approaches focusing on EC signaling pathways with TME can enhance treatment outcomes. This integrated strategy aims to interfere with essential signaling pathways promoting cancer spread while disrupting factors encouraging tumor development. Unraveling aberrant signaling pathways and TME components can lead to more focused and efficient treatment approaches, identifying specific cellular targets for treatments. Targeting the TME and signaling pathways may reduce metastasis risk by interfering with mechanisms facilitating cancer cell invasion and dissemination. In conclusion, this integrative strategy has significant potential for improving patient outcomes and advancing EC research and therapy. This review discusses the altered signaling pathways and TME in EC, focusing on potential future therapeutics.

AB  - IntroductionPatients living in high altitudes are often deprived of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to logistic reasons, economic, and social challenges in performing surgical procedures for management of knee pain. Surgical procedures in high-altitude dwellers have associated risk of deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). In patients undergoing these procedures at lower altitudes, return to high altitudes can cause high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). We share our experience of performing TKA in high-altitude dwellers by setting up a surgical camp at 11,000 feet.MethodsA retrospective assessment of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty at a camp set up at 11,000 feet between 2014 and 2020 was undertaken. Follow-up data of patients which included clinical assessment by the Knee Society Score (KSS) and complications like DVT, infection, residual deformity, etc. were included in the study. Radiographic evaluation to look for evidence of implant loosening was also inculcated.Results132 patients (202 knee joints in 50 male and 82 female patients) underwent TKA during annual camps. The average follow-up of patients was 60 months. Mean pre-operative KSS was 38, which was increased to 83 at 1-year follow-up post-surgery. There was no evidence of DVT or superficial or deep infection in any patient in the post-operative period.ConclusionWith this study, we want to highlight that total knee arthroplasty can be safely performed at high altitudes and remote areas with limited health facilities. We believe it is a safer and more convenient prospect for the residents of high-altitude regions.Level of evidenceIII.

AB  - Early prognostication of patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is critical for patient care. We aim to investigate protein biomarkers' role in prognosticating outcomes in ICH patients. We assessed 22 protein biomarkers using targeted proteomics in serum samples obtained from the ICH patient dataset (N = 150). We defined poor outcomes as modified Rankin scale score of 3-6. We incorporated clinical variables and protein biomarkers in regression models and random forest-based machine learning algorithms to predict poor outcomes and mortality. We report Odds Ratio (OR) or Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). We used five-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping for internal validation of prediction models. We included 149 patients for 90-day and 144 patients with ICH for 180-day outcome analyses. In multivariable logistic regression, UCH-L1 (adjusted OR 9.23; 95%CI 2.41-35.33), alpha-2-macroglobulin (aOR 5.57; 95%CI 1.26-24.59), and Serpin-A11 (aOR 9.33; 95%CI 1.09-79.94) were independent predictors of 90-day poor outcome; MMP-2 (aOR 6.32; 95%CI 1.82-21.90) was independent predictor of 180-day poor outcome. In multivariable Cox regression models, IGFBP-3 (aHR 2.08; 95%CI 1.24-3.48) predicted 90-day and MMP-9 (aOR 1.98; 95%CI 1.19-3.32) predicted 180-day mortality. Machine learning identified additional predictors, including haptoglobin for poor outcomes and UCH-L1, APO-C1, and MMP-2 for mortality prediction. Overall, random forest models outperformed regression models for predicting 180-day poor outcomes (AUC 0.89), and 90-day (AUC 0.81) and 180-day mortality (AUC 0.81). Serum biomarkers independently predicted short-term poor outcomes and mortality after ICH. Further research utilizing a multi-omics platform and temporal profiling is needed to explore additional biomarkers and refine predictive models for ICH prognosis.

KW  - VENTRICULAR-TACHYCARDIA
AB  - An electrical storm also known as a ventricular tachycardia storm (VT storm) tends to recur and form a vicious cycle, eventually leading to a refractory electrical storm, refractory to electrical and pharmacological cardioversion. The treatment of refractory VT storm is challenging. Here we discuss the case of a middle-aged gentleman who presented to our emergency department 6 months apart with a refractory VT storm. When all the anti -arrhythmic agents and multiple cardioversion attempts failed in terminating the storm, we attempted ultrasound -guided stellate ganglion block. On both occasions, it successfully terminated the storm. Hence emergency physicians need to be aware of the right technique and timing of stellate ganglion block and ultrasoundguided needle tracking, as it can be a final rescue technique in treating refractory electrical storm in the emergency department.

AB  - Background: Improving mental health literacy (MHL) can reduce stigma towards mental illness, decreasing delays in help-seeking for mental disorders such as psychosis. We aimed to develop and assess the impact of an interactive MHL intervention on stigma related mental health knowledge and behaviour (SRMHKB) among youth in two urban colleges in South India. Methods: Incorporating input from stakeholders (students, teachers, and mental health professionals), we developed a mental health literacy module to address SRMHKB. The module was delivered as an interactive session lasting 90 min. We recruited 600 (300 males; 300 females; mean age 19.6) participants from two city colleges in Chennai from Jan-Dec 2019 to test the MHL module. We assessed SRMHKB before the delivery of the MHL intervention, immediately after, and at 3 and 6 months after the intervention using the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS) and Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS). We used generalised estimating equations (GEE) to assess the impact of the intervention over time. Results: Compared to baseline, there was a statistically significant increase in stigma related knowledge and behaviour immediately after the intervention (coefficient=3.8; 95% CI: 3.5,4.1) and during the 3-month (coefficient=3.4; 95% CI: 3.0,3.7) and 6-month (coefficient=2.4; 95% CI: 2.0,2.7) follow-up. Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest that a single 90-minute MHL interactive session could lead to improvements in SRMHKB among youth in India. Future research might utilise randomised controlled trials to corroborate findings, and explore how improvements can be sustained over the longer-term.

AB  - Background Diabetes control is poor globally and leads to burdensome microvascular and macrovascular complications. We aimed to assess post hoc between-group differences in sustained risk factor control and macrovascular and microvascular endpoints at 6.5 years in the Center for cArdiovascular Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) randomized trial. Methods and findings This parallel group individual randomized clinical trial was performed at 10 outpatient diabetes clinics in India and Pakistan from January 2011 through September 2019. A total of 1,146 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >= 8% and systolic BP >= 140 mm Hg and/or LDL-cholesterol >= 130 mg/dl) were randomized to a multicomponent quality improvement (QI) strategy (trained nonphysician care coordinator to facilitate care for patients and clinical decision support system for physicians) or usual care. At 2.5 years, compared to usual care, those receiving the QI strategy were significantly more likely to achieve multiple risk factor control. Six clinics continued, while 4 clinics discontinued implementing the QI strategy for an additional 4-year follow-up (overall median 6.5 years follow-up). In this post hoc analysis, using intention-to-treat, we examined between-group differences in multiple risk factor control (HbA1c <7% plus systolic BP <130 mm Hg and/or LDL-cholesterol <100 mg/dl) and first macrovascular endpoints (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, death, revascularization [angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft]), which were coprimary outcomes. We also examined secondary outcomes, namely, single risk factor control, first microvascular endpoints (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy), and composite first macrovascular plus microvascular events (which also included amputation and all-cause mortality) by treatment group and whether QI strategy implementation was continued over 6.5 years. At 6.5 years, assessment data were available for 854 participants (74.5%; n = 417 [intervention]; n = 437 [usual care]). In terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, participants in the intervention and usual care groups were similar and participants at sites that continued were no different to participants at sites that discontinued intervention implementation. Patients in the intervention arm were more likely to exhibit sustained multiple risk factor control than usual care (relative risk: 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45, 2.20), p < 0.001. Cumulatively, there were 233 (40.5%) first microvascular and macrovascular events in intervention and 274 (48.0%) in usual care patients (absolute risk reduction: 7.5% [95% CI: -13.2, -1.7], p = 0.01; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.61, 0.86]), p < 0.001. Patients in the intervention arm experienced lower incidence of first microvascular endpoints (HR = 0.68 [95% CI: 0.56, 0.83), p < 0.001, but there was no evidence of between-group differences in first macrovascular events. Beneficial effects on microvascular and composite vascular outcomes were observed in sites that continued, but not sites that discontinued the intervention. Conclusions In urban South Asian clinics, a multicomponent QI strategy led to sustained multiple risk factor control and between-group differences in microvascular, but not macrovascular, endpoints. Between-group reductions in vascular outcomes at 6.5 years were observed only at sites that continued the QI intervention, suggesting that practice change needs to be maintained for better population health of people with diabetes.

AB  - Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. Despite of significant advances in combination therapy of chemotherapeutic drugs, its application in clinical settings is limited due to several limitations such as side effects and availability of drugs at therapeutic levels at target site. In order to overcome the limitations, we developed pro-drug-based pH-responsive alkylated dextran nanoparticles co-linked with doxorubicin (Dox) as a model drug along with RITA {2,5-bis([5-hydroxymethyl-2-thienyl]furan)} which induces tumor cell apoptosis. RITA loaded and Dox-conjugated dextran-based NPs were synthesized with series of chemical reactions and characterized for particle size, drug loading, release, etc. The nanoparticles (NPs) were found to be 131.7 +/- 20.6 nm in size with zeta potential of 15.1 +/- 2.13 mV. Dox conjugation efficiency and RITA entrapment efficiency was found to be 92 +/- 4.24 and 55.6 +/- 5.24%, respectively. The Dox and RITA loaded dextran NPs showed enhanced cancer cell killing properties when compared with free RITA, free Dox, and a combination of free RITA and Dox. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated faster release of drugs at the tumor pH (6.5-6.8) conditions owing to the cleavage of amide bond releasing Dox, responsible for antitumor properties of NPs. Cytotoxicity and clonogenic studies in cell lines of diverse origins demonstrated cell killing efficacy of NPs, attributed to the enhanced cellular uptake of NPs. Combination index values observed were < 1 suggesting that the growth inhibition effect of NPs was synergistic. Hence, this novel combination may offer a potential treatment for cancer therapy.

AB  - The evolutionarily conserved Wnt signaling has a significant and diverse role in maintaining cell homeostasis and tissue maintenance. It is necessary in the regulation of crucial biological functions such as embryonal development, proliferation, differentiation, cell fate, and stem cell pluripotency. The deregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling often leads to various diseases, including cancer and non-cancer diseases. The role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in adult tumors has been extensively studied in literature. Although the Wnt signaling pathway has been well explored and recognized to play a role in the initiation and progression of cancer, there is still a lack of understanding on how it affects pediatric tumors. This review discusses the recent developments of this signaling pathway in pediatric tumors. We also focus on understanding how different types of variations in Wnt signaling pathway contribute to cancer development and provide an insight of tissue specific mutations that lead to clinical progression of these tumors.

AB  - ObjectiveHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) have limited therapeutic options, Re-188 lipiodol transarterial therapy being one of them. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of Re-188 lipiodol exclusively in HCC with PVT as well as to compare two chelating agents for the synthesis of Re-188 lipiodol: novel bis-(diethyldithiocarbamato) nitrido (N-DEDC) with existing acetylated 4-hexadecyl 1-2,9,9-tetramethyl-4,7-diaza-1,10-decanethiol [(A)HDD].MethodsPatients with radiological diagnosis of HCC with PVT having Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <= 2 and Child Pugh score (PS) A or B were recruited. Patients received an empirical dose of transarterial Re-188 lipiodol, labelled with (A)HDD or N-DEDC. Radiological response on MRI (modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors), biochemical response with serum alpha fetoprotein and clinical response with ECOG PS was assessed at three months and survival was estimated at the end of the study.ResultsFifteen therapies were performed in 14 patients with a median age of 62 years (range: 41-70 years). Eight therapies were with Re-188 (A)HDD lipiodol and seven with Re-188 N-DEDC lipiodol. Overall mean injected dose was 2.6 +/- 0.37 GBq. Radiological objective response rate was 31% and disease control rate was 85%. Mean overall survival was 14.21 months and mean progression free survival was 10.23 months. Percentage survival assessed at 3, 6 and 9 months was 93%, 64% and 57%, respectively. Safety parameters, response and survival outcome were comparable for (A)HDD and N-DEDC groups.ConclusionTransarterial Re-188 lipiodol in HCC with PVT is safe and effective in disease control as well as improving survival outcome. Additionally, cost-effective and high-yielding novel agent N-DEDC appears to be a comparable alternative to (A)HDD for the same.

AB  - Introduction Tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, is a putative choice in the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA). The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of tofacitinib with adalimumab, in AxSpA, in a real-world clinical setting. Methods In this multicentric medical records review study, adult patients with active AxSpA treated with either tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously fortnightly were recruited. Effectiveness was measured with Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). Drug-cost analysis was calculated with Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICERdrug). Results Among the 266 patients, 135 were treated with tofacitinib and 131 with adalimumab (follow-up: 6.5 +/- 1.6 months). Mean improvement of BASDAI (3.39 +/- 0.09 vs. 3.14 +/- 1.16, respectively) and that of ASDAS (1.78 +/- 0.68 vs. 2.07 +/- 2.08, respectively) were comparable between the adalimumab and tofacitinib groups. A higher proportion of patients achieved BASDAI50 response in the second (49.5% vs. 31.6%) and fourth month (83.9% vs. 62.8%) and ASDAS low disease activity in the fourth month (71.6% vs. 47.9%) in the adalimumab group. All disease activity measurements were similar by the sixth month in both groups. A higher proportion of patients in the tofacitinib group than in the adalimumab group required change in therapy (14.8% vs. 7.6%, respectively). ICERdrug for adalimumab compared with tofacitinib was US $188.8 per patient in the adalimumab group for each person-month with BASDAI <4. ConclusionsTofacitinib showed comparable effectiveness with adalimumab in patients with AxSpA at the sixth month, despite lesser response in the initial months, with favorable ICERdrug.

AB  - Myricetin can be found in the traditional Chinese medicinal plant, Myrica rubra. Myricetin is a flavonoid that is present in many vegetables, fruits, and plants and is considered to have strong antioxidant properties as well as a wide range of therapeutic applications. Growing interest has been piqued by its classification as a polyphenolic molecule because of its potential therapeutic benefits in both the prevention and management of numerous medical conditions. To clarify myricetin's traditional medical uses, modern research has investigated various pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammation, antiviral, antidiabetic, immunomodulation, and antineurodegenerative effects. Myricetin shows promise as a nutritional flavonol that could be beneficial in the prevention and mitigation of prevalent health conditions like diabetes, cognitive decline, and various types of cancer in humans. The findings included in this study indicate that myricetin has a great deal of promise for application in the formulation of medicinal products and nutritional supplements since it affects several enzyme activities and alters inflammatory markers. However, comprehensive preclinical studies and research studies are necessary to lay the groundwork for assessing myricetin's possible effectiveness in treating these long-term ailments. This review summarizes both in vivo and in vitro studies investigating myricetin's possible interactions through the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as well as PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT (protein kinase B) signaling pathways in an attempt to clarify the compound's possible clinical applicability across a range of disorders.

AB  - ObjectivesTo report the outcomes of pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in single rooms without high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, laminar air flow or positive pressure at our centre and discuss the adaptations of a high-volume government centre.MethodsData of the first 20 children who underwent allogeneic HSCT between May 2019 and July 2023 in adaptive settings were reviewed retrospectively. All patients were managed in in single rooms without HEPA filters, positive pressure or laminar air flow. Supportive care in the form of antimicrobial prophylaxis, veno-occlusive disease prophylaxis, anti-epileptics (with busulfan) and irradiated blood products were provided. Trained manpower including multi-specialty consultations were readily available. All complications including infections were managed as per standard guidelines.ResultsThe median (range) of children included was 6 (1-20) years. For eight patients we used alternate donors. The mean (SD) time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 17.0 (8.07) days and 18.8 (10.1) days, respectively. The mean (SD) time to discharge from the hospital was 30.9 (10.04) days. There were no deaths within 30 days. Six children each developed acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The overall survival at a median follow-up of 292 days was 70% (n = 14).ConclusionsWith certain adaptations in the existing infrastructure in resource-limited settings, allogeneic HSCT can be performed with good outcomes, provided experienced, dedicated and adequate personnel, comprehensive supportive care, multidisciplinary consultative support and isolation are provided.

AB  - Purpose:Topical glaucoma medication is the first line of management to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma. In this study, we intended to compare the ultrastructural findings of the cornea in patients with glaucoma before and after the reduction of the IOP through confocal microscopy. Methods:Ten patients (19 eyes) with newly diagnosed glaucoma were recruited from the glaucoma services of our tertiary care center. Demographic parameters were noted, and basic ocular examination, specular microscopy (Topcon SP3000P, Tokyo, Japan), and ultrasonic pachymetry (300 AP, Sonomed Escalon, Stoneham, MA, USA) were performed. In vivo confocal microscopy of corneal sections was performed using the z-ring Confoscan 4.0 (Nidek, Inc., Freemont, CA) at baseline and after 3 months of starting glaucoma medications. Results:The mean age of the patients was 53.53 +/- 9.34 years. There was a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.0001) of IOP from 30.21 +/- 7.42 mmHg (baseline) to 16.42 +/- 4.14 mmHg (3 months). The mean central corneal thickness at baseline was 533.42 +/- 3.96 <mu>m, and it further decreased to 521.94 +/- 42.45 mu m at the end of 3 months (P = 0.006). No significant change was noted in the mean epithelial cell density, mean keratocyte density in anterior and posterior stroma, and the mean endothelial cell density and cell area (P >0.5). There was no significant percentage change in these parameters before and after the lowering of the IOP. Conclusion:A short-term (3 months) decrease in IOP using topical glaucoma medications caused a significant reduction in corneal thickness but did not have any significant ultrastructural changes in cornea measured using confocal microscopy.

AB  - Background: Existing literature lacks high-quality evidence regarding the ideal intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to minimize postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). We hypothesized that applying individualized PEEP derived from electrical impedance tomography (EIT) would reduce the severity of postoperative lung aeration loss, deterioration in oxygenation, and PPC incidence. Methods: A pilot feasibility study was conducted on 36 patients who underwent open abdominal oncologic surgery. The patients were randomized to receive individualized PEEP or conventional PEEP at 4 cm H2O. The primary outcome was the impact of individualized PEEP on changes in the modified lung ultrasound score (MLUS) derived from preoperative and postoperative lung ultrasonography. A higher MLUS indicated greater lung aeration loss. The secondary outcomes were the PaO2/FIO2 ratio and PPC incidence. Results: A significant increase in the postoperative MLUS (12 +/- 3.6 vs 7.9 +/- 2.1, P < 0.001) and a significant difference between the postoperative and preoperative MLUS values (7.0 +/- 3.3 vs 3.0 +/- 1.6, P < 0.001) were found in the conventional PEEP group, indicating increased lung aeration loss. In the conventional PEEP group, the intraoperative PaO2/FIO2 ratios were significantly lower but not the postoperative ratios. The PPC incidence was not significantly different between the groups. Post-hoc analysis showed the increase in lung aeration loss and deterioration of intraoperative oxygenation correlated with the deviation from the individualized PEEP. Conclusions: Individualized PEEP appears to protect against lung aeration loss and intraoperative oxygenation deterioration. The advantage was greater in patients whose individualized PEEP deviated more from the conventional PEEP.

AB  - Objectives: The study aimed to identify a quantitative signature of circulating small non -coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as a biomarker for pulmonary tuberculosis disease (active-TB/ATB) and explore their regulatory roles in hostpathogen interactions and disease progression. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study recruiting subjects diagnosed with active -TB (drug -sensitive and drug -resistant) and healthy controls. Sera samples were collected and utilized for preparing small RNA libraries. Quantitative patterns of circulating sncRNAs (miRNAs, piRNAs and tRFs) were identified via high -throughput sequencing and DeSeq2 analysis and validated in independent active -TB cohorts. Functional knockdown for two selected miRNAs were also performed. Results: A diagnostic signature of four sncRNAs for both drug -sensitive and drug -resistant active -TB cases was validated, exhibiting an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.937 - 0.996, p < 0.001) with 86.7% sensitivity (95% CI: 0.775 - 0.932) and 91.7% specificity (95% CI: 0.730 - 0.990) in ROC analysis. Functional knockdown demonstrated regulatory roles of hsa-miR-223-5p and hsa-miR-10b-5p in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth and pro -inflammatory cytokine expression (IL -6 and IL -8). Conclusion: The study identified a diagnostic tool utilizing a signature of four sncRNAs with high specificity and sensitivity, enhancing our understanding of sncRNAs as ATB diagnostic biomarker. Additionally, hsa-miR-223-5p and hsa-miR-10b-5p demonstrated potential roles in Mtb pathogenesis and host -response to infection.

AB  - Background:To evaluate the effect of metformin on the plasma levels of rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide in patients with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis being treated with first-line antituberculosis treatment (ATT) and to assess the influence of gene polymorphisms on the metabolic pathway of metformin and plasma levels of antitubercular drugs.Methods:Nondiabetic adults aged 18-60 years with pulmonary tuberculosis were randomized to either the standard ATT (ATT group) or ATT plus metformin (METRIF group) groups in a phase IIB clinical trial. An intensive pharmacokinetic study with blood collection at 0 hour (predosing), followed by 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after dosing was conducted during the first month of treatment in a subset of 60 study participants after a minimum of 14 doses. Plasma concentrations of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and metformin were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using validated methods, and pharmacokinetic parameters and OCT1 and MATE1 gene polymorphisms were compared between the groups.Results:Significant increases in the clearance of rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide were observed in patients in the METRIF group (n = 29) compared with those in the ATT group (n = 31). The AA genotypes of the single-nucleotide polymorphism of rs2289669 (MATE1) in the METRIF group showed a significantly decreased area under the concentration-time curve to the last observation point and increased clearance of rifampicin.Conclusions:Metformin altered rifampicin and isoniazid plasma concentrations in patients receiving antituberculosis treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis with little effect on sputum conversion at the end of treatment. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to understand host drug-drug interactions.

AB  - Background: Parallel panel germline and somatic genetic testing of all patients with ovarian cancer (OC) can identify more pathogenic variants (PVs) that would bene fit from PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapy, and allow for precision prevention in unaffected relatives with PVs. In this study, we estimate the cost-effectiveness and population impact of parallel panel germline and somatic BRCA testing of all patients with OC incorporating PARPi therapy in the United Kingdom and the United States compared with clinical criteria/family history (FH) -based germline BRCA testing. We also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of multigene panel germline testing alone. Methods: Microsimulation cost-effectiveness modeling using data from 2,391 (UK: n=1,483; US: n=908) unselected, population-based patients with OC was used to compare lifetime costs and effects of panel germline and somatic BRCA testing of all OC cases (with PARPi therapy) (strategy A) versus clinical criteria/ FH-based germline BRCA testing (strategy B). Unaffected relatives with germline BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1 PVs identi fied through cascade testing underwent appropriate OC and breast cancer (BC) risk-reduction interventions. We also compared the costeffectiveness of multigene panel germline testing alone (without PARPi therapy) versus strategy B. Unaffected relatives with PVs could undergo risk-reducing interventions. Lifetime horizon with payer/societal perspectives, along with probabilistic/one-way sensitivity analyses, are presented. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were compared with 30,000 pound/QALY (UK) and $100,000/QALY (US) thresholds. OC incidence, BC incidence, and prevented deaths were estimated. Results: Compared with clinical criteria/FH-based BRCA testing, BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1 germline testing and BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic testing of all patients with OC incorporating PARPi therapy had a UK ICER of 51,175 pound/QALY (payer perspective) and 50,202 pound/QALY (societal perspective) and a US ICER of $175,232/QALY (payer perspective) and $174,667/QALY (societal perspective), above UK/NICE and US cost-effectiveness thresholds in the base case. However, strategy A becomes cost-effective if PARPi costs decrease by 45% to 46% or if overall survival with PARPi reaches a hazard ratio of 0.28. Unselected panel germline testing alone (without PARPi therapy) is cost-effective, with payer-perspective ICERs of 11,291 pound/QALY or $68,808/QALY and societal-perspective ICERs of 6,923 pound/QALY or $65,786/QALY. One year 's testing could prevent 209 UK BC/OC cases and 192 deaths, and 560 US BC/OC cases and 460 deaths. Conclusions: Unselected panel germline and somatic BRCA testing can become cost-effective, with a 45% to 46% reduction in PARPi costs. Regarding germline testing, unselected panel germline testing is highly cost-effective and should replace BRCA testing alone.

AB  - Background & objectives: Reducing maternal anaemia and enhancing feto-maternal health to achieve desired birth outcomes is a major health concern in India. Micronutrient deficiencies during pregnancy may impact fetal growth and neonatal outcomes. There is increasing interest in using multiple micronutrient supplement (MMS) during pregnancy. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends use of MMS containing Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) in the context of "rigorous research". Against this backdrop, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-led MMS design expert group met over six months to review the evidence and decide on the formulation of an India-specific MMS supplement for pregnant mothers for potential use in a research setting. Methods: The India-MMS design expert group conducted a series of meetings to assess the available evidence regarding the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in pregnant women in India, the health benefits of supplementing with different micronutrients during pregnancy, as well as nutrient interactions within the MMS formulation. Based on these considerations, the expert group reached a consensus on the composition of the MMS tailored for pregnant women in India. Results: The India-specific MMS formulation includes five minerals and 10 vitamins, similar to the United Nations International Multiple Micronutrient Antenatal Preparation (UNIMMAP) composition. However, the quantities of all vitamins and minerals except Zinc, Vitamin E, and Vitamin B6 differ. Interpretation & conclusions: This report provides an overview of the process adopted, the evidence evaluated, and the conclusions from the expert working group meetings to finalize an MMS supplement in pregnancy for the Indian context to be used in a research setting.

AB  - Objective: To compare the proportion of exclusively breastfed (EBF) infants having severe vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D concentration <11 ng/mL) at 6 months of age when mothers were supplemented with 300,000 IU vitamin D3 or placebo during the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 100 pregnant women (who were willing to exclusively breastfeed their babies for 6 months) at 30-32 weeks gestation and the infants born to them. Pregnant women were randomized to receive either oral vitamin D3 60,000 IU or placebo, given weekly for 5 weeks during the third trimester. Serum 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase concentration were measured in all participants at recruitment, in the cord blood at delivery, and in infants at 6 months of age. The proportion of infants developing severe vitamin D deficiency and rickets at 6 months was assessed. Results: A total 72 mother-infant dyads were followed-up till 6 months. At enrollment, the mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D concentration (ng/mL) were comparable in mothers in the intervention and control groups [12.9 (5.8) vs 12.8 (5.9), P = 0.96]. The mean (SD) 25(OH)D concentration (ng/mL) in the cord blood was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group [42.1 (17.1) vs 12.7 (6.3); P = 0.002]. Serum 25(OH)D levels (ng/mL) in the infants at 6 months age were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group [31.8 (10.9) vs 12.5 (5.7); P < 0.001]. No infant in the intervention group had severe vitamin D deficiency at 6 months age compared to 54.3% infants in the control group (P < 0.001). No infant in the intervention group developed rickets. Conclusion: Oral supplementation of vitamin D3 to pregnant women in the third trimester prevents severe hypovitaminosis D in the EBF infants at 6 months of age.

AB  - Background & objectives: : Presence of resistant gut flora in the community is associated with increasing multi-drug resistance (MDR) infections. In this study, the prevalence of MDR organisms in the gut flora of a healthy rural population residing in northern India was determined. Methods: : Healthy individuals aged 18-45 yr from Nuh district, Haryana, India were included in this study. Risk factors associated with dysbiosis, diet, lifestyle and exposure to animals was assessed. Qualitative food frequency questionnaire and inflammatory diet score was calculated. Pathogens in stool sample were detected by MALDI-TOF. Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility was done by automated Vitek-2 System. The presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes was evaluated using PCR. An isolate having resistance to at least one antibiotic out of the three or more classes of antibiotics tested was labelled as MDR. Results: : Among 153 individuals included in this study (mean age-32.5 +/- 8.6 yr, females-58.2%, vegetarian-68.6%), the most frequent organism isolated was E. coli (n=137, 89.5%) followed by K. pneumoniae (n=19, 12.4%) and Enterobacter species (n=23, 15%). Forty seven (30.7%) individuals had sensitive and 42 (27.4%) had MDR organisms. Fifty one (33.3%) were positive for ESBL, 5 (3.3%) were positive for carbapenems, and 18 (11.8%) were positive for both genes. Age, gender, body mass index, diet pattern, or diet score were similar between participants with sensitive and resistant organisms. Resistance against fluoroquinolones was highest [92(48.7%)] among all isolates. Forty nine (25.9%), 25 (13.2%), 24 (12.7%) and 21 (11.1%) isolates, respectively were positive for bla TEM , bla SHV, bla CTXM-1 and OXA-48 48 genes. Interpretation & conclusions: : Overall the study findings suggest that 27 per cent individuals from rural northern India carry MDR organisms in their fecal flora, with an ESBL carriage rate of 44 per cent.

Such confusing and atypical cases usually produce a clinical dilemma and should be managed in a stepwise manner. Ancillary investigations usually provide a clue to the clinician and should be performed without any hesitation.

AB  - Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19), called as long COVID syndrome, is a major global public health issue after recovery from COVID-19. The disease occurs in symptomatic patients irrespective of illness severity. The symptoms continue after four wk of recovery from acute illness and persist beyond three months. Risk factors for long COVID include older age, female gender, multiple co-morbidities including diabetes mellitus, prior chronic respiratory illnesses, hospitalized patients with severe disease, especially receiving assisted ventilation, high viral load, reactivation of Epstein Barr (EB) virus and human herpes virus 6 (HH6), circulating auto antibodies against various organs and type I interferon. The prevalence varies from 10 to 20 per cent, and most data have been reported from high-income countries. Any system can get involved in long COVID. The symptoms include fatigue, cognition impairment, cough and dyspnoea, anosmia, hair loss and diarrhoea, among others. While there are no laboratory tests for confirmation of diagnosis, reduced complement C7 complexes at six months, and a two-gene biomarker including FYN and SARS-CoV-2 antisense ribonucleic acid (RNA) are emerging as potentially useful biomarkers for long COVID. There should be no alternative disease to explain various symptoms. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and early use of oral antiviral nirmatrelvir within the first five days in patients with acute mild disease having various risk factors for progression to severe disease help in preventing long COVID. Several clinical trials are underway for the treatment of long COVID and the results of these are eagerly awaited. Physical and mental rehabilitation at home, at community level or in the hospital setting as appropriate is essential in patients with long COVID.

AB  - Introduction Early childhood development forms the foundations for functioning later in life. Thus, accurate monitoring of developmental trajectories is critical. However, such monitoring often relies on time-intensive assessments which necessitate administration by skilled professionals. This difficulty is exacerbated in low-resource settings where such professionals are predominantly concentrated in urban and often private clinics, making them inaccessible to many. This geographic and economic inaccessibility contributes to a significant 'detection gap' where many children who might benefit from support remain undetected. The Scalable Transdiagnostic Early Assessment of Mental Health (STREAM) project aims to bridge this gap by developing an open-source, scalable, tablet-based platform administered by non-specialist workers to assess motor, social and cognitive developmental status. The goal is to deploy STREAM through public health initiatives, maximising opportunities for effective early interventions. Methods and analysis The STREAM project will enrol and assess 4000 children aged 0-6 years from Malawi (n=2000) and India (n=2000). It integrates three established developmental assessment tools measuring motor, social and cognitive functioning using gamified tasks, observation checklists, parent-report and audio-video recordings. Domain scores for motor, social and cognitive functioning will be developed and assessed for their validity and reliability. These domain scores will then be used to construct age-adjusted developmental reference curves. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from local review boards at each site (India: Sangath Institutional Review Board; All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Ethics Committee; Indian Council of Medical Research-Health Ministry Screening Committee; Malawi: College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee; Malawi Ministry of Health-Blantyre District Health Office). The study adheres to Good Clinical Practice standards and the ethical guidelines of the 6th (2008) Declaration of Helsinki. Findings from STREAM will be disseminated to participating families, healthcare professionals, policymakers, educators and researchers, at local, national and international levels through meetings, academic journals and conferences.

AB  - The objective of this prospective observational study was to assess the growth and body composition of term small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants from birth to 6 months and evaluate the effect of catch-up growth (CUG) on body composition. Term SGA newborns were recruited at birth. Anthropometry and body composition were evaluated at 3 days, 6, 10 and 14 weeks, and 6 months. Fat and fat-free mass (FM and FFM) were compared between infants with and without CUG (increase in weight Z-score by > 0<middle dot>67) by air displacement plethysmography. Factors that could affect body composition and CUG, including parents' BMI and stature, infants' birth weight, sex and feeding, were evaluated. A total of 143 SGA newborns (sixty-six boys) with birth weight of 2336 (sd 214) g were enrolled; 109 were followed up till 6 months. Median weight Z-score increased from -2<middle dot>3 at birth to -1<middle dot>3 at 6 months, with 51<middle dot>9 % of infants showing CUG. Infants with CUG had higher FM (1796 (sd 491) g v. 1196 (sd 474) g, P < 0<middle dot>001) but similar FFM (4969 (sd 508) g v. 4870 (sd 622) g, P = 0<middle dot>380), and consequently higher FM percentage (FM%) (26<middle dot>5 (sd 5<middle dot>8) v. 19<middle dot>7 (sd 6<middle dot>9), P < 0<middle dot>001), compared with those without CUG. Lower birth weight, exclusive breast-feeding and higher parental stature were positively associated with CUG. In conclusion, CUG in term SGA infants in the first 6 months of life was almost entirely attributable to greater gain in FM. Follow-up of this cohort will provide insight into the long-term effect of disproportionate gain in FM in early infancy in SGA babies.

AB  - In metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), existing treatments including checkpoint inhibitors are failed to cure and/or prevent recurrence of the disease. Therefore, in-depth understanding of tumor tissue resident memory T cells (TRMs) dysfunction are necessitated to enrich efficacy of immunotherapies and increasing disease free survival in treated patients. In patients, we observed dysregulation of K+, Ca2+, Na2+ and Zn2+ ion channels leads to excess infiltration of their respective ions in tumor TRMs, thus ionic gradients are disturbed and cells became hyperpolarized. Moreover, overloaded intramitochondrial calcium caused mitochondrial depolarization and trigger apoptosis of tumor TRMs. Decreased prevalence of activated tumor TRMs reflected our observations. Furthermore, disruptions in ionic concentrations impaired the functional activities and/or suppressed anti-tumor action of circulating and tumor TRMs in RCC. Collectively, these findings revealed novel mechanism behind dysfunctionality of tumor TRMs. Implicating enrichment of activated TRMs within tumor would be beneficial for better management of RCC patients.

AB  - Background The Dafodil (TM)-1 trial was designed to evaluate the clinical safety and performance of Dafodil (TM) pericardial bioprosthesis for replacing diseased native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valves in patients with advanced valvular heart disease (VHD). Methods The Dafodil (TM)-1 trial was a prospective, multicenter, first-in-human clinical trial. Patients were enrolled if they had advanced VHD requiring aortic valve replacement (AVR) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) with or without concomitant valve surgery and having surgical risk scores <4%. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke; and hemodynamics were analyzed. Results A total of 136 patients (aortic: 67 and mitral: 69) were enrolled in the trial (with mean age-AVR group: 60.2 +/- 8.3 years and MVR group: 49.7 +/- 14.4 years). A total of 134 patients (aortic: 66 and mitral: 68) completed the 3-year follow-up (total 300 per 100 patient-years of follow-up). The AVR group demonstrated a significant reduction in the mean pressure gradients from 51.2 +/- 24.1 mmHg at baseline to 11.1 +/- 6.0 mmHg at the 3-year follow-up (p < 0.0001). The mean effective orifice area (EOA) improved from baseline (0.9 +/- 0.6 cm2) to 3-year follow-up (1.8 +/- 0.4 cm2) (p < 0.0001). In the MVR group, the mean indexed EOA (iEOA) increased significantly from baseline (0.7 +/- 0.4 cm2/m2) to 3-year follow-up (1.1 +/- 0.4 cm2/m2) (p < 0.001). There was significant improvement in New York Heart Association functional class and mean SF-12 scores in both groups. At 3-year follow-up, the MACE incidence was 2.3% per 100 patient-years (1.3% strokes per 100 patient-years and 1.3% deaths per 100 patient-years) for AVR group and 4.7% per 100 patient-years (0.6% strokes per 100 patient-years and 4.0% deaths per 100 patient-years) for MVR group. No cases of MI, structural valve deterioration and prosthetic valve endocarditis were reported. The AVR and MVR groups achieved 89.6% and 79.7% MACE-free survival, respectively at 3-year follow-up. Conclusions The Dafodil (TM)-1 trial demonstrated satisfactory outcomes of clinical safety, hemodynamic performance, and quality-of-life metrics. Additionally, no incidence of structural valve deterioration and very low rates of valve thrombosis during the 3-year follow-up period of Dafodil (TM)-1 first-in-human trial indicated acceptable valve durability up to three years and similar outcomes are warranted for longer follow-ups as a primary goal.

AB  - Background Congenital inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis (UDT) are associated with patent processus vaginalis. The smooth muscles present in the processus vaginalis aid in the descent of the testis and undergo programmed cell death after testicular descent leading to obliteration. The persisting amount of smooth muscle in the processus vaginalis influences the clinical outcome as inguinal hernia, hydrocele or UDT. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the processus vaginalis in these three conditions to observe the presence and phenotype of smooth muscle cells and the presence of myofibroblasts. Materials and methods The processus vaginalis sacs in patients with inguinal hernia, hydrocele and UDT were examined using light microscopy for the presence and distribution of smooth muscle cells and immunohistochemical staining for vimentin, desmin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) to identify the smooth muscle phenotype. Transmission electron microscopy was also performed in all the sacs to observe the presence of myofibroblasts. Results Seventy-eight specimens of processus vaginalis (from seventy-four patients), distributed as 47%, 27%, and 26% as inguinal hernia, hydrocele and UDT respectively, were included in the study. The sacs from inguinal hernia and hydrocele had significantly more presence of smooth muscles distributed as multiple smooth muscle bundles (p < 0.001). Desmin and SMA staining of smooth muscle cells was observed in significantly more sacs from hydrocele, followed by inguinal hernia and UDT (p < 0.001). The sacs from UDT had a significant presence of striated muscles (p = 0.028). The sacs from inguinal hernia had a significant presence of myofibroblasts, followed by hydrocele and UDT (p < 0.001) and this significantly correlated with the light microscopy and immunohistochemical features. The processus vaginalis sacs from four female patients did not differ statistically from the male inguinal hernia sacs in any of the above parameters. Conclusion The processus vaginalis sacs in pediatric inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis differ in the presence, distribution and phenotype of smooth muscles and the presence of myofibroblasts. The clinical presentations in these entities reflect these differences.

AB  - Eye-related diseases, specifically retinal dystrophy (RD) conditions, are the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Gene addition, regulation, or editing could potentially treat such diseases through gene expression regulation. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is one of the most prominent and precise gene editing tools which could be employed to edit genes related to the dystrophic condition. However, CRISPR/Cas9 faces in vivo delivery challenges due to its high molecular weight, negative charge, prone to degradation in the presence of nucleases and proteases, poor cellular degradation, etc., which makes it challenging to adopt for therapeutic applications. We developed cRGD-modified lipopolymeric nanoplexes loaded with Cas9 RNPs with a particle size and zeta potential of 175 +/- 20 nm and 2.15 +/- 0.9 mV, respectively. The cRGD-modified lipopolymeric nanoplexes were stable for 194 h and able to transfect >70 % ARPE-19 and NIH3T3 cells with an Indel frequency of similar to 40 % for the VEGF-A gene. The cRGD-modified lipopolymeric nanoplexes found good vitreous mobility and could transfection retinal cells in vivo after 48 h of intravitreal injection in Wistar Rats. Moreover, in vivo VEGFA gene editing was similar to 10 % with minimal toxicities. Collectively, the cRGD-modified lipopolymeric nanoplexes were found to have extreme potential in delivering CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs payload to the retinal tissues for therapeutic applications.

AB  - BackgroundFacebook (FB) is the most popular online networking platform. Many celiac disease Facebook (CD-FB) pages spread awareness about celiac disease (CD). To get the latest information, patients with CD frequently follow such pages. However, little is known about whether such pages provide authentic and reliable information.AimsThis study aims to investigate whether CD-FB pages spread misleading information to patients with CD.MethodsOn the Facebook social networking platform, CD-FB pages created in three celiac-prevalent countries (Italy, the USA, and India) were explored using different combinations of keywords. The type/category of the CD-FB page, country of origin, purpose, page web link, and number of followers/members were documented in a Microsoft spreadsheet. All posts distributed on selected CD-FB pages in the last 3 years were thoroughly screened.ResultsFrom August 2022 to March 2023, a total of 200 CD-FB pages from Italy, the USA, and India were explored. Out of these 200 pages, 155 CD-FB (Italy 70; the USA 46; India 39) were found eligible. Of them, 20 (13%) CD-FB pages (Italy 4; the USA 5; India 11) shared misleading information about CD. Surprisingly, 11 (8%) of these 20 pages (Italy 0; the USA 2; India 9) supported alternative treatment options for CD.ConclusionsCD-FB pages are useful for disseminating celiac-disease-related information. While most such pages provide useful information, 13% of CD-FB pages allow misleading information. Patients with CD should consult their treating unit before following any uncertain information posted on CD-FB pages.

AB  - Background Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by depigmented skin patches, which can pose substantial psychosocial challenges particularly in individuals with dark skin tones. Despite its impact on quality of life, there is an absence of standardised global epidemiological data. We sought to address this gap with the present study. Methods In this study we did a systematic review and modelling analysis to estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence and incidence of vitiligo. We did a comprehensive search of nine digital libraries (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scientific Electronic Library Online, KCI Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, Western Pacific Region Index Medicus, Informit, and Health Research and Development Information Network) from inception up to May 25, 2023. We included cross-sectional or cohort studies reporting the incidence rate or prevalence of vitiligo, or data from which incidence rate or prevalence could be calculated, in the general population of a country or area of a country. Summary estimate data were extracted. A main outcome was to estimate the worldwide, regional, and country -specific lifetime prevalence of vitiligo diagnosed by physicians or dermatologists among the general population and in adults and children (as per age groups defined in included studies). We used a Bayesian hierarchical linear mixed model to estimate prevalence, and calculated number of affected individuals using the UN population structure in 2022. In estimating lifetime prevalence, studies reporting point or period prevalence were excluded. Our other main outcome was to estimate incidence rates of vitiligo, but due to a small number of studies, the data on incidence were presented in a descriptive summary. This study was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023390433. Findings Our search identified 22 192 records, of which 90 studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, six focused on the incidence of vitiligo, 79 reported on the prevalence of vitiligo, and five provided data on both incidence and prevalence. 71 studies reported on lifetime prevalence. In the most recent years studied, incidence rates in the general population ranged from 24<middle dot>7 cases (95% CI 24<middle dot>3-25<middle dot>2) per 100 000 person -years in South Korea in 2019, to 61<middle dot>0 cases (60<middle dot>6-61<middle dot>4) in the USA in 2017. In individual studies, incidence rates showed an increasing trend over the periods studied. The global lifetime prevalence of vitiligo diagnosed by a physician or dermatologist was estimated at 0<middle dot>36% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0<middle dot>24-0<middle dot>54) in the general population (28<middle dot>5 million people [95% CrI 18<middle dot>9-42<middle dot>6]), 0<middle dot>67% (0<middle dot>43-1<middle dot>07) in the adult population (37<middle dot>1 million adults [23<middle dot>9-58<middle dot>9]), and 0<middle dot>24% (0<middle dot>16-0<middle dot>37) in the child population (5<middle dot>8 million children [3<middle dot>8-8<middle dot>9]). Vitiligo prevalence was higher in adults than in children across all regions. Central Europe and south Asia reported the highest prevalence (0<middle dot>52% [0<middle dot>28-1<middle dot>07] and 0<middle dot>52% [0<middle dot>33-0<middle dot>82], respectively, in the general population). Interpretation This study highlights the need for standardised epidemiological data collection globally to inform public health policies and improve vitiligo diagnosis and management.
   Emphasis on the impact on individuals with darker skin tones is crucial to reducing stigma and improving quality of life. Furthermore, our study highlights the need to conduct more research in regions and populations that have been historically under -represented, to effectively address the worldwide burden of vitiligo.

AB  - Background: The economic burden of psychotic disorders is not well documented in LMICs like India, due to several bottlenecks present in Indian healthcare system like lack of adequate resources, low budget for mental health services and inequity in accessibility of treatment. Hence, a large proportion of health expenditure is paid out of pocket by the households. Objective: To evaluate the direct and indirect costs incurred by patients with First Episode Psychosis and their families in a North Indian setting. Method: Direct and Indirect costs were estimated for 87 patients diagnosed at AIIMS, New Delhi with first-episode psychosis (nonaffective) in the first- and sixth month following diagnosis, and the six months before diagnosis, using a bespoke questionnaire. Indirect costs were valued using the Human Capital Approach. Results: Mean total costs in month one were INR 7991 ($107.5). Indirect costs were 78.3% of this total. Productivity losses was a major component of the indirect cost. Transportation was a key component of direct costs. Costs fell substantially at six months (INR 2732, Indirect Costs 61%). Respondents incurred substantial costs prediagnosis, related to formal and informal care seeking and loss of income. Conclusion: Families suffered substantial productivity loss. Care models and financial protection that address this could substantially reduce the financial burden of mental illness. Measures to address disruption to work and education during FEP are likely to have significant long-term benefits. Families also suffered prolonged income loss pre-diagnosis, highlighting the benefits of early and effective diagnosis.

AB  - Background: Physical exercise can improve outcomes for people with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Co-designing physical exercise interventions with end users has the potential to enhance their acceptability, feasibility, and long-term viability. This study's objective was to use experience-based co-design (EBCD) methodology to develop a physical exercise intervention for FEP, and pilot test it. Methods: The study was conducted at the Schizophrenia Research Foundation's FEP program in Chennai, India. Participants(N=36) were individuals with FEP and their caregivers, mental health professionals (MHPs, and physical training experts. EBCD methodology included one-to-one interviews, focus group discussions, joint conferences, and co-design workshops. Two instructional videos were developed. Twelve FEP patients engaged in physical exercise with help of the videos over three months. They were followed up through weekly phone calls and in-person interviews to capture data on regularity, frequency, location of exercise, and comfort levels. Results: Several touch points emerged from the interviews, focus groups, and joint meetings including lack of motivation, knowledge about physical exercise; differing perspectives about physical exercise; limited resource, and time constraints. Two instructional videos demonstrating activities for participants incorporated strategies that addressed these touch points. Pilot data indicated that participants engaged with the physical exercise intervention over 3 months. Conclusion: This was the first study to use co-design methodology to design a physical exercise intervention for first-episode psychosis. The intervention may have therefore been responsive to stakeholder needs and preferences. Results of this study highlight the potential of co-design in designing and adapting interventions. There is need for rigorous testing with larger samples.

AB  - Background Lupus nephritis (LN) is a very severe manifestation of lupus. There is no consensus on which treatment goals should be achieved to protect kidney function in children with LN. Methods We retrospectively analyzed trends of commonly used laboratory biomarkers of 428 patients (<= 18 years old) with biopsy-proven LN class >= III. We compared data of patients who developed stable kidney remission from 6 to 24 months with those who did not. Results Twenty-five percent of patients maintained kidney stable remission while 75% did not. More patients with stable kidney remission showed normal hemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate from 6 to 24 months compared to the group without stable kidney remission. eGFR >= 90 ml/min/1.73m(2) at onset predicted the development of stable kidney remission (93.8%) compared to 64.7% in those without stable remission (P < 0.00001). At diagnosis, 5.9% and 20.2% of the patients showed no proteinuria in the group with and without stable kidney remission, respectively (P = 0.0001). dsDNA antibodies decreased from onset of treatment mainly during the first 3 months in all groups, but more than 50% of all patients in both groups never normalized after 6 months. Complement C3 and C4 increased mainly in the first 3 months in all patients without any significant difference. Conclusions Normal eGFR and the absence of proteinuria at onset were predictors of stable kidney remission. Significantly more children showed normal levels of Hb and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) from 6 to 24 months in the group with stable kidney remission.

AB  - The integrity and authenticity of electronic patient records (EPRs) are essential concerns in the healthcare industry. To address these concerns, this paper introduces a novel, robust watermarking scheme using integer wavelet transform -singular value decomposition (IWT-SVD). The proposed scheme is divided into logo embedding and EPR text embedding, aiming to mitigate false -positive issues and maintain EPR integrity and authenticity. In the first part, medical image and watermark logo are encrypted using DMA (Diffused Mandelbrot set -Arnold map) to enhance security. Further, the encrypted medical image is segmented into four subbands (CA, CH, CV, CD) by one -level IWT transform. Then SVD is applied on sub -band CD to extract the principal component (PC), where the encrypted logo is embedded due to its higher magnitudes, thereby mitigating false -positive errors. Embedding the encrypted logo into the hybrid IWT-SVD domain enhances security and robustness. Moreover, for embedding, multiple optimal embedding factors (MOEFs) are determined through Non -dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to balance imperceptibility and robustness. In the second part, EPR text is embedded into watermarked logo using SVD to verify authenticity. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated on standard medical image datasets against various attacks in terms of SSIM, PSNR, BER, and NC. The proposed scheme improves PSNR values by 48.44% and 19.66% for grayscale and color images, respectively. Similarly, NC values are also improved by 10%-12% for grayscale and color images. Therefore, the proposed scheme enhances security, imperceptibility, and robustness while reducing complexity compared to the state-of-the-art schemes. Moreover, it is also false -positive -free and maintain integrity simultaneously.

AB  - Introduction: Postoperative Ileus (POI) negatively impacts patient outcomes and increases healthcare costs. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been found to improve gastrointestinal (GI) motility following abdominal surgery. However, its effectiveness in this context is not well-established. This study was designed to evaluate the role of TENS on the recovery of GI motility after exploratory laparotomy. Methods: Patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into control (standard treatment alone) and experimental (standard treatment + TENS) arms. TENS was terminated after 6 days or after the passage of stool or stoma movement. The primary outcome was time for the first passage of stool/functioning stoma. Non-passage of stool or nonfunctioning stoma beyond 6 days was labeled as prolonged POI. Patients were monitored until discharge. Results: Median (interquartile range) time to first passage of stool/functioning stoma was 82.6 (49-115) hours in the standard treatment group and 50 (22-70.6) hours in the TENS group [p < 0.001]. Prolonged POI was noted in 11 patients in the standard treatment group (35.5%) and one in the TENS group (3.2%) [p = 0.003]. Postoperative hospital stay was similar in the two groups. Conclusion: TENS resulted in early recovery of GI motility by shortening the duration of POI without any improvement in postoperative hospital stay.

AB  - Background Post-mastectomy pain Syndrome (PMPS), characterized by chronic neuropathic pain stemming from intercostobrachial nerve lesions, presents a formidable clinical challenge. With the incidence of breast cancer surging, effective interventions for PMPS are urgently needed. To address this, we conducted this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to study the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) therapy over the motor cortex on pain, quality of life and thermal sensitivity in PMPS patients. Methods We delivered 15 rTMS sessions over three weeks in a cohort of 34 PMPS patients. These patients were allocated randomly to either rTMS therapy or sham therapy groups. Pain assessments, utilizing the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), alongside quality-of-life evaluations through the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), were recorded before and after the 15 sessions. Additionally, we assessed thermal sensitivity using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). Results Our findings demonstrate the superior efficacy of rTMS therapy (over sham therapy) in reducing VAS and SF-MPQ scores (p < 0.0001), improving physical (p = 0.037), emotional (p = 0.033), and functional well-being (p = 0.020) components of quality of life, as quantified by FACT-B. Our investigation also unveiled marked enhancements in thermal sensitivity within the rTMS therapy group, with statistically significant improvements in cold detection threshold (p = 0.0001), warm detection threshold (p = 0.0033), cold pain threshold (p = 0.0078), and hot pain tolerance threshold (p = 0.0078). Conclusion The study underscores the profound positive impact of rTMS therapy on pain, quality of life, and thermal sensitivity in patients having PMPS, opening new avenues for pain management strategies.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) imposes a significant economic burden in developing countries like India. Timely diagnosis and treatment should be prioritized to mitigate the disease. Current diagnostic tools being invasive and less specific raise the need to develop less invasive and more reliable molecular biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an emerging class of molecules that can serve as a potential source of non-invasive biomarkers for CAD. The objective of this study was to determine the potential of circulatory miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers in CAD. In this study, we have reported two microRNAs, miR-128-3p and miR-195-5p in the serum of CAD patients in Indian Population. A total of 124 subjects were recruited which included 89 angiographically proven CAD patients and 35 control subjects. Our results show a significant decrease in the levels of miR-128-3p in CAD patients while there were no significant changes in the levels of miR-195-5p. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed the potential role of miR-128-3p in cholesterol homeostasis. Altered homeostasis due to cholesterol accumulation in macrophages is the driving force behind formation of foam cells which in turn accelerates the progression of CAD. Here, we have shown that miR-128-3p increases cholesterol levels in macrophages by decreasing cholesterol efflux in-vitro.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Patient-centric outcome measures focus on clinically meaningful change in various aspects of disease, including severity, quality of life and psychological distress. The minimal important change (MIC) is a commonly used threshold of patient-reported outcome measures, representing the smallest difference that is considered significant by the patient and/or physician. However, it has been suggested that MIC is too low a bar for determining treatment success, and alternative thresholds such as substantial clinical benefit (SCB) and patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) may be preferred.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coconut water (CW) is anti-inflammatory, can manipulate the gut microbiome, and is a rich source of potassium. Gut microbiome modulation improves outcomes in ulcerative colitis (UC), and potassium possesses in vitro anti-inflammatory property. We evaluated the effect of CW as an adjunct therapy for patients with mild-moderate UC. METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized patients with mild to moderate (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI]: 3-9) endoscopically active UC (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity [UCEIS] >1) in 1:1 ratio to CW + standard medical therapy (SMT) vs placebo + SMT. Four hundred mL of CW was administered for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measure was clinical remission (SCCAI <= 2), and secondary outcome measures were clinical response (SCCAI decline >= 3) and adverse events at 8 weeks. Microbiome was analyzed at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Of 121 patients screened, 95 were included for modified intention to treat analysis (CW, n = 49; placebo, n = 46) (mean age, 37.2 +/- 11.2 years; males, 54.1%; disease duration, 48 months [interquartile range (IQR), 24-90 months]; pancolitis, 26.1%; SCCAI, 5 [IQR, 4-6]; UCEIS, 4 [IQR, 3-5]). Clinical response (57.1% vs 28.3%; odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-7.9; P = .01), remission (53.1% vs 28.3%; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.7; P = .02), and proportion of patients with fecal calprotectin (FCP) <150 mu g/g (30.6% vs 6.5%; OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.7-23.6; P = .003) were significantly higher in CW. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa that had a significant or trend towards negative correlation with SCCAI, UCEIS, or FCP increased at 8 weeks in CW, and this effect was independent of disease activity and dietary fiber. Adverse events were comparable, and no patient developed hyperkalemia. CONCLUSIONS: CW was more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission in patients with mild to moderate UC. The trial was prospectively registered on Clinical Trials Registry of India (ctri.nic.in, Number: CTRI/2019/03/01827).

AB  - The impairment of phenotype switching of pro-inflammatory M1 to pro-healing M2 macrophage induced by hyperglycemic microenvironment often elevates oxidative stress, impairs angiogenesis, and leads to chronic nonhealing wounds in diabetic patients. Administration of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2Exo) at wound site is known to polarize M1 to M2 macrophage and can accelerate wound healing by enhancing collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization. In the present study, M2Exo were conjugated with oxidized hyaluronic acid and mixed with PEGylated silk fibroin to develop self-healing Exo-gel to achieve an efficient therapy for diabetic wounds. Exo-gel depicted porous networked morphology with self-healing and excellent water retention behaviour. Fibroblast cells treated with Exo-gel showed significant uptake of M2Exo that increased their proliferation and migration in vitro. Interestingly, in a diabetic wound model of wistar rats, Exo-gel treatment induced 75 % wound closure within 7 days with complete epithelial layer regeneration by modulating cytokine levels, stimulating fibroblast-keratinocyte interaction and migration, angiogenesis, and organized collagen deposition. Taken together, this study suggests that Exo-gel depict properties of an excellent wound healing matrix and can be used as a therapeutic alternative to treat chronic non-healing diabetic wounds.

AB  - Introduction: Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) using standard rib plating systems has become a norm in developed countries. However, the procedure has not garnered much interest in low-middle-income countries, primarily because of the cost. Methods: This was a single-center pilot randomized trial. Patients with severe rib fractures were randomized into two groups: SSRF and nonoperative management. SSRF arm patients underwent surgical fixation in addition to the tenets of nonoperative management. Lowcost materials like stainless steel wires and braided polyester sutures were used for fracture fixation. The primary outcome was to assess the duration of hospital stay. Results: Twenty-two patients were randomized, 11 in each arm. Per-protocol analysis showed that the SSRF arm had significantly reduced duration of hospital stay (22.6 +/- 19.1 d versus 7.9 +/- 5.7 d, P value 0.031), serial pain scores at 48 h and 5 d (median score 5, IQR (3-6) versus median score 7, IQR (6.5-8), P value 0.004 at 48 h and median score 2 IQR (2-3) versus median score 7 IQR (4.5-7) P value 0.0005 at 5 d), significantly reduced need for injectable opioids (9.9 +/- 3.8 mg versus 4.4 +/- 3.4 mg, P value 0.003) and significantly more ventilatorfree days (19.9 +/- 8.7 d versus 26.4 +/- 3.2 d, P value 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in the total duration of ICU stay (median number of days 2, IQR 1-4.5 versus median number of days 7, IQR 1-14, P value 0.958), need for tracheostomy (36.4% versus 0%, P value 0.155), and pulmonary and pleural complications. Conclusions: SSRF with low-cost materials may provide benefits similar to standard rib plating systems and can be used safely in resource-poor settings. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Achieving successful pregnancy outcomes is a delicate interplay between the maternal and the fetal counterparts. Paternal factors play a critical role in health and disease of offspring. Early pregnancy loss (EPL) is a psychologically devastating condition affecting the quality of life (QOL). Thus, it needs to be managed by a mind body integrated approach like yoga.The prospective single arm exploratory studyincluded male partners of couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL, n = 30), and recurrent implantation failure (RIF, n = 30) and semen samples wereassessed at the beginning and completion of yoga (6 weeks) (WHO 2010).A significant increase in the sperm concentration, motility, decrease in seminal ROS, DFI and increase in relative sperm telomere length was found at the end of yoga. The relative expression of genes critical for early embryonic developmentnormalized towards the levels of controls. WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire scores to assess QOL also showed improvement.Integration of regular practice yoga into our lifestyle may help in improving seminal redox status, genomic integrity, telomere length, normalizing gene expression and QOL, highlighting the need to use an integrated, holistic approach in management of such cases. This is pertinent for decreasing the transmission of mutation and epimutation load to the developing embryo, improving pregnancy outcomes and decreasing genetic and epigenetic disease burden in the next generation.

AB  - Aims: The INtegrating DEPrEssioN and Diabetes treatmENT (INDEPENDENT) trial tested a collaborative care model including electronic clinical decision support (CDS) for treating diabetes and depression in India. We aimed to assess which features of this clinically and cost-effective intervention were associated with improvements in diabetes and depression measures. Methods: Post -hoc analysis of the INDEPENDENT trial data (189 intervention participants) was conducted to determine each intervention feature 's effect: 1. Collaborative case reviews between expert psychiatrists and the care team; 2. Patient care -coordinator contacts; and 3. Clinicians ' CDS prompt modifications. Primary outcome was baseline -to -12 -months improvements in diabetes control, blood pressure, cholesterol, and depression. Implementer interviews revealed barriers and facilitators of intervention success. Joint displays integrated mixed methods ' results. Results: High baseline HbA1c >= 74.9 mmol/mol (9%) was associated with 5.72 fewer care -coordinator contacts than those with better baseline HbA1c (76.8 mmol/mol, 9.18%, p < 0.001). Prompt modification proportions varied from 38.3% (diabetes) to 1.3% (LDL). Interviews found that providers ' and participants ' visit frequencies were preference dependent. Qualitative data elucidated patient -level factors that influenced number of clinical contacts and prompt modifications explaining their lack of association with clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Our mixed methods approach underlines the importance of the complementarity of different intervention features. Qualitative findings further illuminate reasons for variations in fidelity from the core model.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to compare the treatment outcomes of digital nasoalveolar moulding (dNAM) technique with conventional nasoalveolar moulding (cNAM) or non-presurgical intervention protocol in infants with unilateral (UCLP) or bilateral (BCLP) cleft lip and palate. A bibliometric search by MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase, Cochrane Library, grey literature and manual method was conducted without language restriction until November 2023. Literature screening and data extraction were undertaken in Covidence. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and RoB-2. Pooled effect sizes were determined through random-effects statistical model using R-Software, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Among 775 retrieved articles, nine studies were included for qualitative synthesis (6-UCLP, 3-BCLP), with only three eligible UCLP studies for meta-analysis. In the UCLP group, very low certainty of evidence indicated no difference in alveolar cleft width (SMD, 0.13 mm; 95% CI, -0.31 to 0.57; I2, 0%), soft tissue (lip) cleft gap, nasal width, nasal height, and columellar deviation angle changes between dNAM and cNAM. In the BCLP group, qualitative synthesis suggested similar changes in alveolar, lip, and nasal dimensions with dNAM and cNAM. In both cleft groups (UCLP, BCLP), reduced alveolar cleft width was observed in the dNAM group compared to the non-presurgical intervention protocol, along with fewer clinical visits and reduced chairside time for dNAM compared to cNAM. It can be concluded that the treatment outcomes with dNAM were comparable to cNAM in reducing malformation severity and were advantageous in terms of chairside time and clinical visit frequency. However, the overall quality of evidence is very low and standardization is needed for the virtual workflow regarding the alveolar movements and growth factor algorithms.

AB  - Endophyte-host interactions lead to the production of various bioactive compounds. Thus, endophytes from a medicinal plant such as Momordica charantia, can be promising candidates for producing pharmacological compounds. Our study therefore aims to evaluate these endophytes as sustainable sources of potential lowcost lung cancer drugs. We determined the endophytes associated with M. charantia (fruit and leaf) and assessed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative potential against NCI-H23 lung cancer cells. LC-Q-TOF-MS of the endophyte extracts was conducted to determine the metabolite profile. Leaf endophyte F. circinatum showed anti-inflammatory (114.29 %), antioxidant (IC50=27.39 mu g/ml) and antiproliferative activity (IC50=98.62 mu l/ml) with decreased Beclin1 expression (autophagy regulator) in NCI-H23 cells. It produced five anticancer compounds namely linamarin, xestoaminol C, phytosphingosine, cucurbitacin E and margarolic acid. Fruit endophyte E. fergusonii also showed significant antiproliferative potential (IC50=170.8 mu l/ml) with upregulated apoptosis regulator Bcl2 expression. It produced compounds such as eplerenone, kuguacin C and H. With the production of triterpenoids momordicine I, cucurbitacin E and kuguaglycoside A, leaf endophyte A. faecalis showed antioxidant potential (IC50=29.65 mu g/ml) but limited antiproliferative activity. This is the first report of endophytes-mediated biosynthesis of host-specific compounds in M. charantia including momordicine I, cucurbitacin E and kuguacins, which are known to have anti-cancer properties. Thus, these medicinal plant endophytes can be low-cost sustainable candidates with anti-cancerous potential, especially against lung cancer. (c) 2024 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lactate is an oncometabolite that play important role in tumor aggressiveness. Lactate from the tumor microenvironment (TME) is taken up by cancer cells as an energy resource via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (or OXPHOS). In the present study, by using an online meta-analysis tool we demonstrated that in oral squamous cancer cells (OSCCs) glycolytic and OXPHOS governing genes are overexpressed, like in breast cancer. For experimental demonstration, we treated the OSCC cell line (SCC4) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with sodium L-lactate and analyzed its effects on changes in EMT and migration. For the therapeutic intervention of lactate metabolism, we used AZD3965 (an MCT1 inhibitor), and 7ACC2 (an MPC inhibitor). Like breast cancer, oral cancer tissues showed increased transcripts of 12 genes that were previously shown to be associated with glycolysis and OXPHOS. We experimentally demonstrated that L-lactate treatment induced mesenchymal markers and migration of cancer cells, which was significantly neutralized by MPC inhibitor that is, 7ACC2. Such an effect on EMT status was not observed with AZD3965. Furthermore, we showed that lactate treatment increases the MPC1 expression in both cancer cells, and this might be the reason why cancer cells in the high lactate environment are more sensitive to 7ACC2. Overall, our present findings demonstrate that extracellular lactate positively regulates the MPC1 protein expression in cancer cells, thereby putting forward the notion of using 7ACC2 as a potential therapeutic alternative to inhibit malignant oxidative cancers. Future preclinical studies are warranted to validate the present findings.

AB  - ScopeAssociation between vitamin B12 deficiency (VB12D) and dietary patterns being well documented has bearing on obstetrics and neonatal outcomes. However, relationship between VB12D and serum inflammatory markers (IMs), particularly in vegetarian diet and Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), remains elusive. This cross-sectional study assesses VB12D and IMs among reproductive age women consuming different diets.Methods and resultsNonvegetarian (PCOS, n = 104; healthy, n = 148) and vegetarian women (PCOS n = 112; healthy, n = 186) are for evaluated clinical, biochemical, hormonal assessment, inflammatory, and four vitamin B 12 (VB12) markers. VB12D is defined by Fedosov's wellness quotient (4cB12). Using 4cB12, prevalence of VB12D is discerned in 54.4% (PCOS: 72.1%; healthy 36.5%) and 93.4% (PCOS: 95.9%; healthy: 91.9%) among nonvegetarians and vegetarians, respectively. Vegetarian PCOS women depict lowest median (interquartile range [IQR]) of serum B12 76.2(72.6) pg mL-1, holotranscobalamine (HTC) 37.9(11.3) and highest homocysteine (HCY) 40.32(6.0) mu mol L-1, methylmalonic acid (MMA) 352.26(156.7) nmol L-1 with highest Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and IMs (Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6)). Significant correlation of serum hs-CRP, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 with VB12 markers is observed.ConclusionThe VB12D is rampant among reproductive age women that gets exacerbated by PCOS or vegetarian diet. It is directly correlated with magnitude of proinflammatory markers. The results carry substantial implications for public health policies aimed at improving preconception maternal VB12 status for better future pregnancy and offspring outcomes.
   Vitamin B12 Deficiency is rampant among reproductive age women. Vitamin B12 deficiency is affected by pattern of diet intake and is worse among women who follow vegetarian dietary pattern in contrast to non-vegetarians. Further vitamin B12 deficiency seems to be exacerbated among women with PCOS. In, vegetarian women with PCOS, vitamin B12 was lowest and the highest levels of certain markers were found indicating inflammation and insulin resistance. This highlights the importance of paying attention to women's vitamin B12 levels before pregnancy to ensure better health for both mothers and babies. image

AB  - PURPOSEHand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a dose-limiting side effect of capecitabine. Celecoxib prevents HFS by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that is upregulated because of the underlying associated inflammation. However, systemic side effects of celecoxib have limited routine prescription. Topical diclofenac inhibits COX-2 locally with minimal risk of systemic adverse events. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the efficacy of topical diclofenac in the prevention of capecitabine-induced HFS.METHODSIn this single-site phase III randomized double-blind trial, we enrolled patients with breast or GI cancer who were planned to receive capecitabine-based treatment. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive topical diclofenac or placebo gel for 12 weeks or until the development of HFS, whichever occurred earlier. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 2 or 3 HFS (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5), which was compared between the two groups using simple logistic regression.RESULTSIn total, 264 patients were randomly assigned to receive topical diclofenac gel (n = 131) or placebo (n = 133). Grade 2 or 3 HFS was observed in 3.8% of participants in the diclofenac group compared with 15.0% in the placebo group (absolute difference, 11.2%; 95% CI, 4.3 to 18.1; P = .003). Grade 1-3 HFS was lower in the diclofenac group than in the placebo group (6.1% v 18.1%; absolute risk difference, 11.9%; 95% CI, 4.1 to 19.6). Capecitabine dose reductions because of HFS were less frequent in the diclofenac group (3.8%) than in the placebo group (13.5%; absolute risk difference, 9.7%; 95% CI, 3.0 to 16.4).CONCLUSIONTopical diclofenac prevented HFS in patients receiving capecitabine. This trial supports the use of topical diclofenac to prevent capecitabine-associated HFS.

AB  - Early GDM is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, however data on other outcomes are scarce. We evaluated women with early (n = 117) and classical (n = 412) GDM for long-term postpartum (median 32 months) glycemic and cardiometabolic outcomes and found a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes in the former [22.2 % vs. 12.6 %, p = 0.010].

AB  - BackgroundIntracranial mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (IMC) is a rare malignant tumor in pediatric population. IMC can present as extra- or intra-axial lesion in pediatric patients, though the former is commoner causing raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Radiological diagnosis is a challenge in these cases, as is it difficult to differentiate these from other extra-axial neoplasms due to the wide differential diagnosis in pediatric population. We aim to systematically review the literature and present a rare case of extraskeletal intracranial mesenchymal chondrosarcoma treated with safe maximal resection.MethodsA systematic review of literature was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed and Scopus databases were queried using the search terms, "primary intracranial chondrosarcoma", "extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma", "mesenchymal chondrosarcoma" and "pediatric". Presentation, surgical management and outcome of a 15-year-old male with an extraskeletal IMC are also described.ResultsThe search yielded 25 articles which met the inclusion criteria. These published records consisted of 33 IMC cases with mean age at presentation of 9.81 +/- 5.2 years (range 2 months to 18 years). Frontal region was the commonest locations (11, 33.3%). Most common presentation was headache (14, 42.4%). All patients underwent surgical intervention: gross total resection (20, 60.6%), subtotal resection (9, 27.3%) and no extent mentioned (4, 12.1%). No adjuvant therapy was received in 15 patients (45.5%). On latest follow-up, 11 patients (33.3%) are on remission, 5 patients (15.2%) are symptom free, 3 patients (9.1%) had recurrence, 2 patients (6.1%) had metastasis and 9 patients (27.3%) expired.ConclusionIMC is a rare entity in pediatric population with imaging findings which are non-characteristic leading to its diagnostic challenge. It can masquerade as other extra-axial intracranial neoplasm (meningioma or hemangiopericytoma). Combination of clinico-radiological and pathological examination can help in accurate diagnosis. Safe Maximal resection followed by radiotherapy is the preferred treatment strategy.

AB  - PurposeTo improve postoperative outcome in middle third falcine meningiomas by cortical venous preservation.BackgroundFalcine meningiomas arise from the falx and do not involve the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Their complete resection is often associated with the risk of venous infarction in the eloquent cortex due to overlying superficial cortical veins on the tumors.MethodWe report one case of middle third falcine meningioma, where we used the posterior interhemispheric corridor for tumor approach.ConclusionUse of the posterior interhemispheric approach, carefully raised bone flap, along with sharp dissection and vein reinforcement using fibrin glue can help to preserve the cortical veins while resecting the falcine meningiomas.

AB  - Background: Variants in the TUBB4A gene are associated with dystonia (DYT- TUBB4A ), Hypomyelination with Atrophy of the Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (H -ABC) and spastic paraplegia. Phenotypes intermediate to these three broad phenotypes are also observed. These are rare disorders, and data from diverse populations remains limited. We report seven Indian cases with dystonia phenotype related to TUBB4A mutation. Cases: Among these seven patients, age at onset ranged from 5 to 48 years. Five patients had cranio-cervical onset of dystonia. One patient had prominent parkinsonism with dystonia. Patients responded well to botulinum toxin injected for laryngeal, cervical and jaw dystonia. The patient with parkinsonism responded well to levodopa, albeit with development of dyskinesias. Apart from the common p.Arg2Gly variant in three patients with DYTTUBB4A , other variants included p.Arg262Pro, p.Arg39Cys and p.Asp245Asn. Conclusions: We report the first collection of cases with TUBB4A mutation from India. We expand the phenotype to include levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. Indian patients, consistent with global literature, harbor prominent adductor dysphonia, cervical and jaw dystonia, which responds well to botulinum treatment.

AB  - Background: Blood transfusion necessity in neurosurgery varies based on surgical type, blood loss, and patient anemia. Leukocytes in red blood cells (RBCs) component release pro -inflammatory cytokines during storage, contributing to transfusion -related immunomodulation (TRIM). Our aim was to examine the impact of the leukocyte content in transfused PRBCs on patients undergoing neurosurgery for meningioma tumours. Study design and methods: This prospective randomized controlled trial conducted from 2018 to 2020 by dividing patients randomly into non-leukoreduced (NLR) (n = 65) and leuko-reduced (LR) (n = 65) groups based on PRBCs received during surgery and hospital stay. Hospital and ICU stays, mechanical ventilation duration, and postoperative bacterial infections were observed. Hematological parameters and cytokine levels (IL -10, INFgamma, and FAS-L) were assessed at pre -transfusion, 24 h, and 7 days post -transfusion. Data analysis included Mann -Whitney U test, Friedman test, Fisher 's chi-square test, with statistical significance at p < 0.05. Results: In our study, ICU and hospital stay duration showed no significant difference (p = 0.06) between groups. However, NLR group had longer mean mechanical ventilation (18 +/- 40.1 h) than the LR group (12.8 +/- 8.6 h). Both groups showed statistically significant increase in Fas-L level on days 1 and 7 (p < 0.05). The IL -10 levels rose 43% in the NLR group, while and decreased by 7% the LR group on day 1. On day 7, IL -10 increased by 75% in NLR and decreased by 40% in LR, with no significance (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, leukoreduction appeared to offer some immune response protection in term of reducing mechanical ventilation timings and cytokine level changes.

AB  - The present work describes the syntheses and structural characterization of new half sandwiched mono (complex 1 ) and dinuclear (complex 2 ) organoruthenium complexes derived from thiosemicarbazone ligand (L1). The molecular structures of compounds were characterized by analytical and multispectroscopic methods which corroborate well with single crystal XRD studies. DFT and TD-DFT studies of compounds revealed that HOMO electron density in L1 is localised on the thiosemicarbazide moiety while the LUMO electron density is evenly distributed over the ligand. However, in complex 1 , the HOMO and LUMO is localised on the arene moiety and partially distributed over metal ion while HOMO and LUMO in complex 2 is equally delocalised throughout the complex. The collaborative preliminary DNA binding studies revealed that complexes 1 and 2 exhibited intercalative mode of interaction. The magnitude of DNA binding strength was determined by calculating K b , K and Ksv values which demonstrated higher DNA binding propensity of complex 2 . Furthermore, HSA binding studies of complexes also revealed better binding efficiency of dinuclear complex in contrast to mononuclear complex. The cytotoxic potential of dinuclear complex 2 was examined against triple negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) via MTT assay.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia type -12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by tandem CAG repeat expansion in the 5 0 -UTR/non-coding region of PPP2R2B . Molecular pathology of SCA12 has not been studied in the context of CAG repeats, and no appropriate models exist. We found in human SCA12-iPSCderived neuronal lineage that expanded CAG in PPP2R2B transcript forms nuclear RNA foci and were found to sequester variety of proteins. Further, the ectopic expression of transcript containing varying length of CAG repeats exhibits non -canonical repeat -associated non-AUG (RAN) translation in multiple frames in HEK293T cells, which was further validated in patient -derived neural stem cells using specific antibodies. mRNA sequencing of the SCA12 and control neurons have shown a network of crucial transcription factors affecting neural fate, in addition to alteration of various signaling pathways involved in neurodevelopment. Altogether, this study identifies the molecular signatures of SCA12 disorder using patient -derived neuronal cell lines.

AB  - ObjectiveA pregnancy at the utero-tubal junction is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy and is associated with high maternal morbidity if it remains undetected. In the present study we discuss four cases of ectopic pregnancies at the utero-tubal junction which caused diagnostic and management dilemmas.MethodsFour cases of early pregnancies with the gestational sac (G-sac) implanted near the utero-tubal junction are described. In case 1 this was suspected after a failed attempt at dilatation and curettage at our hospital, cases 2 and 3 presented with amenorrhea and pain abdomen and case 4 was diagnosed on first pregnancy documentation scan after frozen embryo transfer.ResultsAs initial two-dimensional (2D) transvaginal scan (TVS) failed to diagnose the exact location of the G-sac, three-dimensional (3D) TVS helped to localize the exact location of pregnancy and subsequent individualized management. Case 1 had a partial intramural ectopic pregnancy managed by laparotomy and removal of the ectopic sac. The second and third cases were eccentric uterine pregnancies. The fourth was an interstitial ectopic pregnancy managed by a laparoscopic loop and stitch technique.ConclusionThis case series describes the role of 3D TVS for the evaluation of pregnancies implanted at the utero-tubal junction and individual management of eccentric intrauterine, interstitial ectopic and intramural ectopic pregnancies. A diagnostic algorithm for such types of cases and management options is discussed.
   Four cases of pregnancies at the utero-tubal junction along with diagnostic dilemmas, role of three-dimensional ultrasound (3D USG) in diagnosis and management algorithm are described.

AB  - At present, there is no internationally accepted set of core outcomes or measurement methods for epilepsy clinical practice. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) convened an international working group of experts in epilepsy, people with epilepsy, and their representatives to develop minimum sets of standardized outcomes and outcome measurement methods for clinical practice. Using modified Delphi consensus methods with consecutive rounds of online voting over 12 months, a core set of outcomes and corresponding measurement tool packages to capture the outcomes were identified for infants, children, and adolescents with epilepsy. Consensus methods identified 20 core outcomes. In addition to the outcomes identified for the ICHOM Epilepsy adult standard set, behavioral, motor, and cognitive/language development outcomes were voted as essential for all infants and children with epilepsy. The proposed set of outcomes and measurement methods will facilitate the implementation of the use of patient-centered outcomes in daily practice.

AB  - Background An incisional hernia (IH) after major abdominal surgery is an unwanted complication particularly following cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS and HIPEC). The frequency of IH among patients treated with CRS and HIPEC remains unexpectedly high in various studies. This study aimed to analyze the incidence, determine the factors contributing to the occurrence of IH, and develop methods to reduce the incidence of IH. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from a prospectively maintained structured computerized comprehensive database of 360 patients who had undergone CRS and HIPEC after January 2013 and completed two years of follow-up before December 2023. All patients were followed for a minimum period of two years with physical examination and radiological imaging when required and the occurrence of IH was documented. We used SPSS software version 24 to analyze the data using appropriate statistical tests. We set a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Results Within two years of undergoing CRS and HIPEC, 25 patients (6.9%) out of 360 developed IH, indicating an annual incidence rate of 3.5%. The mean duration of hospitalization for the CRS/HIPEC procedure was 8.4 +/- 4.13 days. Fifty-two (14.4%) patients experienced early post-operative surgical complications. The development of IH in our series was significantly associated with obesity (76% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.001), the occurrence of early post-operative surgical complications (48% vs. 12%, P = 0.001), mainly category III complications (44% vs. 7.1%), category IV complications (24% vs. 2.9%) according to Clavien-Dindo classification, post neoadjuvant chemotherapy status (72% vs. 87%, P = 0.045) and need for bowel anastomosis (32% vs. 11%, P = 0.002). Conclusion The lower incidence of IH following CRS and HIPEC in our patient cohort than in the literature can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the use of meticulous surgical techniques and the use of an abdominal binder postoperatively, particularly in obese patients.

AB  - Introduction: Most trauma societies recommend intubating trauma patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores <= 8 without robust supporting evidence. We examined the association between intubation and 30-d in -hospital mortality in trauma patients arriving with a GCS score <= 8 in an Indian trauma registry. Methods: Outcomes of patients with a GCS score <= 8 who were intubated within 1 h of arrival (intubation group) were compared with those who were intubated later or not at all (nonintubation group) using various analytical approaches. The association was assessed in various subgroup and sensitivity analyses to identify any variability of the effect. Results: Of 3476 patients who arrived with a GCS score <= 8, 1671 (48.1%) were intubated within 1 h. Overall, 1957 (56.3%) patients died, 947 (56.7%) in the intubation group and 1010 (56.0%) in the nonintubation group, with no significant difference in mortality (odds ratio = 1.2 [confidence interval, 0.8-1.8], P value = 0.467) in multivariable regression and propensity score -matched analysis. This result persisted across subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Patients intubated within an hour of arrival had longer durations of ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Intubation within an hour of arrival with a GCS score <= 8 after major trauma was not associated with differences in -hospital mortality. The indications and benefits of early intubation in these severely injured patients should be revisited to promote optimal resource utilization in LMICs. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background Accurate assessments of current and future fertility-including overall trends and changing population age structures across countries and regions-are essential to help plan for the profound social, economic, environmental, and geopolitical challenges that these changes will bring. Estimates and projections of fertility are necessary to inform policies involving resource and health-care needs, labour supply, education, gender equality, and family planning and support. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 produced up-to-date and comprehensive demographic assessments of key fertility indicators at global, regional, and national levels from 1950 to 2021 and forecast fertility metrics to 2100 based on a reference scenario and key policy-dependent alternative scenarios.
   Methods To estimate fertility indicators from 1950 to 2021, mixed-effects regression models and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression were used to synthesise data from 8709 country-years of vital and sample registrations, 1455 surveys and censuses, and 150 other sources, and to generate age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for 5-year age groups from age 10 years to 54 years. ASFRs were summed across age groups to produce estimates of total fertility rate (TFR). Livebirths were calculated by multiplying ASFR and age-specific female population, then summing across ages 10-54 years. To forecast future fertility up to 2100, our Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) forecasting model was based on projections of completed cohort fertility at age 50 years (CCF50; the average number of children born over time to females from a specified birth cohort), which yields more stable and accurate measures of fertility than directly modelling TFR. CCF50 was modelled using an ensemble approach in which three sub-models (with two, three, and four covariates variously consisting of female educational attainment, contraceptive met need, population density in habitable areas, and under-5 mortality) were given equal weights, and analyses were conducted utilising the MR-BRT (meta-regression-Bayesian, regularised, trimmed) tool. To capture time-series trends in CCF50 not explained by these covariates, we used a first-order autoregressive model on the residual term. CCF50 as a proportion of each 5-year ASFR was predicted using a linear mixed-effects model with fixed-effects covariates ( female educational attainment and contraceptive met need) and random intercepts for geographical regions. Projected TFRs were then computed for each calendar year as the sum of single-year ASFRs across age groups. The reference forecast is our estimate of the most likely fertility future given the model, past fertility, forecasts of covariates, and historical relationships between covariates and fertility. We additionally produced forecasts for multiple alternative scenarios in each location: the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for education is achieved by 2030; the contraceptive met need SDG is achieved by 2030; pro-natal policies are enacted to create supportive environments for those who give birth; and the previous three scenarios combined. Uncertainty from past data inputs and model estimation was propagated throughout analyses by taking 1000 draws for past and present fertility estimates and 500 draws for future forecasts from the estimated distribution for each metric, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) given as the 2 center dot 5 and 97 center dot 5 percentiles of the draws. To evaluate the forecasting performance of our model and others, we computed skill values-a metric assessing gain in forecasting accuracy-by comparing predicted versus observed ASFRs from the past 15 years (2007-21). A positive skill metric indicates that the model being evaluated performs better than the baseline model (here, a simplified model holding 2007 values constant in the future), and a negative metric indicates that the evaluated model performs worse than baseline.
   Findings During the period from 1950 to 2021, global TFR more than halved, from 4 center dot 84 (95% UI 4 center dot 63-5 center dot 06) to 2 center dot 23 (2 center dot 09-2 center dot 38). Global annual livebirths peaked in 2016 at 142 million (95% UI 137-147), declining to 129 million (121-138) in 2021. Fertility rates declined in all countries and territories since 1950, with TFR remaining above 2 center dot 1-canonically considered replacement-level fertility-in 94 (46 center dot 1%) countries and territories in 2021. This included 44 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which was the super-region with the largest share of livebirths in 2021 (29 center dot 2% [28 center dot 7-29 center dot 6]). 47 countries and territories in which lowest estimated fertility between 1950 and 2021 was below replacement experienced one or more subsequent years with higher fertility; only three of these locations rebounded above replacement levels. Future fertility rates were projected to continue to decline worldwide, reaching a global TFR of 1 center dot 83 (1 center dot 59-2 center dot 08) in 2050 and 1 center dot 59 (1 center dot 25-1 center dot 96) in 2100 under the reference scenario. The number of countries and territories with fertility rates remaining above replacement was forecast to be 49 (24 center dot 0%) in 2050 and only six (2 center dot 9%) in 2100, with three of these six countries included in the 2021 World Bank-defined low-income group, all located in the GBD super-region of sub-Saharan Africa. The proportion of livebirths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa was forecast to increase to more than half of the world's livebirths in 2100, to 41 center dot 3% (39 center dot 6-43 center dot 1) in 2050 and 54 center dot 3% (47 center dot 1-59 center dot 5) in 2100. The share of livebirths was projected to decline between 2021 and 2100 in most of the six other super-regions-decreasing, for example, in south Asia from 24 center dot 8% (23 center dot 7-25 center dot 8) in 2021 to 16 center dot 7% (14 center dot 3-19 center dot 1) in 2050 and 7 center dot 1% (4 center dot 4-10 center dot 1) in 2100-but was forecast to increase modestly in the north Africa and Middle East and high-income super-regions. Forecast estimates for the alternative combined scenario suggest that meeting SDG targets for education and contraceptive met need, as well as implementing pro-natal policies, would result in global TFRs of 1 center dot 65 (1 center dot 40-1 center dot 92) in 2050 and 1 center dot 62 (1 center dot 35-1 center dot 95) in 2100. The forecasting skill metric values for the IHME model were positive across all age groups, indicating that the model is better than the constant prediction.
   Interpretation Fertility is declining globally, with rates in more than half of all countries and territories in 2021 below replacement level. Trends since 2000 show considerable heterogeneity in the steepness of declines, and only a small number of countries experienced even a slight fertility rebound after their lowest observed rate, with none reaching replacement level. Additionally, the distribution of livebirths across the globe is shifting, with a greater proportion occurring in the lowest-income countries. Future fertility rates will continue to decline worldwide and will remain low even under successful implementation of pro-natal policies. These changes will have far-reaching economic and societal consequences due to ageing populations and declining workforces in higher-income countries, combined with an increasing share of livebirths among the already poorest regions of the world.

AB  - Background Understanding the health consequences associated with exposure to risk factors is necessary to inform public health policy and practice. To systematically quantify the contributions of risk factor exposures to specific health outcomes, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 aims to provide comprehensive estimates of exposure levels, relative health risks, and attributable burden of disease for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, from 1990 to 2021.
   Methods The GBD 2021 risk factor analysis used data from 54 561 total distinct sources to produce epidemiological estimates for 88 risk factors and their associated health outcomes for a total of 631 risk-outcome pairs. Pairs were included on the basis of data-driven determination of a risk-outcome association. Age-sex-location-year-specific estimates were generated at global, regional, and national levels. Our approach followed the comparative risk assessment framework predicated on a causal web of hierarchically organised, potentially combinative, modifiable risks. Relative risks (RRs) of a given outcome occurring as a function of risk factor exposure were estimated separately for each risk-outcome pair, and summary exposure values (SEVs), representing risk-weighted exposure prevalence, and theoretical minimum risk exposure levels (TMRELs) were estimated for each risk factor. These estimates were used to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF; ie, the proportional change in health risk that would occur if exposure to a risk factor were reduced to the TMREL). The product of PAFs and disease burden associated with a given outcome, measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), yielded measures of attributable burden (ie, the proportion of total disease burden attributable to a particular risk factor or combination of risk factors). Adjustments for mediation were applied to account for relationships involving risk factors that act indirectly on outcomes via intermediate risks. Attributable burden estimates were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile and presented as counts, age-standardised rates, and rankings. To complement estimates of RR and attributable burden, newly developed burden of proof risk function (BPRF) methods were applied to yield supplementary, conservative interpretations of risk-outcome associations based on the consistency of underlying evidence, accounting for unexplained heterogeneity between input data from different studies. Estimates reported represent the mean value across 500 draws from the estimate's distribution, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) calculated as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile values across the draws.
   Findings Among the specific risk factors analysed for this study, particulate matter air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, contributing 8.0% (95% UI 6.7-9.4) of total DALYs, followed by high systolic blood pressure (SBP; 7.8% [6.4-9.2]), smoking (5.7% [4.7-6.8]), low birthweight and short gestation (5.6% [4.8-6.3]), and high fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 5.4% [4.8-6.0]). For younger demographics (ie, those aged 0-4 years and 5-14 years), risks such as low birthweight and short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high SBP, high body-mass index (BMI), high FPG, and high LDL cholesterol had a greater impact. From 2000 to 2021, there was an observable shift in global health challenges, marked by a decline in the number of all-age DALYs broadly attributable to behavioural risks (decrease of 20.7% [13.9-27.7]) and environmental and occupational risks (decrease of 22.0% [15.5-28.8]), coupled with a 49.4% (42.3-56.9) increase in DALYs attributable to metabolic risks, all reflecting ageing populations and changing lifestyles on a global scale. Age-standardised global DALY rates attributable to high BMI and high FPG rose considerably (15.7% [9.9-21.7] for high BMI and 7.9% [3.3-12.9] for high FPG) over this period, with exposure to these risks increasing annually at rates of 1.8% (1.6-1.9) for high BMI and 1.3% (1.1-1.5) for high FPG. By contrast, the global risk-attributable burden and exposure to many other risk factors declined, notably for risks such as child growth failure and unsafe water source, with age-standardised attributable DALYs decreasing by 71.5% (64.4-78.8) for child growth failure and 66.3% (60.2-72.0) for unsafe water source. We separated risk factors into three groups according to trajectory over time: those with a decreasing attributable burden, due largely to declining risk exposure (eg, diet high in trans-fat and household air pollution) but also to proportionally smaller child and youth populations (eg, child and maternal malnutrition); those for which the burden increased moderately in spite of declining risk exposure, due largely to population ageing (eg, smoking); and those for which the burden increased considerably due to both increasing risk exposure and population ageing (eg, ambient particulate matter air pollution, high BMI, high FPG, and high SBP).
   Interpretation Substantial progress has been made in reducing the global disease burden attributable to a range of risk factors, particularly those related to maternal and child health, WaSH, and household air pollution. Maintaining efforts to minimise the impact of these risk factors, especially in low SDI locations, is necessary to sustain progress. Successes in moderating the smoking-related burden by reducing risk exposure highlight the need to advance policies that reduce exposure to other leading risk factors such as ambient particulate matter air pollution and high SBP. Troubling increases in high FPG, high BMI, and other risk factors related to obesity and metabolic syndrome indicate an urgent need to identify and implement interventions.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a common plasticizer, is categorized as a neurotoxic compound. Its impact on individuals exhibits sex-linked variations. Several biological and environmental factors impact the degree of toxicity. Moreover, nutritional factors have profound influence on toxicity outcome. BPA has been demonstrated to be an obesogen. However, research on the potential role of obesity as a confounding factor in BPA toxicity is lacking. We studied the neurodegenerative effects in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese female rats after exposure to BPA (10 mg/L via drinking water for 90 days). Four groups were taken in this study - Control, HFD, HFD + BPA and BPA. Cognitive function was evaluated through novel object recognition (NOR) test. Inflammatory changes in brain, and changes in hormonal level, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, oxidative stress, and antioxidants were also determined. HFD + BPA group rats showed a significant decline in memory function in NOR test. The cerebral cortex (CC) of the brain showed increased neurodegenerative changes as measured by microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) accompanied by histopathological confirmation. The increased level of neuroinflammation was demonstrated by microglial activation (Iba-1) and protein expression of nuclear factor- kappa B (NF-& Kcy;B) in the brain. Obesity also caused significant (p < 0.05) increase in lipid peroxidation accompanied by reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione S-transferase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and decrease in reduced-glutathione (p < 0.05) when compared to non-obese rats with BPA treatment. Overall, study revealed that obesity serves as a risk factor in the toxicity of BPA which may exacerbate the progression of neurological diseases.

AB  - Background Regular, detailed reporting on population health by underlying cause of death is fundamental for public health decision making. Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations.
   Methods The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds.
   Findings The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94.0 deaths (95% UI 89.2-100.0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271.0 deaths [250.1-290.7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195.4 deaths [182.1-211.4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48.1 deaths [47.4-48.8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23.2 deaths [16.3-37.2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1.6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8.3 years (6.7-9.9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0.4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3.6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles.
   Interpretation Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

AB  - Background Estimates of demographic metrics are crucial to assess levels and trends of population health outcomes. The profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations worldwide has underscored the need for timely estimates to understand this unprecedented event within the context of long-term population health trends. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 provides new demographic estimates for 204 countries and territories and 811 additional subnational locations from 1950 to 2021, with a particular emphasis on changes in mortality and life expectancy that occurred during the 2020-21 COVID-19 pandemic period.
   Methods 22 223 data sources from vital registration, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources were used to estimate mortality, with a subset of these sources used exclusively to estimate excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2026 data sources were used for population estimation. Additional sources were used to estimate migration; the effects of the HIV epidemic; and demographic discontinuities due to conflicts, famines, natural disasters, and pandemics, which are used as inputs for estimating mortality and population. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate under-5 mortality rates, which synthesised 30 763 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 1365 surveys and censuses, and 80 other sources. ST-GPR was also used to estimate adult mortality (between ages 15 and 59 years) based on information from 31 642 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 355 surveys and censuses, and 24 other sources. Estimates of child and adult mortality rates were then used to generate life tables with a relational model life table system. For countries with large HIV epidemics, life tables were adjusted using independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated via an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, and other data sources. Excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 was determined by subtracting observed all-cause mortality (adjusted for late registration and mortality anomalies) from the mortality expected in the absence of the pandemic. Expected mortality was calculated based on historical trends using an ensemble of models. In location-years where all-cause mortality data were unavailable, we estimated excess mortality rates using a regression model with covariates pertaining to the pandemic. Population size was computed using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model. Life expectancy was calculated using age-specific mortality rates and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution.
   Findings Global all-cause mortality followed two distinct patterns over the study period: age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1950 and 2019 (a 62 center dot 8% [95% UI 60 center dot 5-65 center dot 1] decline), and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-21; 5 center dot 1% [0 center dot 9-9 center dot 6] increase). In contrast with the overall reverse in mortality trends during the pandemic period, child mortality continued to decline, with 4 center dot 66 million (3 center dot 98-5 center dot 50) global deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2021 compared with 5 center dot 21 million (4 center dot 50-6 center dot 01) in 2019. An estimated 131 million (126-137) people died globally from all causes in 2020 and 2021 combined, of which 15 center dot 9 million (14 center dot 7-17 center dot 2) were due to the COVID-19 pandemic (measured by excess mortality, which includes deaths directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those indirectly due to other social, economic, or behavioural changes associated with the pandemic). Excess mortality rates exceeded 150 deaths per 100 000 population during at least one year of the pandemic in 80 countries and territories, whereas 20 nations had a negative excess mortality rate in 2020 or 2021, indicating that all-cause mortality in these countries was lower during the pandemic than expected based on historical trends. Between 1950 and 2021, global life expectancy at birth increased by 22 center dot 7 years (20 center dot 8-24 center dot 8), from 49 center dot 0 years (46 center dot 7-51 center dot 3) to 71 center dot 7 years (70 center dot 9-72 center dot 5). Global life expectancy at birth declined by 1 center dot 6 years (1 center dot 0-2 center dot 2) between 2019 and 2021, reversing historical trends. An increase in life expectancy was only observed in 32 (15 center dot 7%) of 204 countries and territories between 2019 and 2021. The global population reached 7 center dot 89 billion (7 center dot 67-8 center dot 13) people in 2021, by which time 56 of 204 countries and territories had peaked and subsequently populations have declined. The largest proportion of population growth between 2020 and 2021 was in sub-Saharan Africa (39 center dot 5% [28 center dot 4-52 center dot 7]) and south Asia (26 center dot 3% [9 center dot 0-44 center dot 7]). From 2000 to 2021, the ratio of the population aged 65 years and older to the population aged younger than 15 years increased in 188 (92 center dot 2%) of 204 nations.
   Interpretation Global adult mortality rates markedly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, reversing past decreasing trends, while child mortality rates continued to decline, albeit more slowly than in earlier years. Although COVID-19 had a substantial impact on many demographic indicators during the first 2 years of the pandemic, overall global health progress over the 72 years evaluated has been profound, with considerable improvements in mortality and life expectancy. Additionally, we observed a deceleration of global population growth since 2017, despite steady or increasing growth in lower-income countries, combined with a continued global shift of population age structures towards older ages. These demographic changes will likely present future challenges to health systems, economies, and societies. The comprehensive demographic estimates reported here will enable researchers, policy makers, health practitioners, and other key stakeholders to better understand and address the profound changes that have occurred in the global health landscape following the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and longer-term trends beyond the pandemic.

AB  - There is an arising need for effective wound dressings that retain the bioactivity of a cellular treatment, but without the high costs and complexities associated with manufacturing, storing, and applying cell-based products. As skin wound recovery is a dynamic and complicated process, a significant obstacle to the healing of skin wounds is the lack of an appropriate wound dressing that can imitate the microenvironment of healthy skin and prevent bacterial infection. It requires the well-orchestrated integration of biological and molecular events. In this study, we have fabricated full-thickness skin graft biocomposite membranes to target full-thickness skin excision wounds. We reinforced human amniotic membrane (hAM) with electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) to develop composite membranes, namely, PCL/hAM and PCL/hAM/PCL. Composite membranes were compared for physical, biological, and mechanical properties with the native counterpart. PCL/hAM and PCL/hAM/PCL displayed improved stability and delayed degradation, which further synergically improved the rapid wound healing property of hAM, driven primarily by wound closure analysis and histological assessment. Moreover, PCL/hAM displayed a comparable cellular interaction to hAM. On application as a wound dressing, histological analysis demonstrated that hAM and PCL/hAM promoted early epidermis and dermis formation. Studies on in vivo wound healing revealed that although hAM accelerates cell development, the overall wound healing process is similar in PCL/hAM. This finding is further supported by the immunohistochemical analysis of COL-1/COL-3, CD-31, and TGF-beta. Overall, this conjugated PCL and hAM-based membrane has considerable potential to be applied in skin wound healing. The facile fabrication of the PCL/hAM composite membrane provided the self-regenerating wound dressing with the desired mechanical strength as an ideal regenerative property for skin tissue regeneration.

AB  - Aim: To assess the prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors among the nursing staff and educate them on prevention. Background: Nursing staff is integral to the Indian community healthcare systems. Recent studies report a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases in Indian nursing staff. Therefore, data on the prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors among nursing staff are crucial for education on prevention. Design: A cross-sectional digital survey-based study. Method: We invited 4435 nursing staff to attend our online survey. We used a customized questionnaire for data collection, including a digitized version of the Community-Based Assessment Checklist form. A score of >4 was considered high risk and warranted screening. Result: Among 682 nursing staff who attended, 70% had never undergone screening for non-communicable diseases. The prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors was significantly higher in male nursing staff. In addition, logistic regression analysis showed that age, tobacco and alcohol use, increased waist circumference, physical inactivity and family history of non-communicable diseases were significant risk factors among nursing staff. Conclusion: The study findings suggest that the nursing staff have suboptimal self-health concerns on non-communicable diseases. This situation warrants continued medical education, awareness campaigns on adopting a healthy lifestyle and health promotion.

AB  - BackgroundSubacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a complication of measles, occurring after a latency of 4-10 years. It continues to occur in developing countries although resurgence is being reported from developed countries. Characteristic features include progressive neuropsychiatric issues, myoclonus, seizures, movement disorders and visual impairment. Electroencephalography (EEG) typically shows periodic generalized discharges, and elevated CSF anti-measles antibodies are diagnostic. Movement disorders are being increasingly recognized as part of the clinical spectrum, and range from hyperkinetic (chorea, dystonia, tremor, tics) to hypokinetic (parkinsonism) disorders and ataxia.ObjectivesThis article aims to comprehensively review the spectrum of movement disorders associated with SSPE.MethodsA literature search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE databases in December 2023 and articles were identified for review.ResultsMovement disorders reported in SSPE included hyperkinetic (chorea, dystonia, tremor and tics), hypokinetic (parkinsonism), ataxia and extraocular movement disorders. Myoclonus, a core clinical feature, was the most frequent "abnormal movement." Movement disorders were observed in all clinical stages, and could also be a presenting feature, even sans myoclonus. Hyperkinetic movement disorders were more common than hypokinetic movement disorders. An evolution of movement disorders was observed, with ataxia, chorea and dystonia occurring earlier, and parkinsonism later in the disease. Neuroradiological correlates of movement disorders remained unclear.ConclusionA wide spectrum of movement disorders was observed throughout the clinical stages of SSPE. Most data were derived from case reports and small case series. Multicentric longitudinal studies are required to better delineate the spectrum and evolution of movement disorders in SSPE.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a significant global issue in terms of public health. While it is largely associated with respiratory complications, recent reports indicate that patients also experience neurological symptoms and other health issues. The objective of this study is to examine the network of protein-protein interactions (PPI) between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human host proteins, pinpoint the central genes within this network implicated in disease pathology, and assess their viability as targets for drug development. The study adopts a network-based approach to construct a network of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins interacting with 2896 host proteins, with 176 host genes being identified as interacting genes with all the viral proteins. Gene ontology and pathway analysis of these host proteins revealed their role in biological processes such as translation, mRNA splicing, and ribosomal pathways. We further identified EEF2, RPS3, RPL9, RPS16, and RPL11 as the top 5 most connected hub genes in the disease-causing network, with significant interactions among each other. These hub genes were found to be involved in ribosomal pathways and cytoplasmic translation. Further a diseasegene interaction was also prepared to investigate the role of hub genes in other disorders and to understand the condition of comorbidity in COVID-19 patients. We also identified 13 drug molecules having interactions with all the hub genes, and estradiol emerged as the top potential drug target for the COVID-19 patients. Our study provides valuable insights using the proteinprotein interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with host proteins and highlights the molecular basis of manifestation of COVID-19 and proposes drug for repurposing. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is anticipated that investigating SARS-CoV-2 proteins will remain a critical area of focus for researchers globally, particularly in addressing potential challenges posed by specific SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future.

AB  - A 12-year-old girl born to third-degree consanguineous parents presented with 2 years of progressive dystonia starting in both lower limbs followed by upper limbs, along with dysarthria, numbness, and bladder incontinence. Examination revealed dystonia, spasticity, and brisk reflexes. MRI brain showed T2-weighted and susceptibility-weighted imaging hypointensity in bilateral globus pallidi (Figure, A and B) with sparing of the medial medullary lamina and hypointensity in substantia nigra (Figure, C and D). Clinicoradiologic differentials included neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation-mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN), pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration, PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration, and fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration.1 Next generation sequencing revealed a contiguous 12.217 kb homozygous deletion in exon 1-3 of C19ORF12 gene (ENST00000323670.14). This likely pathogenic, loss-of-function autosomal recessive variant confirmed MPAN. Clinical presentation encompasses progressive dystonia, spasticity, dysphagia, dysarthria, axonal neuropathy, optic atrophy, parkinsonism, and bowel/bladder incontinence.2 Medial medullary lamina-sparing mineral deposition is a characteristic feature of MPAN.1 Treatment is symptomatic. Trials with iron chelators have been unsatisfactory.2

AB  - Background Perianal fistulas (PF) affect one-third patients with Crohn's disease (CD) with limited therapeutic options. There is dearth of literature on safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) in this population. Methods An open-label, phase I/II, single-arm study was conducted involving local administration of human allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in perianal fistula of patients with Crohn's disease refractory to standard therapies. Clinical severity and biomarkers were assessed at baseline and periodically until week 104 , and MRI at week 24 and 104. Primary and secondary objectives were to assess safety and efficacy respectively. Fistula remission was complete closure of fistula openings with < 2 cm perianal collection on MRI, and fistula response was decrease in drainage by >= 50%. Change in perianal disease activity index, quality-of-life and Van Assche index on MRI over time was assessed using mixed-effect linear regression model. Results Ten patients (male:8, mean age:27.4 +/- 12.0years) were recruited. Self-resolving procedure-related adverse events occurred in three patients, with no follow-up adverse events. In intention to treat analysis at week 24, two patients (20%) achieved fistula remission and seven (70%) had fistula response. At week 52, two (20%) patients were in remission and seven (70%) maintained response. At 104 weeks, two (20%) patients maintained response and one (10%) was in remission. Statistically significant decrease in perianal disease activity index (P = 0.008), Van Assche Index (P = 0.008) and improvement in quality-of-life (P = 0.001) were observed over time. Conclusions Allogeneic BMSCs are safe and effective for the treatment of perianal fistulizing CD with significant improvement in clinical severity and radiological healing.

AB  - Purpose Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common clinical problem that is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes attributed to the oxidative stress due to sympathetic overstimulation. Treatment approaches targeting oxidative stress have been tried by multiple investigators. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of such approaches. Methods Pubmed and Embase databases were searched for human studies evaluating the utility of antioxidant therapies in patients with OSA. Results A total of six studies (five randomized trials and one case-control study) were included, including 160 patients with OSA using N-acetyl cysteine, vitamin C, carbocysteine, superoxide dismutase, vitamin E, allopurinol, and their combinations. There was a significant improvement in flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) following antioxidants, with the pooled effect being 2.16 % (95% CI 1.65-2.67) using the random-effects model (I2 = 0% and p<0.001). It was also associated with a significant reduction in malondialdehyde levels and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. There was also a significant improvement in the Epworth sleepiness scale, oxygen desaturation index, and minimum oxygen saturation during sleep without any significant adverse effects. Conclusion Antioxidant therapy in patients with OSA is associated with improved endothelial function, reduced oxidative stress, and improved sleep parameters. These results call for future multicentre studies with longer follow-ups to assess the utility of antioxidant therapy in patients with OSA.

AB  - Ultrasound imaging or sonomyography has been found to be a robust modality for measuring muscle activity due to its ability to image deep-seated muscles directly while providing superior spatiotemporal specificity compared with surface electromyography-based techniques. Quantifying the morphological changes during muscle activity involves computationally expensive approaches for tracking muscle anatomical structures or extracting features from brightness-mode (B-mode) images and amplitude-mode signals. This article uses an offline regression convolutional neural network called SonoMyoNet to estimate continuous isometric force from sparse ultrasound scanlines. SonoMyoNet learns features from a few equispaced scanlines selected from B-mode images and utilizes the learned features to estimate continuous isometric force accurately. The performance of SonoMyoNet was evaluated by varying the number of scanlines to simulate the placement of multiple single-element ultrasound transducers in a wearable system. Results showed that SonoMyoNet could accurately predict isometric force with just four scanlines and is immune to speckle noise and shifts in the scanline location. Thus, the proposed network reduces the computational load involved in feature tracking algorithms and estimates muscle force from the global features of sparse ultrasound images.

AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent vaginal illness resulting from a disruption in the vaginal microbial equilibrium. The vaginal microbiota has been shown to have a substantial impact on the development and continuation of BV. This work utilized 16S rRNA sequence analysis of vaginal microbiome samples (Control vs BV samples) utilizing Parallel-Meta 3 to investigate the variations in microbial composition. The unique genes identified were used to determine prospective therapeutic targets and their corresponding inhibitory ligands. Further, molecular docking was conducted and then MD simulations were carried out to confirm the docking outcomes. In the BV samples, we detected several anaerobic bacteria recognized for their ability to generate biofilms, namely Acetohalobium, Anaerolineaceae, Desulfobacteraceae, and others. Furthermore, we identified Dalfopristin, Clorgyline, and Hydrazine as potential therapeutic options for the management of BV. This research provides new insights into the causes of BV and shows the potential effectiveness of novel pharmacological treatments.

AB  - At present, there is no internationally accepted set of core outcomes or measurement methods for epilepsy clinical practice. Therefore, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) convened an international working group of experts in epilepsy, people with epilepsy and their representatives to develop minimum sets of standardized outcomes and outcomes measurement methods for clinical practice that support patient-clinician decision-making and quality improvement. Consensus methods identified 20 core outcomes. Measurement tools were recommended based on their evidence of strong clinical measurement properties, feasibility, and cross-cultural applicability. The essential outcomes included many non-seizure outcomes: anxiety, depression, suicidality, memory and attention, sleep quality, functional status, and the social impact of epilepsy. The proposed set will facilitate the implementation of the use of patient-centered outcomes in daily practice, ensuring holistic care. They also encourage harmonization of outcome measurement, and if widely implemented should reduce the heterogeneity of outcome measurement, accelerate comparative research, and facilitate quality improvement efforts.

AB  - Nosocomial outbreak of varicella zoster virus (VZV) has been reported when susceptible individuals encounter a case of chicken pox or shingles. A suspected VZV outbreak was investigated in a 50-bedded in-patient facility of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in a tertiary care multispecialty hospital. A 30-year-old female patient admitted with Pott's spine was clinically diagnosed with chicken pox on 31 December 2022. The following week, four more cases were identified in the same ward. All cases were diagnosed as laboratory-confirmed varicella zoster infection by PCR. Primary case was a housekeeping staff who was clinically diagnosed with chicken pox 3 weeks prior (9 December 2022). He returned to work on eighth day of infection (17 December 2022) after apparent clinical recovery but before the lesions had crusted over. Thirty-one HCWs were identified as contacts a and three had no evidence of immunity. Two of these susceptible HCWs had onset of chickenpox shortly after first dose of VZV vaccination was inoculated. All cases recovered after treatment with no reported complications. VZV infection is highly contagious in healthcare settings with susceptible populations. Prompt identification of cases and implementation of infection prevention and control measures like patient isolation and vaccination are essential for the containment of outbreaks.

AB  - Objectives: Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found in a wide range of foods, including fruits, vegetables, tea plants, and other natural products. They have been mainly classified as flavanols, flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavanones, and flavanonols. In this comprehensive review, we will discuss preclinical pieces of evidence on the potential of flavonoids for the prevention/treatment of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Key findings: In-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that flavonoids play an important role in preventing ischemic heart disease (IHD). They possess strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-thrombotic, antiapoptotic, and anti-carcinogenic activities. In addition, at a molecular level, flavonoids also modulate various pathways like MAPK, NF kappa B etc. to confer beneficial effects. Summary: The current review of flavonoids in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury furnishes updated information that could drive future research. The in-vitro and in-vivo experiments have demonstrated various favourable pharmacological properties of flavonoids. This review provides valuable information to conduct clinical studies, validating the safety aspects of flavonoids in the clinical domain.

AB  - Preeclampsia is an important cause of heart failure during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The aim of this review is to elucidate the pathophysiology and clinical features of preeclamptic heart failure and describe the medical and anesthetic management of these high-risk parturients. This article reviews the current evidence base regarding preeclamptic heart failure and its pathophysiology, types, and clinical features. We also describe the medical and anesthetic management of these patients during the peripartum period. Heart failure due to preeclampsia can present as either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. The management strategies of systolic heart failure include dietary salt restriction, diuresis, and cautious use of beta-blockers and vasodilators. Diuretics are the mainstay in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. In the absence of obstetric indications, vaginal delivery is the safest mode of delivery in these high-risk patients, and the use of an early labor epidural for analgesia is recommended. These patients would require increased invasive monitoring during labor and vaginal delivery. Neuraxial and general anesthesia have been used successfully for cesarean section in these patients but require crucial modifications of the standard technique. Uterotonic drugs have significant cardiovascular and pulmonary effects, and a clear understanding of these is essential during the management of these patients. Preeclamptics with heart failure require individualized peripartum care, as cardiac decompensation is an important risk factor for maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. These high-risk parturients benefit from timely multidisciplinary team inputs and collaborated management.

AB  - Background: Pilocytic astrocytoma (PAs) represents a significant portion of childhood primary brain tumors, with distinct histological and radiological features. The prevalence of KIAA1549::BRAF fusion in PAs has been well-established, this study aims to assess the prevalence of KIAA1549::BRAF fusions and explore their associations with tumor characteristics, radiological findings, and patient outcomes in PAs. Methods: Histologically confirmed cases of PAs from a 5-year period were included in the study. Demographic, histopathological, and radiological data were collected, and immunohistochemistry was performed to characterize tumor markers. FISH and qRT-PCR assays were employed to detect KIAA1549::BRAF fusions. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine associations between fusion status and various other parameters. Results: Histological analysis revealed no significant differences in tumor features based on fusion status. However, younger age groups showed higher fusion prevalence. Radiologically, fusion-positive cases were distributed across different tumor subtypes SE, CWE and NCWE. Survival analysis did not demonstrate a significant impact of fusion status on overall survival, however most cases with recurrence and death harboured KIAA1549::BRAF fusion. Of 200 PAs, KIAA1549::BRAF fusions were detected in 64 % and 74 % of cases via qRT-PCR and FISH, respectively. Concordance between the two platforms was substantial (86 %). Conclusion: KIAA1549::BRAF fusions are prevalent in PAs and can be reliably detected using both FISH and qRTPCR assays. Cost considerations suggest qRT-PCR as a more economical option for fusion detection in routine clinical practice.

AB  - <black square> BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disease characterized by progressive stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. As a result of chronically decreased brain perfusion, eloquent areas of the brain become hypoperfused, leading to cognitive changes in patients. Repeated infarcts and bleeds produce clinically apparent neurologic deficits . <black square> OBJECTIVES: 1) To study the functional and neuropsychological outcome in MMD after revascularization surgery. 2) To find postrevascularization correlation between functional and neuropsychological improvement and radiologic improvement. <black square> METHODS: A single-center prospective and analytic study was carried out including 21 patients with MMD during the study period from March 2021 to December 2022. Patients were evaluated and compared before and after revascularization for functional, neuropsychological, and radiologic status. <black square> RESULTS: Postoperative functional outcome in terms of modified Rankin Scale score showed improvement in 33.33% of cases (P P = 0.0769). An overall improving trend was observed in different neuropsychological domains in both adult and pediatric age groups. However, the trend of neuropsychological improvement was better in adults compared with pediatric patients. Radiologic outcome in the form of the Angiographic Outcome Score (AOS) significantly improved after revascularization (P P = 0.0001). There was a trend toward improvement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion in the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery territories, 4.7% (P P = 0.075) and 9.33% (P P = 0.058) respectively, compared with preoperative MRI perfusion. <black square> CONCLUSIONS: After revascularization, significant improvement occurred in functional and neuropsychological status. This result was also shown radiologically as evidenced by improvement in MRI perfusion and cerebral angiography.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEAs) to petroclival chondrosarcomas (PCs) require a thorough understanding of skullbase anatomy, especially the anatomy of petrous internal carotid artery (pICA), as ICA injury is the most dreaded complication of extended EEAs. We conducted this study to determine the displacement patterns of pICA in patients with PCs. METHODS: Contrast enhanced computed tomography scan and angiography images of patients with PCs were analyzed for following parameters-antero-posterior, cranio-caudal, medio -lateral, and direct distances between anterior genu of petrous internal carotid artery (AGpICA) and posterior end of Vidian canal (pVC). pICA encasement/ narrowing by tumor was noted on magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: We studied 11 patients with histopathologically proven PCs. pICA encasement/narrowing and pVC destruction were observed in one patient each. The mean antero-posterior and cranio-caudal distances on tumor side/normal side were 7.7 +/- 1.9/6.4 +/- 1.0 mm & 4.5 +/- 1.5/3.4 +/- 0.9 mm, respectively. The overall displacement was posterior & superior. Medio -lateral displacement was seen in 4 patients (lateral in 3 and medial in 1). In rest, AGpICA was centered on pVC. The mean direct distance was 9.4 +/- 2.5 mm. In 3 patients with displacement seen in all three axes, direct distance was measured by the "cuboid method. " Overall, posterior-superior-lateral, posterior-superior, and anterior-inferior were the common displacement patterns of AGpICA relative to pVC. CONCLUSIONS: The displacement patterns of AGpICA in PCs are variable. An individualized approach with meticu lous analysis of preoperative imaging can help in determining the relation between AGpICA and pVC. This detailed morphometric information can facilitate better orientation to altered anatomy, which can be helpful in preventing pICA injury during extended EEAs.

AB  - Background Current clinical diagnosis pathway for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) involves sequential biochemical enzymatic tests followed by DNA sequencing, which is iterative, has low diagnostic yield and is costly due to overlapping clinical presentations. Here, we describe a novel low-cost and high-throughput sequencing assay using single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs) to screen for causative single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) in genes associated with 29 common LSDs in India.Results 903 smMIPs were designed to target exon and exon-intron boundaries of targeted genes (n = 23; 53.7 kb of the human genome) and were equimolarly pooled to create a sequencing library. After extensive validation in a cohort of 50 patients, we screened 300 patients with either biochemical diagnosis (n = 187) or clinical suspicion (n = 113) of LSDs. A diagnostic yield of 83.4% was observed in patients with prior biochemical diagnosis of LSD. Furthermore, diagnostic yield of 73.9% (n = 54/73) was observed in patients with high clinical suspicion of LSD in contrast with 2.4% (n = 1/40) in patients with low clinical suspicion of LSD. In addition to detecting SNVs, the assay could detect single and multi-exon copy number variants with high confidence. Critically, Niemann-Pick disease type C and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-6 diseases for which biochemical testing is unavailable, could be diagnosed using our assay. Lastly, we observed a non-inferior performance of the assay in DNA extracted from dried blood spots in comparison with whole blood.Conclusion We developed a flexible and scalable assay to reliably detect genetic causes of 29 common LSDs in India. The assay consolidates the detection of multiple variant types in multiple sample types while having improved diagnostic yield at same or lower cost compared to current clinical paradigm.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rapidly emerging in the Asia Pacific region. However, there are many challenges in the diagnosis and management of this condition. The Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) Working Group on IBD conducted a round table meeting to identify 10 common mistakes in the management of IBD in Asia. To summarize, many physicians still over rely on a definitive histological diagnosis before starting treatment and do not fully establish disease extent such as perianal and proximal gastrointestinal involvement in Crohn's disease (CD) or extent of involvement in ulcerative colitis (UC). It is also essential to actively look for evidence of extra-intestinal manifestations, which may influence choice of therapy. In terms of conventional therapy, underuse of topical 5 aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) in UC and inappropriate dosing of corticosteroids are also important considerations. Acute severe UC remains a life-threatening condition and delay in starting rescue therapy after inadequate response to intravenous steroids is still common. Anti-tumor necrosis factors should be considered first line in all cases of complex perianal fistulizing CD. Most patients with IBD are on potent immunosuppressive therapy and should be screened for latent infections and offered vaccinations according to guidelines. Under-recognition and management of significant complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, malnutrition, and thromboembolism should also be addressed. Colonoscopy is still not properly performed for dysplasia/cancer surveillance and for evaluating post-op recurrence of CD. Another common misstep is inappropriate withdrawal of medications during pregnancy leading to increased complications for the mother and the newborn.

AB  - Purpose: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is largely studied in healthcare settings. There is a need to understand the fluctuations in AMR during pandemic at the community level. With urinary tract infection (UTI) being one of the most common infections in the community, the AMR profile of community-acquired UTI (CA-UTI) is considered representative AMR at the community level. Methods: The study was taken in a cohort of patients with a clinical diagnosis of CA-UTI. The four study sites represented different community health centres in India. Escherichia coli isolates were analysed phenotypically and genotypically for AMR pre-COVID (October 2019-February 2020) and in the first (March 2020-February 2021) and second waves of COVID-19 (March 2021-December 2021). Results: E. coli was the predominant uropathogen (229, 82%). Increased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin was observed during the pandemic. Reduced susceptibility to first-line oral antibiotics and carbapenems was seen during the second wave, and an increased minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50 ) to betalactams and fluoroquinolones was seen during the pandemic. Genomic analysis of E. coli isolates showed some AMR genes ( aacC1, aacC4, SHV, QepA ) only during the second wave. Conclusion: One good outcome of the pandemic was increased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin, while drawback was a significant decrease in susceptibility to oral antibiotics during the second wave and increased MIC50 of some antibiotics. Decreased susceptibility to last-resort carbapenems and the occurrence of various AMR genes during the second wave of the pandemic are of great concern. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The availability of syndrome-based panels for various ailments has widened the scope of diagnostics in many clinical settings. These panels can detect a multitude of pathogens responsible for a particular condition, which can lead to a timely diagnosis and better treatment outcomes. In contrast to traditional identification methods based on pathogen growth on culture, syndrome-based panels offer a quicker diagnosis, which can be especially beneficial in situations requiring urgent care, such as intensive care units. One such panel is the Biofire Filmarray Pneumonia plus Panel (BFP), which we have compared against microbiological culture and identification. The lower respiratory samples from patients were tested with BFP, culture, and identification with culture considered the gold standard. The phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility results (Vitek 2) were compared with the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes detected in BFP. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad 7.0 and MS Excel (Microsoft Inc.). The results showed a positive percent agreement of 100% and a negative percent agreement of 47.8% with an overall agreement of 76.72% compared to culture. BFP was better at identifying fastidious bacteria, and the agreement with culture was higher for high bacterial identification numbers (107 and 106). There was also a correlation between the number of pathogens detected and growth in culture. Carbapenemase genes were detected in around 80% of phenotypically resistant samples and correlated with in-house PCR 60% of the time. Hence, BFP results need to be interpreted with caution especially when multiple pathogens are detected. Similarly, the presence or absence of AMR genes should be used to guide the therapy while being watchful of unusual resistance or susceptibility. The cost constraints and low throughput call for patient selection criteria and prioritization in emergency or resource-limited conditions. IMPORTANCE Application of syndrome-based panels in clinical microbiology is of huge support in infectious conditions requiring urgent interventions, such as pneumonia. Interpreting the results requires caution; hence, we have compared the results obtained from Biofire Filmarray Pneumonia plus Panel with standard microbiological methods.

AB  - The Drosophila larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) shares many similarities with the spinal cord of vertebrates and has emerged as a major model for understanding the development and function of motor systems. Here, we use high -quality scRNA-seq, validated by anatomical identification, to create a comprehensive census of larval VNC cell types. We show that the neural lineages that comprise the adult VNC are already defined, but quiescent, at the larval stage. Using fluorescence -activated cell sorting (FACS)-enriched populations, we separate all motor neuron bundles and link individual neuron clusters to morphologically characterized known subtypes. We discovered a glutamate receptor subunit required for basal neurotransmission and homeostasis at the larval neuromuscular junction. We describe larval glia and endorse the general view that glia perform consistent activities throughout development. This census represents an extensive resource and a powerful platform for future discoveries of cellular and molecular mechanisms in repair, regeneration, plasticity, homeostasis, and behavioral coordination.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the status of physical fitness, reproductive abnormalities, QOL and epilepsy associated stigma in women with epilepsy (WWE) and their association with ASM therapy and seizure frequency. Methods: This cross-sectional study included WWE of reproductive age (18 -50 years) on antiseizure medications (ASMs) for at least three months before enrolment. Physical fitness was assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) and Body composition analysis. Subjects were interviewed for menstrual abnormalities [menstrual disturbance or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)/hirsutism]. Validated questionnaires were used for assessment of, QOL (QOLIE-10) and Stigma in epilepsy (Epilepsy Stigma Scale). Sub-group analysis was done to compare the above parameters on the basis of a) type of therapy (mono or polytherapy), b) type of ASMs treatment (conventional, newer, or conventional + newer ASMs), and c) seizure type and (d) seizure frequency. Correlation and regression analysis were done to find out the association among different variables with physical fitness. Results: The overall prevalence of poor physical fitness, reproductive abnormalities, worsened QOL and stigma in the enrolled WWE (n = 203) were 21.18 %, 20.19 %, 52.7 %, and 21.67 %, respectively. Sub-group analysis revealed that WWE on monotherapy (n = 99) had higher median IPAQ score (p = 0.002), comparatively less reproductive abnormalities (24.03 %, p = 0.008), and higher stigma (24.03 %, p = 0.04) than polytherapy group. WWE on conventional ASMs had significantly higher IPAQ scores compared to newer and conventional + newer ASMs groups (p = 0.02). The prevalence of poor physical fitness and stigma was significantly higher in WWE with higher number of seizures (p = 0.007, <0.001, respectively). No significant difference in QOL was observed on the basis of ASM type and therapy; however, WWE with generalized onset seizures had worsened QOL compared to those with focal onset seizures (p = 0.04). A significant negative correlation was found among seizure frequency and IPAQ score in WWE (p = 0.04). Conclusion: WWE on polytherapy were physically less active, higher occurrence of reproductive abnormalities, and stigma compared to the monotherapy group. WWE with higher seizure frequency had poor physical fitness, and higher stigma compared to those with lesser number of seizures. These findings may aid value in optimization of ASM treatment in WWE of reproductive age.

AB  - In an exploration of novel spirooxindole-pyrrolidine/spirooxindole-pyrrolizine-based compounds as antimicrobial and antitubercular agents, we have prepared a new series of pharmacologically privileged substructures, i.e., chalcone-isatin based spirooxindole compounds 12a-j, 13a-e, 14a-d, and 15-16 which were derived by the reaction of various substituted amino acids 11a-d, respectively, substituted chalcone (Me, OMe, Cl) 10a-m and isatins 9a-b via one-pot three-component [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. We also report the SAR, and in silico molecular docking studies of 12a-j, 13a-e, 14a-d, and 15. While compared to the standard drug ampicillin (MIC = 25 mu g/mL), compounds 13c, 13e, 14a, and 15 (MIC = 12.5 mu g/mL) have shown to be twice as potent against the Bacillus subtilis [BS] bacterial strain. Compounds 12a and 13c (MIC = 25 mu g/mL) exhibited equipotent behavior towards ampicillin (MIC = 25 mu g/mL), a bacterial strain of B. subtilis [BS]. Compounds 13b (MIC = 3.125 mu g/Ml) and 15 (MIC = 1.56 mu g/mL) demonstrated strong antitubercular activity in the antitubercular activity assay when compared to the conventional medications Rifampicin (MIC = 0.2 mu g/mL) and INH (MIC = 0.1 mu g/mL). We also report, for the first time, in vitro antimicrobial activity of some previously reported spiro compounds 12c, 12f and 12 g.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-fidelity visualization of anatomical organs is crucial for neurosurgical education, simulation, and planning. This becomes much more important for minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures. Realistic anatomical visualization can allow resident surgeons to learn visual cues and orient themselves with the complex 3-dimensional (3D) anatomy. Achieving full fidelity in 3D medical visualization is an active area of research; however, the prior reviews focus on the application area and lack the underlying technical principles. Accordingly, the present study attempts to bridge this gap by providing a narrative review of the techniques used for 3D visualization. METHODS: We conducted a literature review on 3D medical visualization technology from 2018 to 2023 using the PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. The cross-referenced manuscripts were extensively studied to find literature that discusses technology relevant to 3D medical visualization. We also compiled and ran software applications that were accessible to us in order to better understand them. RESULTS: We present the underlying fundamental technology used in 3D medical visualization in the context of neurosurgical education, simulation, and planning. Further, we discuss and categorize a few important applications based on the 3D visualization techniques they use. CONCLUSIONS: The visualization of virtual human organs has not yet achieved a level of realism close to reality. This gap is largely due to the interdisciplinary nature of this research, population diversity, and validation complexities. With the advancements in computational resources and automation of 3D visualization pipelines, next-gen applications may offer enhanced medical 3D visualization fidelity.

AB  - Background Limited data exists regarding risk factors for adverse outcomes in older adults hospitalized with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) in low- and middle-income countries such as India. This multisite study aimed to assess outcomes and associated risk factors among adults aged >= 60 years hospitalized with pneumonia. Methods Between December 2018 and March 2020, we enrolled >= 60-year-old adults admitted within 48 hours for CAP treatment across 16 public and private facilities in four sites. Clinical data and nasal/oropharyngeal specimens were collected by trained nurses and tested for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other respiratory viruses (ORV) using the qPCR. Participants were evaluated regularly until discharge, as well as on the 7th and 30th days post-discharge. Outcomes included ICU admission and in-hospital or 30-day post-discharge mortality. A hierarchical framework for multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models identified risk factors (e.g., demographics, clinical features, etiologic agents) associated with critical care or death. Findings Of 1,090 CAP patients, the median age was 69 years; 38.4% were female. Influenza viruses were detected in 12.3%, RSV in 2.2%, and ORV in 6.3% of participants. Critical care was required for 39.4%, with 9.9% in-hospital mortality and 5% 30-day post-discharge mortality. Only 41% of influenza CAP patients received antiviral treatment. Admission factors independently associated with ICU admission included respiratory rate >30/min, blood urea nitrogen>19mg/dl, altered sensorium, anemia, oxygen saturation <90%, prior cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and private hospital admission. Diabetes, anemia, low oxygen saturation at admission, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation were associated with 30-day mortality. Conclusion High ICU admission and 30-day mortality rates were observed among older adults with pneumonia, with a significant proportion linked to influenza and RSV infections. Comprehensive guidelines for CAP prevention and management in older adults are needed, especially with the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Purpose Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an intense form of treatment, resulting in major symptom burden but can prove curative. The quality of life (QOL) is a major endpoint for these patients as the survival rate in them has improved over time. The aim of the study is to assess the QOL and symptom burden of hematological malignancy patients at admission to hospital for HSCT, at 1 month and at 3 months following HSCT.
   Methods This prospective observational study was done on hematological malignancy patients who were admitted for HSCT in a regional cancer center. The study subjects were assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant Scale (FACT-BMT Scale), Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-revised (r-ESAS), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) at the time of hospital admission for transplantation, on day 30 (similar to 1 month) and day100 (similar to 3 months) of transplantation.
   Results A total of 68 patients were included in this study. FACT-BMT scores have decreased from baseline (F0) to the first follow-up (F1) and then increased in the third follow-up (F2). The maximum r-ESAS mean score was for tiredness among all other symptoms at F0 as well as at F1 and at F2. The DASS 21 scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were maximum during F1 and minimum during F2.
   Conclusion Symptom burden is maximum during the first month of BMT, which improves later and QOL becomes improved with time.

AB  - Background:Psychosocial interventions, crucial for recovery in patients with schizophrenia, have often been developed and tested in high income countries. We aimed at developing and validating home-based a booklet based psycho-social intervention with inputs from stakeholders: patients, families, and mental health professionals (MHP) for patients with schizophrenia and related disorders in low resource settings.Methods:We developed a preliminary version of psychosocial intervention booklets based on six themes derived from focus group discussions conducted with patients, families, and MHP. Initially, quantitative assessment of content validity was done by MHP on overall and Content Validity Index of individual items of the specific booklets, followed by in-depth interviews about their views. The booklets were modified based on their inputs. Further, pilot testing of manuals was done on the users - nine pairs of patients and caregivers followed by development of a final version of psycho-social intervention.Results:The percentage content validity of individual modules and overall booklets was >= 78.5% indicating good validity. Most MHP reported that the manuals were relevant and easy to use but were text-heavy, and lengthy. On pilot testing of modified manuals with patients and their family caregivers, majority (77.8%) of them found booklets useful and suggested that there should be separate booklets for both patients and caregivers for providing information and entering separate response for the activities, integrating helpful tips. Language should be simple. Finally, two sets of booklets ("info book" and "workbook") named 'Saksham' (meaning empowered) were created with specific modules (viz., 'Medicine adherence', 'Daily routine', 'Eating right', 'Physical activity', 'Physical health monitoring', 'Self-reliance', and 'Psychoeducation') for patients and caregivers each, in two languages (Hindi and English).Conclusion:Booklets with modules for psychosocial interventions for patients with schizophrenia and their caregivers were developed after establishing content validity and pilot testing.

AB  - Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous system, involving the meninges, brain parenchyma, and spinal cord. The distinctive radiologic feature observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is characterized by periventricular radial and linear contrast enhancement. This case report details a 45-year-old male who initially exhibited constitutional symptoms, followed by encephalitis, lower limb weakness, and urinary retention. The MRI findings revealed meningoencephalitis with longitudinal extensive myelitis. Notably, the cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed the presence of anti-GFAP antibodies.

AB  - Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) is an Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Our study aims to examine the impact of baseline insomnia severity on mood outcomes of dTMS and the impact of dTMS on comorbid insomnia in patients with treatmentresistant depression using a retrospective analysis. Twenty-five patients with treatment-resistant depression who underwent dTMS were divided into two groups: "low insomnia " and "high insomnia, " depending on Insomnia Severity Index scores at baseline. Significant improvements in depression and anxiety from baseline to final dTMS session were noted in both groups. Baseline insomnia severity was not associated with poorer treatment outcomes after dTMS. Final insomnia scores of the two groups were not significantly different, suggesting dTMS alleviated insomnia symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Further research incorporating a prospective study design in a multicenter setting is warranted to replicate these findings and elucidate the mechanistic action of dTMS on insomnia outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To assess attention, vigilance, and executive functions in migraine patients during headache-free (interictal) periods and in healthy controls without migraine and to study the impact of migraine preventive treatment on these cognitive functions. Methods: Preventive drug-naive migraine patients, aged >= 18 years, without a history of medication overuse were studied and compared to non-migraine controls. Psychiatric comorbidity was screened by Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and those who screened positive were evaluated further by specific scales. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale assessed subjective complaints of sleep quality. Cognitive functions were assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), digit span forward and backward (DS-F, DS-B), trail-making tests (TMT-A and B) and Stroop word (SW), Stroop color (SC), and Stroop interference (SI) tests. Cognitive test scores at the end of 6 months following treatment were compared to baseline scores. Results: One hundred and fifty migraine patients and controls each were studied. Compared to controls, migraine patients performed significantly worse in DS-B (P < 0.0001), TMT-A (P = 0.00004), TMT-B (P < 0.0001), SW (P < 0.0001), SC (P < 0.0001), and SI (P = 0.0221). MMSE scores did not differ between patients and the controls (P = 0.3224). Compared to the patients without psychiatric comorbidity, migraine patients with psychiatric comorbidity showed no significant differences in the cognitive test scores. Significant improvement in all cognitive test scores (P < 0.001) was observed after 6 months of treatment. Conclusion: Migraine patients, compared to non-migraine controls, showed deficits in attention, vigilance, and executive functions during the interictal period, which improved with successful preventive treatment. Psychiatric comorbidities did not have a significant impact on cognitive dysfunctions.

TI  - Comparison of Change in the Pulsatility Index before and after Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery in Adult Patients with Hydrocephalus
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
KW  - Evans index
KW  - hydrocephalus
KW  - pulsatility index
KW  - trans-systolic time
KW  - TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER SONOGRAPHY
AB  - Background and Aim: In hydrocephalus patients, after ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, decrease in pulsatility index (PI) correlates with decrease in ventricle size. Also, increase in PI is noted in obstructed or malfunctioning VP shunts. However, previous studies were either done in infants and children or included patients of all age groups. Our aim was to compare PI before and after successful VP shunt surgery in adult patients and also the trend of transcranial Doppler (TCD) parameters for 3 days after surgery.
   Materials and Methods: A prospective, observational study was done in 20 adult patients undergoing VP shunt. Clinical features, vitals, Evans index, and TCD parameters were noted in the preoperative period. A computed tomography (CT) head was repeated 4-6 h after surgery, and the position of ventricular end of shunt was confirmed and Evans index was calculated. The vitals and TCD parameters were noted at same time and for the next 2 days. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test were uses for statistical analysis.
   Results: A total of 18 patients were included for statistical analysis. The mean preoperative PI was 1.19 0.24 and the postoperative PI after surgery was 0.97 +/- 0.17, 0.97 +/- 0.23, and 0.94 +/- 0.21 (P = 0.0039) on postoperative day (POD) 1 (POD1), POD2, and POD3, respectively. The mean preoperative value of Evans index was 0.37 +/- 0.06 and there was statistically significant (P = < 0.001) reduction to 0.33 +/- 0.07 after VP shunt surgery. The change in PI and change in Evans index were found to be positively correlated (r = 0.34 and P = 0.0013).
   Conclusions: The decrease in PI after VP shunt surgery correlates with decrease in ventricular size. Any increase in PI in the postoperative period should raise the suspicion of malfunctioning of VP shunt.

AB  - The management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in children remains challenging due to differences in the chemotherapy regimens, their relative emetogenicity compared to that in adults and differences in drug metabolism and the available formulations. The common four classes of anti-emetics used for the treatment and prophylaxis of CINV in children include dexamethasone, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3RAs), and olanzapine. The appropriate dose of dexamethasone for CINV prophylaxis in children is unknown, with a significant variability in dosage ranging between 6 and 32 mg/m(2)/day. The dose of dexamethasone is decreased by 30% when this drug is combined with (fos)aprepitant in children, in contrast to a decrease of 50% required in adults. The use of aprepitant in younger children (<12 years) is often hampered by the non-availability of oral suspension formulations in many countries; alternatively, 80 mg capsules are administered for 1-3 days in certain institutes to children weighing between 15 and 40 kg. Among the different 5HT3RAs, palonosetron is comparatively metabolized faster in children than in adults, requiring a higher dosage for similar efficacy to that achieved in adults. Olanzapine is a newer agent, used in doses between 0.1 and 0.14 mg/kg/day in children, with good anti-emetic efficacy, but has sedation and hyperglycemia as concerning adverse effects. Drug interactions between anti-emetics and between anti-emetics and chemotherapy/supportive agents (azole antifungals, cyclosporine, arsenic trioxide), especially QTc prolongation, should be considered during prescription.

AB  - Purpose: To compare perimetric outcomes of an iPad perimetry app (Melbourne Rapid Fields [MRF]) with those of the Humphrey Field Analyser (HFA) testing children with glaucoma. Methods: Sixteen children diagnosed and treated for glaucoma were recruited to evaluate their perimetric performance over two visits. At each visit, they undertook visual field assessment using the MRF application as well as the HFA. The HFA test was part of their usual clinical work up and a clinical assistant judged which test format (24-2 SITA standard or SITA fast) might be suited to the testing of that child. The primary outcome measure was the association and repeatability of mean deviation (MD) for the MRF and HFA tests, by way of regression, intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland- Altman analysis. Secondary measures were comparisons of pattern deviation indices, test times as well as an indication of participant test preference. Summary data show means +/- standard deviation. Results: The age for our cohort was 7 to 15 years of age (mean, 10.0 +/- 2.4 years of age). The MRF MD was in close concordance to HFA MD with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.95). Bland-Altman analysis found little bias ( - 0.6 dB) and a 95% coefficient of repeatability of 2.1 dB in eyes having a normal HFA MD. In eyes with glaucomatous visual field defects the 95% coefficient of repeatability at retest was much larger for both the MRF (10.5 dB) as well as for the HFA (10.0 dB). Average MRF test times (5.6 +/- 1.2 minutes) were similar to SITA Fast (5.4 +/- 1.9 minutes) with both being significantly faster than SITA standard (8.6 +/- 1.4 minutes; P < 0.001). All children chose testing with the MRF as their preference. Conclusions: MRF correlated strongly with HFA and was preferred by the children over the HFA. MRF is suitable for perimetric evaluation of children with glaucoma.

AB  - Objectives: To explore associations between type and number of abnormal glucose values on antenatal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with postpartum diabetes in South Asian women diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) using International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria. Methods: This post-hoc evaluation of the Lifestyle Intervention IN Gestational Diabetes (LIVING) study, a randomized controlled trial, was conducted among women with GDM in the index pregnancy, across 19 centers in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. Postpartum diabetes (outcome) was defined on OGTT, using American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Results: We report data on 1468 women with GDM, aged 30.9 (5.0) years, and with median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 1.8 (1.4-2.4) years after childbirth following the index pregnancy. We found diabetes in 213 (14.5%) women with an incidence of 8.7 (7.6-10.0)/100 women-years. The lowest incidence rate was 3.8/100 women years, in those with an isolated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) abnormality, and highest was 19.0/100 women years in participants with three abnormal values. The adjusted hazard ratios for two and three abnormal values compared to one abnormal value were 1.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.54; p = .005) and 3.56 (95% CI, 2.46-5.16; p < .001) respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for the combined (combination of fasting and postglucose load) abnormalities was 2.61 (95% CI, 1.70-4.00; p < .001), compared to isolated abnormal FPG. Conclusions: Risk of diabetes varied significantly depending upon the type and number of abnormal values on antenatal OGTT. These data may inform future precision medicine approaches such as risk prediction models in identifying women at higher risk and may guide future targeted interventions.

AB  - A reliable, quick-to-assess, and automatic scoring system for cleanliness assessment in video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is presently not available. The present study proposes an approach to automatically assess the cleanliness in VCE frames as per the latest scoring system, that is, Korea-Canada (KODA). First, a new multi-label frame dataset containing medical scores of 28 VCE videos was generated through the proposed mobile-based application called Artificial Intelligence-KODA (AI-KODA) score. The scores were saved automatically in real-time through the application. The generated dataset was transformed into three datasets based on the scores, and each of the dataset was then randomly split into train:validate:test ratio of 60:20:20. Second, a comprehensive evaluation, interpretation, and benchmarking of the three classification tasks were performed with the help of eight transfer learning algorithms on NVIDIA RTX A5000 workstation. Thorough analysis indicates that AI-KODA utilized with AI is reliable, quick-to-access, and free from observer bias. It promotes automatic scoring system for cleanliness assessment in VCE. The meta-data is available here ().

AB  - Background: Several observational studies have reported the prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and their risk factors in an elderly population. Any information in this regard is currently lacking from India. Aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence, risk factors of CMBs, and association with cognition in an Indian urban population aged 50 years and above. Methods: Household surveys were conducted as part of ongoing Longitudinal Cognition and Aging Research on Population of the National Capital Region (LoCARPoN) study in areas of urban Delhi. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in 2599 participants. Using standard neuropsychological battery, mean Z-scores for each domain (memory, executive, information) were derived. Binary and stepwise logistic regression models were used to determine associated risk factors for the presence of CMB and its association with cognitive domains. Results: The prevalence of CMBs was 14.42% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.06-15.73). Of these, 203 (7.81%) participants had single CMBs and 172 (6.61%) had multiple microbleeds (>= 2). Higher prevalence was observed in older age (60-70 years: odds ratio [OR]: 1.25 [95% CI: 0.93-1.67]; 70-80 years: OR: 2.05 [95% CI: 1.48-2.84]; >= 80 years: OR: 3.27 [95% CI: 1.97-5.44]) compared to individuals in the age group 50-60 years. History of stroke (OR: 2.97 [95% CI: 1.56-5.66]), hypertension (OR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.05-1.75]), and smoking (OR: 1.43 [95% CI: 1.11-1.85]) was associated with at least one CMB. Multiple CMBs were associated with worse scores in memory and executive domains. Conclusion: Older age, hypertension, history of stroke, and history of smoking emerged as important risk factors for the presence of multiple CMBs. Follow-up study is required to determine implications of CMBs.

AB  - Background: Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is known to complicate patients with post-tubercular lung disease. However, some evidence suggests that CPA might co-exist in patients with newly-diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (P.TB) at diagnosis and also develop during therapy. The objective of this study was to confirm the presence of CPA in newly diagnosed P.TB at baseline and at the end-of-TB-therapy. Materials and Methods: This prospective longitudinal study included newly diagnosed P.TB patients, followed up at third month and end-of-TB-therapy with symptom assessment, anti-Aspergillus IgG antibody and imaging of chest for diagnosing CPA. Results: We recruited 255 patients at baseline out of which 158 (62%) completed their follow-up. Anti-Aspergillus IgG was positive in 11.1% at baseline and 27.8% at end-of-TB-therapy. Overall, proven CPA was diagnosed in 7% at baseline and 14.5% at the end-of-TB-therapy. Around 6% patients had evidence of aspergilloma in CT chest at the end-of-TB-therapy. Conclusions: CPA can be present in newly diagnosed P.TB patients at diagnosis and also develop during anti-tubercular treatment. Patients with persistent symptoms or developing new symptoms during treatment for P.TB should be evaluated for CPA. Whether patients with concomitant P.TB and CPA, while receiving antitubercular therapy, need additional antifungal therapy, needs to be evaluated in future studies.

AB  - Background & objectives: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are extremely prevalent in India, making early detection of people at high risk for CVDs and prevention crucial. This study aimed to estimate CVD risk distribution in older adults (40-69 yr) in India using WHO's non-laboratory risk chart and identify factors associated with elevated CVD risk (10%).Methods: The current study used a nationally representative sample of 40-69 yr adults in India. The population's 10-yr CVD risk was defined as very low-to-low (10%), moderate (10-20%) and high to very high (>20%). We attempted univariable and multivariable logistic regressions to identify factors related to higher CVD risk (>= 10%).Results: Out of 4480 participants, 50 per cent were younger participants (40-49 years). The proportions of the population with very low to low, moderate and high to very high CVD risk were 84.9, 14.4 and 0.7 per cent, respectively. The estimated 10-year CVD risk was higher for people with unemployed [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 5.12; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.63, 7.24], followed by raised blood glucose (AOR: 1.81; 95%CI: 1.39, 2.34).Interpretation & conclusions: The non-laboratory-based chart proves valuable in low-resource settings, especially at the primary healthcare level, facilitating efficient CVD risk assessment and resource allocation. Further research is needed to explore the association of second-hand smoke with CVD risk in the Indian population

AB  - Objectives To review the efficacy of nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in acute asthma in children.Methods The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 15 December 2023. RCTs were included if they compared the efficacy and safety of nebulised MgSO4 as a second-line agent in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the Risk of Bias V.2 tool was used to assess the biases among them.Results 10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with acute asthma were included. All trials were placebo controlled and administered nebulised MgSO4/placebo and salbutamol (+/- ipratropium bromide). There was no significant difference in Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; standardised mean difference: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.2 to +0.02, I2=21%). Children in the MgSO4 group have significantly better peak expiratory flow rate (% predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; mean difference: 19.3; 95% CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I2=0%). There was no difference in the need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission or duration of hospital stay. Adverse events were minor, infrequent (7.3%) and similar among the two groups.Conclusions There is low-certainty evidence that nebulised MgSO4 as an add-on second-line therapy for acute asthma in children does not reduce asthma severity or a need for hospitalisation. However, it was associated with slightly better lung functions. The current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO4 in paediatric acute asthma management.PROSPERO registration number CRD42022373692.

KW  - DEFINITION
AB  - Background: Sensory processing refers to receiving, organizing, and interpreting sensory stimuli from the sensory system. Unlike other neurodevelopmental disorders, knowledge about the sensory processing abilities of children with cerebral palsy (CP) is lacking.
   Objective: To study the difference in sensory processing abilities of children with cerebral palsy in comparison to age matched typically developing children (TDC).
   Methods and Material: A cross-sectional analysis of sensory processing abilities of children with CP and TDC was performed from July 2018 through February 2020. The child sensory profile2 (CSP2) caregiver questionnaire was used to detect sensory processing differences (SPD) across nine sensory domains and four sensory processing patterns. A comparison was made between the two study groups as well as between the CP subtypes.
   Result: Around 226 children with CP and 58 TDC were screened. Finally, 150 children with CP and 50 TDC were enrolled. Probable SPD (>1SD) was observed in (121/150) 80.7% of children with CP compared to (13/50) 26% in TDC (p < 0.001). Definite SPD (>2SD) was seen in 40.7% (61/150) of children with CP vs. none in TDC (p < 0.001). The body position domain which tests the vestibular and proprioceptive processing was primarily affected in CP. Most children with CP fell under the "bystander" pattern suggesting poor registration of sensory stimuli. No significant difference in the pattern of sensory processing was observed between the CP subtypes. Prevalence of definite SPD positively correlated with the gross motor functional classification system level.
   Conclusion: Sensory processing abilities of children with CP differ significantly from TDC. Proprioceptive and vestibular sensory processing is primarily affected in CP.

This study was conducted to compare the posterior corneal morphology in areas with DM breaks with regards to DM and pre-Descemet's layer (PDL) between the two. In this cross-sectional comparative study, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) scans of the posterior cornea of advanced keratoconus eyes with hydrops (n = 12), PCG eyes with Haab's striae (n = 15), and healthy control eyes (n = 14) were compared for DM-PDL morphology. These were further corroborated by the histopathology of corneal buttons from keratoconus (n = 14) and PCG (n = 13) cases obtained following penetrating keratoplasty and compared with controls (enucleated retinoblastoma globes, n = 6) on light microscopy and collagen IV immunostaining. AS-OCT showed a thicker median DM/PDL complex in PCG (80 mu m) versus keratoconus eyes (36 mu m, P = 0.01; Kruskal-Wallis test). The median height and length of detached DM-PDL were significantly more in keratoconus versus PCG (145 mu m, 1766.1 +/- 1320.6 mu m vs. 26.5 mu m, 453.3 +/- 303.2 mu m, respectively, P = 0.012; Kruskal-Wallis test). Type-1 DM/PDL detachment (seen as a characteristic taut chord) in keratoconus (90%) was the most common morphological pattern versus intracameral twin protuberance (92%) following DM breaks in PCG. Histopathology confirmed thicker DM in PCG (median: 63.4 mu m) versus keratoconus eyes (median: 33.2 mu m) or controls (27.1 mu m) (P = 0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test). Greater height/length of DM/PDL detachment compounded by poor healing response (lower DM/PDL thickness) probably causes more frequent corneal decompensation in keratoconus eyes when compared to PCG eyes following DM tears.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the changes encountered in corneal biomechanics and aberration profile following accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) using hypo-osmolar and iso-osmolar riboflavin in corneal thicknesses of <400 and >400 microns, respectively. Methods:This is a prospective, interventional, comparative study involving 100 eyes of 75 patients with progressive keratoconus. Eyes were divided into two groups based on corneal thickness: group 1 included eyes with a corneal thickness of <400 microns who underwent hypo-osmolar CXL, and group 2 included eyes with a corneal thickness of >400 microns who underwent iso-osmolar CXL. Corneal biomechanical and aberration profiles were evaluated and compared between groups. Results:In group 1, all higher-order aberrations (HOA) except secondary astigmatism significantly decreased from baseline; however, in group 2, only coma and trefoil decreased. The corneal resistance factor and corneal hysteresis significantly improved in both groups, which was significantly greater in group 2 than in group 1. The change in inverse radius, deformation amplitude, and tomographic biomechanical index was significantly improved in group 2 as compared to group 1. Conclusion:Improvement in corrected distance visual acuity and decrease in HOA were significantly better in the hypo-osmolar CXL group; however, the improvement in biomechanical strength of the cornea was significantly better in the iso-osmolar group.

AB  - Background. Marjolin ulcer (MU) is an aggressive cutaneous malignancy that commonly occurs in those with a chronic wound such as post -burn scar. Case Report. A 20 -year -old male who sustained a flame burn over the scalp at 3 months of age developed a nonhealing ulcer over the burn scar 20 years later, which was treated with adequate surgical margins with adjuvant mold brachytherapy. Two months after completion of that treatment, he developed parotid nodal metastasis with positron emission tomography (PET) -positive bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, right suboccipital, and mesenteric lymph nodes that were treated with concurrent chemoradiation. One month later, the patient developed an ulcerative lesion involving the left parotid region with PET showing infiltration of the parotid gland, but with resolution of other previous sites of uptake. The patient was treated surgically with radical parotidectomy with elective neck dissection and reconstruction with locoregional flap. At 6 -month follow-up, the patient developed extensive locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis and was started on oral metronomic therapy. The patient was alive with stable disease at 3 -month follow-up after initiation of palliative chemotherapy. Conclusion. Despite timely multimodality therapy, MU may present with a hostile clinical course with a short disease -free interval and early recurrence.

AB  - Introduction There are around 250 million adolescents (10-19 years) in India. The prevalence of mental health-related morbidity among adolescents in India is approximately 7.3%. Vulnerable subpopulations among adolescents such as those living in slum communities are particularly at risk due to poor living conditions, financial difficulty and limited access to support services. Adolescents' Resilience and Treatment nEeds for Mental Health in Indian Slums (ARTEMIS) is a cluster randomised controlled trial of an intervention that intends to improve the mental health of adolescents living in slum communities in India. The aim of this paper is to describe the process evaluation protocol for ARTEMIS trial. The process evaluation will help to explain the intervention outcomes and understand how and why the intervention worked or did not work. It will identify contextual factors, intervention barriers and facilitators and the adaptations required for optimising implementation. Methods Case study method will be used and the data will include a mix of quantitative metrics and qualitative data. The UK Medical Research Council's guidance on evaluating complex interventions, the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance Framework and the Affordability, Practicability, Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, Acceptability, Safety/Side Effects and, Equity criteria will be used to develop a conceptual framework and a priori codes for qualitative data analysis. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Implementation fidelity will also be measured. Discussion The process evaluation will provide an understanding of outcomes and causal mechanisms that influenced any change in trial outcomes. Ethics and dissemination Ethics Committee of the George Institute for Global Health India (project number 17/2020) and the Research Governance and Integrity Team, Imperial College, London (ICREC reference number: 22IC7718) have provided ethics approval. The Health Ministry's Screening Committee has approved to the study (ID 2020-9770). Trial registration number CTRI/2022/02/040307.

AB  - Background: Data on mixed mould infection with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis (CAPM) are sparse. Objectives: To ascertain the prevalence of co-existent CAPA in CAPM (mixed mould infection) and whether mixed mould infection is associated with early mortality (<= 7 days of diagnosis). Methods: We retrospectively analysed the data collected from 25 centres across India on COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. We included only CAPM and excluded subjects with disseminated or rhino-orbital mucormycosis. We defined co-existent CAPA if a respiratory specimen showed septate hyphae on smear, histopathology or culture grew Aspergillus spp. We also compare the demography, predisposing factors, severity of COVID-19, and management of CAPM patients with and without CAPA. Using a case-control design, we assess whether mixed mould infection (primary exposure) were associated with early mortality in CAPM. Results: We included 105 patients with CAPM. The prevalence of mixed mould infection was 20% (21/105). Patients with mixed mould infection experienced early mortality (9/21 [42.9%] vs. 15/84 [17.9%]; p = 0.02) and poorer survival at 6 weeks (7/21 [33.3] vs. 46/77 [59.7%]; p = 0.03) than CAPM alone. On imaging, consolidation was more commonly encountered with mixed mould infections than CAPM. Co-existent CAPA (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 19.1 [2.62-139.1]) was independently associated with early mortality in CAPM after adjusting for hypoxemia during COVID-19 and other factors. Conclusion: Coinfection of CAPA and CAPM was not uncommon in our CAPM patients and portends a worse prognosis. Prospective studies from different countries are required to know the impact of mixed mould infection.

TI  - Natural History of Type 2 Diabetes in Indians: Time to Progression
T2  - DIABETES CARE
KW  - IMPAIRED GLUCOSE-TOLERANCE
AB  - OBJECTIVE
   To describe the natural history of diabetes in Indians.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   Data are from participants older than 20 years in the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia longitudinal study. Glycemic states were defined per American Diabetes Association criteria. Markov models were used to estimate annual transition probabilities and sojourn time through states.
   RESULTS
   Among 2,714 diabetes-free participants, 641 had isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG), and 341 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The annual transition to diabetes for those with IGT was 13.9% (95% CI 12.0, 15.9) versus 8.6% (7.3, 9.8) for iIFG. In the normoglycemia <-> iIFG -> diabetes model, mean sojourn time in normoglycemia was 40.3 (34.6, 48.2) years, and sojourn time in iIFG was 9.7 (8.4, 11.4) years. For the normoglycemia <-> IGT -> diabetes model, mean sojourn time in normoglycemia was 34.5 (29.5, 40.8) years, and sojourn time in IGT was 6.1 (5.3, 7.1) years.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Individuals reside in normoglycemia for 35-40 years; however, progression from prediabetes to diabetes is rapid.

AB  - The knee meniscus plays a key role in shock absorption, joint stability, and congruity at the knee joint. However, due to several reasons, meniscal tears are increasing that in turn causes osteoarthritis. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the stresses on the meniscus during kinematic activities and correlate them with the potential tears observed clinically. From the MRI data of a healthy volunteer, 3D models of the menisci were segmented in Mimics (R), post-processed in 3-matics (R), meshed in HyperMesh (R) and were analyzed in Abaqus (R) for stresses arising due to compressive loads from both femoral and tibial ends; under various angles of flexion. The critical regions with higher stress distribution were correlated with the potential meniscal tears. It was observed that the stresses were higher when loads were applied from the tibial end than femoral end. Though the loads were applied proportional to the area, higher stresses were observed in the lateral meniscus. Results of the study show that at higher knee flexion angles, loading from tibial end leads to longitudinal tear in region E1-E2 (as per Cooper's Classification) on the lateral meniscus and horizontal tear in A-1 region of the medial meniscus. Longitudinal, horizontal, and root detachment tears reported in the literature, coincide with our predictions. The novelty of the study is the estimation of stresses due to forces from the tibial end and the correlation of the stresses to the type of meniscal tears observed clinically.

AB  - Background. Untreated co-occurring substance use and substance use disorders (SUDs) in patients with medical conditions may be associated with unfavourable medical outcomes. Understanding the prevalence of substance use and SUDs among patients admitted to hospital for medical illness may help in developing appropriate strategies to manage SUDs in this population and improve the outcomes of medical illness. We assessed the prevalence of substance use and SUDs among patients admitted for medical illnesses and the association between substance use and medical illness. Methods. This cross-sectional study was done in an inpatient setting in a multidisciplinary teaching medical institution in India. Using systematic sampling, adult patients admitted in various departments for at least 24 hours were interviewed using standard instruments by psychiatrists trained in the study methodology. Results. Two hundred and ninety patients participated. Their mean (SD) age was 42.2 (15.6) years. One hundred and nine participants (37.6%) reported lifetime use of any psychoactive substance, with tobacco beingthe most common substance used (91, 31.4%), followed by alcohol (69, 23.8%) and cannabis (12, 4.1%). Lifetime alcohol use was significantly associated with diseases of the circulatory system. Lifetime use of any substance or of alcohol, and current use of any substance or tobacco were significantly associated with injuries, poisoning and other consequences of external causes. Conclusions. A large proportion of patients hospitalized for medical illness reported the use of psychoactive substances or had SUDs. The use of some of these substances was also associated with injuries as well as diseases of the circulatory system.

AB  - Background: Previous work demonstrated the beneficial effect of T6 dermatomal stimulation by the percutaneous method in managing obesity. However, a simple, cost-effective, and feasible intervention stimulating the dermatome can be a potential solution for obesity care.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to find the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of T6 dermatome on appetite and weight loss in obese individuals.
   Material and Methods: In this prospective single-arm experimental study, 20 obese patients received TENS treatment of T6 dermatome for 30 min, once a week and for 12 weeks. Outcome measures such as appetite level in the visual analog scale (VAS), weight in kg, and basal metabolic index (BMI) in kg/m(2) were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks -post-intervention, and at 8 weeks of follow-up.
   Results: A statistically significant difference in all the variables was found from baseline to 12 weeks of intervention (P < 0.001) and maintained till 8 weeks of follow-up. From pre- to post-treatment, the effect size for appetite reduction was large (>1) while for weight and BMI loss was (0.14, 0.16), respectively small. Additionally, a weak correlation was found between pre- and follow-up appetite and weight loss (r = 0.25, P = 0.294).
   Conclusions: Twelve weeks of TENS treatment of T6 dermatome showed a positive effect in reducing appetite with sustained reduction up to 8 weeks of follow-up even after completion of the intervention. However, in the absence of dietary modification, TENS treatment was associated with low effect sizes weight and BMI loss.

AB  - Background and Objective: Gait impairment leads to increased dependence, morbidity, institutionalization, and mortality in older people. We intended to assess gait parameters with the continuum of cognitive impairment and observe variation with the severity of cognitive impairment.
   Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the memory clinic of a tertiary care center. One hundred and twelve subjects were recruited, and cognition was assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Usual gait was assessed by a 6-m walk test, and the dynamic gait was assessed using Biodex Gait Trainer((TM)). Apart from crude analysis, adjusted linear regression was used to find the association of spatiotemporal gait parameters with cognitive decline.
   Results: Subjects were divided into subjective cognitive decline (SCD; n = 38), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 40), and major neurocognitive disorder (MNCD; n = 34) groups. History of falls (23.7% vs. 30.0% vs. 67.7%, P < 0.001) and impaired activities of daily living (ADLs) (5.3% vs. 15.0% vs. 100%, P < 0.001) were significantly higher with cognitive decline. Age- and gender-adjusted regression analysis revealed that usual gait speed (0.8 vs. 0.6 vs. 0.5, P < 0.001) (m/s), total time (3.9 vs. 2.9 vs. 2.6, P = 0.022) (min), total distance (65.6 vs. 55.8 vs. 46.6, P = 0.025) (m), step cycle time (0.6 vs. 0.8 vs. 0.8, P = 0.020) (cycles/s), and step lengths were significant.
   Conclusion: Gait speed and other parameters worsened with increasing cognitive impairment. Changes in gait parameters might be a useful marker of declining cognition, though a long-term follow-up study is required to establish this association. Early intervention could be beneficial in preserving autonomy in patients with cognitive impairment.

AB  - Background: The outcome of poor grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is dismal. Some of these patients need cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage procedure for the hydrocephalus and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) which may precipitate rebleeding. However, aneurysmal rebleed following CSF drainage procedure is controversial.
   Objective: Our study aimed at analyzing the effect of CSF drainage procedure on aneurysmal rebleeding.
   Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of all the consecutive patients diagnosed with poor grade aneurysmal SAH over three year period. Patients initially requiring either external ventricular drainage (EVD) or lumbar drain (LD) were included in the study group, and the rest (not requiring drainage) were included in the control group. Rebleeding was confirmed on computed tomography. The factors affecting rebleeding were analyzed.
   Results: Overall 194 patients with poor grade SAH were enrolled in the study (91 males: 103 females; mean age: 50.6 years). The study group had 91 patients (83 EVD and 8 LD) while 103 patients were in the control group. Posterior circulation aneurysms, poor grade SAH, hydrocephalus, and IVH were more common in the study group P < 0.001. The rebleeding rate was 7.6% in the study group and 8.7% in the control group. On univariate analysis size >1 cm, multiplicity, multilobularity, vasospasm, and CSF drainage were significant risk factors for rebleeding (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis aneurysm size >1 cm, CSF overdrainage >250 ml/day were significantly associated with risk of rebleeding.
   Conclusion: Ventricular drainage is essential to relieve acute hydrocephalus and drain IVH in SAH and we found no significant association between CSF drainage and rebleeding. However, rapid overdrainage of CSF can lead to aneurysm rupture, hence controlled controlled CSF drainage should be undertaken.

AB  - Background: Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal syndrome among females, which leads to significant morbidity and complications, if left untreated. The association of bacterial vaginosis with various sexually transmitted infections has been mentioned in previous literature. However, studies on the intermediate Nugent Score are lacking. This study was planned to examine the association of sexually transmitted infections with the intermediate Nugent Score. Materials and Methods: The study included was conducted to include females presenting with vaginal discharge, burning micturition, itching, lower abdominal pain and infertility. The Nugent scoring was used to categorize patients into those having normal flora, intermediate or bacterial vaginosis. Conventional and molecular techniques targeting Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Syphilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and vulvovaginal candidiasis were performed. Results: A total of 3,531 clinical samples were collected from females with a median age of 28.0 years. The number of patients with bacterial vaginosis and intermediate Nugent Score and positive cases were significantly higher in the 21-35 years age group (P < 0.0001). We observed that the likelihood of test results being positive for Trichomonas vaginalis was higher (P < 0.05), as the abnormality of the vaginal flora increased. Mycoplasma hominis was observed to be significantly higher in the intermediate Nugent Score group than the BV-positive patients (0.6 vs 0.2, P = 0.002). The number of vulvovaginal candidiasis cases in both the bacterial vaginosis-negative and bacterial vaginosis-positive groups were nearly the same (9.3 vs 9.8%). Limitation Individual follow-up couldn't be performed on the patients. Conclusion: We observed that the dysbiosis in vaginal microbiota, with an increase in Nugent scoring, was significantly associated with an increased risk for the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections and vulvovaginal candidiasis.

AB  - Impairment of hand functions in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) severely disrupts activities of daily living. Recent advances have enabled rehabilitation assisted by robotic devices to augment the residual function of the muscles. Traditionally, electromyography-based muscle activity sensing interfaces have been utilized to sense volitional motor intent to drive robotic assistive devices. However, the dexterity and fidelity of control that can be achieved with electromyography-based control have been limited due to inherent limitations in signal quality. We have developed and tested a muscle-computer interface (MCI) utilizing sonomyography to provide control of a virtual cursor for individuals with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury. We demonstrate that individuals with SCI successfully gained control of a virtual cursor by utilizing contractions of muscles of the wrist joint. The sonomyography-based interface enabled control of the cursor at multiple graded levels demonstrating the ability to achieve accurate and stable endpoint control. Our sonomyography-based muscle-computer interface can enable dexterous control of upper-extremity assistive devices for individuals with motor-incomplete SCI.

AB  - The follicular variant of Becker's nevus is an under-reported entity. We present the rare occurrence of follicular Becker's nevus in 7 patients, confirmed through dermoscopy and histopathological examination. Dermoscopy shows perifollicular hypopigmentation surrounded by a well-defined net-like pigmentation corresponding clinically to the presence of folliculocentric macules. Histology shows prominent basal and suprabasal melanization surrounding the follicle, corresponding to well-defined net-like pigmentation seen on dermoscopy. However, the melanization does not extend along the entire length of the follicular epithelium leading to perifollicular hypopigmentation on dermoscopy. Though biopsy is confirmatory, it is not usually necessary.

AB  - Objective: Oral cancer is a leading cause of mortality globally, particularly affecting developing regions where oral hygiene is often overlooked. The optical properties of tissues are vital for diagnostics, with polarization imaging emerging as a label -free, contrast -enhancing technique widely employed in medical and scientific research over past few decades. Materials and methods: We present a novel polarization sensitive quantitative phase imaging of biological tissues by incorporating the conventional polarization microscope and transport of intensity equation -based phase retrieval algorithm. This integration provides access to the birefringence mapping of biological tissues. The inherent optical anisotropy in biological tissues induces the polarization dependent refractive index variations which can provide the detailed insights into the birefringence characteristics of their extracellular constituents. Experimental investigations were conducted on both normal and cancerous oral tissue samples by recording a set of three polarization intensity images for each case with a step size of 2 mu m. Results: A noteworthy increment in birefringence quantification was observed in cancerous as compared to the normal tissues, attributed to the proliferation of abnormal cells during cancer progression. The mean birefringence values were calculated for both normal and cancerous tissues, revealing a significant increase in birefringence of cancerous tissues (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10 -2 compared to normal tissues (0.8 +/- 0.2) x 10 -2 . Data were collected from 8 patients in each group under identical experimental conditions. Conclusion: This polarization sensitive non-interferometric optical approach demonstrated effective discrimination between cancerous and normal tissues, with various parameters indicating elevated values in cancerous tissues.

AB  - Introduction: Video-electroencephalogram (EEG) with suggestion is widely considered the gold standard for diagnosing psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). However, ethical concerns and uncertainties persist regarding the most minimally invasive and least deceptive suggestion approach. Materials and methods: In an open-label randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of three suggestion methods (verbal suggestion, verbal suggestion with a tuning fork, and verbal suggestion with a cotton swab) during short-term video-EEG (STVEEG) recordings to induce PNES in children aged 5-18 years. If the paroxysmal event couldn't be elicited with the assigned method, alternative techniques were employed. Results: Out of 97 initially screened children, 75 were enrolled, with 25 in each group. The efficacy of all three suggestion methods was comparable in reproducing paroxysmal events (success rate of 16/25, 17/25 and 17/25 in verbal suggestion only, verbal suggestion with tuning fork and sterile cotton swab group respectively, p = 0.83) and the time required for induction (median of 2, 3 and 3 min respectively, p = 0.21). After trying alternative methods, 20 %, 12 %, and 12 % more patients in these three groups, respectively, were able to reproduce the paroxysmal event, with the differences not reaching statistical significance (p = 0.74). The assigned induction method or the success/failure of event reproduction did not significantly impact clinical outcomes at 12 weeks, and none of the patients in whom PNES could not be reproduced during STVEEG were later found to have an organic cause. Only the presence of psychiatric comorbidity independently predicted successful event reproduction during STVEEG, with statistical significance even after adjusting for other variables (p = 0.03). Conclusion: The efficacy of verbal suggestion alone in inducing paroxysmal nonepileptic seizures is on par with using a tuning fork or cotton swab in conjunction with verbal suggestion during STVEEG.

AB  - Over 50 million people worldwide are affected by epilepsy, a common neurological disorder that has a high rate of drug resistance and diverse comorbidities such as progressive cognitive and behavioural disorders, and increased mortality from direct or indirect effects of seizures and therapies. Despite extensive research with animal models and human studies, limited insights have been gained into the mechanisms underlying seizures and epileptogenesis, which has not translated into significant reductions in drug resistance, morbidities, or mortality. To better understand the molecular signaling networks associated with seizures in MTLE patients, we analyzed the proteome of brain samples from MTLE and control cases using an integrated approach that combines mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, differential expression analysis, and co-expression network analysis. Our analyses of 20 human brain tissues from MTLE patients and 20 controls showed the organization of the brain proteome into a network of 9 biologically meaningful modules of co-expressed proteins. Of these, 6 modules are positively or negatively correlated to MTLE phenotypes with hub proteins that are altered in MTLE patients. Our study is the first to employ an integrated approach of proteomics and protein co-expression network analysis to study patients with MTLE. Our findings reveal a molecular blueprint of altered protein networks in MTLE brain and highlight dysregulated pathways and processes including altered cargo transport, neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles, synaptic plasticity, proteostasis, RNA homeostasis, ion transport and transmembrane transport, cytoskeleton disorganization, metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, blood micro-particle function, extracellular matrix organization, immune response, neuroinflammation, and cell signaling. These insights into MTLE pathogenesis suggest potential new candidates for future diagnostic and therapeutic development.

AB  - ObjectiveIn this document, 9 Indian experts have evaluated the factors specific to LMICs when it came to Severe Asthma (SA) diagnosis, evaluation, biologic selection, non-biologic treatment options, and follow-up.Data sourcesA search was performed using 50 keywords, focusing on the Indian/LMICs perspective, in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The key areas of the search were focused on diagnosis, phenoendotyping, non-biological therapies, selecting a biologic, assessment of treatment response, and management of exacerbation.Study selectionsThe initial search revealed 1826 articles, from these case reports, observational studies, cohort studies, non-English language papers, etc., were excluded and we short-listed 20 articles for each area. Five relevant articles were selected by the experts for review.ResultsIn LMICs, SA patients may be referred to the specialist for evaluation a little late for Phenoendotyping of SA. While biologic therapy is now a standard of care, pulmonologists in LMICs may not have access to all the investigations to phenoendotype SA patients like fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), skin prick test (SPT), etc., but phenotyping of SA patients can also be done with simple blood investigations, eosinophil count and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). Choosing a biologic in the overlapping phenotype of SA and ACO patients is also a challenge in the LMICs.ConclusionsGiven the limitations of LMIC, it is important to select the right patient and explain the potential benefits of biological therapy. Non-biologic add-on therapies can be attempted in a resource-limited setting where biological therapy is not available/feasible for patients.

AB  - The gold standard for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) genetic diagnostic procedures was published in 2012. With the increasing complexity of the genetics of FSHD1 and 2, the increase of genetic testing centers, and the start of clinical trials for FSHD, it is crucial to provide an update on our knowledge of the genetic features of the FSHD loci and renew the international consensus on the molecular testing recommendations. To this end, members of the FSHD European Trial Network summarized the evidence presented during the 2022 ENMC meeting on Genetic diagnosis, clinical outcome measures, and biomarkers. The working group additionally invited genetic and clinical experts from the USA, India, Japan, Australia, South-Africa, and Brazil to provide a global perspective. Six virtual meetings were organized to reach consensus on the minimal requirements for genetic confirmation of FSHD1 and FSHD2. Here, we present the clinical and genetic features of FSHD, specific features of FSHD1 and FSHD2, pros and cons of established and new technologies (Southern blot in combination with either linear or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, molecular combing, optical genome mapping, FSHD2 methylation analysis and FSHD2 genotyping), the possibilities and challenges of prenatal testing, including pre-implantation genetic testing, and the minimal requirements and recommendations for genetic confirmation of FSHD1 and FSHD2. This consensus is expected to contribute to current clinical management and trial-readiness for FSHD.

AB  - Background: Pediatric airway management requires careful clinical evaluation and experienced execution due to anatomical, physiological, and developmental considerations. Video laryngoscopy in pediatric airways is a developing area of research, with recent data suggesting that video laryngoscopes are better than standard Macintosh blades. Specifically, there is a paucity of literature on the advantages of the C-MAC D-blade compared to the McCoy direct laryngoscope. Methods: After Ethics Committee approval, 70 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2 children aged 4-12 years scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were recruited. Patients were randomly allocated to intubation using a C-MAC video laryngoscope size 2 D-blade (Group 1) and a McCoy laryngoscope size 2 blade (Group 2). The Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) for ease of intubation was the primary outcome, while Cormack-Lehane grades, duration of laryngoscopy and intubation, hemodynamic responses, and incidence of any airway complications were secondary outcomes. Results: Both groups were comparable in terms of patient characteristics. The median (IQR) Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) score was better but was statistically nonsignificant with C-MAC (0 [0-0] vs. 0 [0-2], p = .055). The glottic views were superior (CL grade I in 32/35 vs. 23/35, p = .002), and the time to best glottic view (6 s [5-7] vs. 8.0 s [6-10], p = .006) was lesser in the C-MAC D-blade group while the total duration of intubation was comparable (20 s [16-22] vs. 18 s [15-22], p = .374). All the patients could be successfully intubated on the first attempt. None of the patients had any complications. ConclusionThe C-MAC video laryngoscope size 2 D-blade provided faster and better glottic visualization but similar intubation difficulty compared to McCoy size 2 laryngoscope in children. The shorter time to achieve glottic view demonstrated with the C-MAC failed to translate into a shorter total duration of intubation when compared to the McCoy laryngoscope attributable to a pronounced curvature of the D-blade.

AB  - Across workplaces, slip-and-fall accidents occur frequently due to reduced friction at the shoe-floor interaction. However, these events are typically ignored, and the importance of appropriate footwear is frequently overlooked. Mechanical-based slip and fall risk assessment devices are used to evaluate the frictional measurements at the shoe and floor contact. The available devices are however lab-based and have difficulty in replicating the realistic slipping biomechanics. Additionally, the current devices are expensive to be used in lower-middleincome nations. In this study, a biomimetic and cost-effective slip testing device was presented. The performance of the manufactured slip tester was thoroughly validated and examined utilising five formal shoes on three different flooring surfaces in different contaminant conditions. The findings showed that the slip tester effectively distinguished between the combinations of shoes, contaminant, and floorings. It was discovered that the slip tester's performance effectively distinguished between different shoe tread patterns across several slipping combinations.

AB  - Mucormycosis, a rare but deadly fungal infection, was an epidemic during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in cases (COVID-19-associated mucormycosis, CAM) is attributed to excessive steroid and antibiotic use, poor hospital hygiene, and crowded settings. Major contributing factors include diabetes and weakened immune systems. The main manifesting forms of CAM-cutaneous, pulmonary, and the deadliest, rhinocerebral- and disseminated infections elevated mortality rates to 85%. Recent focus lies on small-molecule inhibitors due to their advantages over standard treatments like surgery and liposomal amphotericin B (which carry several long-term adverse effects), offering potential central nervous system penetration, diverse targets, and simpler dosing owing to their small size, rendering the ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier via passive diffusion facilitated by the phospholipid membrane. Adaptation and versatility in mucormycosis are facilitated by a multitude of virulence factors, enabling the pathogen to dynamically respond to various environmental stressors. A comprehensive understanding of these virulence mechanisms is imperative for devising effective therapeutic interventions against this highly opportunistic pathogen that thrives in immunocompromised individuals through its angio-invasive nature. Hence, this Review delineates the principal virulence factors of mucormycosis, the mechanisms it employs to persist in challenging host environments, and the current progress in developing small-molecule inhibitors against them.

AB  - PurposeTo perform an extensive exploratory analysis to build a deeper insight into clinically relevant molecular biomarkers in Papillary, Follicular, and Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (PTC, FTC, ATC).MethodsThirteen Thyroid Cancer (THCA) datasets incorporating PTC, FTC, and ATC were derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Genes differentially expressed (DEGs) between THCA and normal were identified and subjected to GO and KEGG analyses. Multiple topological properties were harnessed and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed to identify the hub genes followed by survival analysis and validation.ResultsThere were 70, 87, and 377 DEGs, and 23, 27, and 53 hub genes for PTC, FTC, and ATC samples, respectively. Survival analysis detected 39 overall and 49 relapse-free survival-relevant hub genes. Six hub genes, BCL2, FN1, ITPR1, LYVE1, NTRK2, TBC1D4, were found common to more than one THCA type. The most significant hub genes found in the study were: BCL2, CD44, DCN, FN1, IRS1, ITPR1, MFAP4, MKI67, NTRK2, PCLO, TGFA. The most enriched and significant GO terms were Melanocyte differentiation for PTC, Extracellular region for FTC, and Extracellular exosome for ATC. Prostate cancer for PTC was the most significantly enriched KEGG pathway. The results were validated using TCGA data.ConclusionsThe findings unravel potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of thyroid carcinomas.

AB  - Objectives To assess the effect of cryotherapy on haemostasis, post-operative pain, and the outcome of full pulpotomy performed in mature permanent teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.
   Materials and methods The study included sixty mature permanent mandibular molar teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and no periapical rarefaction. After coronal pulp tissue amputation, teeth were randomly allocated to one of two groups (n=30 each). In group I (conventional pulpotomy), a sterile cotton pellet moistened with 2.5% NaOCl was used for haemostasis. In group II (cryotherapy), the pulp chamber was continuously lavaged with 2.5 degrees C normal saline solution for haemostasis using an indigenous portable cryotherapy irrigation unit. Following haemostasis, the pulp was capped with mineral trioxide aggregate and the tooth was restored with resin composite. The time taken to achieve haemostasis was recorded. Preoperative and 24, 48 and 72 h postoperative pain was measured using the Numerical Rating Scale. The pulpotomy outcome was assessed at the 12-month follow-up. Data were analyzed using Fischer's exact test, two-sample t-test, two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Friedman Test, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.
   Results The cryotherapy group achieved haemostasis in less time (p<0.05). There was a significant pain reduction at 24 and 48 h in the cryotherapy group when compared with the conventional pulpotomy group (P<0.005). The overall success rate of pulpotomy after 12 months was 88% (n=22) in both study groups(p<0.05).
   Conclusions Cryotherapy application reduces postoperative pain and has no adverse effect on the outcome of pulpotomy in permanent teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 is a hereditary and neurodegenerative illness commonly found in India. However, there is no established noninvasive automatic diagnostic system for its diagnosis and identification of imaging biomarkers. This work proposes a novel four-phase machine learning-based diagnostic framework to find spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 disease-specific atrophic-brain regions and distinguish spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 from healthy using a real structural magnetic resonance imaging dataset. Firstly, each brain region is represented in terms of statistics of coefficients obtained using 3D-discrete wavelet transform. Secondly, a set of relevant regions are selected using a graph network-based method. Thirdly, a kernel support vector machine is used to capture nonlinear relationships among the voxels of a brain region. Finally, the linear relationship among the brain regions is captured to build a decision model to distinguish spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 from healthy by using the regularized logistic regression method. A classification accuracy of 95% and a harmonic mean of precision and recall, i.e. F1-score of 94.92%, is achieved. The proposed framework provides relevant regions responsible for the atrophy. The importance of each region is captured using Shapley Additive exPlanations values. We also performed a statistical analysis to find volumetric changes in spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 group compared to healthy. The promising result of the proposed framework shows that clinicians can use it for early and timely diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 12.

AB  - STAT1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1), belongs to the STAT protein family, essential for cytokine signaling. It has been reported to have either context dependent oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles in different tumors. Earlier, we demonstrated that Glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs) overexpressing FAT1, an atypical cadherin, had poorer outcomes. Overexpressed FAT1 promotes pro-tumorigenic inflammation, migration/invasion by downregulating tumor suppressor gene, PDCD4. Here, we demonstrate that STAT1 is a novel mediator downstream to FAT1, in downregulating PDCD4 in GBMs. In-silico analysis of GBM databases as well as q-PCR analysis in resected GBM tumors showed positive correlation between STAT1 and FAT1 mRNA levels. Kaplan -Meier analysis showed poorer survival of GBM patients having high FAT1 and STAT1 expression. SiRNAmediated knockdown of FAT1 decreased STAT1 and increased PDCD4 expression in glioblastoma cells (LN229 and U87MG). Knockdown of STAT1 alone resulted in increased PDCD4 expression. In silico analysis of the PDCD4 promoter revealed four putative STAT1 binding sites (Site1-Site4). ChIP assay confirmed the binding of STAT1 to site1. ChIP-PCR revealed decrease in the binding of STAT1 on the PDCD4 promoter after FAT1 knockdown. Site directed mutagenesis of Site1 resulted in increased PDCD4 luciferase activity, substantiating STAT1 mediated PDCD4 inhibition. EMSA confirmed STAT1 binding to the Site 1 sequence. STAT1 knockdown led to decreased expression of pro -inflammatory cytokines and EMT markers, and reduced migration/invasion of GBM cells. This study therefore identifies STAT1 as a novel downstream mediator of FAT1, promoting pro-tumorigenic activity in GBM, by suppressing PDCD4 expression.

AB  - ObjectiveIn recent years, patients with celiac disease (CeD) have been reported to have a high prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in patients with CeD and effect of gluten-free diet in them.MethodsThe PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for original studies upto November 18, 2022. We included full-text articles published in the English language after 1990 that used well-defined criteria for CeD, fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence.ResultsOf 350 studies identified, 11 studies (n = 2578) were included in the analysis. On analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, pooled prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in treatment-na & iuml;ve patients with CeD were 18.2% (95% CI 8.3-30.8%, n = 1237) and 4.3% (95% CI 2.4-6.7, n = 1239) and in those on GFD of varying duration was 28.2% (95% CI 20.7-36.4%, n = 1368) and 21.3% (95% CI 11.7-32.9%, n = 2193), respectively. There was no difference in the prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome between low- or high-income group countries.ConclusionsPatients with CeD have a high prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome which increases further with the initiation of GFD. Patients with CeD should thus be screened and monitored for development of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. They should be counselled appropriately regarding their diet and inclusion of physical activity in their lifestyle.

AB  - The present prospective cohort study evaluated the prevalence of FSH-R receptor Asn680Ser and Ala307Thr among infertile Indian women and the correlation of these polymorphisms with ART outcomes. Total 804 infertile and 209 fertile controls were enrolled for FSH-R analysis. Correlation of different genotypes with ovarian reserve markers, IVF parameters, and cumulative live birth rates (CLBR) was done among women undergoing IVF. In fertile controls, at 680 position GG (Ser/Ser) was the most common genotype; but among infertile women, all the genotypes were equally distributed. There was no significant difference in ovarian response parameters, oocyte yield, and CLBR among the three genotype groups. Empty follicle syndrome (EFS) was highest in women with AA or AG type at both positions. On categorisation of unexpected poor responders according to POSEIDON stratification; GG genotype at both positions had the lowest risk ratio of low-oocyte yield in ART cycles, but these differences were not statistically significant. This is the largest study from Indian ethnicity showing GG (Ser/Ser) genotype is most common among fertile women. The effect of FSH-R genotypes is very marginal on IVF parameters and is not reflected in CLBR. More prospective data may be required on the correlation of these genotypes with genuine EFS, thus stratifying the next cycles with self or donor oocytes. Routine genetic testing of FSH-R polymorphism should not be done except in a research setting. As both 680 and 307 positions are in linkage disequilibrium, only 680 position analysis may be done in a research setting.

AB  - Purpose: Epilepsy type, whether focal or generalised, is important in deciding anti-seizure medication (ASM). In resource-limited settings, investigations are usually not available, so a clinical separation is required. We used a na & iuml;ve Bayes approach to devise an algorithm to do this, and compared its accuracy with algorithms devised by five other machine learning methods. Methods: We used data on 28 clinical variables from 503 patients attending an epilepsy clinic in India with defined epilepsy type, as determined by an epileptologist with access to clinical, imaging, and EEG data. We adopted a machine learning approach to select the most relevant variables based on mutual information, to train the model on part of the data, and then to evaluate it on the remaining data (testing set). We used a na & iuml;ve Bayes approach and compared the results in the testing set with those obtained by several other machine learning algorithms by measuring sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve, and Cohen's kappa. Results: The six machine learning methods produced broadly similar results. The best na & iuml;ve Bayes algorithm contained eleven variables, and its accuracy was 92.2% in determining epilepsy type (sensitivity 92.0%, specificity 92.7%). An algorithm incorporating the best eight of these variables was only slightly less accurate 91.0% (sensitivity 89.6%, and specificity 95.1%) - and easier for clinicians to use. Conclusion: A clinical algorithm with eight variables is effective and accurate at separating focal from generalised epilepsy. It should be useful in resource-limited settings, by epilepsy-inexperienced doctors, to help determine epilepsy type and therefore optimal ASMs for individual patients, without the need for EEG or neuroimaging.

AB  - Following an initial recovery, COVID-19 survivors struggle with a spectrum of persistent medical complications, including fatigue, breathlessness, weight loss, hair loss, and attention deficits. Additionally, there is growing evidence of adverse effects of COVID-19 on the male reproductive system. This investigation seeks to understand the long-term ramifications on male fertility by examining hormonal profiles, semen parameters, and sperm proteome of recovered COVID-19 patients compared to controls. The serum hormone profiles between the two groups showed minimal variations except for prolactin, cortisol, and testosterone levels. Testosterone levels were slightly lower, while prolactin and cortisol were elevated in COVID-19 cases compared to controls. Though semen parameters exhibited no significant disparities between the COVID-19 and control groups, quantitative proteomics analysis revealed changes in sperm proteins. It identified 190 differentially expressed proteins, of which 161 were upregulated and 29 downregulated in COVID-19 cases. Western blotting analysis validated the differential expression of serpin B4 and calpain 2. Bioinformatics analysis signifies cellular stress in the spermatozoa of COVID-19 recovered patients and thus, SOD and MDA levels in semen were measured. MDA levels were found to be significantly elevated, indicating lipid peroxidation in COVID-19 samples. While the effects of COVID-19 on semen parameters may exhibit a potential for reversal within a short duration, the alterations it inflicts on sperm proteome are persisting consequences on male fertility. This study paves the path for further research and emphasizes the significance of comprehending the complex molecular processes underlying the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on male reproductive health.

AB  - We evaluated the performance of various polygenic risk score (PRS) models derived from European (EU), South Asian (SA), and Punjabi Asian Indians (AI) studies on 13,974 subjects from AI ancestry. While all models successfully predicted Coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, the AI, SA, and EU + AI were superior predictors and more transportable than the EU model; the predictive performance in training and test sets was 18% and 22% higher in AI and EU + AI models, respectively than in EU. Comparing individuals with extreme PRS quartiles, the AI and EU + AI captured individuals with high CAD risk showed 2.6 to 4.6 times higher efficiency than the EU. Interestingly, including the clinical risk score did not significantly change the performance of any genetic model. The enrichment of diversity variants in EU PRS improves risk prediction and transportability. Establishing population-specific normative and risk factors and inclusion into genetic models would refine the risk stratification and improve the clinical utility of CAD PRS.

AB  - A 5-year-old girl with autism-spectrum disorder presented with persistent fever, recurrent episodes of projectile vomiting, increased irritability, and reduced oral intake for 2 months. Neuroimaging showed a left parieto-occipital cystic lesion with multiple septations, perilesional edema, and contrast enhancement of the cyst wall (Figure). Differential diagnoses included a cerebral abscess, cystic tumor, and hydatid cyst. Craniotomy was performed, and the cyst was excised (Video 1), with histopathologic examination confirming a hydatid cyst, a zoonosis caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosis. No additional cysts were found in the chest, abdomen, or spine. Intracranial presentation is rare, seen in up to 1%-2%.1 The usual MRI pattern of an intracranial primary hydatid cyst is that of a single clear cyst with a hypointense rim without contrast enhancement or perilesional edema.1 Superimposed infection or rupture can have a multivesicular presentation with contrast enhancement and perilesional edema.1 Treatment is complete excision. Albendazole perioperatively and postoperatively in cases of a ruptured cyst may help reduce recurrence.2

AB  - Breast cancer, a leading cause of female mortality due to delayed detection owing to asymptomatic nature and limited early diagnostic tools, was investigated using a multi-modal approach. Plasma-derived small EVs from breast cancer patients (BrCa, n = 74) and healthy controls (HC, n = 30) were analyzed. Small EVs (n = 104), isolated through chemical precipitation, underwent characterization via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Validation involved antibody-based tests (TSG101, CD9, CD81, CD63). Infrared spectra of small EVs were obtained, revealing significant differences in lipid acyl chains, particularly in the C-H stretching of CH3. The study focused on the lipid region (3050-2900 cm-1), identifying peaks (3015 cm-1, 2960 cm-1, 2929 cm-1) as distinctive lipid characteristics. Spectroscopic lipid-to-lipid ratios [(I3015/I2929), (I2960/I2929)] emerged as prominent breast cancer markers. Exploration of protein, nucleic acid, and carbohydrate ratios indicated variations in alpha helices, asymmetric C-H stretching vibrations, and C-O stretching at 1033 cm-1. Principal component analysis (PCA) successfully differentiated BrCa and HC small EVs, and heatmap analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluations underscored the discriminatory power of lipid ratios. Notably, (I2960/I2929) exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity, highlighting its potential as a robust BrCa sEV marker for breast cancer detection.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of depression in people with limb amputation. Additionally, factors affecting the prevalence or pattern of depression following limb amputation were explored. Methods: Systematic literature search to identify all relevant studies assessing prevalence of depression following limb amputations was conducted through following databases: PubMed/ MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science. Search period was since inception of database till December 2021. Meta-analyses using random-effects model were conducted to estimate pooled prevalence of depression. Results: A total of 61 studies comprising 9852 limb amputees were included. Pooled prevalence of depression following limb amputations was 33.85% (95% CI: 27.15% to 40.54%), with significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 98.57%; p < 0.001). Sub-group meta-analysis showed that pooled prevalence of depression was significantly higher in studies conducted from middle-income (45.31%, 95% CI: 28.92% to 61.70%) as compared high income countries (28.31%, 95% CI: 23.97% to 32.64%). Greater activity restriction, amputation-related body image disturbances, social discomfort, perceived vulnerability regarding disability, and avoidant coping style were commonly reported factors associated with greater depression symptomatology. Whereas, good perceived social support, and use of more active coping strategies were commonly reported protective factors. Conclusion: About one-third of all limb amputees suffered from clinically significant depression. This emphasizes need to sensitize health care professionals involved in providing care to people following limb amputation regarding the importance of periodically screening this vulnerable group of patients for depression and liaising with psychiatrists. Further, addressing risk factors identified in this review could help in reducing the rates of depression post-amputation.

AB  - Dengue viruses (DENV) are positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. DENV is the causative agent of dengue, the most rapidly spreading viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Each year, millions of people contract the virus through bites from infected female mosquitoes of the Aedes species. In the majority of individuals, the infection is asymptomatic, and the immune system successfully manages to control virus replication within a few days. Symptomatic individuals may present with a mild fever (Dengue fever or DF) that may or may not progress to a more critical disease termed Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or the fatal Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In the absence of a universally accepted prophylactic vaccine or therapeutic drug, treatment is mostly restricted to supportive measures. Similar to many other viruses that induce acute illness, DENV has developed several ways to modulate host metabolism to create an environment conducive to genome replication and the dissemination of viral progeny. To search for new therapeutic options, understanding the underlying host-virus regulatory system involved in various biological processes of the viral life cycle is essential. This review aims to summarize the complex interaction between DENV and the host cellular machinery, comprising regulatory mechanisms at various molecular levels such as epigenetic modulation of the host genome, transcription of host genes, translation of viral and host mRNAs, post-transcriptional regulation of the host transcriptome, post-translational regulation of viral proteins, and pathways involved in protein degradation.

AB  - BackgroundThe pediatric sizes of BlockBuster supraglottic airway (SGA) have been introduced recently. Its efficacy as a conduit for endotracheal intubation in children has not been assessed. Newer devices are often compared with Air-Q SGA to assess their intubating capability. AimsThe primary objective was to compare the time taken for fiber-optic-guided intubation through the BlockBuster and the Air-Q SGAs. MethodsSixty children aged 6 months to 12 years with normal airways were randomized into two groups: Air-Q SGA (Group A) and Blockbuster SGA (Group B). After administration of general anesthesia, an appropriately sized SGA was inserted. The time taken for fiber-optic-guided intubation through the SGA, success, ease, and time for SGA insertion and removal were noted. The glottic view was graded by fiber-optic bronchoscopy. ResultsDemographic parameters were comparable. The time to intubate with the BlockBuster 62.40 +/- 17.2 s was comparable to the Air-Q 60.8 +/- 18.5 s (mean difference 1.6 s, 95% CI -7.65 to10.85; p = .73). The average time for SGA insertion in BlockBuster and Air-Q was 14.57 +/- 3.2 s and 16.67 +/- 5.39 s, respectively (mean difference -2.1, 95% CI -4.39 to 0.19 s; p = .07). The first-attempt intubation success and overall intubation success rates were comparable in both groups, 96.7% and 100%, respectively. In Group B, 25/3/1/1/0 cases had a glottic view grade of 1/2/3/4/5, respectively. In Group A, 23/3/2/2/0 cases had grade of 1/2/3/4/5 glottic views respectively. The average time to SGA removal was comparable between the BlockBuster (20.17 +/- 5.8 s) and the Air-Q (22.5 +/- 12.8 s) groups (mean difference -2.3 s, 95% CI -7.5 to 2.82 s; p = .37). None of the children had any perioperative complications. ConclusionBlockBuster SGA may be a useful alternative to Air-Q for SGA-assisted, fiber-optic-guided tracheal intubation in children.

AB  - The function of CD5 protein in T cells is well documented, but regulation of its surface-level expression has yet to be fully understood. However, variation in its surface expression is associated with various immunopathological conditions and haematological malignancies. Briefly, expression of an alternate exon E1B of a human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) origin directly downregulates the conventional transcript variant (E1A), as its expression leads to the retention of the resultant protein at the intracellular level (cCD5). A separate promoter governs the expression of E1B and may be influenced by different transcription factors. Hence, we performed in silico transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis of the 3 kb upstream region from TSS of exon E1B and found five putative DREs (Dioxin Response elements) with good similarity scores. Further, we observed the upregulation in E1B expression after the exposure of BaP (a dioxin) and the reduction of E1A expression and their respective protein, i.e. sCD5 and cCD5. The binding of AHR at the predicted DRE sites was confirmed by ChIP qPCR and AHR specific inhibitor and gene silencing studies suggested the involvement of AHR in exonal switch. This study indicates that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon decreases the sCD5 expression by upregulating alternative exon expression, which may adversely affect the overall T cell functions.

AB  - Introduction: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by a persistent propensity for seizure generation. About one-third of patients do not achieve seizure control with the first-line treatment options, which include >20 antiseizure medications. It is therefore imperative that new medications with novel targets and mechanisms of action are developed. Areas covered: Clinical studies and preclinical research increasingly implicate Non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. To date, several nRTK members have been linked to processes relevant to the development of epilepsy. Therefore, in this review, we provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which the various nRTK subfamilies can contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. We further highlight the prospective use of specific nRTK inhibitors in the treatment of epilepsy deriving evidence from existing literature providing a rationale for their use as therapeutic targets. Expert opinion: Specific small-molecule inhibitors of NRTKs can be employed for the targeted therapy as already seen in other diseases by examining the precise molecular pathways regulated by them contributing to the development of epilepsy. However, the evidence supporting NRTKs as therapeutic targets are limiting in nature thus, necessitating more research to fully comprehend their function in the development and propagation of seizures.

AB  - Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular malignancy of childhood. Advanced stage presentation of RB is common in low middle-income countries (LMICs) due to lack of awareness, social taboos associated with enucleation, seeking alternative conservative treatment options, and poor accessibility to health care. Over the last few decades, there have been significant advancements in the management of extraocular RB (EORB) which have improved outcomes and helped in minimizing treatment-related toxicities. The incorporation of multimodality approaches including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy (RT) has shown promising results; however, prognosis remains poor especially in LMICs. In this article, authors have discussed the ICMR consensus guidelines on the management of EORB, including metastatic RB.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a heterogeneous condition that encompasses a wide range of liver diseases that progresses from simple hepatic steatosis to the life-threatening state of cirrhosis. However, due to the heterogeneity of this disease, comprehensive analysis of several physicochemical and biological factors that drive its progression is necessary. Therefore, an in vitro platform is required that would enable real-time monitoring of these changes to better understand the progression of these diseases. The earliest stage of NAFLD, i.e. hepatic steatosis, is characterised by triglyceride accumulation in the form of lipid vacuoles in the cytosol of hepatocytes. This fatty acid accumulation is usually accompanied by hepatic inflammation, leading to tissue acidification and dysregulated expression of certain proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Taking cues from the biological parameters of the disease, we report here a 3D in vitro GelMA/alginate microscaffold platform encapsulating a triple-marker (pH, MMP-3 and MMP-9) sensitive fluorescent nanoprobe for monitoring, and hence, distinguishing the fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis) from healthy livers on the basis of pH change and MMP expression. The nanoprobe consists of a carbon nanoparticle (CNP) core, which exhibits intrinsic pH-dependent fluorescence properties, decorated either with an MMP-3 (NpMMP3) or MMP-9 (NpMMP9) sensitive peptide substrate. These peptide substrates are flanked with a fluorophore-quencher pair that separates on enzymatic cleavage, resulting in fluorescence emission. The cocktail of these nanoprobes generated multiple fluorescence signals corresponding to slightly acidic pH (blue) and overexpression of MMP-3 (green) and MMP-9 (red) enzymes in a 3D in vitro fatty liver model, whereas no/negligible fluorescence signals were observed in a healthy liver model. Moreover, this platform enabled us to mimic fatty liver disease in a more realistic manner. Therefore, this 3D in vitro platform encapsulating triple-marker sensitive fluorescent nanoprobes would facilitate the monitoring of the changes in pH and MMP expression, thereby enabling us to distinguish a healthy liver from a diseased liver and to study liver disease stages on the basis of these markers.

AB  - Objective: This paper explores the role of depressive symptoms (mediator/moderator) in the association between physical multimorbidity (exposure) and cognitive function (outcome) among older adults in the three most populous middle-income countries. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from China (2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study), India (2017/2018 Longitudinal Ageing Study in India), and Indonesia (2014/2015 Indonesian Family Life Survey), with a total sample of 73,199 respondents aged >= 45 years. Three domains of cognitive tests were harmonised across surveys, including time orientation, word recall, and numeracy. The four-way decomposition analysis assessed the mediation and interaction effects between exposure, mediator/moderator, and outcome, adjusted for covariates. Results: The mean age of the respondents (in years) was slightly younger in Indonesia (56.0, SD = 8.8) than in China (59.5, SD = 9.3) and India (60.0, SD = 10.5). The proportion of male respondents was 49.3 % in China, 47.3 % in India, and 47.5 % in Indonesia. Respondents in China had the highest mean cognitive function z scores (54.7, SD = 19.9), followed by India (51.1, SD = 20.0) and Indonesia (51.0, SD = 18.4). Physical multimorbidity was associated with lower cognitive function in China and India (p < 0.0001), with 48.4 % and 40.0 % of the association explained by the mediating effect of depressive symptoms ('overall proportion due to mediation'). The association was not found in Indonesia. Conclusion: Cognitive functions were lower among individuals with physical multimorbidity, and depressive symptoms mainly explained the association. Addressing depressive symptoms among persons with physical multimorbidity is likely to have not only an impact on their mental health but could prevent cognitive decline.

AB  - JAK-STAT signalling pathway inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of hair loss. Among different JAK isoforms, JAK3 has become an ideal target for drug discovery because it only regulates a narrow spectrum of gamma c cytokines. Here, we report the discovery of MJ04, a novel and highly selective 3-pyrimidinylazaindole based JAK3 inhibitor, as a potential hair growth promoter with an IC50 of 2.03 nM. During in vivo efficacy assays, topical application of MJ04 on DHT-challenged AGA and athymic nude mice resulted in early onset of hair regrowth. Furthermore, MJ04 significantly promoted the growth of human hair follicles under ex-vivo conditions. MJ04 exhibited a reasonably good pharmacokinetic profile and demonstrated a favourable safety profile under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Taken together, we report MJ04 as a highly potent and selective JAK3 inhibitor that exhibits overall properties suitable for topical drug development and advancement to human clinical trials.

AB  - Initial therapies for children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome include alternate-day prednisolone that is given daily during infections, or levamisole. In this open label, non-inferiority trial, 160 patients, 2 to 18-years- old with frequent relapses, were randomly assigned to receive either prednisolone (0.5-0.7 mg/kg/alternate-day, given daily during infections), or levamisole (2-2.5 mg/kg/ alternate-days) for one-year. Patients with relapses on alternate day prednisolone at over 1 mg/kg, prior use of potent steroid-sparing therapies, eGFR under 60 ml/min/ 1.73 m2 2 and significant steroid toxicity were excluded. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients with frequent relapses, defined as three-relapses in one-year, or two-relapses within six-months if associated with significant steroid toxicity or loss to follow up. Eighty patients each were randomized to receive prednisolone and levamisole. Baseline features showed preponderance of young patients presenting within two-years of disease onset. On intention-to-treat analysis, frequent relapses were more common in patients administered prednisolone (40% versus 22.5%; risk difference 17.5%; 95% confidence interval 3.4-31.6%). Prednisolone was not non-inferior to levamisole in preventing frequent relapses. However, the two groups showed similar proportions of patients in sustained remission, comparable frequency of relapses, and low frequency of adverse events. The decline in steroid requirement from baseline was higher in the levamisole group. Per-protocol analysis showed similar results. These results have implications for choice of therapy for frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Although therapy with alternate-day prednisolone was not non- inferior to levamisole in preventing frequent relapses, both therapies were effective in other outcome measures. Thus, levamisole was relatively steroid-sparing and may be preferred in patients at risk of steroid toxicity.

AB  - BackgroundIndividuals with bleeding disorders have been reported to have a number of oral health issues due to varying conditions. A comprehensive evaluation of the different oral health conditions has not been carried out in the past. This systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to collate and critically analyse existing research, and provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on oral health.MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted in electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus and Embase, in October 2023. No restriction on time frame or language was applied. The risk of bias for cross-sectional studies was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tool, and case control studies were assessed using the New Castle Ottawa Scale (NOS).ResultsTwenty-two articles were included in the final analysis with a total sample size of 2422 subjects. Of the 22 articles assessed, nine quantitative assessments were included in the Meta analysis. Pooled data analysis was carried out. A total of 13 studies reported medium risk whereas the remaining nine studies showed low risk of bias. The weighted mean DMFT scores in individuals with bleeding disorders were found to be 2.43 [0.62. 4.24], mean dmft was 2.79 [1.05, 4.53] and mean OHI-S was reported to be 1.79 [1.00, 2.57], respectively.ConclusionThe findings emphasize that these individuals have fair oral hygiene and lower dmft/DMFT scores. Oral bleeding emerged as an important oral health component to be cautiously dealt with particularly during the stages of exfoliation/shedding.

AB  - Objectives: A videolaryngoscope may decrease the high incidence of aberrant positioning of supraglottic airway devices (SAD) inserted with blind techniques. We aimed to compare Igel insertion characteristics between blind and videolaryngoscope-assisted techniques. Methods: In this study 70 adult patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were randomly divided into blind (Group B, n = 35) and videolaryngoscope-guided (Group V, n = 35) Igel insertion. Oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP), fiber-optic view score, time for device insertion, first attempt success, ease of insertion, ventilation score, maneuvers, and adverse events were assessed. Results: OLP was significantly higher in group V at 1 and 10 minutes (24.80 +/- 1.91 vs 21.71 +/- 2.37; p < 0.001 and 32.60 +/- 2.32 vs 30.68 +/- 2.93; p = 0.006). The mean fiberoptic scoring (3.63 +/- 0.49 vs 3.38 +/- 0.49; p = 0.043), a fibreoptic score of grade 4 (24 vs 13; p = 0.012) and time-to-device insertion (25.6 +/- 3.5 vs 21.7 +/- 4.1; p < 0.001) was considerably higher in group V. First-attempt success (p = 0.630), ease of insertion of SAD (p = 0.540) and nasogastric tube (p = 1), ventilation score (p = 1), number of maneuvers required (p = 1), number of attempts (p = 0.592) and postoperative complications (p = 0.800) were comparable in the two groups. Conclusion: The videolaryngoscope-guided technique provided superior airway sealing and reduced malposition of Igel without an increase in adverse events compared to the blind technique. However, this was at the cost of increased time of device insertion.

AB  - Background and Aim: Abnormalities in the reproductive functions are often ignored while evaluating a patient with celiac disease (CeD). We evaluated the entire reproductive functions in female patients with CeD. Methods: In a case control study between 2020 and 2021 using detailed questionnaire, we evaluated reproductive functions (age at menarche, menstrual pattern, fertility, pregnancy outcome and menopause) in biopsy-proven female patients with CeD of age >10 years. The questionnaire was administered either in person or telephonically. Age-matched healthy female controls (twice the number) were also recruited. Results: Of 1086 CeD patients, 470 were females and 288 were included. As compared with controls (n = 586), females with CeD had higher age at menarche (14.6 +/- 2.0 vs 13.6 +/- 1.5 years; P = 0.001), delayed menarche (30.8% vs 11.4%; P = 0.001), abnormal menstrual pattern (39.7% vs 25.8%; P < 0.001), involuntary delay in conception at > 1 year (33.8% vs 11.8%; P = 0.01), current infertility rate (10.5% vs 5.2%;P = 0.028), and poorer overall pregnancy outcomes (abortion [23.5% vs 12.8%; P = 0.001], pre-term birth [16.3% vs 3.7%; P = 0.001]). Conclusions: Either one or more aspect of reproductive functions and pregnancy outcome is affected adversely in three-fourth female patients with CeD.

AB  - Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (9;22)(q34;q11) comprises 90-95 % of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), while 5-10 % of CML have translocations involving three or more chromosomes. The outcome of treating patients harbouring complex Ph-positive cytogenetics with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is unclear. In the present systematic review, we aim to summarise the response of patients with complex Ph-positive cytogenetics to treatment with TKI therapy. We collated all available literature from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science database, Cochrane library, Scopus and Embase (up until January 31st, 2024), which describe cases of patients with CML, harbouring complex Ph-positive variations (three and four-way translocations), and summarised their response to TKI therapy. The studies were screened for the following criteria: documented TKI intervention and outcome (whether CR was achieved). Studies that did not report the same, were excluded. Additionally, we report a case from our center of a 55-year-old patient with CML, positive for the Ph-chromosome, harbouring a three-way translocation involving chromosome 15 i.e. 46XX, t(9;15;22) (q34;p11;q11). Identification of BCR::ABL and involvement of chromosome 15 was carried out using conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Based on the inclusion criteria, a total of 15 studies were included from which a total of 87 cases were covered. Overall, we identified 38 unique complex three- and four-way translocations across 87 Ph-positive cases and found that 85 patients with complex Ph-positive cytogenetics achieved complete remission upon treatment and did not appear to have a lesser response to TKI therapy.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a global increase in cases of male infertility. There are about 30 million cases of male infertility worldwide and male reproductive health is showing rapid decline in last few decades. It is now recognized as a potential risk factor for developing certain types of cancer, particularly genitourinary malignancies like testicular and prostate cancer. Male infertility is considered a potential indicator of overall health and an early biomarker for cancer. Cases of unexplained male factor infertility have high levels of oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage and this induces both denovo germ line mutations and epimutations due to build up of 8-hydroxy 2 deoxygunaosine abase which is highly mutagenic and also induces hypomethylation and genomic instability. Consequently, there is growing evidence to explore the various factors contributing to an increased cancer risk. Currently, the available prognostic and predictive biomarkers associated with semen characteristics and cancer risk are limited but gaining significant attention in clinical research for the diagnosis and treatment of elevated cancer risk in the individual and in offspring. The male germ cell being transcriptionally and translationally inert has a highly truncated repair mechanism and has minimal antioxidants and thus most vulnerable to oxidative injury due to environmental factors and unhealthy lifestyle and social habits. Therefore, advancing our understanding requires a thorough evaluation of the pathophysiologic mechanisms at the DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite levels to identify key biomarkers that may underlie the pathogenesis of male infertility and associated cancer. Advanced methodologies such as genomics, epigenetics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics stand at the forefront of cutting-edge approaches for discovering novel biomarkers, spanning from infertility to associated cancer types. Henceforth, in this review, we aim to assess the role and potential of recently identified predictive and prognostic biomarkers, offering insights into the success of assisted reproductive technologies, causes of azoospermia and idiopathic infertility, the impact of integrated holistic approach and lifestyle modifications, and the monitoring of cancer susceptibility, initiation and progression. Comprehending these biomarkers is crucial for providing comprehensive counselling to infertile men and cancer patients, along with their families.

AB  - Malaria is a life-threatening disease that affects tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Various drugs were used to treat malaria, including artemisinin and derivatives, antibiotics (tetracycline, doxycycline), quinolines (chloroquine, amodiaquine), and folate antagonists (sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine). Since the malarial parasites developed drug resistance, there is a need to develop new chemical entities with high efficacy and low toxicity. In this context, 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes emerged as an essential scaffold and have shown promising antimalarial activity. To improve activity and overcome resistance to various antimalarial drugs; 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes were fused with various aryl/heteroaryl/alicyclic/spiro moieties (steroid-based 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, triazine-based 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, aminoquinoline-based 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, dispiro-based 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, piperidine-based 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes and diaryl-based 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes). The present review aims to focus on covering the relevant literature published during the past 30 years (1992-2022). We summarize the most significant in vitro, in vivo results and structure-activity relationship studies of 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane-based hybrids as antimalarial agents. The structural evolution of different hybrids can provide the framework for the future development of 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane-based hybrids to treat malaria.

AB  - The genetic loci implicated in familial Parkinson's disease (PD) have limited generalizability to the Indian PD population. We tested mutations and the frequency of known mutations in the SNCA gene in a PD cohort from India. We selected 298 PD cases and 301 age-matched controls for targeted resequencing (before QC), along with 363 PD genomes of Indian ancestry and 1029 publicly available whole genomes from India as healthy controls (IndiGenomes), to determine the frequency of monogenic SNCA mutations. The raw sequence reads were analyzed using an in-house analysis pipeline, allowing the detection of small variants and structural variants using Manta. The in-depth analysis of the SNCA locus did not identify missense or structural variants, including previously identified SNCA mutations, in the Indian population. The familial forms of SNCA gene variants do not play a major role in the Indian PD population and this warrants further research in the under-represented population.

AB  - Background: Pathogenic variants in the NDUFV1 gene disrupt mitochondrial complex I, leading to neuroregression with leukoencephalopathy and basal ganglia involvement on neuroimaging. This study aims to provide a concise review on NDUFV1 -related disorders while adding the largest cohort from a single center to the existing literature. Methods: We retrospectively collected genetically proven cases of NDUFV1 pathogenic variants from our center over the last decade and explored reported instances in existing literature. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns observed in these patients were split into three types -Leigh (putamen, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem involvement), mitochondrial leukodystrophy (ML) (cerebral white matter involvement with cystic cavitations), and mixed (both). Results: Analysis included 44 children (seven from our center and 37 from literature). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertonia, ocular abnormalities, feeding issues, and hypotonia at onset. Children with the Leigh -type MRI pattern exhibited signi ficantly higher rates of breathing dif ficulties, whereas those with a mixed phenotype had a higher prevalence of dystonia. The c.1156C >T variant in exon 8 of the NDUFV1 gene was the most common variant among individuals of Asian ethnicity and is predominantly associated with irritability and dystonia. Seizures and Leigh pattern of MRI of the brain was found to be less commonly associated with this variant. Higher rate of mortality was observed in children with Leigh -type pattern on brain MRI and those who did not receive mitochondrial cocktail. Conclusions: MRI phenotyping might help predict outcome. Appropriate and timely treatment with mitochondrial cocktail may reduce the probability of death and may positively impact the long-term outcomes, regardless of the genetic variant or age of onset.

AB  - Introduction: Hand foot skin reaction (HFSR) is a common dose-limiting adverse effect of multi kinase inhibitors (MKI) whose mechanism is not fully understood, and the prophylaxis is inadequate. Objective: In this pilot study, a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of topical urea in secondary prevention of sunitinib-induced HFSR in renal cell cancer patients. Methods: Out of 55 screened patients, 14 were randomized to receive topical urea or placebo for four weeks. The association of HFSR with drug levels of sunitinib and its metabolite (n-desethyl sunitinib), genetic polymorphism of VEGFR2 gene, quality of life (QOL) and biochemical markers was also assessed. Results: The results showed that urea-based cream was not superior to placebo (P = .075). There was no change in the QOL in both the groups. Single nucleotide polymorphism was checked for two nucleotides rs1870377 and rs2305948 located in VEGFR2 gene on chromosome 4. SNP (variant T > A) at rs1870377 was associated with appearance of new HFSR as compared to the wild type, although the association was not statistically significant (OR 0.714). There was no statistically significant difference between mean plasma levels of sunitinib and N-desethyl sunitinib in urea arm as compared to placebo arm as compared to placebo. The best fit population pharmacokinetic model for sunitinib was one compartment model with first order absorption and linear elimination. The median (IQR) of population parameters calculated from the population pharmacokinetics model for Ka, V and Cl was 0.22 (0.21-0.24) h-1, 4.4 (4.09-4.47) L, 0.049 (0.042-0.12) L/hr, respectively. Conclusion: The study suggested that the urea-based cream was not superior to placebo in decreasing the appearance of new HFSR in renal cancer patients receiving 4:2 regimen of sunitinib.

AB  - HIV infection has been a global public health threat and overall reported similar to 40 million deaths. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is attributed to the retroviruses (HIV-1/2), disseminated through various body fluids. The temporal progression of AIDS is in context to the rate of HIV-1 infection, which is twice as protracted in HIV-2 transmission. Q-PCR is the only available method that requires a well-developed lab infrastructure and trained personnel. Micro-PCR, a portable Q-PCR device, was developed by Bigtec Labs, Bangalore, India. It is simple, accurate, fast, and operationalised in remote places where diagnostic services are inaccessible in developing countries. This novel micro-PCR determines HIV-1 and HIV-2 viral load using a TruePrep (TM) extractor device for RNA isolation. Five ml blood samples were collected at the blood collection centre at AIIMS, New Delhi, India. Samples were screened for serology, and a comparison of HIV-1/2 RNA was done between qPCR and micro-PCR in the samples. The micro-PCR assay of HIV-RNA has compared well with those from real-time PCR (r = 0.99, i < 0.002). Micro-PCR has good inter and intra-assay reproducibility over a wide dynamic range (1.0 x 10(2)-1.0 x 10(8) IU/ml). The linear dynamic range was 10(2)-10(8) IU/ml. The clinical and analytical specificity of the assay was comparable, i.e., 100%. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 1.17% to 3.15% and from 0.02% to 0.46%, respectively. Moreover, due to the robust, simple, and empirical method, the Probit analysis has also been done for qPCR LODs to avoid uncertainties in target recoveries. The micro-PCR is reliable, accurate, and reproducible for early detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 viral loads simultaneously. Thus, it can easily be used in the field and in remote places where quantification of both HIV-1/2 is not reachable.

AB  - Objective Mitotane is an important cornerstone in the treatment of pediatric adrenal cortical tumors (pACC), but experience with the drug in the pediatric age group is still limited and current practice is not guided by robust evidence. Therefore, we have compiled international consensus statements from pACC experts on mitotane indications, therapy, and management of adverse effects.Methods A Delphi method with 3 rounds of questionnaires within the pACC expert consortium of the international network groups European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors pediatric working group (ENSAT-PACT) and International Consortium of pediatric adrenocortical tumors (ICPACT) was used to create 21 final consensus statements.Results We divided the statements into 4 groups: environment, indications, therapy, and adverse effects. We reached a clear consensus for mitotane treatment for advanced pACC with stages III and IV and with incomplete resection/tumor spillage. For stage II patients, mitotane is not generally indicated. The timing of initiating mitotane therapy depends on the clinical condition of the patient and the setting of the planned therapy. We recommend a starting dose of 50 mg/kg/d (1500 mg/m(2)/d) which can be increased up to 4000 mg/m2/d. Blood levels should range between 14 and 20 mg/L. Duration of mitotane treatment depends on the clinical risk profile and tolerability. Mitotane treatment causes adrenal insufficiency in virtually all patients requiring glucocorticoid replacement shortly after beginning. As the spectrum of adverse effects of mitotane is wide-ranging and can be life-threatening, frequent clinical and neurological examinations (every 2-4 weeks), along with evaluation and assessment of laboratory values, are required.Conclusions The Delphi method enabled us to propose an expert consensus statement, which may guide clinicians, further adapted by local norms and the individual patient setting. In order to generate evidence, well-constructed studies should be the focus of future efforts.

AB  - To synthesise the evidence comparing the incidence rates of UAS post-RARC vs Open Radical cystectomy (ORC) in adults undergoing cystectomy and to compare differential stricture rates between Extracorporeal and Intracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD vs ICUD). The primary outcome was incidence rate of UAS post RARC vs ORC and the secondary outcome was incidence rate of UAS in RARC post ECUD vs ICUD. Review authors conducted comprehensive search for studies comparing RARC with ORC in terms of incidence of UAS. Furthermore, we conducted a secondary search for studies which compared UAS incidence comparing ECUD and ICUD. We found that RARC may have higher incidence of UAS [OR: 1.39; 95% CI 1.11-1.75; p < 0.0001]. ECUD may result in lower rate of UAS as compared to ICUD [OR: 0.74; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98; p= 0.04].

AB  - Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a novel real-time lung imaging technology for personalized ventilation adjustments, indicating promising results in animals and humans. The present study aimed to assess its clinical utility for improved ventilation and oxygenation compared to traditional protocols. Comprehensive electronic database screening was done until 30th November, 2023. Randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, comparative cohort studies, and assessments of EIT-guided PEEP titration and conventional methods in adult ARDS patients regarding outcome, ventilatory parameters, and P/F ratio were included. Our search retrieved five controlled cohort studies and two RCTs with 515 patients and overall reduced risk of mortality [RR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.95; I2 = 0%], better dynamic compliance [MD = 3.46; 95% CI: 1.59 to 5.34; I2 = 0%] with no significant difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio [MD = 6.5; 95%CI -13.86 to 26.76; I2 = 74%]. The required information size except PaO2/FiO2 was achieved for a power of 95% based on the 50% reduction in risk of mortality, 10% improved compliance as the cumulative Z-score of the said outcomes crossed the alpha spending boundary and did not dip below the inner wedge of futility. EIT-guided individualized PEEP titration is a novel modality; further well-designed studies are needed to substantiate its utility.
   Question: Is the EIT-guided PEEP titration in ARDS universally beneficial and effective?Findings: This systematic review found better survivability, dynamic compliance, in ARDS patients, as the required information size was achieved for a power of 95%. There was no significant improvement in oxygenation and successful weaning incidence compared to conventional methods. However, the required information size for these contexts is yet to be achieved.Meaning: EIT-guided PEEP titration in ARDS patients showed promising results and warranted further clinical trials.

AB  - Fungal infections of cornea are important causes of blindness especially in developing nations with tropical climate. However, the challenges associated with current treatments are responsible for poor outcome. Natamycin is the only FDA -approved antifungal drug to treat fungal keratitis, but unfortunately due to its poor water solubility, it is available as suspension. The marketed suspension (5% Natamycin) has rapid precorneal clearance, poor corneal permeability, a higher frequency of administration, and corneal irritation due to undissolved suspended drug particles. In our study, we developed clear and stable natamycin-loaded nanomicelles (1% Natcel) to overcome the above challenges. We demonstrated that 1% Natcel could permeate the cornea better than 5% suspension. The developed 1% Natcel was able to provide sustained release for up to 24 h. Further, it was found to be biocompatible and also improved the mean residence time (MRT) than 5% suspension in tears. Therefore, the developed 1% Natcel could be a potential alternative treatment for fungal keratitis.

AB  - This study conducts the first meta-analysis to assess the aggregated risk of malignancy associated with each category of the International System for Reporting Serous Fluid Cytopathology (ISRSFC) for reporting serous effusion cytology, while also evaluating diagnostic accuracy. PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase were systematically searched using the keywords "(pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial effusions) AND (serous effusion cytology) OR (International System for Reporting Serous Fluid Cytopathology)". Articles underwent risk of bias assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. After excluding inadequate samples, a meta-analysis determined sensitivity and specificity for different cutoff points, including "atypical considered positive," "suspicious of malignancy considered positive," and "malignant considered positive." Summary receiver operating characteristic curves assessed diagnostic accuracy, and the diagnostic odds ratio was pooled. Sixteen retrospective cross-sectional studies, totaling 19,128 cases, were included. Sensitivity and specificity for the "atypical and higher risk categories" considered positive were 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68%-84%) and 95% (95% CI, 93%-97%) respectively. For the "suspicious for malignancy and higher risk categories" considered positive, sensitivity and specificity were 57% (95% CI, 49%-65%) and 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%) respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the "malignant" category considered positive for malignancy were 70% (95% CI, 60%-77%) and 99% (95% CI, 98%-99%), respectively. The pooled area under the curve ranged from 85% to 89.5% for each cutoff. This meta-analysis underscores the ISRSFC's accuracy in reporting serous fluid cytology. It emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the "suspicious" and "malignant" categories in identifying malignancy, and the role of the "benign" category in ruling out malignancy.

AB  - Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common childhood intraocular malignancy. Delayed presentation due to a lack of awareness and advanced intraocular tumors are a common scenario in low-middle income countries (LMICs). Remarkable treatment advances have been made in the past few decades allowing globe salvage in advanced intraocular RB (IORB) including systemic chemotherapy with focal consolidation and targeted treatments like intraarterial chemotherapy and intravitreal chemotherapy. However, a lack of availability and affordability limits the use of such advances in LMICs. External beam radiotherapy, despite risk of second cancers in RB with germline mutations, still remains useful for recalcitrant RB not responding to any other treatment. When choosing conservative treatment for advanced IORB, the cost and long duration of treatment, morbidity from multiple evaluation under anesthesias (EUAs), side effects of treatment and risk of treatment failure need to be taken into account and discussed with the parents. In this article, the authors discuss the ICMR consensus guidelines on the management of IORB.

Methods 38 patients with 45 adnexal masses were enrolled in this prospective study and assessed with multiparametric MRI, including the IVIM-DKI sequence, on a 3 T MRI system. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from conventional DWI, the apparent diffusion coefficient derived from DKI (D-app), the apparent kurtosis coefficient (K-app), true diffusion coefficient (D-t), perfusion fraction (f) and pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D-p) were measured. Results The mean ADC, D-app, and D-t were significantly higher in benign adnexal masses than in malignant adnexal masses (p < 0.001). f and D-p were also significantly higher in benign adnexal masses, with p values of 0.026 and 0.002, respectively. K-app was higher in malignant masses (p < 0.001). Among mean ADC, D-app, and D-t, mean ADC had the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.885. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the ROCs of various diffusion parameters. Conclusion The mean ADC, D-app, and K-app are useful parameters in discriminating between benign and malignant adnexal masses. D-t derived from IVIM also helps in distinguishing benign and malignant adnexal masses; however, no incremental role of IVIM and DKI over ADC could be identified in our study.

AB  - A highly selective and sensitive label-free liquid crystal (LC)-based optical DNA biosensor has been reported for the detection of bacterial disease. A sensing platform is constructed using nematic LC (4-cyano-4'-pentyl biphenyl) filled in a confined mesh area of transmission electron microscope (TEM) grid placed within a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well of a fixed dimension for the detection of bacterial infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The optical response associated with LC orientation was investigated by using N. gonorrhoeae nucleotide-specific oligonucleotide probe interacting with both the synthetic complementary ssDNA as well as genomic DNA isolated from N. gonorrhoeae under polarised optical microscope. The grey scale area of the resultant POM images was quantised using Image J software and monitored as a function of DNA concentration. The LC-cell has been able to detect the genomic DNA of N. gonorrhoeae bacteria down to the lowest detectable concentration of 10 pM. The optical response studies of LC-biosensor with genomic DNAs isolated from different bacteria showed high specificity and selectivity exclusively for N. gonorrhoeae pathogen and its potential as a convenient, rapid, and reliable label-free detection for gonorrhoea disease.

AB  - Objective To determine if systemic administration of low-molecular-weight heparin impacts venous compromise in loco-regional flap reconstruction for head and neck subsites.Methods This prospective study was conducted on patients who had developed features of venous compromise of the flap. The case group received low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin).Results Of the 73 patients who developed venous congestion, low-molecular-weight heparin was administered in 47 patients. In the low-molecular-weight heparin subset, 23 patients had either reversal or non-progression of venous compromise (48.9 per cent). Of the patients who had no response to low-molecular-weight heparin rescue, complete necrosis was seen in 4 and partial flap necrosis was observed in 19. The corresponding numbers in the control group were 13 and 12, respectively (odds ratio 23.9, p = 0.002). Additionally, the low-molecular-weight heparin arm had a lower incidence of partial or complete flap necrosis (p = 0.002).Conclusion Low-molecular-weight heparin salvage, when instituted early, is likely to result in a significant reduction in flap-related morbidity.

TI  - Management of the infant born to a mother with tuberculosis: a systematic review and consensus practice guideline
T2  - LANCET CHILD & ADOLESCENT HEALTH
KW  - BURDEN
AB  - Infants born to mothers with tuberculosis disease are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis disease themselves. We reviewed published studies and guidelines on the management of these infants to inform the development of a consensus practice guideline. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from database inception to Dec 1, 2022, for original studies reporting the management and outcome of infants born to mothers with tuberculosis. Of the 521 published papers identified, only three met inclusion criteria and no evidence-based conclusions could be drawn from these studies, given their narrow scope, variable aims, descriptive nature, inconsistent data collection, and high attrition rates. We also assessed a collection of national and international guidelines to inform a consensus practice guideline developed by an international panel of experts from different epidemiological contexts. The 16 guidelines reviewed had consistent features to inform the expert consultation process. Two management algorithms were developed-one for infants born to mothers considered potentially infectious at the time of delivery and another for mothers not considered infectious at the time of delivery-with different guidance for high and low tuberculosis incidence settings. This systematic review and consensus practice guideline should facilitate more consistent clinical management, support the collection of better data, and encourage the development of more studies to improve evidence-based care.

AB  - Objective: Recently, the ILAE Nosology and Definitions Task Force defined diagnostic criteria for epilepsy syndromes. There is paucity of data on the use of these new diagnostic criteria in children with epilepsy, and how these criteria may lead to changes from previous practice. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of data of children attending the epilepsy clinic in a tertiary care children's hospital from January 2011 to January 2023. The clinical details such as age at onset, types of seizures, co-morbidities, and results of EEG, MRI and genetic testing were reviewed. Epilepsy syndrome diagnosis was made as per the ILAE 2022 criteria, and compared with the previous syndrome diagnosis as per records. Results: Data from 1550 children (63 % boys) with epilepsy were analysed, and 55.4 % children were classified to have epilepsy syndromes as per the new ILAE 2022 diagnostic criteria. Application of the new 2022 ILAE diagnostic criteria was associated with a change in name alone in 676 (77.8 %) children. Hundred (11.5 %) children were newly classified under an epilepsy syndrome who had previously remained unclassified. Eleven (1.3 %) children who were previously classified into an epilepsy syndrome could not be classified using the new diagnostic criteria. Eight (0.9 %) were shifted to a new syndromic category. Overall, change in diagnosis occurred in 13.7 (11.5 + 1.3 + 0.9)%. No change in epilepsy syndrome classification/nomenclature occurred in 74 (8.5 %) children. Significance: The new diagnostic criteria led to an overall change in diagnosis in 13.7 % of children with epilepsy. These criteria will hopefully lead to uniformity in diagnosis of epilepsy syndromes across diverse settings.

AB  - Background: Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a skin condition characterized by hyperpigmentation and thickening, often found in individuals with insulin resistance. Despite this well -established association, the potential link between AN and hepatic fibrosis in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has yet to be thoroughly explored. Methodology: We recruited a total of 300 people with T2D, half of whom had AN (n, 150), and the other half without AN (n, 150). We evaluated body composition, biochemistry, and hepatic fat analysis (using the controlled attenuation parameter, CAP), as well as assessments of hepatic stiffness (using the kilopascal, kPa) using Fibroscan. We used multivariable regression analysis to find independent predictors of AN and their relationship to hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, we developed a prediction equation and AUC for hepatic fibrosis. Results: Upon comparison between AN vs. NAN group, following were significatly higher; weight, BMI, hepatic transaminases, liver span, CAP, and kPa. After adjusting for age, weight, body mass index, diabetes duration, and specific anti -hyperglycaemic drugs (gliclazide, DPP -4 inhibitors, pioglitazone, and Glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor agonists), adjusted OR for AN were, liver span, 1.78 (95% CI: 0.91 -3.49, p = 0.09), CAP, 7.55 (95% CI: 0.93 -61.1, p = 0.05), and kPa, 2.47 (95% CI: 1.50 -4.06, p = 0.001). A ROC analysis of predictive score for hepatic fibrosis showed optimal sensitivity and specificity at a score cut-off of 25.2 (sensitivity 62%, specificity 63%), with an AUC of 0.6452 (95% CI: 0.61235 -0.76420). Conclusion: Acanthosis nigricans has the potential to be used as an easy -to -identify clinical marker for risk of hepatic fat and fibrosis in Asian Indians with T2D, allowing for early detection and management strategies.

AB  - Inflammation in ulcerative colitis is typically restricted to the mucosal layer of distal gut. Disrupted mucus barrier, coupled with microbial dysbiosis, has been reported to occur prior to the onset of inflammation. Here, we show the involvement of vesicular trafficking protein Rab7 in regulating the colonic mucus system. We identified a lowered Rab7 expression in goblet cells of colon during human and murine colitis. In vivo Rab7 knocked down mice (Rab7KD) displayed a compromised mucus layer, increased microbial permeability, and depleted gut microbiota with enhanced susceptibility to dextran sodium-sulfate induced colitis. These abnormalities emerged owing to altered mucus composition, as revealed by mucus proteomics, with increased expression of mucin protease chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1). Mechanistically, Rab7 maintained optimal CLCA1 levels by controlling its lysosomal degradation, a process that was dysregulated during colitis. Overall, our work establishes a role for Rab7-dependent control of CLCA1 secretion required for maintaining mucosal homeostasis.

AB  - Objective: Borderline ovarian tumors (BOT) are characterized by atypical epithelial proliferation without stromal invasion and majority are diagnosed in women of reproductive age group desirous of fertility preservation. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records of patients diagnosed with BOT and on regular follow up at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, during a nine-year study period from March 2014 to March 2023 was performed. Surgical treatment was classified as radical or fertility sparing surgery (FSS). Surgical staging was defined as complete, partial or un-staged. Results: Median age of 91 women was 34 years. Follow up period ranged from 4 to 222 months (median 77 months). Among 68 premenopausal women, 31 (46 %) underwent radical surgery and FSS in 37 (54 %) cases. Median time to conception in 29 women with future fertility wishes was 13 months (range, 4 to38 m). Seven of 29 cases (29 %) required ovulation induction. The pregnancy rate was 82.7 % and live birth rate was 80 %. Eight cases (8.7 %) had a recurrence (7un-staged, 1- partially staged) and median time to recur was 36 months. There was no significant difference in recurrence between cystectomy/oophorectomy. Ovary was the site of recurrence in all surgically salvaged cases except peritoneal cavity in 1 case with mortality. Relapse free survival at 5 and 10 years in FSS and radical surgery group were similar. Conclusion: FSS is a safe procedure and should be considered in young patients desirous of future fertility along with a comprehensive peritoneal staging. Reproductive outcomes are excellent.

Methods: Thirty-two patients requiring FGG were treated in this randomized controlled clinical trial. Complete epithelialization (CE) and color match (CM) at donor sites were assessed by a blinded examiner on postoperative days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Donor sites were compressed for 2 min with wet gauze (WG) alone in control group (CG) or WG + CD in test group (TG) immediately after graft harvesting, and immediate bleeding (IB) was recorded (yes/no). Delayed bleeding (DB) (for 1 week), and number of analgesic tablets consumed, and VAS scores for pain (for 2 weeks) were recorded by patient every day. Results: Twenty-eight patients (14 in each group) were included in final analysis. The prevalence of CE (at weeks 2 and 3) and VAS scores for CM scores were higher in TG but the intergroup differences were statistically significant only for CM (at week 4). Number of patients exhibiting IB and DB was significantly fewer in the TG (p < .05). Although average pain scores and analgesic consumption were higher in TG up to 5 days, differences between two groups were not statistically significant at any time point. Conclusion: Our data suggests that the application of CD increased re-epithelialization and accelerated wound healing process, although it did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, CD was found to significantly reduce bleeding complications, but it did not decrease the pain levels.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) on mRNA expression of metallothionein (MT) and its levels in serum, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of smokers (S) and non-smokers (NS) with periodontitis (P).A total of 100 participants were included: 48 periodontally healthy (PH) subjects (24 S [PH + S] and 24 NS [PH + NS]) and 52 patients with P (27 S [P + S] and 25 NS [P + NS]). Clinical parameters were recorded, and biofluids (serum, saliva and GCF) and gingival tissue samples were obtained at baseline in all groups and 3 months after NSPT in P groups. MT levels in biofluids were determined by ELISA. In gingival tissues, MT-mRNA expression was quantified using real-time PCR. mRNA expression of MT and its levels in biofluids were significantly higher in P + S compared to other groups, and the differences between P + NS and PH + S were non-significant. A significant decrease was observed for MT levels in biofluids, and MT-mRNA expression in periodontitis patients after NSPT. In conclusion, smoking and periodontitis are associated with higher MT expression which decreases after NSPT. MT as an oxidative stress biomarker and its therapeutic role in periodontitis should be investigated in future studies.Clinical trial registration: The study was prospectively registered at Clinical Trials Registry-India (ctri.nic.in) as CTRI/2018/08/015427 on August 23, 2018.

AB  - Aim: The mechanism of NO bioavailability in endothelial dysfunction, the trigger for atherogenesis is still unclear as exogenous nitrate therapy fails to alleviate endothelial dysfunction. Recently, sialin, a nitrate transporter, has been linked to affect tissue nitrate/nitrite levels. Hence, we investigated the role of sialin in NO bioavailability in endothelial dysfunction. Methods: Serum-starved HUVECs were stimulated with either TNF alpha or AT-2 for 24 h either alone or in the presence of autophagy inducer or autophagy inhibitor alone. Nitric oxide, nitrite, and nitrate levels were measured in cell supernatant and cell lysate. Quantitative real-time PCR, Annexin V-PI, and monocyte adhesion assays were performed. Immunofluorescence staining for sialin, vWF, and LC3 was performed. STRING database was used to create protein interacting partners for sialin. Results: Sialin is strongly expressed in activated EC in vitro and atherosclerotic plaque as well as tumor neo-vessel ECs. Sialin mediates nitrate ion efflux and is negatively regulated by autophagy via mTOR pathway. Blocking sialin enhances NO bioavailability, autophagy, cell survival, and eNOS expression while decreasing monocyte adhesion. PPI shows LGALS8 to directly interact with sialin and regulate autophagy, cell-cell adhesion, and apoptosis. Conclusion: Sialin is a potential novel therapeutic target for treating endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis and cancer.

AB  - Recombinant native-like HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers are used in candidate vaccines aimed at inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies. While state-of-the-art SOSIP or single-chain Env designs can be expressed as native-like trimers, undesired monomers, dimers and malformed trimers that elicit non-neutralizing antibodies are also formed, implying that these designs could benefit from further modifications for gene-based vaccination approaches. Here, we describe the triple tandem trimer (TTT) design, in which three Env protomers are genetically linked in a single open reading frame and express as native-like trimers. Viral vectored Env TTT induced similar neutralization titers but with a higher proportion of trimer-specific responses. The TTT design was also applied to generate influenza hemagglutinin (HA) trimers without the need for trimerization domains. Additionally, we used TTT to generate well-folded chimeric Env and HA trimers that harbor protomers from three different strains. In summary, the TTT design is a useful platform for the design of HIV-1 Env and influenza HA immunogens for a multitude of vaccination strategies.

AB  - Introduction: Invasive mould infections (IMIs) are a leading cause of death in patients with compromised immune systems. Proven invasive mould infection requires detection of a fungus by histopathological analysis of a biopsied specimen, sterile culture, or fungal DNA amplification by PCR in tissue. However, the clinical performance of a PCR assay on blood samples taken from patients suspected of invasive mould disease has not been fully evaluated, particularly for the differential diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive Mucormycosis (IM). Objectives: To assess the diagnostic utility of our previously validated in-house real-time PCR in blood samples for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis in patients with suspected invasive mould infection. Methods: All patients with suspected invasive mould infection were prospectively enrolled from May 2021 to July 2021. Conventional fungal diagnosis was performed using tissue and respiratory samples. In-house PCR was performed on blood samples and its diagnostic performance evaluated. Results: A total of 158 cases of suspected invasive mould infection were enrolled in the study. The sensitivity and specificity of in-house PCR performed on blood samples was found to be 92.5% and 81.4% respectively for diagnosis of probable IA, and 65% and 84.62% respectively for diagnosis of proven and probable IM. It was also able to detect 3 out of 5 cases of possible IM where no other microbiological evidence of IM was obtained. Conclusions: This assay could be helpful in minimally invasive diagnosis of IMIs for patients in whom invasive sampling is not feasible, especially as a preliminary or screening test. It can help in early diagnosis, anticipating conventional laboratory confirmation by days or weeks. Possible correlation between fungal load and mortality can help in initiating aggressive treatment for patients with high initial fungal load. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome that is characterized by the rapid development of organ failures predisposing these patients to a high risk of short-term early death. The main causes of organ failure in these patients are bacterial infections and systemic inflammation, both of which can be severe. For the majority of these patients, a prompt liver transplant is still the only effective course of treatment. Kidneys are one of the most frequent extrahepatic organs that are affected in patients with ACLF, since acute kidney injury (AKI) is reported in 22.8-34% of patients with ACLF. Approach and management of kidney injury could improve overall outcomes in these patients. Importantly, patients with ACLF more frequently have stage 3 AKI with a low rate of response to the current treatment modalities. The objective of the present position paper is to critically review and analyze the published data on AKI in ACLF, evolve a consensus, and provide recommendations for early diagnosis, pathophysiology, prevention, and management of AKI in patients with ACLF. In the absence of direct evidence, we propose expert opinions for guidance in managing AKI in this very challenging group of patients and focus on areas of future research. This consensus will be of major importance to all hepatologists, liver transplant surgeons, and intensivists across the globe.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence related to the occurrence of pulp necrosis and related complications in permanent anterior teeth with lateral luxation. It was envisaged to address the ambiguity related to the recommendation for pulp extirpation in teeth with mature root apex. An a priori protocol was formulated as per the best practices of evidence-based medicine and registered in PROSPERO. A comprehensive search was performed electronically in PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane on July 10,2023 without any restriction of language or year of publication. The screening of titles and abstracts and later the full-text articles were performed. Later, the data extraction was performed by using a self-designed sheet, risk of bias (ROB) assessment was done, meta-analysis was performed, and the GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. The qualitative synthesis was performed on 13 studies done from 1985 to 2020 in hospital settings. There was variability in the minimum and total observation periods, sample sizes, and characteristics of the sample population. The overall pooled prevalence of pulp necrosis was found to be 57% (95% CI: 42, 72%). It was 12% (95% CI: 8%, 18%, I2 = 0%) in immature teeth, and 58% (95% CI: 42, 73%, I2 = 86%) in mature teeth. The pooled prevalence of EIRR was found to be 11% (95% CI: 4, 27%, I2 = 95%) with greater risk in teeth with mature root apex (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.42, I2 = 0%). The ROB was moderate or high in nine studies and the GRADE of evidence was very low in 14 of 15 outcomes. There are greater chances of pulp necrosis in teeth with lateral luxation, especially with mature apex. However, it can still be less than 60% in most cases with the prevalence of EIRR less than 20%. Hence, an absolute recommendation for endodontic intervention in mature teeth with lateral luxation must be interpreted with slight caution.

AB  - BackgroundThe costoclavicular space serves as an alternative approach to the infraclavicular brachial plexus block, and numerous studies in adults have demonstrated promising outcomes for distal upper limb surgery. Blocking the brachial plexus at this level is potentially advantageous because the cords are relatively superficial, located in close proximity to each other and easily identified using ultrasound.AimsThis study aimed to assess the success rate and feasibility of costoclavicular block in children undergoing unilateral below elbow upper limb surgery.MethodsThirty children aged 2-12 years scheduled for unilateral below elbow surgery under general anesthesia were included. Costoclavicular block was performed under ultrasound and nerve stimulator guidance with 0.5% ropivacaine, 0.5 mL/kg. Success was evaluated based on the absence of significant hemodynamic response to skin incision made 20 min after the block. The sono-anatomy of costoclavicular space, ease of needling, complications, and the post-operative pain scores were assessed.ResultsThe mean age and weight of the children were 6.5 +/- 3.8 years and 19.7 +/- 9.1 kg, respectively. The success rate of costoclavicular block in our cohort is 100%. Sonographic visualization was graded as excellent (Likert Scale 2) in 90% of cases. The plexus was located at a depth of 1.4 +/- 0.3 cm from the skin, the lateral extent of cords from the artery was 0.8 +/- 0.4 cm and they were observed inferior and lateral to the artery. The mean needling time was 3.6 +/- 1.1 min. None of the children experienced complications such as vascular or pleural puncture, hematoma, Horner's syndrome or diaphragmatic palsy. Postoperative pain scores were low, and no rescue analgesia was required.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the costoclavicular block exhibited a notably high success rate in pediatric population. This study substantiates that the three cords of the brachial plexus are consistently visible and superficial during ultrasound examination using this approach, confirming their separation from vascular structures and the reliable achievement of blockade without observed complications.

AB  - - BACKGROUND: Papillary tumors of pineal region (PTPR) comprise a very rare subset of pineal region tumors that have been recently described. Literature on the management and outcome of PTPR is scarce owing to the rarity of these tumors. To address this lacuna, we analyzed our experience in management of PTPR. - METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 11 patients with histopathologically proven PTPR who - nderwent surgical excision at our center. - RESULTS: Mean patient age was 33.3 years (range, 12 - 45 years), and male-to-female ratio was 1.75:1. Headache was the most common presentation followed by visual disturbances, altered sensorium, Perinaud syndrome, and seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid diversion was required in 6 patients. Krause approach was the most common approach used for tumor excision (9/11 cases). There was no perioperative mortality. Two patients were lost to follow-up. In the remaining 9 patients, the average follow-up period was 45 months (range, 12 - 79 months). On first postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, 8 patients showed no evidence of residual tumor (gross total resection), while 1 patient had small residual tumor (near-total resection) that remained stable during follow-up. Four patients underwent adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. None of the patients developed recurrence during follow-up. - CONCLUSIONS: PTPR are a rare subgroup of pineal region tumors with distinct cells of origin but presentation similar to other pineal region tumors. Surgical resection constitutes the mainstay of management, and the extent of resection appears to be the most important determinant of prognosis. The role of adjuvant therapy still needs to be determined.

AB  - Background & Aims: There is a need to reduce the screen failure rate (SFR) in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) clinical trials (MASH+F2-3; MASH+F4) and identify people with high-risk MASH (MASH+F2-4) in clinical practice. We aimed to evaluate non-invasive tests (NITs) screening approaches for these target conditions. Methods: This was an individual participant data meta-analysis for the performance of NITs against liver biopsy for MASH+F2-4, MASH+F2-3 and MASH+F4. Index tests were the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, liver stiffness measured using vibration-controlled transient elastography (LSM-VCTE), the fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) and the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and thresholds including those that achieved 34% SFR were reported. Results: We included 2281 unique cases. The prevalence of MASH+F2-4, MASH+F2-3 and MASH+F4 was 31%, 24% and 7%, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for MASH+F2-4 were .78, .75, .68 and .57 for FAST, LSM-VCTE, FIB-4 and NFS. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for MASH+F2-3 were .73, .67, .60, .58 for FAST, LSM-VCTE, FIB-4 and NFS. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for MASH+F4 were .79, .84, .81, .76 for FAST, LSM-VCTE, FIB-4 and NFS. The sequential combination of FIB-4 and LSM-VCTE for the detection of MASH+F2-3 with threshold of .7 and 3.48, and 5.9 and 20 kPa achieved SFR of 67% and sensitivity of 60%, detecting 15 true positive cases from a theoretical group of 100 participants at the prevalence of 24%. Conclusions: Sequential combinations of NITs do not compromise diagnostic performance and may reduce resource utilisation through the need of fewer LSM-VCTE examinations.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterised by unprovoked, repetitive seizures caused by abnormal neuronal firing. The Wnt/ beta-Catenin signalling pathway is involved in seizure -induced neurogenesis, aberrant neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and hyperexcitability associated with epileptic disorder. Wnt/ beta-Catenin signalling is crucial for early brain development processes including neuronal patterning, synapse formation, and Nmethyl- D -aspartate receptor (NMDAR) regulation. Disruption of molecular networks such as Wnt/ beta-catenin signalling in epilepsy could offer encouraging anti-epileptogenic targets. So, with a better understanding of the canonical Wnt/-Catenin pathway, we highlight in this review the important elements of Wnt/-Catenin signalling specifically in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) for potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Distal arthrogryposis type 5D (DA5D) is clinically characterized by knee extension contractures, distal joint contractures, clubfoot, micrognathia, ptosis, and scoliosis. We report nine affected individuals from eight unrelated Indian families with DA5D. Although the overall musculoskeletal phenotype is not very distinct from other distal arthrogryposis, the presence of fixed knee extension contractures with or without scoliosis could be an important early pointer to DA5D. We also report a possible founder variant in ECEL1 along with four novel variants and further expand the genotypic spectrum of DA5D.

AB  - The survival rate over a five-year period for rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) is notably lower compared to other neuroendocrine tumors due to late -stage detection, which is a consequence of the absence of suitable diagnostic markers; therefore, there exists a critical need for an early -stage biomarker-specific to PanNETs. This study introduces a novel approach, investigating the impact of small extracellular vesicles (sEV) in PanNET growth and metastasis. As proof of concept, this study shows a correlation between sEV concentration in controls and PanNET. Notably, higher sEV concentrations were observed in PanNETs than in controls (p < 0.0001) with a sensitivity of 100%. Further, apparent differences were observed in the sEV concentrations between controls and grades 1 PanNET (p = 0.005). The expression of sEV markers was confirmed using CD63, TSG101, CD9, Flotillin-1, and GAD65 antibodies. Additionally, the expression of cancer marker BIRC2/cIAP1 (p = 0.002) and autophagy marker Beclin1 (p = 0.02) were observed in plasma -derived sEVs and PanNET tissue. This study represents the first to indicate the increased secretion of sEV in PanNET patients ' blood plasma, proposing potential function of sEV as a new biomarker for early -stage PanNET detection.

AB  - Background: Data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responsiveness in adolescent/young adult (AYA) cancer patients are sparse. The present study assessed humoral and cellular immune responses post -vaccination in this population. Methods: In this prospective study, patients aged 12-30 years undergoing cancer therapy ("on therapy") and survivors ("off therapy") were recruited. Anti -receptor binding domain (RBD) protein IgG levels were measured at baseline, four weeks post -first vaccine dose (T1), and six weeks post -second dose (T2). Cellular immunity was assessed using activation -induced markers and intracellular cytokine staining in a patient subset. The primary outcome was to quantify humoral responses in both cohorts at T2 compared to baseline. Clinical predictors of log antibody titres at T2 were identified. Results: Between April -December 2022, 118 patients were recruited of median age 15.4 years. Among them, 77 (65.2 %) were in the "on therapy" group, and 77 (65.2 %) had received the BBV152 vaccine. At baseline, 108 (91.5 %) patients were seropositive for anti-RBD antibody. The log anti-RBD titre rose from baseline to T2 (pvalue = 0.001) in the whole cohort; this rise was significant from baseline -T1 (p -value < 0.001), but not from T1 to T2 (p -value = 0.842). A similar pattern was seen in the "on therapy" cohort. BECOV-2 vaccine was independently associated with higher log anti-RBD titres than BBV152 (regression coefficient: 0.41; 95 % CI: 0.10-0.73; p = 0.011). Cellular immune responses were similar in the "on-" and "off therapy" groups at the three time points. Conclusion: Among AYA cancer patients, a single non-mRNA vaccine dose confers robust hybrid humoral immunity with limited benefit from a second dose.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to assess the recovery rates of diagnostic cardiac procedure volumes in the Oceania Region, midway through the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods A survey was performed comparing procedure volumes between March 2019 (pre -pandemic), April 2020 (during fi rst wave of COVID-19 pandemic), and April 2021 (1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic). A total of 31 health care facilities within Oceania that perform cardiac diagnostic procedures were surveyed, including a mixture of metropolitan and regional, hospital and outpatient, public and private sites, as well as teaching and non -teaching hospitals. A comparison was made with 549 centres in 96 countries in the rest of the world (RoW) outside of Oceania. The total number and median percentage change in procedure volume were measured between the three timepoints, compared by test type and by facility. Results A total of 11,902 cardiac diagnostic procedures were performed in Oceania in April 2021 as compared with 11,835 pre -pandemic in March 2019 and 5,986 in April 2020; whereas, in the RoW, 499,079 procedures were performed in April 2021 compared with 497,615 pre -pandemic in March 2019 and 179,014 in April 2020. There was no signi fi cant difference in the median recovery rates for total procedure volumes between Oceania ( - 6%) and the RoW ( - 3%) (p=0.81). While there was no statistically signi fi cant difference in percentage recovery been functional ischaemia testing and anatomical coronary testing in Oceania as compared with the RoW, there was, however, a suggestion of poorer recovery in anatomical coronary testing in Oceania as compared with the RoW (CT coronary angiography -16% in Oceania vs - 1% in RoW, and invasive coronary angiography - 20% in Oceania vs - 9% in RoW). There was no statistically signi fi cant difference in recovery rates in procedure volume between metropolitan vs regional (p=0.44), public vs private (p=0.92), hospital vs outpatient (p=0.79), or teaching vs non -teaching centres (p=0.73). Conclusions Total cardiology procedure volumes in Oceania normalised 1 year post -pandemic compared to prepandemic levels, with no signi fi cant difference compared with the RoW and between the different types of health care facilities.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to conduct a comparative evaluation of partial and full pulpotomy techniques in cariously exposed teeth with symptoms indicative of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched. Studies evaluating and/or comparing clinical and/or radiographic success of partial and full pulpotomy in teeth diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis with a minimum of 12 months follow-up were included. The risk of bias (ROB) tool was used for the assessment of ROB. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the healing outcome of partial and full pulpotomy. Three studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, there was a low risk of bias in each of the five domains. Full pulpotomy had a higher success rate than partial pulpotomy, according to meta-analysis, but the difference was not statistically significant.

AB  - A survey of awareness and attitudes to the management of fragility fractures among the membership of the Asia Pacific Orthopaedic Association conducted in 2022 found considerable variation in care across the region. A Call to Action is proposed to improve acute care, rehabilitation and secondary fracture prevention across Asia Pacific.
   Purpose Fragility fractures impose a substantial burden on older people and their families, healthcare systems and national economies. The current incidence of hip and other fragility fractures across the Asia Pacific region is enormous and set to escalate rapidly in the coming decades. This publication describes findings of a survey of awareness and attitudes to the management of fragility fractures among the membership of the Asia Pacific Orthopaedic Association (APOA) conducted in 2022.
   Methods The survey was developed as a collaboration between the Asia Pacific Osteoporosis and Fragility Fracture Society and the Asia Pacific Fragility Fracture Alliance, and included questions relating to aspects of care upon presentation, during surgery and mobilisation, secondary fracture prevention, and access to specific services.
   Results In total, 521 APOA members completed the survey and marked variation in delivery of care was evident. Notable findings included:
   center dot Fifty-nine percent of respondents indicated that analgesia was routinely initiated in transit (by paramedics) or within 30 minutes of arrival in the Emergency Department.
   center dot One-quarter of respondents stated that more than 80% of their patients underwent surgery within 48 hours of admission.One-third of respondents considered non-hip, non-vertebral fractures to merit assessment of future fracture risk.
   center dot One-third of respondents reported the presence of an Orthogeriatric Service in their hospital, and less than a quarter reported the presence of a Fracture Liaison Service.
   center dot One-third of respondents reported the presence of an Orthogeriatric Service in their hospital, and less than a quarter reported the presence of a Fracture Liaison Service.
   Conclusion A Call to Action for all National Orthopaedic Associations affiliated with APOA is proposed to improve the care of fragility fracture patients across the region.

AB  - Background The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) working group proposed recommendations for managing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) a decade ago. There is a need to update these recommendations due to advances in diagnostics and therapeutics. Methods An international expert group was convened to develop guidelines for managing ABPA (caused by Aspergillus spp.) and allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM; caused by fungi other than Aspergillus spp.) in adults and children using a modified Delphi method (two online rounds and one in-person meeting). We defined consensus as >= 70% agreement or disagreement. The terms "recommend" and "suggest" are used when the consensus was >= 70% and <70%, respectively. Results We recommend screening for A. fumigatus sensitisation using fungus-specific IgE in all newly diagnosed asthmatic adults at tertiary care but only difficult-to-treat asthmatic children. We recommend diagnosing ABPA in those with predisposing conditions or compatible clinico-radiological presentation, with a mandatory demonstration of fungal sensitisation and serum total IgE >= 500 IU<middle dot>mL(-1) and two of the following: fungal-specific IgG, peripheral blood eosinophilia or suggestive imaging. ABPM is considered in those with an ABPA-like presentation but normal A. fumigatus-IgE. Additionally, diagnosing ABPM requires repeated growth of the causative fungus from sputum. We do not routinely recommend treating asymptomatic ABPA patients. We recommend oral prednisolone or itraconazole monotherapy for treating acute ABPA (newly diagnosed or exacerbation), with prednisolone and itraconazole combination only for treating recurrent ABPA exacerbations. We have devised an objective multidimensional criterion to assess treatment response. Conclusion We have framed consensus guidelines for diagnosing, classifying and treating ABPA/M for patient care and research.

AB  - Background:Common mental disorders (CMDs) among adolescents may hamper their psycho-social development.Aim:This study evaluated the prevalence and determinants of CMD like depression and anxiety among late adolescents of an age of 15--19 years residing in an urban resettlement colony of southeast Delhi.Methods:A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 556 randomly selected adolescents. CMD was assessed using Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview - Kid version 6 (MINI-Kid) based on DSM-IV TR and compliant with ICD-10 definitions of CMD. The associated risk factors were studied using a self-developed semi-structured interview schedule and analyzed using multi-variable logistic regression.Results:A total of 491 adolescents were interviewed (a response rate of 88.3%), of whom 247 (50.3%) were female and 210 (42.8%) belonged to a lower-middle socio-economic status. The lifetime prevalence of CMD was 34% [95% confidence interval (CI): 29.8-38.2]. Of the total, 22.4% (95% CI: 18.7-6.1) of the participants reported depression and 6.7% (95% CI: 4.5-8.9) reported generalized anxiety disorder during their lifetime. Female sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-2.2], experiencing a stressful event in the past 6 months (aOR 4.7, 95% CI: 3.1-7.3), and smoking tobacco (aOR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-7.4) significantly increased the odds of having CMD in multi-variate analysis.Conclusion:There is a high prevalence of CMD among adolescents residing in urban resettlement colonies of Delhi, which is composed mostly of people belonging to lower socio-economic strata. Hence, tailored intervention at stress management with promotion of healthy lifestyle is needed for this age group.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of the study was to perform the first meta-analysis for assessment of the pooled risk of malignancy of each category of the Sydney system for reporting of lymph nodal aspirates along with the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase were searched with the following keywords: "(Lymph node) AND (fine needle aspiration biopsy) OR (International system OR Sydney system)" in the timeframe 2020 to August 4, 2023. The selected articles were assessed for the risk of bias by the QUADAS-2 tool. The meta-analysis for sensitivity (SN) and specificity for each cut-off, that is, "atypical considered positive," "suspicious of malignancy considered positive," and "malignant considered positive" for the lesions, was carried out after excluding the inadequate samples in each study. To assess the diagnostic accuracy, summary receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed, and the diagnostic odds ratio was pooled in both scenarios. Results: Nine studies, all of which were retrospective cross-sectional studies, were evaluated with a total of 13,205 cases. The SN and specificity for the "atypical and higher risk categories" considered positive for malignancy were 97% (95% CI, 95-99%) and 96% (95% CI, 91-98%), respectively. The SN and specificity for the "suspicious of malignancy and higher risk categories" considered positive for malignancy were 91% (95% CI, 85-95%) and 99% (95% CI, 97-100%), respectively. The SN and specificity for the "malignant" considered positive for malignancy were 75% (95% CI, 65-84%) and 100% (95% CI, 99-100%), respectively. The pooled area under the curve was 99-100% for each of the cut-offs. Conclusion: This meta-analysis highlights the accuracy of the Sydney system in reporting lymph node aspirates. It exhibits the significance of the "suspicious" and "malignant" categories in diagnosing malignancy and of the "benign" category in excluding malignancy.

AB  - Background:Abdominal bloating is a common complaint in patients with functional and organic bowel disease. Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic, has been tried for the treatment of this disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the efficacy of rifaximin in abdominal bloating and distension in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID).Methods:We accessed 4 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, and Web of Science) to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials that utilized rifaximin in FGID. We excluded observational studies, those including patients with organic bowel disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, or those in which rifaximin was given for other indications, such as hepatic encephalopathy.Results:A total of 1426 articles were available, of which 813 articles were screened after removing duplicates and 34 articles were selected for full-text review. Finally, 10 trials (3326 patients) were included. Rifaximin was administered in doses ranging from 400 to 1650 mg per day for 1 to 2 weeks. Rifaximin therapy led to a higher likelihood of improvement in symptoms of bloating (44.6% vs. 34.6%, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11, 1.35; n=2401 patients) without significant heterogeneity. However, daily doses less than 1200 mg/day were similar to placebo (P=0.09). Bloating was quantified subjectively in 7 studies, and rifaximin led to a greater reduction in bloating scores compared with placebo (standardized mean difference -0.3, 95% CI -0.51, -0.1, P=0.04) but carried significant heterogeneity (I 2=61.6%, P=0.01).Conclusions:Rifaximin therapy is associated with an increased likelihood of improvement in bloating and distension, as well as reduces the subjective severity of these symptoms in patients with FGID.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated mucormycosis (CAM) was reported predominantly from India during the second wave of COVID-19 and has a high mortality rate. The present study aims to understand the fungal community composition of the nasopharyngeal region of CAM-infected individuals and compare it with severe COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The fungal community composition was decoded by analyzing the sequence homology of the internal transcribed spacer-2-(ITS-2) region of metagenomic DNA extracted from the upper respiratory samples. The alpha-diversity indices were found to be significantly altered in CAM patients (p < 0.05). Interestingly, a higher abundance of Candida africana, Candida haemuloni, Starmerella floris, and Starmerella lactiscondensi was observed exclusively in CAM patients. The interindividual changes in mycobiome composition were well supported by beta-diversity analysis (p < 0.05). The current study provides insights into the dysbiosis of the nasal mycobiome during CAM infection. In conclusion, our study shows that severe COVID-19 and CAM are associated with alteration in mycobiome as compared to healthy controls. However, the sequential alteration in the fungal flora which ultimately leads to the development of CAM needs to be addressed by future studies.

AB  - Acute corneal hydrops (ACH) is a rare but sight-threatening complication of corneal ectasias. We aim to review the current literature on etiopathogenesis, histology, role of ancillary investigations, management, and outcomes of ACH by classifying the various management strategies based on their site of action and the underlying mechanism. A review of the literature was conducted by searching the following databases: PubMed (United States National Library of Medicine), Embase (Reed Elsevier Properties SA), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and Scopus (Elsevier BV) till April 2023. The literature search used various combinations of the following keywords: acute corneal hydrops, keratoconus, ectasia, management, keratoplasty. Nine hundred eighty-three articles were identified based on the above searches. Case reports which did not add any new modality of treatment to the existing literature, articles unrelated to management, those with no full text available, and foreign-language articles with no translation available were excluded. Eventually, 75 relevant articles that pertained to the management of ACH were shortlisted and reviewed. Recent studies have described newer surgical interventions like full-thickness or pre-Descemetic sutures, thermokeratoplasty, and plasma injection that aim to close the posterior stromal break. Posterior lamellar keratoplasties act by replacing the posterior torn Descemet's membrane (DM), and early deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has been attempted to combine the correction of the anatomical defect and visual rehabilitation in a single surgery. These surgical interventions may help by reducing the scarring and increasing the number of patients who can be visually rehabilitated with contact lenses rather than keratoplasty.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the parameters of three different topographic devices (Pentacam HR, Oculus Optikgerate GmbH; Sirius, Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici; and Cassini, i-Optics) in grading the severity of keratoconus in cross -linked and non -cross -linked eyes. METHODS: This was a prospective comparative interventional study done in a tertiary eye care center, wherein 114 eyes of 68 patients with keratoconus were divided into two groups: 62 eyes that were observed and 52 eyes that were cross -linked. All eyes were evaluated on all three topographers at baseline, 3 -month follow-up, and 6 -month follow-up. RESULTS: The Sirius showed significantly lower values of mean flat keratometry in comparison to the Pentacam HR (limits of agreement [LoA]: 1.75 to 3.51%) and Cassini (LoA: 1.75 to 3.51%). The mean steep keratometry values were higher for the Cassini in comparison to the Pentacam HR (LoA: 4.39 to 7.02%) and Sirius (LoA: 3.51 to 6.14%). The mean steep keratometry values of the Sirius were significantly lower than those of the Pentacam HR and in both the crosslinked and observation groups (LoA: 3.51 to 6.14%). The mean keratometry values were significantly higher in the Cassini compared to the Pentacam HR (LoA: 3.51 to 8.77%) and significantly lower in the Sirius in comparison to the Pentacam HR (LoA: 3.51 to 6.14%). The mean difference in astigmatism was also statistically significant between the three tomographers in both groups, with the Cassini showing higher values (LoA: 3.51 to 5.26%) and the Sirius lower values than the Pentacam HR (LoA: 5.26 to 6.14%). CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude the three devices cannot be used interchangeably. The Cassini showed better agreement and correlation with the Pentacam HR in the staging of keratoconus, whereas the Sirius tended to underdiagnose and under -stage the disease.

AB  - Objectives: We hypothesized that crypt failure in the small bowel results in villous flattening in patients with celiac disease (CeD). We investigated whether alterations in the stem cell niche (ISC) are responsible for this phenomenon. Materials and Methods: We included 92 duodenal (D2/3) biopsies from treatment-naive patients of CeD and 37 controls. All underwent screening for serum anti-tissue transglutaminase and endoscopic upper small bowel biopsy. Immunohistochemical markers were used to investigate ISC niche alterations, including LGR5 for crypt basal cells (CBC), Bmi1 for position 4+ cells, beta-Defensin for Paneth cells, R-spondin1 as WNT activator, transcription factor-4 as WNT transcription factor, BMP receptor1A as WNT inhibitor, fibronectin-1 as periepithelial stromal cell marker, H2AX as apoptosis marker, and Ki67 as proliferation marker. We also analyzed IgA anti-tTG2 antibody deposits by using dual-color immunofluorescence staining. Results: We found that in biopsies from patients with treatment-naive CeD with modified Marsh grade 3a-3c changes, the epithelial H2AX apoptotic index was upregulated than in controls. LGR5+ crypt basal cells were upregulated in all modified Marsh grades compared to controls. However, the Ki67 proliferation index, expressions of WNT-activator RSPO1, and position-4 cell marker Bmi1 did not significantly alter in patients' biopsies as compared to controls (P = 0.001). We also observed depletion of pericrypt stromal fibronectin-1 in patients with CeD compared to controls. In addition, we identified IgA anti-TG2 antibody deposits in pericrypt stroma. Conclusions: Our data suggests that ISC niche failure is a plausible hypothesis for villous flattening in patients with CeD, resulting from pericrypt IgA anti-TG2 antibody complex-mediated stromal depletion.

AB  - Purpose:To study the correlation of corneal topography, corneal biomechanical properties, and ocular aberrations with the magnitude of refractive error in myopic eyes. Methods:All myopic patients attending the clinic for refractive surgery were recruited. Data recorded included visual acuity, axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), topography (Pentacam - Oculus), corneal biomechanical factors [ocular response analyzer (ORA)], and optical aberrations (iTrace). They were further categorized into group 1 (suitable for femto-LASIK) and group 2 (unsuitable for femto-LASIK). Results:Sixty eyes (30 myopes) of mean age 22.78 +/- 2.71 years were enrolled. A negative correlation of refractive error was noted with AL (rho = -0.9; P < 0.001), total aberrations (rho = 0.53; P < 0.001), and lower-order aberrations (LOA) (rho = 0.54; P < 0.001). A strongly positive correlation was noted between CCT and corneal hysteresis (CH) (rho = 0.63; P < 0.001), CCT and CRF (rho = 0.56; P < 0.001), CH and corneal resistance factor (CRF) (rho = 0.83; P < 0.001), and Goldmann equivalent intraocular pressure (IOPg) and corneal compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) (rho = 0.78; P < 0.001). An increase in higher-order aberrations (HOAs) as well as lower-order aberrations (LOAs) was noted with increasing sim-K [HOA (r = 0.73, P = 0.001); LOA (r = 0.601, P = 0.014)] and increasing CRF [HOA (r = 0.5, P = 0.006); LOA (r = 0.732, P = 0.001)] in group 2. The amount of refractive error, axial length, central corneal thickness, and sim-K were significantly different in the two groups. Conclusion:Increasing degree of myopia is associated with an increase in axial length, total aberrations, and lower-order aberrations. Corneal biomechanical parameters have a strong correlation with each other. Lower corneal biomechanics are noted in high myopes as they have weaker and thinner corneas. Corneal biomechanics and ocular aberrations do not differ significantly between cases suitable for femto-LASIK and cases unsuitable for femto-LASIK.

AB  - The extent and magnitude of the mental health stigma are enormous, with substantial clinical and social implications. There is a complex relationship between mental health stigma and mental health professionals (MHPs); MHPs can be anti-stigma crusaders, victims of stigma, and even a source of stigma. Unfortunately, literature is scarce talking about the relationship between stigma and MHPs. Hence, the current review aims to bridge the existing gap in the literature on various aspects of stigma and the role of MHPs. For the current review, we ran a search in PubMed and Google Scholar databases; we restricted our study to records focusing on the interplay of mental health stigma and the MHPs, published during 2012-2022, in English, and having a full text available. We found that MHPs (psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses) can also be the recipients of the stigma. The stigma faced by the MHPs is determined by the negative stereotypes set by the media, or medical students, or other health professionals; the marginal position of psychiatry in the health system; difficult-to-treat mental disorders; MHPs' own experience of stigma; and the attitude or beliefs of various caders of the MHPs, their professional experience, and expertise in managing various mental health conditions. Notably, MHPs can also be a source of stigma (stigmatizers). MHPs need to be sensitized concerning this, and the anti-stigma interventions must incorporate this aspect of stigma. Novel interventions, such as digital-based programs, should be used instead of traditional anti-stigma programs in order to decrease stigma around mental health issues and make anti-stigma initiatives more appealing and scalable. To address the issues of stigma, there has to be more communication between MHPs, other health professionals, service users, and policymakers.

AB  - The area under the ROC curve is frequently used for assessing the predictive efficacy of a model, and the Youden index is commonly used to provide the optimal cut-off. Both are misleading tools for predictions. A ROC curve is drawn for the sensitivity of a quantitative test against its (1 - specificity) at different values of the test. Both sensitivity and specificity are retrospective in nature as these are indicators of correct classification of already known conditions. They are not indicators of future events and are not valid for predictions. Predictivity intimately depends on the prevalence which may be ignored by sensitivity and specificity. We explain this fallacy in detail and illustrate with several examples that the actual predictivity could differ greatly from the ROC curve-based predictivity reported by many authors. The predictive efficacy of a test or a model is best assessed by the percentage correctly predicted in a prospective framework. We propose predictivity-based ROC curves as tools for providing predictivities at varying prevalence in different populations. For optimal cut-off for prediction, in place of the Youden index, we propose a P-index where the sum of positive and negative predictivities is maximum after subtracting 1. To conclude, for correctly assessing adequacy of a prediction models, predictivity-based ROC curves should be used instead of the usual sensitivity-specificity-based ROC curves and the P-index should replace the Youden index.

AB  - Glandular odontogenic cysts (GOCs) and dentigerous cysts may show mucous metaplasia. Central mucoepidermoid carcinoma is very rare and mostly associated with dental cysts. It is hypothesized that odontogenic cysts showing mucus differentiation in their lining, have a propensity to transform into MEC. The present study is the first attempt to explore the relationship between odontogenic cysts [GOCs and dentigerous cysts with mucus metaplasia (DCMM)] and MEC by evaluating immunoexpression of MUC5AC and MUC2. Immunoexpression of MUC5AC and MUC2 was evaluated semiquantitatively in GOCs (20 cases), DCMMs (20 cases), and MECs (20 cases). The percentage of positive cells, intensity, and localization of immunoexpression were assessed for each marker in all cases. Of GOCs, DCMMs, and MECs cases, 85%, 70%, and 80%, respectively, were immunopositive for MUC5AC. Strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for MUC5AC was noted, particularly in mucous cells present diffusely within MECs. However, the immunoreactivity was limited to the epithelial lining of GOCs and DCMMs. Most of the MECs (60%) showed more than 25% positivity for MUC5AC, followed by GOCs, and the least in DMMCs. Mild cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity of MUC2 was noted only in epithelial lining cells of 70% GOCs and 45% DCMMs. Whereas, 55% of MECs displayed moderate to strong cytoplasmic and membranous immunopositivity for MUC2 exclusively within mucous cells. As MECs showed strong MUC5AC immunoreactivity in mucous cells, immunoexpression of MUC5AC in odontogenic cysts with mucus cells can possibly explain the pathogenesis of MEC from cysts. However, the variable expression of MUC2 did not give any strong evidence regarding its role as a marker.

AB  - The lung is the most common site of metastases in the case of phyllodes tumor of the breast followed by bone. However, pneumothorax as a presenting complaint in a patient of bilateral cavitating lung metastases from malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast has never been reported to our knowledge. We herein report a case of a 34-year-old female presenting with sudden onset of chest pain in already existing lung metastases who on imaging showed the development of bilateral pneumothorax. We should, therefore, be on the lookout for the potential development of spontaneous pneumothorax in such cases.

AB  - Introduction: Hyperthyroidism, characterized by excessive thyroid hormone production, is a common endocrine disorder that affects various physiological processes, including brain function. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques have enabled researchers to investigate structural alterations in the brain associated with hyperthyroidism. This study aimed to examine regional cortical thickness and cortical volume differences across the brain between hyperthyroid patients and control subjects. Methods: We examined localized cortical thicknesses and volumes in 34 hyperthyroid patients and 35 control subjects with high-resolution T1-weighted images using FreeSurfer software and assessed group differences with analysis of covariance (covariates: age, sex, education, and total intracranial volume). Spearman and partial correlations were performed between clinical variables and cortical thicknesses/volumes and between neuropsychological scores and cortical thicknesses/volumes, respectively. Results: Hyperthyroid patients exhibited significantly increased cortical thickness in bilateral superior temporal and superior frontal gyri, along with higher cortical volumes in various regions, including the right superior temporal gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, right rostral and caudal middle frontal gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus. Notably, thyroid hormones (fT3, fT4) correlated positively with cortical thicknesses and volumes in the superior temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus. Additionally, recognition memory scores negatively correlated with the right superior temporal gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus cortical thickness. Conclusion: The observed cortical thickening and increased cortical volume in specific brain areas provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanism associated with brain impairment in hyperthyroidism.

AB  - Recent research has shown that the complex and dynamic behavior of isolated regions is necessary for the proper functioning of the human brain. To this end, network neuroscience evaluates the neural channels that respond to diverse motor tasks and assesses the brain's functionality. However, the utilization of network neuroscience has not been done to map out the cortical sources in lower limb amputee's postural control. Our earlier research shows that transfemoral amputees' fronto-central region and secondary somatosensory cortex have substantial functional connections while they are balancing with vibrotactile feedback. In this work, we advanced to investigate the cortical sources of transfemoral amputee's postural stability improvement with vibrotactile feedback. The results highlight the predominance of cortical sources in frontal and parietal lobe in alpha frequency band. The observation shows the connectivity of left superiorparietal, lateralorbitofrontal and right rostranteriorcingulate, supramarginal, and inferiorparietal sources. Moreover, the node strength of these cortical sources significantly changes ( p <0.05, ANOVA) with the effect of feedback and visual input. In future, it could be interesting to develop some neural feedback techniques intended to improve the postural performance of lower limb amputees by making these cortical sources more adaptable via local stimulation techniques.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a persistent condition affecting the pulmonary arteries' endothelium. Benidipine, a calcium channel blocker, possesses vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory activity, reduces oxidative stress, and inhibits the activity of Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). The present study was designed to investigate the effect of benidipine alone and in combination with bosentan and sildenafil on monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension in a rat model. PAH was induced by a single-dose administration of MCT in rats. Animals were randomized into different groups and treated with benidipine alone and in combination with bosentan or sildenafil. Various parameters such as hemodynamic parameters, Fulton's index and oxidative stress parameters were performed. Additionally, histopathology of lung and right ventricular of heart tissue, immunohistochemistry, expression of alpha-SMA, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), TGF-beta, and RT-PCR, and an in vitro study using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was also carried out. Treatment of benidipine and its combination exhibited better prevention in the elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, rise in oxidative stress, and increase in expression of alpha-SMA and TGF-beta receptor 1 compared with MCT control group rats. In HUVECs, the expression of alpha-SMA was increased, whereas that of eNOS decreased after TGF-beta exposure and was substantially reversed after pretreatment with benidipine. We concluded that benidipine and its combination with bosentan and sildenafil exhibit beneficial effects in MCT-induced PAH through the eNOS/TGF-beta/alpha-SMA signaling pathway.

AB  - Introduction: To describe the perioperative care of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) who undergo microsurgical repair of a ruptured intracerebral aneurysm. Methods: An English language survey examined 138 areas of the perioperative care of patients with aSAH. Reported practices were categorized as those reported by <20%, 21% to 40%, 41% to 60%, 61% to 80%, and 81% to 100% of participating hospitals. Data were stratified by Worldbank country income level (high-income or low/middle-income). Variation between country-income groups and between countries was presented as an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Forty-eight hospitals representing 14 countries participated in the survey (response rate 64%); 33 (69%) hospitals admitted >= 60 aSAH patients per year. Clinical practices reported by 81 to 100% of the hospitals included placement of an arterial catheter, preinduction blood type/cross match, use of neuromuscular blockade during induction of general anesthesia, delivering 6 to 8 mL/kg tidal volume, and checking hemoglobin and electrolyte panels. Reported use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring was 25% (41% in high-income and 10% in low/middle-income countries), with variation between Worldbank country-income group (ICC 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-2.76) and between countries (ICC 0.44, 95% CI 0.00-0.68). The use of induced hypothermia for neuroprotection was low (2%). Before aneurysm securement, variable in blood pressure targets was reported; systolic blood pressure 90 to 120 mm Hg (30%), 90 to 140 mm Hg (21%), and 90 to 160 mmHg (5%). Induced hypertension during temporary clipping was reported by 37% of hospitals (37% each in high and low/middle-income countries). Conclusions: This global survey identifies differences in reported practices during the perioperative management of patients with aSAH.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a metabolic joint disorder influenced by hormonal regulation, notably estrogen, which plays a cytoprotective role against inflammation. While estrogen's impact on RA pathogenesis has been studied, the altered metabolite expression under estrogen's influence remains unexplored. This study investigated the changes in the metabolome of synovial fibroblasts isolated from RA patients under 17 beta-estradiol (E2) using the liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach followed by multivariate and biological pathway analysis along with in vitro validation. Results identified 3624 m/z, among which eight metabolites were significant (p < 0.05). Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism was found to be highly correlated with the treatment of E2, with metabolites NAD(+) and 1-methynicotinamide (1-MNA) upregulated by E2 induction in RA-FLS. PharmMapper analysis identified potential gene targets of 1-MNA, which were further matched with RA gene targets, and thus, STAT1, MAPK14, MMP3, and MMP9 were concluded to be the common targets. E2 treatment affected the expression of these gene targets and ameliorated the development of oxidative stress associated with RA inflammation, which can be attributed to increased concentration of 1-MNA. Thus, an LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics study revealed the prominent role of estrogen in preventing inflammatory progression in RA by altering metabolite concentration, which can support its therapeutic capacity in remitting RA.

AB  - Extranodal Natural killer/T (NK/T) cell lymphoma nasal type is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has a constant association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Approximately more than 75% cases are located in upper aero-digestive tract, of which stomach is a very rare site. Very few cases of gastric extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma have been reported in the literature. A 22-year-old male patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain and hematemesis. Endoscopy showed a large ulcer in the stomach. Partial gastrectomy done and histopathology showed transmural infiltration by intermediate size atypical lymphoid cells which are immunopositive for CD3, CD56, TIA, EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) and negative for CD4, CD8, CD20. A diagnosis of extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma nasal type was made.

AB  - Evidence on the association of chronic illnesses with depression among adolescents in the Indian community setting is limited. A simple random sample of 583 adolescents, comprising 56.6% of boys and 43.4% of girls, were interviewed on home visits. Self-reports on chronic illnesses were elicited, followed by administration of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) questionnaire to screen for depression, and for confirmation of diagnosis by age-appropriate Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid), or MINI. The prevalence of chronic illnesses was 8.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.3-11.0). Of these participants, 42.8% screened positive for depression. The prevalence of depression was 10.2% (95% CI: 3.4-22.2) among adolescents with chronic illness. The prevalence of physical-mental multimorbidity was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3-2.0). The presence of chronic illness was associated with depression identified using both PHQ-9 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =3.1 [95% CI: 1.7-5.8], P < 0.001) and MINI Kid/MINI (AOR = 3.2 [95% CI: 1.1-9.4], P = 0.037). Adolescents with chronic illnesses can be targeted for mental morbidity screening in a bid to improve functional outcomes.

AB  - This work experimentally demonstrates the operation of a miniaturized magnetoelectric (ME) wireless power transfer (WPT) system by incorporating a ME transducer and a suitable interface power management circuit (PMC) for potentially powering implantable medical devices (IMD) wirelessly. A ME heterostructure is micromachined to obtain desired device dimensions of 3.5 x 5 mm(2 )and to restrict the operating frequency at a clinically approved frequency of 50 kHz. The proposed work also aims to address the trade-off between the device miniaturization, power attenuation and limiting the specific absorption rate (SAR) in the human tissue. By limiting the operating frequency to 50 kHz, the SAR is reduced to less than 1 mu W/kg. The fabricated device is characterized with low-intensity AC magnetic field up to 40 mu T without using any DC bias, resulting in 0.4 V output voltage and 6.6 mu W power across 8 k Omega load. Alignment misorientation between the Tx and Rx is studied for in-plane and out-of-plane angular rotations to confirm the device's reliability against angular misalignment. By eliminating the bulky biasing magnets, the proposed device achieves a significant size reduction compared to the previously reported works. In addition, a self-powered interface PMC is incorporated with the ME system. The PMC generates 3.5 V regulated DC voltage from the input AC voltage range 0.7 V to 3.3 V. The PMC is fabricated on a 2-layered PCB and the over all ME WPT system consumes 12 x 12 mm(2) area. The overall PMC has intrinsic current consumption less than 550 nA with peak power conversion efficiency higher than 85%. The in vitro cytotoxicity analysis in the human hepatic cell line WRL-68 confirmed the biocompatibility of the Parylene-C encapsulated ME device for up to 7 days, suggesting its potential use in implantable electronic devices for biomedical and clinical applications.

AB  - Learning disabilities (LDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental deficits that negatively affect the acquisition, organization, retention, comprehension, or application of age appropriate knowledge. Persons with LD lead a subsidized quality of life, especially in academic/ vocational and psychosocial domains. A certificate issued by the medical boards at a state or district level is required to avail benefits such as scribes or relaxations. This may be done through a series of assessments by psychologists, special educators, or other health-care professionals. The authors aim to understand if uniformity exists in the assessment methods used for the diagnosis of LD globally and to prepare a gap analysis for the same. A systematic review was performed on English literature articles published from January 2005 to August 2023. Full-text studies reporting assessment and diagnostic methods of LD were included. A total of 1246 records were identified through a manual search of an electronic database. Seven duplicates were removed and 1174 studies were excluded based on the relevance by screening titles, abstracts, and full texts. Sixty-five studies were included and analyzed. The authors found a lack of uniformity in this diagnostic protocol, leading to uncertainty in disability certification, doctor shopping, and additional stress for the patients, as well as added burden on the government. Identification of LD requires a multistep assessment process with culturally relevant tools and norms and the participation of a multidisciplinary team of experts.

AB  - With the introduction of the novel coronavirus in late 2019, the healthcare system of every country in the world experienced many challenges. In India, every healthcare organization has prepared itself to fight against these global challenges. This study aims to describe the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic and how we dealt with the pandemic successfully. This narrative analysis study was made in a 960-bedded teaching hospital during the pandemic. The challenges were identified from the minutes of meetings, circulars issued, and various strategic decisions made to combat the pandemic. The challenges faced by the institute were categorized into nine different categories: infrastructural, human resource, hospital operations, and others. Lack of knowledge during the initial days of the pandemic, need for round-theclock situational management, and day-to-day operation needed aggressive training and adherence to the guidelines. Gaps identified in areas like inventory, infection control, logistics, etc., were quickly addressed, and processes were created as per the nation's changing guidelines. This study revealed strategies to manage the pandemic by optimally utilizing available resources with good teamwork and situational leadership.

AB  - Arsenic compounds are colorless and odorless and toxicity can occur either acutely following ingestion of arsenicals with gastrointestinal disturbances or due to chronic exposure usually presenting with dermatologic lesions and peripheral neuropathy. We report a young couple who presented with signs and symptoms of painful sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in a typical "stocking and glove" pattern. They had raised urinary arsenic levels with normal blood levels and thus, a diagnosis of chronic arsenic poisoning due to contaminated water intake was made after detecting elevated arsenic levels in their home water supply. Both patients underwent chelation therapy with dimercaprol for 14 days and reported subjective and objective improvement in symptoms with the reduction in urinary arsenic levels at the end of therapy.

AB  - Urachal adenocarcinoma is an unusual and aggressive form of bladder cancer that arises from urachus, a midline fibrous remnant of allantois. Experience with diagnosing them is limited and differentiating urachal adenocarcinoma from other urachal pathologies like infected urachal cysts may be difficult at times. Differentials of urachal anomalies can be narrowed down by proper assessment of patient demographics, clinical details, lesion morphology, and imaging findings. With this case series of five patients of urachal adenocarcinoma, we have tried describing their clinical manifestation and imaging appearances.

AB  - BackgroundBurns constitute a major global health challenge, causing over 11 million injuries and 300,000 deaths annually and surpassing the economic burden of cervical cancer and HIV combined. Despite this, patient-level financial consequences of burn injuries remain poorly quantified, with a significant gap in data from low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we evaluate financial toxicity in burn patients.MethodsA prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted across two tertiary care hospitals in India, assessing 123 adult surgical in-patients undergoing operative interventions for burn injuries. Patient sociodemographic, clinical, and financial data were collected through surveys and electronic records during hospitalization and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Out-of-pocket costs (OOPCs) for surgical burn treatment were evaluated during hospitalization. Longitudinal changes in income, employment status, and affordability of basic subsistence needs were assessed at the 1-, 3-, and 6-month postoperative time point. Degree of financial toxicity was calculated using a combination of the metrics catastrophic health expenditure and financial hardship. Development of financial toxicity was compared by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics using logistic regression models.ResultsOf the cohort, 60% experienced financial toxicity. Median OOPCs was US$555.32 with the majority of OOPCs stemming from direct nonmedical costs (US$318.45). Cost of initial hospitalization exceeded monthly annual income by 80%. Following surgical burn care, income decreased by US$318.18 within 6 months, accompanied by a 53% increase in unemployment rates. At least 40% of the cohort consistently reported inability to afford basic subsistence needs within the 6-month perioperative period. Significant predictors of developing financial toxicity included male gender (odds ratio, 4.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-14.29; P = 0.02) and hospital stays exceeding 20 days (odds ratio, 11.17; 95% confidence interval, 2.11-59.22; P <= 0.01).ConclusionsSurgical treatment for burn injuries is associated with substantial financial toxicity. National and local policies must expand their scope beyond direct medical costs to address direct nonmedical and indirect costs. These include burn care insurance, teleconsultation follow-ups, hospital-affiliated subsidized lodging, and resources for occupational support and rehabilitation. These measures are crucial to alleviate the financial burden of burn care, particularly during the perioperative period.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe mortality associated with different clinical phenotypes of sepsis in children. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: PICU of a tertiary care center in India from 2017 to 2022. PATIENTS: Six hundred twelve children (from 2 mo to 17 yr old) with a retrospectively applied diagnosis of sepsis using 2020 guidance. METHODS: The main outcome was mortality associated with sepsis subtypes. Other analyses included assessment of risk factors, requirement for organ support, and PICU resources used by sepsis phenotype. Clinical data were recorded on a predesigned proforma. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the 612 children identified, there were 382 (62%) with sepsis but no multiple organ failure (NoMOF), 48 (8%) with thrombocytopenia-associated MOF (TAMOF), 140 (23%) with MOF without thrombocytopenia, and 40 (6.5%) with sequential MOF (SMOF). Mortality was higher in the SMOF (20/40 [50%]), MOF (62/140 [44%]) and TAMOF (20/48 [42%]) groups, compared with NoMOF group (82/382 [21%] [p < 0.001]). The requirement for organ support and PICU resources was higher in all phenotypes with MOF as compared with those without MOF. On multivariable analysis elevated lactate and having MOF were associated with greater odds of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center experience of sepsis in India, we found that sepsis phenotypes having MOF were associated with mortality and the requirement of PICU resources. Prospective studies in different regions of the world will help identify a classification of pediatric sepsis that is more widely applicable.

AB  - Purpose: Investigating the causes of visual loss and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is crucial for identifying avoidable eye problems and planning appropriate rehabilitation and assistive technology (AT) services. The study aimed to identify various causes of vision loss and determine AT required for vision rehabilitation (VR). Methods: The electronic records of patients who attended the VR clinic at a tertiary eyecare for the past 2 years were reviewed. Information such as demographics, BCVA, and causes of visual impairment were retrieved from the records. BCVA was categorized into better than or equal to 1/60 and less than <1/60 for AT services. Results: In total, 1723 patients, mostly male (71.2%), visited the rehabilitation clinic from 2018 to 2019. Around 58.6% of patients belonged to the age group 16-49 years, whereas 25.6% were less than 15 years old. The most frequent eye problems were retinal disorders (63.5%), followed by retinitis pigmentosa (15.2%) and rod-cone dystrophy (4.7%). In contrast, congenital disorders were the most common cause of vision loss among younger groups. Approximately 36.0% of patients had <1/60 blindness and 16.6% had >= 1/60. Around 17.1% of patients would benefit from large prints (near vision acuity N18-N12). Conclusion: Early detection and timely management will prevent a significant proportion of patients from developing irreversible vision loss. Around one-third of patients would benefit from visual substitution AT.

AB  - With increasing importance being given to preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for human immunodeficiency virus prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender persons (TG), we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of PrEP awareness and acceptability among these key populations in India, and their sociodemographic and behavioral determinants. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023390508). Studies were included if they provided quantitative data on PrEP awareness or acceptability among MSM or TG in India. MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were searched from inception to February 29, 2024, using keywords and database-specific terms. Relevant websites were also searched. Critical appraisal was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was done for common outcomes reported by the studies. Reporting was as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 2020 statement. Ten studies providing cross-sectional data, mostly from South West India, were included for qualitative synthesis. All were conducted in settings where PrEP was not available. The pooled prevalence among MSM and TG was 18.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.7%, 28.7%) for awareness and 79.8% (95% CI 57.4%, 100.0%) for willingness to use daily oral PrEP. This review highlights the felt need for PrEP among MSM and TG in India. Further research is needed to understand user attitudes in different parts of the country.

KW  - MORTALITY
AB  - Purpose: Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) to lungs did show encouraging results in COVID-19 patients in some clinical trials. However, there has been some concern regarding the long-term risk of radiation-induced cancer (RIC). Compared to the conventional AP-PA field technique, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can potentially reduce the dose to the marrow and other organs at risk (OARs) and thus minimize the risk of cancer. We designed a dosimetry study to study if VMAT can reduce the exposure to the marrow and other OAR doses and curtail the estimated life-time attributable risk (LAR) of cancer.
   Methods and Materials: We retrieved the computed tomography scan data of 10 patients (aged 40-60 years, median 48 years) who have been already treated for any malignancy in the region of the thorax. A dose of 1.0 Gy in single fraction was prescribed to both lungs. All the organs were delineated as per the established guidelines. The dosimetry achieved by the two plans was compared to find the difference. Mean OAR doses were used to estimate the LAR for both plans and compared.
   Results: Planning target volume coverage parameters like conformity index and homogeneity index were significantly better with VMAT (P value < 0.05 for all). The mean dose to most OARs was significantly lower with VMAT (P value < 0.05 for all). The mean dose to the marrow was significantly lower with VMAT (59.05 vs 81.9 cGy with P value < 0.05). The overall LAR was significantly lower with VMAT as compared to the conventional plan (0.357% vs 0.398%, P value < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Compared to the conventional technique, VMAT provides better OAR dosimetry for lung irradiation (a prescription dose of 1.0 Gy or more) in COVID-19 pneumonia. VMAT significantly reduces the risk of RIC. We therefore suggest if lung LDRT is used for COVID-19 patients, VMAT is the preferred technique for a prescription dose of >= 1.0 Gy.

AB  - Introduction: Kodamaea ohmeri is a rare, recognized pathogen that has previously been isolated from environmental sources. The patients commonly affected by this yeast include immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent patients having several associated risk factors. Methodology: We report three cases in which K. ohmeri was isolated from blood using Bact T/ALERT. Identification was carried out by MALDI-TOF MS (Vitek-MS, BioM & eacute;rieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) in addition to color characteristics on chromogenic media. The patients had diminished immune response on account of a multitude of comorbidities. Results: K. ohmeri can be misidentified as Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, or Candida hemolounii by conventional methods; correct and timely identification can be achieved by MALDI-TOF MS. Antifungal susceptibility breakpoints for K. ohmeri are currently not defined. An Echinocandin was added to the treatment regimen of all three of the cases. Conclusions: Identification of K. ohmeri using conventional methods is difficult and unusual yeasts should be carefully observed, especially upon prolonged incubation.

AB  - Background: Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) encompass a group of rare mesenchymal neoplasms, with dual melanocytic and muscular differentiation. Hepatic PEComas are rare and difficult to diagnose, and their behavior is still unclear. Materials and Methods: Herein, we report a total of five cases of hepatic and perihepatic PEComas over a period of the last 5 years from our and collaborating center's archive. A detailed histological evaluation was done. A comprehensive panel of immunohistochemical stains was used and fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis was performed for the TFE3 gene using break-apart probes. Result: All these patients were women, with an average age of presentation of 44 years. The lesions were in the right hepatic lobe: three cases, the left hepatic lobe: one case, and gastrohepatic ligament: one case. The preoperative clinicoradiological diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, metastasis, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, respectively. Surgical excision was performed in four cases with no further adjuvant therapy. Histopathological examination and subsequent immunophenotyping revealed a diagnosis of PEComa. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis was performed for TFE3 gene rearrangement in four cases. Conclusions: This series highlights the fact that accurate histological diagnosis of hepatic or perihepatic PEComas is important to prevent unnecessary aggressive treatment, unlike primary hepatocellular carcinomas or hepatoid/epithelioid metastatic tumors.

AB  - Introduction: Surface mold brachytherapy (SMBT) is an established treatment modality in skin cancer, especially in accessible areas, and has shown comparable outcomes to surgery. We have presented our results for the skin tumor treatment with SMBT treated with high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in terms of clinical outcomes and toxicity at our institute.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective analysis, 15 patients with skin cancer were treated with customized tube-based SMBT at our institute between January 2019 and July 2021. The patients were treated using HDR-brachytherapy using Iridium-192. The median dose was 40 Gy in 10 fractions. The dosimetric parameters were assessed, and patients were followed up as per the institutional protocol. All patients underwent individualized CT-based planning. Skin toxicity was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).
   Results: With the majority of the patients being male, the median age was 59 years and the most common site affected was the face (8/15; 53.3%). Among the 15 cases, five were squamous cell carcinoma, nine were basal cell carcinoma, and a single case of sebaceous cell carcinoma. The median depth of invasion was 4 mm, and the median catheter-to-surface distance was 1 mm. The complete response rate among the 10 definitive cases was 90% and partial response in one case. The treatment was well-tolerated with no grade 3-5 toxicities. The median V95% and V90% were 94.8% and 97.1%, respectively. The mean coverage index (C.I.), dose non-uniformity ratio (DNR), and overdose volume index (ODI) were 0.97, 0.13, and 0.05, respectively. After a median follow-up of 12 months, none of the patients had recurrence. On assessment of DLQI, the scores were found to be significant in association with the tumor size and tumor site with scores favoring <2 cm and non-exposed area lesions.
   Conclusion: SMBT is a safe and effective treatment modality for skin tumors providing excellent response and cosmetic outcomes. It is well-tolerated and a non-invasive option for elderly patients with comorbidities and lesions in inoperable areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small, randomized trials of patients with cervical artery dissection showed conflicting results regarding optimal stroke prevention strategies. We aimed to compare outcomes in patients with cervical artery dissection treated with antiplatelets versus anticoagulation.
   METHODS: This is a multicenter observational retrospective international study (16 countries, 63 sites) that included patients with cervical artery dissection without major trauma. The exposure was antithrombotic treatment type (anticoagulation versus antiplatelets), and outcomes were subsequent ischemic stroke and major hemorrhage (intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage). We used adjusted Cox regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting to determine associations between anticoagulation and study outcomes within 30 and 180 days. The main analysis used an as-treated crossover approach and only included outcomes occurring with the above treatments.
   RESULTS: The study included 3636 patients (402 [11.1%] received exclusively anticoagulation and 2453 [67.5%] received exclusively antiplatelets). By day 180, there were 162 new ischemic strokes (4.4%) and 28 major hemorrhages (0.8%); 87.0% of ischemic strokes occurred by day 30. In adjusted Cox regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting, compared with antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation was associated with a nonsignificantly lower risk of subsequent ischemic stroke by day 30 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.45-1.12]; P=0.145) and by day 180 (adjusted HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.28-2.24]; P=0.670). Anticoagulation therapy was not associated with a higher risk of major hemorrhage by day 30 (adjusted HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.35-5.45]; P=0.637) but was by day 180 (adjusted HR, 5.56 [95% CI, 1.53-20.13]; P=0.009). In interaction analyses, patients with occlusive dissection had significantly lower ischemic stroke risk with anticoagulation (adjusted HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18-0.88]; P (interaction)=0.009).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not rule out the benefit of anticoagulation in reducing ischemic stroke risk, particularly in patients with occlusive dissection. If anticoagulation is chosen, it seems reasonable to switch to antiplatelet therapy before 180 days to lower the risk of major bleeding. Large prospective studies are needed to validate our findings.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the role of combined intravoxel incoherent motion and diffusion kurtosis imaging (IVIM-DKI) and their machine-learning-based texture analysis for the detection and assessment of severity in prostate cancer (PCa). Materials and methods: Eighty-eight patients underwent MRI on a 3 T scanner after giving informed consent. IVIM-DKI data were acquired using 13 b values (0-2000 s/mm(2)) and analyzed using the IVIM-DKI model with the total variation (TV) method. PCa patients were categorized into two groups: clinically insignificant prostate cancer (CISPCa) (Gleason grade <= 6) and clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa) (Gleason grade >= 7). One-way analysis-of-variance, t test, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to measure the discriminative ability to detect PCa using IVIM-DKI parameters. A chi-square test was used to select important texture features of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM-DKI parameters. These selected texture features were used in an artificial neural network for PCa detection. Results: ADC and diffusion coefficient (D) were significantly lower (p < 0.001), and kurtosis (k) was significantly higher (p < 0.001), in PCa as compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and normal peripheral zone (PZ). ADC, D, and k showed high areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.92, 0.89, and 0.88, respectively, in PCa detection. ADC and D were significantly lower (p < 0.05) as compared with CISPCa versus CSPCa. D for detecting CSPCa was high, with an AUC of 0.63. A negative correlation of ADC and D with GS (ADC, rho = -0.33; D, rho = -0.35, p < 0.05) and a positive correlation of k with GS (rho = 0.22, p < 0.05) were observed. Combined IVIM-DKI texture showed high AUC of 0.83 for classification of PCa, BPH, and normal PZ. Conclusion: D, f, and k computed using the IVIM-DKI model with the TV method were able to differentiate PCa from BPH and normal PZ. Texture features of combined IVIM-DKI parameters showed high accuracy and AUC in PCa detection.

AB  - The study presented here aims at assessing the effects of hypobaric hypoxia on RAAS pathway and its components along with mitigation of anomalies with quercetin prophylaxis. One hour prior to hypobaric hypoxia exposure, male SD rats were orally supplemented with quercetin (50 mg/kg BW) and acetazolamide (50 mg/kg BW) and exposed them to 25,000 ft. (7,620 m) in a simulated environmental chamber for 12 h at 25 +/- 2 degrees C. Different biochemical parameters like renin activity, aldosterone, angiotensin I, ACE 2 were determined in plasma. As a conventional response to low oxygen conditions, oxidative stress parameters (ROS and MDA) were elevated along with suppressed antioxidant system (GPx and catalase) in plasma of rats. Quercetin prophylaxis significantly down regulated the hypoxia induced oxidative stress by reducing plasma ROS & MDA levels with efficient enhancement of antioxidants (GPx and Catalase). Further, hypoxia mediated regulation of renin and ACE 2 proves the outstanding efficacy of quercetin in repudiating altercations in RAAS cascade due to hypobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, differential protein expression of HIF-1 alpha, NF kappa B, IL-18 and endothelin-1 analyzed by western blotting approves the biochemical outcomes and showed that quercetin significantly aids in the reduction of inflammation under hypoxia. Studies conducted with Surface Plasmon Resonance demonstrated a binding among quercetin and ACE 2 that indicates that this flavonoid might regulate RAAS pathway via ACE 2. Henceforth, the study promotes the prophylaxis of quercetin for the better adaptability under hypobaric hypoxic conditions via modulating the RAAS pathway.

AB  - Music is an external stimulus that affects physiological systems; both the quality of music and the resultant physiological changes can be quantified, which presents an unique opportunity. To quantify the complexity of a musical phrase we have used the Higuchi fractal dimension. We then compared the response of autonomic system (blood pressure, ECG, heart rate variability) in healthy subjects while listening to Indian classical music of different fractal qualities. Indian classical music has the unique quality of slow transition between notes, with consequent changes in dimensions of the string being played, which we have quantified. 25 healthy volunteers were recruited, all 18-35 years of age; the subjects were randomised into three groups: sinewave, low fractal and high fractal, depending on the type of musical intervention. The subjects were placed in a quiet room and asked to perform deep breathing exercises for relaxation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Non invasive BP (NIBP) leads were placed and continuous measurements started 10 min prior to intervention. At 0 min, the standardised musical intervention/ control was played. During intervention, the fractal dimension of the BP waveform showed a significant difference between subjects of high fractal group and low fractal group. In addition, the increment in heart rate variability (measured by standard parameters) during intervention showed an increasing trend from high to low fractal to sinewave. Whether the changes are due to direct contact with source of music or through a cerebral mechanism can be ascertained by further studies.

AB  - Recurrent falls pose a significant challenge for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and are a leading cause of disability in this population. One contributing factor to these recurring falls is the reduced minimum toe clearance (mTC). Preventing such falls by enhancing mTC has become an important goal in gait training among PD patients. In this paper, we propose a wearable cueing-based novel gait training device in anticipation of improved mTC. The cueing device records the foot strike angle (FSA) and cues the participants if the FSA is observed above a threshold. The patients with PD (n = 8) were recruited and asked to walk under two conditions: (a) with cue and (b) without cue at a self-selected speed during the ON medication state. Kinetic and kinematic gait parameters such as vertical ground reaction force, center of pressure, toe clearance, and FSA were recorded. A Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the toe clearance (within 34% to 64% of the swing phase from the toe-off instance) and FSA, from 87.60 mm and - 5.43degrees respectively during without cue to 94.29 mm and 2.93degrees respectively during with cue walking condition except in one subject. These findings support the potential incorporation of an FSA-based cueing device for toe clearance improvement among PD patients. In addition, the wearable setup supports the cueing device applicability outside laboratory and home settings.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a collective term for disorders of the heart and blood vessels. The molecular events and biochemical pathways associated with CVD are difficult to study in clinical settings on patients and in vitro conditions. Animal models play a pivotal and indispensable role in CVD research. Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode species, has emerged as a prominent experimental organism widely utilized in various biomedical research fields. However, the specific number of CVD-related genes and pathways within the C. elegans genome remains undisclosed to date, limiting its in-depth utilization for investigations. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genes and pathways related to CVD within the genomes of humans and C. elegans through a systematic bioinformatic approach. A total of 1113 genes in C. elegans orthologous to the most significant CVD-related genes in humans were identified, and the GO terms and pathways were compared to study the pathways that are conserved between the two species. In order to infer the functions of CVD-related orthologous genes in C. elegans, a PPI network was constructed. Orthologous gene PPI network analysis results reveal the hubs and important KRs: pmk-1, daf-21, gpb-1, crh-1, enpl-1, eef-1G, acdh-8, hif-1, pmk-2, and aha-1 in C. elegans. Modules were identified for determining the role of the orthologous genes at various levels in the created network. We also identified 9 commonly enriched pathways between humans and C. elegans linked with CVDs that include autophagy (animal), the ErbB signaling pathway, the FoxO signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, ABC transporters, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and metabolic pathways. This study provides the first systematic genomic approach to explore the CVD-associated genes and pathways that are present in C. elegans, supporting the use of C. elegans as a prominent animal model organism for cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Among all non-communicable diseases, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) stand as the leading global cause of mortality. Within this spectrum, Myocardial Infarction (MI) strikingly accounts for over 15 % of all deaths. The intricate web of risk factors for MI, comprising family history, tobacco use, oral health, hypertension, nutritional pattern, and microbial infections, is firmly influenced by the human gut and oral microbiota, their diversity, richness, and dysbiosis, along with their respective metabolites. Host genetic factors, especially allelic variations in signaling and inflammatory markers, greatly affect the progression or severity of the disease. Despite the established significance of the human microbiome-nutrient-metabolite interplay in associations with CVDs, the unexplored terrain of the gut-heart-oral axis has risen as a critical knowledge gap. Moreover, the pivotal role of the microbiome and the complex interplay with host genetics, compounded by age-related changes, emerges as an area of vital importance in the development of MI. In addition, a distinctive disease susceptibility and severity influenced by gender-based or ancestral differences, adds a crucial insights to the association with increased mortality. Here, we aimed to provide an overview on interactions of microbiome (oral and gut) with major risk factors (tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diet, hypertension host genetics, gender, and aging) in the development of MI and therapeutic regulation.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the prevalence and patterns of sensory processing deficits (SPD) in Indian children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) using child sensory profile-2 (CSP-2) caregiver questionnaire. The authors surveyed 230 caregivers of children aged 3 to 14 y with spastic CP, using CSP-2. The difference in prevalence and distribution of SPDs among the CP subtypes and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels was done. Overall prevalence of "Definite" (>2 SD) SPDs was 83%. Forty-seven percent had definite SPDs in more than one sensory subsection. Prevalence of definite SPDs was similar among the spastic CP subtypes. "Conduct" domain had more affection among hemiplegics and quadriplegics. "Avoiding" pattern was observed more in quadriplegics and "Seeking" pattern was observed less in diplegics. Severe GMFCS levels had more definite sensory processing deficits. SPDs are highly prevalent in children with spastic CP with unique patterns of affection among the spastic CP subtypes.

AB  - Purpose: Drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging threat. This study has been conducted to observe the efficacy of eravacycline along with the RND-efflux pump system. Methods: A cross-sectional study was done collecting 48 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. MICs of 15 antibiotics were detected along with BMD of tigecycline and eravacycline. PCR products of drug-resistant regulatory genes were sequenced and analyzed. Results: Of the total 48 Isolates, 35 (72.91%) were XDR and 13 (27.08%) were MDR. Out of all, 60.41% of isolates were found to be susceptible to eravacycline by BMD according to both FDA and EUCAST guidelines. A 2-fold decline of MIC50/90 was observed with the use of eravacycline compared to tigecycline. RND-efflux genes like AdeC in 30 (62.5%) isolates and Regulatory gene AdeS in 29 (60.41%) isolates were detected, explaining the existing resistance mechanism. Conclusions: XDR Acinetobacter poses an escalating threat due to its resistance to multiple antibiotics, raising serious concerns in healthcare settings. Eravacycline is an encouraging new drug for empirical use in severe infection caused due to the same. Molecular investigation and strict antimicrobial stewardship should be followed to control the emergence, and a better understanding of mechanisms of resistance to prevent the spread of drug-resistant isolates.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health problem worldwide. Though Pulmonary TB (PTB) is mostly discussed, one in five cases of TB present are extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) that manifests conspicuous diagnostic and management challenges with respect to the site of infection. The diagnosis of EPTB is often delayed or even missed due to insidious clinical presentation, pauci-bacillary nature of the disease, and lack of laboratory facilities in the resource limited settings. Culture, the classical gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, suffers from increased technical and logistical constraints in EPTB cases. Other than culture, several other tests are available but their feasibility and effciacy for the detection of EPTB is still the matter of interest. We need more specific and precise test/s for the various forms of EPTB diagnosis which can easily be applied in the routine TB control program is required. A test that can contribute remarkably towards improving EPTB case detection reducing the morbidity and mortality is the utmost requirement. In this review we described the scenario of molecular and other noval methods available for laboratory diagnosis of EPTB, and also discussed the challenges linked with each diagnostic method. This review will make the readers aware of new emerging diagnostic techniques in the field of EPTB diagnosis. They can make an informed decision to choose the appropriate one according to the test availability, their clinical settings and financial considerations.

TI  - The multimodality cell segmentation challenge: toward universal solutions
T2  - NATURE METHODS
AB  - Cell segmentation is a critical step for quantitative single-cell analysis in microscopy images. Existing cell segmentation methods are often tailored to specific modalities or require manual interventions to specify hyper-parameters in different experimental settings. Here, we present a multimodality cell segmentation benchmark, comprising more than 1,500 labeled images derived from more than 50 diverse biological experiments. The top participants developed a Transformer-based deep-learning algorithm that not only exceeds existing methods but can also be applied to diverse microscopy images across imaging platforms and tissue types without manual parameter adjustments. This benchmark and the improved algorithm offer promising avenues for more accurate and versatile cell analysis in microscopy imaging.
   Cell segmentation is crucial in many image analysis pipelines. This analysis compares many tools on a multimodal cell segmentation benchmark. A Transformer-based model performed best in terms of performance and general applicability.

AB  - Background and Aim: The prognostic potential of cardiac troponin (cTn) in acute stroke patients has been a subject of ongoing debate. Our objective was to provide a comprehensive evidence for predicting mortality in acute stroke patients by using the elevated troponin levels. Methods: We conducted an extensive literature search, including PubMed, EMbase, and Trip Databases, covering studies published up to September 30, 2023. We computed risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), performed sensitivity analysis, and conducted trial sequential analysis (TSA). Results: In total, 53 studies were analyzed, with 37 focusing on acute ischemic stroke (AIS), 11 on subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 7 on Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Elevated cTn levels were significantly showed a higher predictive risk for In-hospital mortality in both AIS (RR=3.80, 95% CI; 2.82 to 5.12) as well as SAH (RR=2.23, 95% CI; 1.64 to 3.02). However, no significant predictive risk between elevated cTn levels and in-hospital mortality for ICH patients (RR=1.13, 95% CI: 0.46 to 2.79). A similar pattern was observed for elevated cTn levels, indicating an increased risk of last follow-up mortality for AIS (RR=2.41, 95% CI: 1.98 to 2.93) and SAH (RR=3.08, 95% CI: 2.25 to 4.21). Conclusion: Elevated troponin levels can serve as a promising predictive marker for both in-hospital and last follow-up mortality in AIS and SAH patients but not in ICH patients. Further prospective studies are needed to validate our findings along with exploring the preventive management of mortality in acute stroke settings.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, which arises due to low levels of acetyl and butyrylcholines, an increase in oxidative stress, inflammation, metal dyshomeostasis, A beta and tau aggregations. The currently available drugs for AD treatment can provide only symptomatic relief without interfering with pathological hallmarks of the disease. In our ongoing efforts to develop naturally inspired novel multifunctional molecules for AD, systematic SAR studies on EJMC-4e were caried out to improve its multifunctional properties. The rigorous medicinal efforts led to the development of 12o, which displayed a 15-fold enhancement in antioxidant properties and a 2-fold increase in the activity against AChE and BChE over EJMC-4e. Molecular docking and dynamics studies revealed the binding sites and stability of the complex of 12o with AChE and BChE. The PAMPA-BBB assay clearly demonstrated that 12o can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Interestingly, 12o also expresses promising metal chelation activity, while EJMC-4e was found to be devoid of this property. Further, 12o inhibited metal-induced or self A beta 1-42 aggregation. Observing the neuroprotection ability of 12o against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in the PC-12 cell line is noteworthy. Furthermore, 12o also inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and attenuated mitochondrial-induced ROS and MMP damage caused by LPS and ATP in HMC-3 cells. In addition, 12o is able to effectively reduce mitochondrial and cellular oxidative stress in the AD Drosophila model. Finally, 12o could reverse memory impairment in the scopolamine-induced AD mice model, as evident through in vivo and ex vivo studies. These findings suggest that this compound may act as a promising candidate for further improvement in the management of AD.

AB  - BackgroundThe healthcare systems in Asia vary greatly due to the socio-economic and cultural diversities which impact haemophilia management.MethodsAn advisory board meeting was conducted with experts in haemophilia care from Asia to understand the heterogeneity in clinical practices and care provision in the region.FindingsThe overall prevalence of haemophilia in Asia ranges between 3 and 8.58/100,000 patients. Haemophilia A was more prevalent as compared to haemophilia B with a ratio of around 5:1. There is under-diagnosis in the region due to lack of diagnosis, registries and/or lack of appropriate facilities in suburban areas. Most patients are referred to the haematologists by their families or primary care physicians, while some are identified during bleeding episodes. Genetic testing faces obstacles like resource constraints, services available at limited centres and unwillingness of patients to participate. Prophylaxis is offered for people with haemophilia (PWH) with a severe bleeding phenotype. Recombinant factors are approved in most countries across the region and are the preferred therapy. The challenges highlighted for not receiving a high standard of care include patients' reluctance to use an intravenous treatment, poor patient compliance due to frequency of infusions, budget constraints and lack of funding, insurance, availability and accessibility of factor concentrates. Prevalence of neutralizing antibodies ranged from 5% to 20% in the region. Use of immune tolerance induction and bypassing agents to treat inhibitors depends on their cost and availability.ConclusionHaemophilia care in Asia has evolved to a great extent. However, some challenges remain for which a strategic approach along with multi-stakeholder involvement are needed.

AB  - Introduction Guidelines recommend screening older people (> 60-65 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for cognitive impairment, as it has implications in the management of diabetes. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a sensitive test for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the general population, but its validity in T2D has not been established. Methods We administered MoCA to patients with T2D (age >= 60 years) and controls (no T2D), along with a culturally validated neuropsychological battery and functional activity questionnaire. MCI was defined as performance in one or more cognitive domains >= 1.0 SD below the control group (on two tests representing a cognitive domain), with preserved functional activities. The discriminant validity of MoCA for the diagnosis of MCI at different cut-offs was ascertained. Results We enrolled 267 patients with T2D and 120 controls; 39% of the participants with T2D met the diagnostic criteria for MCI on detailed neuropsychological testing. At the recommended cut-off on MoCA (< 26), the sensitivity (94.2%) was high, but the specificity was quite low (29.5%). The cut-off score of < 23 showed an optimal trade-off between sensitivity (69.2%), specificity (71.8%), and diagnostic accuracy (70.8%). The cut-off of < 21 exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy (74.9%) with an excellent specificity (91.4%), a good positive and negative predictive value (78.5% and 73.7%, respectively). Conclusions The recommended screening cut-off point on MoCA of < 26 has a suboptimal specificity and may increase the referral burden in memory clinics. A lower cut-off of < 21 on MoCA maximizes the diagnostic accuracy.Interactive Visual Abstract available for this article.

AB  - Aurora kinases (AURKs) are a family of serine /threonine protein kinases that have a crucial role in cell cycle process mainly in the event of chromosomal segregation, centrosome maturation and cytokinesis. The family consists of three members including Aurora kinase A (AURK-A), Aurora kinase B (AURK-B) and Aurora kinase C (AURK-C). All AURKs contain a conserved kinase domain for their activity but differ in their cellular localization and functions. AURK-A and AURK-B are expressed mainly in somatic cells while the expression of AURK-C is limited to germ cells. AURK-A promotes G2 to M transition of cell cycle by controlling centrosome maturation and mitotic spindle assembly. AURK-B and AURK-C form the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) that ensures proper chromosomal alignments and segregation. Aberrant expression of AURK-A and AURK-B has been detected in several solid tumours and malignancies. Hence, they have become an attractive therapeutic target against cancer. The first part of this review focuses on AURKs structure, functions, subcellular localization, and their role in tumorigenesis. The review also highlights the functional and clinical impact of selective as well as pan kinase inhibitors. Currently, >60 compounds that target AURKs are in preclinical and clinical studies. The drawbacks of existing inhibitors like selectivity, drug resistance and toxicity have also been addressed. Since, majority of inhibitors are Aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI) type-1 that bind to the active (DFG(in) and C-in) conformation of the kinase, this information may be utilized to design highly selective kinase inhibitors that can be combined with other therapeutic agents for better clinical outcomes.

KW  - transfusion safety
KW  - virus
AB  - Background and Objectives: Nucleic acid-amplification testing (NAT) is used for screening blood donations/donors for blood-borne viruses. We reviewed global viral NAT characteristics and NAT-yield confirmatory testing used by blood operators.
   Materials and Methods: NAT characteristics and NAT-yield confirmatory testing used during 2019 was surveyed internationally by the International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases. Reported characteristics are presented herein.
   Results: NAT was mainly performed under government mandate. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) NAT was performed on all donors and donation types, while selective testing was reported for West Nile virus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), and Zika virus. Individual donation NAT was used for HIV, HCV and HBV by similar to 50% of responders, while HEV was screened in mini-pools by 83% of responders performing HEV NAT. Confirmatory testing for NAT-yield samples was generally performed by NAT on a sample from the same donation or by NAT and serology on samples from the same donation and a follow-up sample.
   Conclusion: In the last decade, there has been a trend towards use of smaller pool sizes or individual donation NAT. We captured characteristics of NAT internationally in 2019 and provide insights into confirmatory testing approaches used for NAT-yields, potentially benefitting blood operators seeking to implement NAT.

AB  - Purpose To examine the effects of first-trimester HbA1c (HbA1c-FT) >= 37 mmol/mol on preterm birth (PTB) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies in a retrospective cohort of South Asian pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM). Methods The cohort (n = 686) was separated into two groups based on HbA1c-FT values: Group A (n = 97) and Group B (n = 589), with values of 37-46 mmol/mol (5.5-6.4%) and < 37 mmol/mol (5.5%), respectively. HbA1c-FT's independent influence on PTB and LGA babies was examined using multivariable logistic regression in groups A and B women. The reference group (Group C) included 2031 non-GDM women with HbA1c-FT < 37 mmol/mol (< 5.5%). The effects of HbA1c-FT on PTB and LGA babies in obese women in Groups A, B, and C (designated as A-ob, B-ob, and C-ob, respectively) were re-analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results Group A GDM women with greater HbA1c-FT had a higher risk for PTB (aOR:1.86, 95% CI:1.10-3.14) but not LGA babies (aOR:1.13, 95%: 0.70-1.83). The risk of PTB was higher for obese women in Group A-ob: aOR 3.28 [95% CI 1.68-6.39]. However, GDM women with normal HbA1c-FT exhibited no elevated risk for PTB: Groups B and B-ob had aORs of 1.30 (95% CI 0.86-1.98) and 1.28 (95% CI 0.88-1.85) respectively. Conclusions South Asian GDM women with prediabetic HbA1c FT; 37-46 mmol/mol (5.5-6.4%) are more likely to deliver preterm babies despite treatment, while the risk for LGA babies was the same as non-GDM women.

AB  - tsRNAs (tRNA-derived small non-coding RNAs), including tRNA halves (tiRNAs) and tRNA fragments (tRFs), have been implicated in some viral infections, such as respiratory viral infections. However, their involvement in SARS-CoV infection is completely unknown. A comprehensive analysis was performed to determine tsRNA populations in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-infected samples containing the wild-type and attenuated viruses. Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset at NCBI (accession ID GSE90624) was used for this study. A count matrix was generated for the tRNAs. Differentially expressed tRNAs, followed by tsRNAs derived from each significant tRNAs at different conditions and time points between the two groups WT(SARS-CoV-MA15-WT) vs Mock and Delta E (SARS-CoV-MA15-Delta E) vs Mock were identified. Notably, significantly differentially expressed tRNAs at 2dpi but not at 4dpi. The tsRNAs originating from differentially expressed tRNAs across all the samples belonging to each condition (WT, Delta E, and Mock) were identified. Intriguingly, tRFs (tRNA-derived RNA fragments) exhibited higher levels compared to tiRNAs (tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs) across all samples associated with WT SARS-CoV strain compared to Delta E and mock-infected samples. This discrepancy suggests a non-random formation of tsRNAs, hinting at a possible involvement of tsRNAs in SARS-CoV viral infection.

AB  - Background & Aims: Current international guidelines recommend duodenal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease in adult patients. However, growing evidence suggests that immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTg) antibody levels >= 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) can accurately predict celiac disease, eliminating the need for biopsy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the no-biopsy approach to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease in adults. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from January 1998 to October 2023 for studies reporting the sensitivity and specificity of IgA-tTG >= 10xULN against duodenal biopsies (Marsh grade >= 2) in adults with suspected celiac disease. We used a bivariate random effects model to calculate the summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were used to calculate the positive predictive value of the no-biopsy approach across different pretest probabilities of celiac disease. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42023398812. Results: A total of 18 studies comprising 12,103 participants from 15 countries were included. The pooled prevalence of biopsy-proven celiac disease in the included studies was 62% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40%-83%). The proportion of patients with IgA-tTG >= 10xULN was 32% (95% CI, 24%-40%). The summary sensitivity of IgA-tTG >= 10xULN was 51% (95% CI, 42%-60%), and the summary specificity was 100% (95% CI, 98%-100%). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 - 0.89). The positive predictive value of the no-biopsy approach to identify patients with celiac disease was 65%, 88%, 95%, and 99% if celiac disease prevalence was 1%, 4%, 10%, and 40%, respectively. Between-study heterogeneity was moderate (I-2 =30.3%), and additional sensitivity analyses did not significantly alter our findings. Only 1 study had a low risk of bias across all domains. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that selected adult patients with IgA-tTG >= 10xULN and a moderate to high pretest probability of celiac disease could be diagnosed without undergoing invasive endoscopy and duodenal biopsy.

AB  - Three-dimensional high-definition (3D HD) and ultra-high-definition (4 K HD) endovision systems are rapidly adopted in academic setting. However, transferability of laparoscopic skills acquired from these systems to two-dimensional high-definition (2D HD) endovision system is not known. Forty stereo-enabled surgical residents were randomized into two groups. They performed three standardized surgical tasks, Task 1(Peg transfer), Task 2(Precision touch on uneven surface) and Task 3(Surgical knotting on rubber tube) for 15 repetitions using either 3D HD or 4 K HD. Both groups then performed the same tasks using 2D HD for 5 repetitions. Their performances were evaluated for execution time (speed) and error scores (safety). The residents in 3D HD group performed all three tasks significantly faster than residents in 4 K HD group with comparable error scores. The time taken to complete the tasks on 2D HD were comparable between residents trained in 3D HD and 4 K HD in two out of three tasks (p = 0.027, P = 0.115, p = 0.368 in task 1, 2 and 3 respectively). However, in two out of three tasks, residents trained on 3D HD committed significantly more errors than residents trained on 4 K HD (p < 0.0001, p < 0.001 in task 1 and task 2 respectively). Skill acquired on 4 K HD seems transferable to 2D HD environment. Participants trained in 3D HD made more errors while performing the tasks in 2D HD. It may be prudent to offer additional training on 2D HD to residents trained on 3D HD for safer laparoscopic surgical practice.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of children who received a diagnosis of retinoblastoma in 2017 throughout Asia. Design: Multinational, prospective study including treatment-na & iuml;ve patients in Asia who received a diagnosis of retinoblastoma in 2017 and were followed up thereafter. Participants: A total of 2112 patients (2797 eyes) from 96 retinoblastoma treatment centers in 33 Asian countries. Interventions: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, enucleation, and orbital exenteration. Main Outcome Measures: Enucleation and death. Results: Within the cohort, 1021 patients (48%) were from South Asia (SA), 503 patients (24%) were from East Asia (EA), 310 patients (15%) were from Southeast Asia (SEA), 218 patients (10%) were from West Asia (WA), and 60 patients (3%) were from Central Asia (CA). Mean age at presentation was 27 months (median, 23 months; range, < 1e261 months). The cohort included 1195 male patients (57%) and 917 female patients (43%). The most common presenting symptoms were leukocoria (72%) and strabismus (13%). Using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, Eighth Edition, classification, tumors were staged as cT1 (n = 441 [16%]), cT2 (n = 951 [34%]), cT3 (n = 1136 [41%]), cT4 (n = 267 [10%]), N1 (n = 48 [2%]), and M1 (n = 129 [6%]) at presentation. Retinoblastoma was treated with intravenous chemotherapy in 1450 eyes (52%) and 857 eyes (31%) underwent primary enucleation. Three-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for enucleation and death were 33% and 13% for CA, 18% and 4% for EA, 27% and 15% for SA, 32% and 22% for SEA, and 20% and 11% for WA (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusions: At the conclusion of this study, significant heterogeneity was found in treatment outcomes of retinoblastoma among the regions of Asia. East Asia displayed better outcomes with higher rates of globe and life salvage, whereas Southeast Asia showed poorer outcomes compared with the rest of Asia.

AB  - Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process that produces all adult blood cells and immune cells from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs usually remain quiescent, and in the presence of external stimuli like infection or inflammation, they undergo division and differentiation as a compensatory mechanism. Normal hematopoiesis is impacted by systemic inflammation, which causes HSCs to transition from quiescence to emergency myelopoiesis. At the molecular level, inflammatory cytokine signaling molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferons, interleukins, and toll-like receptors can all cause HSCs to multiply directly. These cytokines actively encourage HSC activation, proliferation, and differentiation during inflammation, which results in the generation and activation of immune cells required to combat acute injury. The bone marrow niche provides numerous soluble and stromal cell signals, which are essential for maintaining normal homeostasis and output of the bone marrow cells. Inflammatory signals also impact this bone marrow microenvironment called the HSC niche to regulate the inflammatory-induced hematopoiesis. Continuous pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine activation can have detrimental effects on the hematopoietic system, which can lead to cancer development, HSC depletion, and bone marrow failure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage DNA and ultimately lead to the transformation of HSCs into cancerous cells, are produced due to chronic inflammation. The biological elements of the HSC niche produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause clonal growth and the development of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in hematological malignancies. The processes underlying how inflammation affects hematological malignancies are still not fully understood. In this review, we emphasize the effects of inflammation on normal hematopoiesis, the part it plays in the development and progression of hematological malignancies, and potential therapeutic applications for targeting these pathways for therapy in hematological malignancies.

AB  - Nomograms help to predict outcomes in individual patients rather than whole populations and are an important part of evaluation and treatment decision making. Various nomograms have been developed in malignancies to predict and prognosticate clinical outcomes such as severity of disease, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival. In prostate cancer, nomograms were developed for determining need for biopsy, disease course, need for adjuvant therapy, and outcomes. Most of these predictive nomograms were based on Caucasian populations. Prostate cancer is significantly affected by race, and Asian men have a significantly different racial and genetic susceptibility compared to Caucasians, raising the concern in generalizability of these nomograms. We reviewed the existing literature for nomograms in prostate cancer and their application in Asian men. There are very few studies that have evaluated the applicability and validity of the existing nomograms in these men. Most have found significant differences in the performance in this population. Thus, more studies evaluating the existing nomograms in Asian men or suggesting modifications for this population are required. (c) 2024 The Asian Pacific Prostate Society. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Dissociative disorder patients often present with sudden and embarrassing symptoms, and it is difficult for the patient and care giver to understand initially, recognize the need for help and reach for appropriate treatment timely. This can result in high risk of engaging in dangerous behaviors such as self-harm and suicidal acts, impaired global functioning, and poor quality of life. Knowledge about the types of barriers which are there in treatment seeking, can help in planning strategies for their removal and to facilitate the treatment process. Methods: Cross-sectional study among patients (n=133) with Dissociative disorders which were recruited from January 2023 to June 2023 in a tertiary care hospital. Pathways to care and barriers in treatment for Dissociative disorders were assessed by interviewing patients using semi-structured proforma. The Dissociative Experience Scale and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0)) were used to assess disease severity and impact of illness on various domains of life respectively. Group comparison was made to assess differences in social- clinical profile of patients choosing different modalities of treatment. Results: 133 patients of Dissociative disorders with mean age 29.6 +/- 9.2, showed their first-choice of help seeking from general practitioner/ neurologist (40.6%), traditional faith healers (35.3%), psychiatrist (18.1%) and 5.2% preferred alternative treatments. This trend changed with 2nd and 3rd contact of help seeking with greater preference for psychiatrist in their 2nd (n=45, 33.8%) and 3rd (n=69, 51.8%) contact. The median duration of untreated illness was 56 weeks (IQR 24-182 weeks). Social-clinical profile of patients varied with their choice of treatment, having lower education level (P = 0.013), longer duration of untreated illness (p=0.003), more severity of symptoms (p=0.032) and greater disability scores(p=0.002) in patients whose first treatment choice was traditional faith healers. More than 70% patients faced availability barriers, stigma, unawareness about mental illness and influence of others in treatment of choice as barriers in initiating and continuing treatment. Conclusion: Patients with Dissociative disorders seek treatment from a multitude of healthcare providers including traditional faith healers, general physicians, and alternative medicine practitioners before reaching psychiatrist and undergoes various barriers in treatment. There is need to implement necessary measures for sensitization and awareness about Dissociative disorders to prevent prolonged and undue delays in initiation of appropriate management.

AB  - Infectious diseases are a cause of major concern in this twenty-first century. There have been reports of various outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, swine flu in 2009, Zika virus disease in 2015, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, since the start of this millennium. In addition to these outbreaks, the latest infectious disease to result in an outbreak is the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A viral infection recognized as a respiratory illness at the time of emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has wreaked havoc worldwide because of its long-lasting implications like heart failure, sepsis, organ failure, etc., and its significant impact on the global economy. Besides the acute illness, it also leads to symptoms months later which is called long COVID or postCOVID-19 condition. Due to its ever-increasing prevalence, it has been a significant challenge to treat the affected individuals and manage the complications as well. Myocarditis, a long-term complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an inflammatory condition involving the myocardium of the heart, which could even be fatal in the long term in cases of progression to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Thus, it is imperative to diagnose early and treat this condition in the affected individuals. At present, there are numerous studies which are in progress, investigating patients with COVID-19-related myocarditis and the treatment strategies. This review focuses primarily on myocarditis, a life -threatening complication of COVID-19 illness, and endeavors to elucidate the pathogenesis, biomarkers, and management of long COVID myocarditis along with pipeline drugs in detail.

AB  - Background: Patch test is the gold standard for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis. Conventionally, the patches are applied for 48 h, which in tropical weather conditions causes excessive sweating, leading to irritation, and sometimes the patches come off, making the test inconclusive.
   Objective: To compare the patch test positivity after 24 and 48 h of occlusion time in patients of allergic contact dermatitis, using standard allergen concentration.
   Materials and methods: Clinically suspected patients of allergic contact dermatitis were enrolled and patch tested using the Indian Standard Series, parthenium acetone extracts (1:50, 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions) and patient material. Patches were applied in duplicate on either side of the back, using a random number table. One set of patches was removed after 24-h of occlusion, while the other set after 48-h. Readings were performed at 48- and 96-h by two independent dermatologists, blinded to the duration of occlusion.
   Results: The study had 97 adult patients (58 males and 39 females; mean age: 48.12 +/- 13.07 years). A total of 133 and 142 positive reactions were observed after 48 h occlusion at 48 and 96 h reading, respectively. Of these 117 (87.9%) and 132 (92.9%) patches were positive and concordant and noted at 24 h occlusion time. The Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.94 for 48 h and 0.97 for 96 h reading, hence showing an almost complete agreement (kappa > 0.81) between patches occluded for 24 and 48 h.
   Conclusion: Though there is no significant difference in patch test positivity among ISS allergens after either occlusion time, 48 h occlusion performs significantly better compared with 24 h, when reactions of all allergens (ISS, patient material and parthenium acetone extract) are analysed together.

AB  - A 2-month-old male with surgically resected sacral chordoma presented with multiple hypopigmented macules showing characteristic patchy, sharply demarcated areas of pigment network on dermoscopy. These dermoscopic findings were suggestive of the ash-leaf macules of tuberous sclerosis over other common hypopigmented macules in neonates. Chordomas presenting in early childhood in the sacral location have been reported as a rare manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex. The combination of these findings led to a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, confirmed with the finding of a heterozygous TSC2 gene deletion; treatment with sirolimus resulted in regression of cardiac rhabdomyomas and hypopigmented macules.

AB  - Background Disorders affecting the nervous system are diverse and include neurodevelopmental disorders, late-life neurodegeneration, and newly emergent conditions, such as cognitive impairment following COVID-19. Previous publications from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study estimated the burden of 15 neurological conditions in 2015 and 2016, but these analyses did not include neurodevelopmental disorders, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11, or a subset of cases of congenital, neonatal, and infectious conditions that cause neurological damage. Here, we estimate nervous system health loss caused by 37 unique conditions and their associated risk factors globally, regionally, and nationally from 1990 to 2021.
   Methods We estimated mortality, prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs), by age and sex in 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to 2021. We included morbidity and deaths due to neurological conditions, for which health loss is directly due to damage to the CNS or peripheral nervous system. We also isolated neurological health loss from conditions for which nervous system morbidity is a consequence, but not the primary feature, including a subset of congenital conditions (ie, chromosomal anomalies and congenital birth defects), neonatal conditions (ie, jaundice, preterm birth, and sepsis), infectious diseases (ie, COVID-19, cystic echinococcosis, malaria, syphilis, and Zika virus disease), and diabetic neuropathy. By conducting a sequela-level analysis of the health outcomes for these conditions, only cases where nervous system damage occurred were included, and YLDs were recalculated to isolate the non-fatal burden directly attributable to nervous system health loss. A comorbidity correction was used to calculate total prevalence of all conditions that affect the nervous system combined.
   Findings Globally, the 37 conditions affecting the nervous system were collectively ranked as the leading group cause of DALYs in 2021 (443 million, 95% UI 378-521), affecting 3.40 billion (3.20-3.62) individuals (43.1%, 40.5-45.9 of the global population); global DALY counts attributed to these conditions increased by 18.2% (8.7-26.7) between 1990 and 2021. Age-standardised rates of deaths per 100 000 people attributed to these conditions decreased from 1990 to 2021 by 33.6% (27.6-38.8), and age-standardised rates of DALYs attributed to these conditions decreased by 27.0% (21.5-32.4). Age-standardised prevalence was almost stable, with a change of 1.5% (0.7-2.4). The ten conditions with the highest age-standardised DALYs in 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, diabetic neuropathy, meningitis, epilepsy, neurological complications due to preterm birth, autism spectrum disorder, and nervous system cancer.
   Interpretation As the leading cause of overall disease burden in the world, with increasing global DALY counts, effective prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for disorders affecting the nervous system are needed.

AB  - Purpose In the context of medical literature, a significant lacuna exists in understanding median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS). While clinical aspects are well documented, literature lacks a robust exploration of the anatomical relationship between the celiac trunk and the median arcuate ligament (MAL). Methods Morphometric parameters, including the vertebral level of MAL origin, MAL thickness, celiac trunk (CeT) origin level, diameter, and distances between CeT/Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) and the MAL center were observed on 250 CT angiograms. Cadavers (n = 11) were dissected to examine the same parameters and histo-morphological examination of MAL tissue was done. Results Radiological findings established average MAL thickness of 7.79 +/- 2.58 mm. The celiac trunk typically originated at T12. The average distance between the celiac trunk and the MAL center was 1.32 +/- 2.04 mm. The angle of the celiac trunk to the abdominal aorta was primarily obtuse. The average celiac trunk diameter was 5.53 +/- 1.33 mm. Histological examinations revealed a diverse MAL composition, indicating variable mechanical properties. Conclusion This study provides comprehensive morphometric data on the anatomical relationship between the MAL and the celiac trunk. In contrast to available literature which says the average MAL thickness of > 4 mm is an indicator of increased thickness, we observed much higher average thickness in the studied population. The findings contribute to a better understanding of normal anatomical variations which can serve as reference values for accurate radiological diagnosis of MALS. The histological examination revealed the heterogeneous nature of the MAL tissue composition, suggesting variable mechanical properties and functions in different regions.

AB  - Background: Arglabin is a plant alkaloid (sesquiterpene lactone) that is used as an anticancer drug. It has potential anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic effects. Purpose: Arglabin has drawn particular attention because of its therapeutic effects as an anti-inflammatory agent in multiple diseases. Since arglabin inhibits Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, concerns for cardiotoxic effects are valid. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of arglabin on the myocardium. Study design: This study was designed to evaluate the effect of arglabin on the myocardium in an experimental model of myocardial necrosis in rats. Different doses of arglabin (2.5, 5, and 10 mu g/kg) were investigated as pretreatment for 21 days in the isoproterenol (ISO) model of myocardial necrosis groups and per se groups. Methods: On the 22nd day, hemodynamic, histopathological, electron microscopy, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic markers, inflammasome mediators, and Western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the effects of arglabin. Results: Arglabin pre-treatment showed improvement in hemodynamic parameters and histopathological findings at low doses in isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrosis model of rats. Arglabin administration altered myocardial structure and modulated myocardial function via activation of NF kappa B/MAPK pathway that led to myocardial injury with an increase in dose. Conclusion: Arglabin imparted partial cardio-protection via an inflammasome-dependent pathway and mediated injury through the inflammasome-independent pathway.

AB  - Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular tumor in childhood. It is mainly caused by mutations in both alleles of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene that is found on chromosome 13 and regulates the cell cycle. Approximately 8000 children are diagnosed with RB globally each year, with an estimated 1500 cases occurring in India. The survival rate of RB has improved to more than 90% in the developed world. Leukocoria and proptosis are the most common presenting features of RB in Asian Indian populations. Most cases of RB are diagnosed by fundus examination followed by ultrasound. The International Classification of Retinoblastoma is the most used scheme for the staging and classification of intraocular RB in India. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for RB may be beneficial in high-risk families. Histopathologic risk factors such as massive choroidal invasion and post-laminar optic nerve help in predicting the occurrence of metastasis in children with RB, while presence of microscopic residual disease requires aggressive adjuvant treatment in eyes enucleated for group E RB. The review provides a consensus document on diagnosis and genetics of RB in India.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   There is scant literature on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). AIM
   To assess the magnitude, clinical characteristics, feasibility, and outcomes of treatment in BCS-HCC. METHODS
   A total of 904 BCS patients from New Delhi, India and 1140 from Mumbai, India were included. The prevalence and incidence of HCC were determined, and among patients with BCS-HCC, the viability and outcomes of interventional therapy were evaluated. RESULTS
   In the New Delhi cohort of 35 BCS-HCC patients, 18 had HCC at index presentation (prevalence 1.99%), and 17 developed HCC over a follow-up of 4601 person-years, [incidence 0.36 (0.22-0.57) per 100 person-years]. BCS-HCC patients were older when compared to patients with BCS alone (P = 0.001) and had a higher proportion of inferior vena cava block, cirrhosis, and long-segment vascular obstruction. The median alpha-fetoprotein level was higher in patients with BCS-HCC at first presentation than those who developed HCC at follow-up (13029 ng/mL vs 500 ng/mL, P = 0.01). Of the 35 BCS-HCC, 26 (74.3%) underwent radiological interventions for BCS, and 22 (62.8%) patients underwent treatment for HCC [transarterial chemoembolization in 18 (81.8%), oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor in 3 (13.6%), and transarterial radioembolization in 1 (4.5%)]. The median survival among patients who underwent interventions for HCC compared with those who did not was 3.5 years vs 3.1 mo (P = 0.0001). In contrast to the New Delhi cohort, the Mumbai cohort of BCS-HCC patients were predominantly males, presented with a more advanced HCC [Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer C and D], and 2 patients underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSION
   HCC is not uncommon in patients with BCS. Radiological interventions and liver transplantation are feasible in select primary BCS-HCC patients and may improve outcomes.

After dividing as per the classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions, subjects were equally allocated into three groups. Group I- only endodontic lesion {control: healthy periodontium (n = 15)}, Group II- CEPL having stage I and II periodontitis (n = 15) and Group III- CEPL having stage III periodontitis (n = 15). Standardized two-visit NSET was performed with 2% chlorhexidine gel as an intracanal medicament. Periodontal therapy was instituted wherever required. Subjects were recalled at 6-and 12-months for clinical and radiographic assessment. Chi-square test was performed to evaluate the difference between the groups.ResultsAt 12-month follow-up, all teeth in the three study groups were asymptomatic. On radiographic evaluation of the periapical region, healing was observed in 80%, 47% and 50% of teeth in Groups I, Group II and Group III, respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant between the groups (p = 0.150).ConclusionThe severity of periodontal disease had no influence on periapical healing after NSET in teeth with concomitant endodontic periodontal lesions without communication.Clinical relevancePeriodontal disease has significant impact on apical periodontitis however severity of the periodontitis does not negatively impact the apical periodontitis.

AB  - Traumatic injuries due to unintentional slips and falls are prevalent in healthcare and nursing facilities. According to reports, around 26% of all the nonfatal slips, trips, and falls cases were observed in the nursing care facilities. Slipping generally occurs due to a sudden reduction in the friction at footwear-floor junction, presence of contaminants during walking, quality of flooring, etc. While several studies have conducted pilot tests to understand the slip risk of different types of footwear, specialized footwear worn by nurses have not been studied till date. In this work, 50 shoe designs worn by nurses were selected to test their traction performances. A biofidelic and portable slip testing device was employed to test the friction of footwear over common locations in a hospital i.e., ward corridor, ICU entry, and nurse station. Through rigorous tests, shoe replacement threshold of 6 months has been identified, which could significantly reduce these accidents. Softer shoes having shore hardness less than 53 A showed high traction over dry floorings (R2 = 0.86). Furthermore, a novel method to estimate the worn region size was employed. The worn-out region sizes of radius more than 5 mm showed drastic reduction in the footwear traction performance across slippery floorings. The novel findings from this study are anticipated to guide the hospital management and nurses in selecting appropriate footwear, determining replacement thresholds, and selecting safer floorings for different slipping scenarios to reduce fatal and non-fatal slipping cases related to hospital staff and nurses.

AB  - Background: The Suicidal Narrative Inventory (SNI) is a 38-item self-report measure developed to assess elements of the suicidal narrative, a subacute, predominantly cognitive, presuicidal construct. Our objectives were to assess the factor structure, validity, and reliability of the SNI-38 among adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, we administered the Hindi version of the SNI along with other self-report measures to adults with MDD, recruited from 24 tertiary care hospitals across India. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to assess the factor structure of SNI-38. Reliability (internal consistency) was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (alpha). Convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity of the SNI-38 were tested by comparing it against other appropriate measures. Results: We collected usable responses from 654 Hindi-speaking participants (Mean age = 36.9 +/- 11.9 years, 50.2% female). The eight-factor solution of the SNI showed good model fit indices (chi 2[637] = 3345.58, p <.001, CFI =.98, and RMSEA =.08). Internal consistencies for the SNI subscale scores were good to excellent, alpha ranging from .73 to.92. While most subscales significantly converged with other measures, associations were comparatively weaker and inconsistent for the 'thwarted belongingness' and 'goal reengagement' subscales. Conclusion: Consistent with prior data, our study confirmed an eight-factor solution and demonstrated adequate psychometric properties for the Hindi version of the SNI-38 in our sample. These findings provide empirical support for the use of SNI to assess the suicidal narrative among Indian adults with MDD.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided multiple injection costotransverse block (MICB) and compare it with erector spinae plane block (ESPB) for poststernotomy pain relief in pediatric cardiac surgical patients. Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative study. Setting: At a single institution tertiary referral cardiac center. Participants: A total of 90 children with acyanotic congenital heart disease requiring surgery via sternotomy. Interventions: Children were allocated randomly to 1 of the 3 following groups: ESPB (group 1), MICB (group 2), or Control (group 3). Participants in groups 1 and 2 received 4 mg/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine for bilateral ultrasound-guided block after induction of anesthesia. Postoperatively, intravenous paracetamol was used for multimodal analgesia, and fentanyl/tramadol was used for rescue analgesia. Measurements and Main Results: The modified objective pain score (MOPS) was evaluated at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours postextubation. After all exclusions, 84 patients were analyzed. The MOPS score was found to be significantly lower in ESPB and MICB groups compared to the control group until 10 hours postextubation (p < 0.05), with no statistically significant difference at the 12th hour (p = 0.2198). The total intraoperative fentanyl consumption (p = 0.0005), need for fentanyl supplementation on incision (p < 0.0001), and need for rescue opioid requirement in the postoperative period (p = 0.034) were significantly lower in both the ESPB and MICB groups than the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in both primary and secondary outcomes between the ESPB and MICB groups. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided MICB was effective and comparable to ESPB for post-sternotomy pain management in pediatric cardiac surgical patients. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) is a member of the F-box family of substrate-recognition subunits in the SCF ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes. It is associated with ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the mammalian cell cycle components and other target proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription. Being an oncogene in solid tumors and hematological malignancies, it is frequently associated with drug resistance and poor disease outcomes. In the current review, we discussed the novel role of SKP2 in different hematological malignancies. Further, we performed a limited in-silico analysis to establish the involvement of SKP2 in a few publicly available cancer datasets. Interestingly, our study identified Skp2 expression to be altered in a cancer-specific manner. While it was found to be overexpressed in several cancer types, few cancer showed a down-regulation in SKP2. Our review provides evidence for developing novel SKP2 inhibitors in hematological malignancies. We also investigated the effect of SKP2 status on survival and disease progression. In addition, the role of miRNA and its associated families in regulating Skp2 expression was explored. Subsequently, we predicted common miRNAs against Skp2 genes by using miRNA-predication tools. Finally, we discussed current approaches and future prospective approaches to target the Skp2 gene by using different drugs and miRNA-based therapeutics applications in translational research.
