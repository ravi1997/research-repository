AB  - Background: ene environment interactions leading to epigenetic alterations play pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Altered DNA methylation is one such epigenetic factor that could lead to altered disease etiology. In this study, we comprehensively identified methylation sites in several genes that have been previously associated with young CAD patients.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 42 healthy controls and 33 young CAD patients (age group <50 years). We performed targeted bisulfite sequencing of promoter as well as gene body regions of several genes in various pathways like cholesterol synthesis and metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, apoptosis, which are implicated in the development of CAD.
   Results: We observed that the genes like GALNT2, HMGCR were hypermethylated in the promoter whereas LDLR gene promoter was hypomethylated indicating that intracellular LDL uptake was higher in CAD patients. Although APOA1 did not show significant change in methylation but APOC3 and APOA5 showed variation in methylation in promoter and exonic regions. Glucokinase (GCK) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) were hyper methylated in the promoter. Genes involved in apoptosis (BAX/BCL2/AKT2) and inflammation (PHACTR1/LCK) also showed differential methylation between controls and CAD patients. A combined analysis of the methylated CpG sites using machine learning tool revealed 14 CpGs in 11 genes that could discriminate CAD cases from controls with over 93% accuracy.
   Conclusions: This study is unique because it highlights important gene methylation alterations which might predict the risk of young CAD in Indian population. Large scale studies in different populations would be important for validating our findings and understanding the epigenetic events associated with CAD.

AB  - Background Previous studies of expression profiles of major endometrial effectors of steroid physiology in endometriosis have yielded markedly conflicting conclusions, presumably because the relative effects of type of endometriosis, fertility history and menstrual cycle phases on the measured variables were not considered. In the present study, endometrial mRNA and protein levels of several effectors of steroid biosynthesis and action in patients with stage III-IV ovarian endometriosis (OE) with known fertility and menstrual cycle histories were compared with the levels in control endometrium to test this concept. Methods Endometrial samples were collected from patients without endometriosis (n = 32) or OE stages III-IV (n = 52) with known fertility and cycle histories. qRT-PCR and immunoblotting experiments were performed to measure levels of NR5A1, STAR, CYP19A1, HSD17Bs, ESRs and PGR transcripts and proteins, respectively. Tissue concentrations of steroids (P4, T, E1 and E2) were measured using ELISAs. Results The levels of expression of aromatase and ER beta were lower (P < 0.0001) and 17 beta-HSD1 (P < 0.0001) and PRA (P < 0.01) were higher in OE endometrium. Lower aromatase levels and higher 17 beta-HSD1 levels were detected in fertile (aromatase: P < 0.05; 17 beta-HSD1: P < 0.0001) and infertile (aromatase: P < 0.0001; 17 beta-HSD1: P < 0.0001) OE endometrium than in the matched control tissues. Both proliferative (PP) and secretory (SP) phase OE samples expressed aromatase (P < 0.0001) and ER beta (PP: P < 0.001; SP: P < 0.01) at lower levels and 17 beta-HSD1 (P < 0.0001) and PRA (PP: P < 0.01; SP: P < 0.0001) at higher levels than matched controls. Higher 17 beta-HSD1 (P < 0.01) and E2 (P < 0.05) levels and a lower (P < 0.01) PRB/PRA ratio was observed in infertile secretory phase OE endometrium than in control. Conclusions We report that dysregulated expression of 17 beta-HSD1 and PGR resulting in hyperestrogenism and progesterone resistance during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, rather than an anomaly in aromatase expression, was the hallmark of eutopic endometrium from infertile OE patients. Furthermore, the results provide proof of concept that the fertility and menstrual cycle histories exerted relatively different effects on steroid physiology in the endometrium from OE patients compared with the control subjects.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a chronic inflammatory and fibrotic disease of the pancreas with a prevalence of 42 to 73 per 100 000 adults in the United States.
   OBSERVATIONS Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of CP. Environmental factors associated with CP include alcohol abuse (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% CI, 1.87-5.14) for 5 or more drinks per day vs abstainers and light drinkers as well as smoking (OR, 4.59; 95% CI, 2.91-7.25) for more than 35 pack-years in a case-control study involving 971 participants. Between 28% to 80% of patients are classified as having "idiopathic CP." Up to 50% of these individuals have mutations of the trypsin inhibitor gene (SPINK1) or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Approximately 1% of people diagnosed with CP may have hereditary pancreatitis, associated with cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) gene mutations. Approximately 80% of people with CP present with recurrent or chronic upper abdominal pain. Long-term sequelae include diabetes in 38% to 40% and exocrine insufficiency in 30% to 48%. The diagnosis is based on pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and atrophy visualized by imaging with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both. Endoscopic ultrasound can assist in making the diagnosis in patients with a high index of suspicion such as recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis when imaging is normal or equivocal. The first line of therapy consists of advice to discontinue use of alcohol and smoking and taking analgesic agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and weak opioids such as tramadol). A trial of pancreatic enzymes and antioxidants (a combination of multivitamins, selenium, and methionine) can control symptoms in up to 50% of patients. Patients with pancreatic ductal obstruction due to stones, stricture, or both may benefit from ductal drainage via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgical drainage procedures, such as pancreaticojejunostomy with or without pancreatic head resection, which may provide better pain relief among people who do not respond to endoscopic therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Chronic pancreatitis often results in chronic abdominal pain and is most commonly caused by excessive alcohol use, smoking, or genetic mutations. Treatment consists primarily of alcohol and smoking cessation, pain control, replacement of pancreatic insufficiency, or mechanical drainage of obstructed pancreatic ducts for some patients.

AB  - Background: Adults in urban areas spend almost 77% of their waking time being inactive at workplaces, which leaves little time for physical activity. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize evidence for the effect of workplace physical activity interventions on the cardio-metabolic health markers (body weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipids and blood glucose) among working adults.
   Methods: All experimental studies up to March 2018, reporting cardio-metabolic worksite intervention outcomes among adult employees were identified from PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE CENTRAL, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess bias in studies. All studies were assessed qualitatively and meta-analysis was done where possible. Forest plots were generated for pooled estimates of each study outcome.
   Results: A total of 33 studies met the eligibility criteria and 24 were included in the meta-analysis. Multicomponent workplace interventions significantly reduced body weight (16 studies; mean diff: - 2.61 kg, 95% CI: - 3.89 to - 1.33) BMI (19 studies, mean diff: - 0.42 kg/m(2), 95% CI: - 0.69 to - 0.15) and waist circumference (13 studies; mean diff: - 1.92 cm, 95% CI: - 3.25 to - 0.60). Reduction in blood pressure, lipids and blood glucose was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Workplace interventions significantly reduced body weight, BMI and waist circumference. Non-significant results for biochemical markers could be due to them being secondary outcomes in most studies. Intervention acceptability and adherence, follow-up duration and exploring non-RCT designs are factors that need attention in future research.

AB  - Background: Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS) is a near fatal condition, except when the ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure is performed as rescue. After antenatal diagnosis of the condition, counseling regarding prognosis and outcome needs to be provided. Case: We describe here a case with CHAOS due to isolated fetal laryngeal atresia, presented at our center at 33-week gestation. After counseling regarding the uncertain outcome, consent for elective caesarean was not given. Intact cord resuscitation (ICR) was done as a rescue by a well-coordinated team during delivery. Tracheostomy was performed successfully under local anesthesia within five minutes, while the cord was still attached to the placenta. The baby had supraglottic stenosis on CT scan. Reconstructive surgery is planned after 8 months. The literature review showed 24 reports of 28 cases with intrinsic airway obstruction managed by EXIT, laryngeal atresia was the most common cause (18/28). The outcome was poor in tracheal agenesis (1/4 survived) whereas those having laryngeal web or small communication (4/4 survived) had better outcome. Tracheal reconstruction was done in 3/28 cases only. Conclusions: The case emphasizes that ICR and tracheostomy during vaginal delivery can rescue the baby. The literature reviewed provided insight into the outcome of CHAOS cases in world literature.

AB  - Aims: Recently, strategies of cancer treatment using combination of agents with distinct molecular mechanism (s) of action are considered more promising due to its high efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity. The study is aimed to improve the efficacy of selective estrogen receptor modulator, Centchroman (CC) by combination with the phytoestrogen Genistein (GN).
   Methods: Cytotoxicity was evaluated by Sulforhodamine B assay. Cell cycle analysis was done through flow cytometry. Further, Apoptosis was analyzed using Annexin V/PI staining, tunel assay and electron microscopic examination and verified using western blot analysis. In order to validate the in vitro results, in vivo analysis was performed using 4T1-syngeneic mouse model.
   Key findings: In this study, we report that the dietary isoflavone genistein (GN) synergistically improved anti-neoplasticity of CC in breast cancer by arresting cells at G2/M phase culminating in ROS dependent apoptosis. The combination of CC plus GN caused dysregulation of Bax and Bcl-2 ratio inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of Caspase-3/7, -9 and PARP cleavage. Further, combination significantly suppresses phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B, enhancing apoptosis. Additionally, combination markedly reduced tumor growth compared to CC and GN alone in mouse 4T1 breast tumor model.
   Significance: Together, these studies suggest that GN represents a potential adjunct molecule whose role in CC induced apoptosis deserves attention.

TI  - Genetic variations in olfactory receptor gene <i>OR2AG2</i> in a large multigenerational family with asthma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - ASSOCIATION
KW  - THRESHOLDS
AB  - It is estimated from twin studies that heritable factors account for at-least half of asthma-risk, of which genetic variants identified through population studies explain only a small fraction. Multi-generation large families with high asthma prevalence can serve as a model to identify highly penetrant genetic variants in closely related individuals that are missed by population studies. To achieve this, a four-generation Indian family with asthma was identified and recruited for examination and genetic testing. Twenty subjects representing all generations were selected for whole genome genotyping, of which eight were subjected to exome sequencing. Non-synonymous and deleterious variants, segregating with the affected individuals, were identified by exome sequencing. A prioritized deleterious missense common variant in the olfactory receptor gene OR2AG2 that segregated with a risk haplotype in asthma, was validated in an asthma cohort of different ethnicity. Phenotypic tests were conducted to verify expected deficits in terms of reduced ability to sense odors. Pathway-level relevance to asthma biology was tested in model systems and unrelated human lung samples. Our study suggests that OR2AG2 and other olfactory receptors may contribute to asthma pathophysiology. Genetic studies on large families of interest can lead to efficient discovery.

AB  - Background: The etiology of schizophrenia is extensively debated, and multiple factors have been contended to be involved. A panoramic view of the contributing factors in a genome-wide study can be an effective strategy to provide a comprehensive understanding of its causality. Materials and Methods: GSE53987 dataset downloaded from GEO-database, which comprised mRNA expression data of post-mortem brain tissue across three regions from control (C) and age-matched subjects (T) of schizophrenia (N = Hippocampus [HIP]: C-15, T-18, Prefrontal cortex [PFC]: C-15, T-19, Associative striatum [STR]: C-18, T-18). Bio-conductor-affy-package used to compute mRNA expression, and further t-test applied to investigate differential gene expression. The analysis of the derived genes performed using the PANTHER Classification System and NCBI database. Further, a protein interactome analysis of the derived gene set was performed using STRING v10 database (https://string-db.org/) Results: A set of 40 genes showed significantly altered (p < 0.01) expression across all three brain regions. The analyses unraveled genes implicated in biological processes and events, and molecular pathways relating basic neuronal functions. Conclusions: The aberrant expression of genes maintaining basic cell machinery explains compromised neuronal processing in SCZ.

AB  - Background Uncorrected refractive errors contribute enormously to the burden of avoidable visual impairment worldwide. There is a huge disparity in different parts of the globe in context to spectacle coverage for distance vision. This study was undertaken with objectives of determining prevalence of spectacle coverage, unmet needs and associated factors among adults in a rural community of north India. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out within selected clusters of Jhajjar district of Haryana. All participants aged > 15 years underwent visual acuity assessment by LogMAR "E" screening chart. Participants with presenting visual acuity < 6/12 in any eye and all current spectacle users underwent detailed ophthalmic examination and refraction. Additional details about spectacles, barriers for their use and willingness to pay for them were collected. Participants with met and unmet need for spectacle use at visual acuity > 6/12 was computed. These are reported as proportions with 95% confidence intervals. Associated factors with unmet need were determined using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 6910 participants were examined. The current spectacle use was 7.5% (95% Confidence Interval CI: 6.5, 8.7). The spectacle coverage was found in 33.3% (95% CI: 30.0, 36.7) participants among those in need. The unmet need was found in 10.8% of participants (95% CI: 10.1, 11.6). On multivariable analysis, odds of unmet need was associated with age, gender, level of education and marriage status. The most common barrier for refractive correction was lack of perceived need for refraction and its correction. Conclusion There is substantial unmet need for distance vision spectacles in this population. It is imperative that multi-component intervention be implemented to improve spectacle coverage in this rural north Indian setting.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important regulatory control in biological systems. Though the field of lncRNA has been progressing rapidly, a complete understanding of the role of lncRNAs in neuroblastoma pathogenesis is still lacking. To identify the abrogated lncRNAs in primary neuroblastoma and in the metastasized as well as the relapsed form of neuroblastoma, we analyzed an RNA-seq dataset on neuroblastoma that is available online to identify the lncRNAs that could potentially be contributing to the biology of neuroblastoma. The identified lncRNAs were further scrutinized using a publicly available epigenetic dataset of neuroblastoma and a cancer database. After this cross-sectional study, we were able to identify three significant lncRNAs, CASC15, PPP1R26-AS1, and USP3-AS1, which could serve as potential biomarkers in clinical studies of neuroblastoma pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: Serial lactate measurement is found to predict mortality in septic shock. Majority of patients with perforation peritonitis for emergency laparotomy are in sepsis and mortality rate is substantial. However, lactate dynamics has not been studied in this patient population.
   Methods: After institutional ethics clearance and informed written consent, 113 patients with suspected or proven perforation peritonitis presenting for emergency laparotomy were recruited in this prospective observational trial. Baseline Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI), SOFA and APACHE II score were calculated. Lactate values were obtained at baseline, immediate and 24-h postoperative period. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
   Results: Mortality was 15.04% at 28 days. Age, SOFA, qSOFA, APACHE, preoperative lactate, MPI and site of perforation were significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. Arterial lactate values at preoperative (cut off 2.75 mmol/L), immediate postoperative (cut off 2.8 mmol/L) and 24 h-postoperative period (cut off 2.45 mmol/L) independently predicted mortality at day 28. Combination of MPI and 24-h lactate value was best predictor of mortality with AUC 0.99.
   Conclusion: Preoperative, immediate postoperative and 24-h postoperative lactate value independently predict 28-day mortality in perforation peritonitis patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Combination of MPI and 24-h lactate value is the most accurate predictor of mortality.

AB  - Aqueous extract of the bark of Terminalia arjuna (TA) is used by a large population in the Indian subcontinent for treating various cardiovascular conditions. Animal experiments have shown its anti-atherogenic, anti-hypertensive, and anti-inflammatory effects. It has several bioactive ingredients with hemodynamic, ROS scavenging, and anti-inflammatory properties. Earlier we have done limited proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to show its efficacy in ameliorating cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol (ISO) in rats. In the present study we have used high-throughput sequencing of the mRNA from control and treated rat heart to further establish its efficacy. ISO (5 mg/kg/day s.c.) was administered in male adult rats for 14 days to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Standardized aqueous extract TA bark extract was administered orally. Total RNA were isolated from control, ISO, ISO + TA, and TA treated rat hearts and subjected to high throughput sequence analysis. The modulations of the transcript levels were then subjected to bio-informatics analyses using established software. Treatment with ISO downregulated 1,129 genes and upregulated 204 others. Pre-treatment with the TA bark extracts markedly restored that expression pattern with only 97 genes upregulated and 85 genes downregulated. The TA alone group had only 88 upregulated and 26 downregulated genes. The overall profile of expression in ISO + TA and TA alone groups closely matched with the control group. The genes that were modulated included those involved in metabolism, activation of receptors and cell signaling, and cardiovascular and other diseases. Networks associated with those genes included those involved in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, integrin binding, inflammation, drug metabolism, redox metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and organization of myofibril. Overlaying of the networks in ISO and ISO_TA group showed that those activated in ISO group were mostly absent in ISO_TA and TA group, suggesting a global effect of the TA extracts. This study for the first time reveals that TA partially or completely restores the gene regulatory network perturbed by ISO treatment in rat heart; signifying its efficacy in checking ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) represents a worldwide cause of mortality (it infects one third of the world's population) affecting mostly developing countries, including India, and recently also developed ones due to the increased mobility of the world population and the evolution of different new bacterial strains capable to provoke multidrug resistance phenomena. Currently, antitubercular drugs are unable to eradicate subpopulations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacilli and therapeutic vaccinations have been postulated to overcome some of the critical issues related to the increase of drug-resistant forms and the difficult clinical and public health management of tuberculosis patients. The Horizon 2020 EC funded project "In Silico Trial for Tuberculosis Vaccine Development" (STriTuVaD) to support the identification of new therapeutic interventions against tuberculosis through novel in silico modelling of human immune responses to disease and vaccines, thereby drastically reduce the cost of clinical trials in this critical sector of public healthcare.
   Results: We present the application of the Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) computational modeling infrastructure as a disease model for TB. The model is capable to simulate the main features and dynamics of the immune system activities i.e., the artificial immunity induced by RUTI (R) vaccine, a polyantigenic liposomal therapeutic vaccine made of fragments of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells (FCMtb). Based on the available data coming from phase II Clinical Trial in subjects with latent tuberculosis infection treated with RUTI (R) and isoniazid, we generated simulation scenarios through validated data in order to tune UISS accordingly to STriTuVaD objectives. The first case simulates the establishment of MTB latent chronic infection with some typical granuloma formation; the second scenario deals with a reactivation phase during latent chronic infection; the third represents the latent chronic disease infection scenario during RUTI (R) vaccine administration.
   Conclusions: The application of this computational modeling strategy helpfully contributes to simulate those mechanisms involved in the early stages and in the progression of tuberculosis infection and to predict how specific therapeutical strategies will act in this scenario. In view of these results, UISS owns the capacity to open the door for a prompt integration of in silico methods within the pipeline of clinical trials, supporting and guiding the testing of treatments in patients affected by tuberculosis.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex autoimmune disorder recently shown to be associated with SUMOylation, a post-translational modification mechanism. Here, we have identified a link between epithelial deSUMOylases and inflammation in IBD. DeSUMOylase SENP7 was seen to be upregulated specifically in intestinal epithelial cells in both human IBD and a mouse model. In steady state, but not IBD, SENP7 expression was negatively regulated by a direct interaction and ubiquitination by SIAH2. Upregulated SENP7 in inflamed tissue displayed a distinct interactome. These changes led to an expansion of localized proinflammatory gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, in vivo knockdown of SENP7 or depletion of gamma delta T cells abrogated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced gut inflammation. Strong statistical correlations between upregulated SENP7 and high clinical disease indices were observed in IBD patients. Overall, our data reveal that epithelial SENP7 is necessary and sufficient for controlling gut inflammation, thus highlighting its importance as a potential drug target.

AB  - The successful management of tuberculosis (TB) requires efficient diagnosis and treatment. Further, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant TB highlights the urgent need to develop novel inhibitors against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms of disease. Malate synthase (MS), an enzyme of the glyoxylate pathway, plays a vital role in mycobacterial persistence, and therefore it is considered as an attractive target for novel anti-TB drug development. Recent studies have also ascribed an adhesin function to MS and established it as a potent diagnostic biomarker. In this study, a panel of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) MS-specific single-stranded DNA aptamers was identified by Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX). The best-performing G-quadruplex-forming 44-mer aptamer, MS10, was optimized post-SELEX to generate an 11-mer aptamer, MS10-Trunc. This aptamer was characterized by various biochemical, biophysical, and in silico techniques. Its theranostic activity toward Mtb was established using enzyme inhibition, host cell binding, and invasion assays. MS10-Trunc aptamer exhibited high affinity for MS (equilibrium dissociation constant [K-D] similar to 19 pM) and displayed robust inhibition of MS enzyme activity with IC50 of 251.1 nM and inhibitor constant (K-i) of 230 nM. This aptamer blocked mycobacterial entry into host cells by binding to surface-associated MS. In addition, we have also demonstrated its application in the detection of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in patients with sensitivity and specificity each of >97%.

AB  - Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a pathogen recognition molecule associated with viral infection with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as its ligand. We evaluated the role of TLR3 in bacterial pneumonia using Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP). WT and TLR3(-/-) mice were subjected to a lethal model of KP. Alveolar macrophage polarization, bactericidal activity, and phagocytic capacity were compared. RNA-sequencing was performed on alveolar macrophages from the WT and TLR3(-/-) mice. Adoptive transfers of alveolar macrophages from TLR3(-/-) mice to WT mice with KP were evaluated for survival. Expression of TLR3 in postmortem human lung samples from patients who died from gram-negative pneumonia and pathological grading of pneumonitis was determined. Mortality was significantly lower in TLR3(-/-), and survival improved in WT mice following antibody neutralization of TLR3 and with TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor. Alveolar macrophages from TLR3(-/-) mice demonstrated increased bactericidal and phagocytic capacity. RNA-sequencing showed an increased production of chemokines in TLR3(-/-) mice. Adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages from the TLR3(-/-) mice restored the survival in WT mice. Human lung samples demonstrated a good correlation between the grade of pneumonitis and TLR3 expression. These data represent a paradigm shift in understanding the mechanistic role of TLR3 in bacterial pneumonia.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of nosocomial infections. This organism produces powerful toxins and cause superficial lesions, systemic infections, and several toxemic syndromes. A total of 109 S. aureus strains isolated from a variety of infections like ocular diseases, wound infection, and sputum were included in the study. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined against 8 antimicrobials. PCR determined the presence of 16S rRNA, nuc, mecA, czrC, qacA/B, pvl, and toxin genes in S. aureus isolates. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec, spa-, and agr-typing and serotyping determined the diversity among them. All isolates of S. aureus were resistant to two or more than two antibiotics and generated 32 resistance patterns. These isolates were positive for 16S rRNA and S. aureus-specific nuc gene, but showed variable results for mecA, czrC, and qacA/B and pvl genes. Of the 32 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 13 strains carried SCCmec type V, seven type IV, two type III, and nine carried unreported type UT6. Of the 109 strains, 98.2% were positive for hlg, 94.5% for hla, 86.2% for sei, 73.3% for efb, 70.6% for cna, 30.2% for sea, and 12.8% for sec genes. Serotypes VII and VI were prevalent among S. aureus strains. PFGE analysis grouped the 109 strains into 77 clusters. MLST classified the strains into 33 sequence types (ST) and eight clonal complexes (CCs) of which 12 were singletons, and two belong to new allelic profiles. Isolates showed 46 spa-types that included two new spa-types designated as t14911 and t14912. MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were diverse in terms of antibiotic resistance pattern, toxin genotypes, SCCmec types, serotypes and PFGE, MLST, and spa-types. However, few isolates from eye infection and wound infection belong to CC239, ST239, and spa-type t037/t657. The study thus suggests that S. aureus strains are multidrug resistant, virulent, and diverse irrespective of sources and place of isolation. These findings necessitate the continuous surveillance of multidrug-resistant and virulent S. aureus and monitoring of the transmission of infection.

AB  - Background: Early childhood caries (ECC) has reached epidemic proportions affecting millions of children worldwide. Its prevention becomes imperative owing to the significant morbidity and financial implications involved with its treatment. The Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), launched in India to provide mid-day meals, pre-school education and primary healthcare to children, can be utilised to counsel and deliver oral health education to mothers. The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of an oral health care package (OHCP) with usual care on the change in dental disease status among 1 to 3-year-old children at Anganwadi centres (AWC) in periurban areas of Chandigarh and rural areas of Cuttack, Orissa over a follow-up period of three years.
   Methods: Two geographically distant ICDS blocks would be selected at each of the two study sites and would be randomly allocated to intervention and control group. Closely located AWCs under each of the selected blocks shall constitute the study setting. OHCP would be delivered to the mothers of the 1-6-year-old children enrolled in the AWCs of the experimental group whereas mothers under control group would receive usual care advice available at the AWCs.
   Discussion: ECC prevention had conventionally focused upon testing effectiveness of programs targeting behaviour change among the caregivers and children, but surprisingly minimal efforts have been made to seek translation of these efforts into reduction of ECC at the community level. The present study has two components; testing effect of altering maternal and child behavioral aspects on ECC incidence through cohort follow up of 1-3-year-old children for three consecutive years and cross-sectional follow up of all available 1-6-year old children at the selected AWCs at regular intervals to look for change in prevalence of ECC at community level. In other regions of the world surveys of ECC prevalence before and after the intensive educational programs have shown a significant reduction in ECC prevalence. A similar decline can be anticipated through this program.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficiency of the polyaspartic acid- and acrylic acid-based superabsorbent polymer. The synthesized polymer was first investigated to check the blood compatibility by protein adsorption and blood clotting tests. Further, the GHK-Cu peptide was incorporated within the polymer and release studies were performed to evaluate the drug-delivery efficiency of the superabsorbent polymer. The polymer with best peptide release results were further used for in vivo analysis for wound healing. The healing efficiency of polymer with and without peptide was analyzed using wound closure, biochemical assay, histopathological, and toxicity studies.

AB  - Background Cure rates for children with cancer in India lag behind that of high-income countries. Various disease, treatment and socio-economic related factors contribute to this gap including barriers in timely access of diagnostic and therapeutic care. This study investigated barriers to accessing care from symptom onset to beginning of treatment, from perspectives of caregivers of children with cancer in India. Methods Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of children (< 18 years) diagnosed with cancer in seven tertiary care hospitals across New Delhi and Hyderabad. Purposive sampling to saturation was used to ensure adequate representation of the child's gender, age, cancer type, geographical location and socioeconomic status. Interviews were audio recorded after obtaining informed consent. Thematic content analysis was conducted and organised using NVivo 11. Results Thirty-nine caregivers were interviewed, where three key themes emerged from the narratives: time intervals to definitive diagnosis and treatment, the importance of social supportive care and the overall accumulative impacts of the journey. There were two phases encapsulating the experiences of the family: referral pathways taken to reach the hospital and after reaching the hospital. Most caregivers, especially those from distant geographical areas had variable and inconsistent referral pathways partly due to poor availability of specialist doctors and diagnostic facilities outside major cities, influence from family or friends, and long travel times. Upon reaching the hospital, families mostly from public hospitals faced challenges navigating the hospital facilities, finding accommodation, and comprehending the diagnosis and treatment pathway. Throughout both phases, financial constraint was a recurring issue amongst low-income families. The caregiver's knowledge and awareness of the disease and health system, religious and social factors were also common barriers. Conclusion This qualitative study highlights and explores some of the barriers to childhood cancer care in India. Our findings show that referral pathways are intrinsically linked to the treatment experience and there should be better recognition of the financial and emotional challenges faced by the family that occur prior to definitive diagnosis and treatment. This information would help inform various stakeholders and contribute to improved interventions addressing these barriers.

AB  - Non-operative management has become a norm in patients with liver trauma and operative management is guided by hemodynamic status. Introduction of haemodynamic status. Introduction of contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen has made NOM possible by helping in exclusion of other injuries and identification of vascular injuries. Haemodynamic instability is now considered as an only absolute indication for operative intervention in liver injuries. However, liver trauma is associated with a large number of complications in the form of perihepatic abscess, hepatic necrosis, bile leak, etc. Patient's undergoing operative intervention for liver trauma are more at risk for these complications. As such regular dynamic assessment is required for early identification and management of these complications. We present a case of a complex liver injury in a 27-year-old male who underwent operative intervention for liver trauma and had a varied number of liver trauma associated complications, with enterohepatic fistula as one of the rarest associated complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm may occur in the setting of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, or after anterior skull base surgery, but its occurrence is extremely rare in the background of glioma surgical resection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare case of symptomatic diffuse vasospasm, which is the fourth reported case of symptomatic vasospasm after temporal lobectomy and the third in the setting of a glial tumor. This patient, a 10-year-old boy, developed bilateral, progressive cerebral infarcts because of diffuse vasospasm after anteromesial temporal lobectomy for a left temporal ganglioglioma leading to significant morbidity.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors, likely pathogenesis and the importance of early diagnosis and timely institution of treatment, in such cases are discussed in the background of relevant literature. The current case represents the first report of symptomatic diffuse vasospasm occuring after surgical resection of intracranial ganglioglioma in the Western literature.

AB  - Aim To evaluate Ga-68-DOTANOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and I-131-meta-iodobenzylguanidine single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (131I-MIBG SPECT/CT) in patients with paragangliomas. including uncommon primaries.
   Methods Ninety patients were prospectively enrolled, and both scans were done within 2 weeks of each other. Lesions were grouped as Head/neck, abdominal, uncommon primary paraganglioma, and metastatic lesions. In most histopathology was used as reference standard.
   Results PET/CT had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 97%, 94%, 99%,88%,97% respectively on patient wise analysis (90) and 98%, 94%, 99%, 85% and 97% respectively on lesion wise analysis (149). Comparison with MIBG SPECT/CT: Significant difference in sensitivities noted (PET/CT-98%, I-131 MIBG -39%) (P< 0.001). however, no significant difference in specificities (94% and 100%, respectively). Group-wise analysis: Head/Neck: Significant difference noted between PET/CT (sensitivity 100%) and I-131 MIBG SPECT/CT (sensitivity 22%) (P= 0.001). Abdominal: No significant difference noted in sensitivities and specificities of PET/CT and I-131 MIBG SPECT/CT. Uncommon paraganglioma: PET/CT detected 10 of 11, while I-131 MIBG detected only 2 of 11 uncommon paraganglioma. Metastatic sites: Significant difference noted between PET/CT (sensitivity 97%) and I-131 MIBG SPECT/CT (sensitivity 33%) (P< 0.0001).
   Conclusion The study demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy of Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT and superiority over I-131 MIBG SPECT/CT for evaluation of extra-adrenal paraganglioma. The current diagnostic role of I-131 MIBG seems limited to abdominal paragangliomas and for theranostic purpose. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) is a major public health problem in India. We conducted this study to assess goitre prevalence, urinary iodine excretion (UIE) among school children and to determine iodine concentration in salt samples at consumer level, in Jabalpur district. We adopted "30 cluster" sampling, recommended by joint WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD Consultation. A total of 2700 children were examined and 540 salt samples and 267 urine samples were collected. Also 150 households and 30 shopkeepers were interviewed for awareness about salt iodization. Total goitre prevalence rate was 2.2% with median UIE level as 218 mu g/l and 19.1% of population had adequate iodine intake. About 90.6% of studied population consumed adequately iodized salt. Jabalpur is now no more an endemic area for goitre. The district has achieved the target of universal salt iodization (USI) but now proceeding towards toxicity. Hence the concern is the need of sustainability of the policy of USI.

AB  - Brimonidine, an anti-glaucoma medicine, acts as an adrenergic agonist which decreases the synthesis of aqueous humour and increases the amount of drainage through Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork, but shows dose-dependent (0.2% solution thrice daily) toxicity. To reduce the side effects and improve the efficacy, brimonidine was nanoencapsulated on ultra-small-sized chitosan nanoparticles (nanobrimonidine) (28 +/- 4 nm) with 39% encapsulation efficiency, monodispersity, freeze-thawing capability, storage stability, and 2% drug loading capacity. This nanocomplex showed burst, half, and complete release at 0.5, 45, and 100 h, respectively. Nanobrimonidine did not show any in vitro toxicity and was taken up by caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The nanobrimonidine-treated trabeculectomy tissue of glaucoma patients showed better dilation of the trabecular meshwork under the electron microscope. This is direct evidence for better bioavailability of nanobrimonidine after topical administration. Thus, the developed nanobrimonidine has the potential to improve the efficacy, reduce dosage and frequency, and improve delivery to the anterior chamber of the eye.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the phases of the menstrual cycle in the reproductive age group of females who committed suicide as compared with a control group of females who died from causes other than suicide. The study included 86 cases in the suicidal group and 80 cases in the non-suicidal group. The menstrual phase was decided by the gross and histological examination of the uterus and ovary at autopsy. Deaths were more common during the secretory phase (56.9%) in the suicidal group, while in the non-suicidal group, death occurred more commonly in the proliferative phase (66.3%). In reference to proliferative phase, deaths were more in the secretory phase and menstrual phase in the suicidal group, adjusted odd's ratio (OR) being 3.7 (p = 0.042) and 4.7 (p = 0.032), respectively. Corpus luteum was present in the right ovary of 43 and 14 victims of suicidal and non-suicidal deaths, respectively, while it was in the left ovary of 3 and 11 victims of suicidal and non-suicidal death, respectively. Odd's ratio was 10.3 for corpus luteum to be in the right ovary in comparison with the left ovary for the suicidal group (p = 0.001). This study revealed that suicidal chances in a woman are significantly more in the menstrual phase and the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. The presence of corpus luteum in the right ovary is associated with an increased risk of suicide, but the reason is not known.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Ischemic stroke (IS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) share common risk factors and one may be the harbinger of the other. We aimed to study prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic CAD in a cohort of consecutive patients with IS and assess its relationship with intracranial and extracranial large artery cerebrovascular disease (LAD). Methods: All consecutive eligible IS and Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) patients were recruited into the study. Both clinically suspected and asymptomatic patients (N = 259) underwent myocardial Stress-rest Gated Technetium-99m (Tc99m) MIBI Myocardial Perfusion SPECT scan performed on a dual head SPECT-CT to estimate evidence of myocardial ischemia. Results: Three hundred patients completed the study. Forty one patients were previously diagnosed cases of definitive CAD. Twelve patients were clinically suspected to have CAD and 247 patients were asymptomatic. Among these, 12 patients (4.81%) had a positive SPECT. The overall prevalence of CAD was 17.67% (n = 53). Presence of diabetes was an independent predictor of CAD (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07-3.67. P .02). No significant association was found between the presence of LAD and CAD in all subgroup comparisons. However, there was a suggestion of higher LAD among patients with known CAD compared with others. Conclusions: CAD is prevalent in patients with ischemic stroke. No definitive relationship was found between CAD and intracranial or extracranial LAD. Population based stratification tools are needed to further assess the need to detect subclinical CAD in patients with stroke.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic cystic neoplasms remain uncommon. Although data are accumulating on the incidence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms in the published literature, Indian data on these tumors are sparse.
   Material and Methods: We collated data from prospectively maintained databases of patients operated for cystic tumors of the pancreas from 2007 to 2016 at 7 academic centers across India to gain insights into clinical presentation and outcome of the operative treatment of these tumors. Data were compared with large series across the world to understand the regional differences in this pathology.
   Results: Of the 423 patients, there were 98 (23.2%) serous cystic neoplasms, 128 (30.2%) mucinous neoplasms, 34(8%) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and 121 (28.6%) solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasms managed in these 7 academic centers. Malignancy (adenocarcinoma, malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) was reported in 39 (9.2%) patients. Median age at presentation was 41 years, and the female-to-male ratio was 3.4:1. At presentation, 81% of patients were symptomatic. A total of 66.7% of lesions were located in body and tail region of the pancreas. Median tumor size was 6 cm. Operative resection with curative intent was performed in 405 of these 423 patients. Major morbidity occurred in 12%, and 30-day perioperative mortality was 0.9%. Laparoscopic resections were performed in 18% and spleen-preserving resections were performed in 3% of patients.
   Conclusion: Female preponderance, young age, and a benign nature of most pancreatic cystic neoplasms were observed. Large size of tumors on presentation, fewer intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm resections, and a much greater incidence of solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasms were distinctive of this study. Although the proportion of laparoscopic resections and splenic preservation was less compared with Western centers, the perioperative morbidity and mortality was on par with established standards.

AB  - Objective: The present study aims to detect the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in ocular malignant tumours, including retinoblastoma, eyelid squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC), in the North Indian population.
   Design: Prospective observational non randomized study.
   Participants: In this study, 142 prospective cases of ocular malignant tumours (retinoblastoma, SGC, and SCC) were included.
   Methods: HPV was detected by multiplex PCR using PGMY09/11 primers in 142 patients with ocular malignancies. This was followed by genotyping using linear array (reverse hybridization).
   Results: Of the 142 tumours studied, 72 were retinoblastoma, 30 SGC, and 40 SCC. The HPV genome was detected in 2.8% (4 of 142) of cases by multiplex PCR; all positive cases (4 of 40) were SCC. Genotyping revealed that all positives belonged to the high-risk HPV16 genotype. HPV-positive SCC patients had better disease-free survival. Retinoblastoma and SGC cases were negative for HPV.
   Conclusions: Low prevalence of HPV in ocular malignancies was observed in this study. The HPV genome was detected only in ocular squamous cell carcinoma cases and these patients were associated with better prognosis. HPV may not have a role in retinoblastoma and SGC in the North Indian population.

AB  - Layered double hydroxides (LDH) also known as hydrotalcite-like compounds that represent a broad class of lamellar basic inorganic compound possessing high capacity for anion intercalation. In this work, Mn/TiLDH has been synthesized through a single step hydrothermal route using commercially available Mn(NO3)(2 center dot)4H(2)O, TiCl4 and urea for investigation into the morphological and electron transport properties. The structural aspects and electron transport within the Mn/Ti LDH, has been investigated through a combinatorial approach of co-relating the experimental results with theoretical studies. The data mined crystal structure of the material, has been presented after comparison of the experimental XRD with the data mined XRD parameters. The characterizations suggest the material to possess crystallinity, layered structure, hexagonal morphology, good potentiodynamic electrochemical response, narrow multiple direct band gaps. The multiple narrow band gaps and electron transport properties could be evident through the UV-visible DRS and cyclic voltammetry analyses of the material. In order to theoretically establish electron transport, the experimental values of band gaps and xi-potential results have been incorporated into the expression for the conduction-band energy (E-c) for generating the density patterns of the LDH through Monte Carlo simulations. Fermi-Dirac statistics presented the probability of transfer of electrons from VB to CB at different temperatures and for given energies for Mn/Ti LDH material. This work emphasized on the methodological advances associated with the structural and electron transport aspects of Mn/Ti LDH.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) features of regressed macular retinoblastoma (RB). Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out in 13 patients with regressed macular RB with good fixation in at least one eye. Fundus photography and SS-OCT were documented. High-resolution scans with good signal strength were selected. The types of clinical regression and SS-OCT characteristics of the regressed lesions (presence of vitreous detachment, intratumor schisis/cavitation, calcification, foveal dip, and OCT pattern) were noted. Results: Of the 13 eyes, 7 (53%) were group B, 4 (30%) were group C, and 2 (17%) were group D. Lesion involving fovea was seen in seven eyes (53%). On SS-OCT, the lesion was isodense to hyperdense in all cases. Three patterns of regressed RB were noted on OCT. Intralesion calcification was noted in eight cases. Subretinal fluid was not detected in any of the cases. Conclusion: SS-OCT is a useful technology to image and analyze cases of regressed macular RB including large lesions. SS-OCT system helps in successful imaging even in smaller children.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS
KW  - HEALTH
AB  - Objective: To identify enablers and barriers related to home Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) adoption after hospital discharge.
   Study design: An exploratory study, using a mixed methods evaluation, followed 60 mother-infant dyads from the hospital ward to 4 weeks post-hospital discharge.
   Results: Fifty-three of the mothers (88.3%) completed all study visits. The majority of mothers were breastfeeding and practicing skin-to-skin contact 4 weeks post-discharge. Seven mothers (13.2%) discontinued skin-to-skin contact at 4 weeks. KMC was practiced on average 3.3 h/day and 5.1 days/week. The top two enablers reported were significantly related to the amount of time skin-to-skin was practiced, with support for household responsibilities being most significant (U = 195, p = 0.008). Lack of privacy (p = 0.002) and lack of motivation (p = 0.034) were negatively correlated to duration of skin-to-skin contact.
   Conclusion: Future programs may increase dissemination and adoption of home KMC by specifically addressing enablers and barriers correlated to duration of skin-to-skin contact.

AB  - Question Is dabigatran etexilate or dose-adjusted warfarin efficacious and safe to use in preventing the recurrence of venous thrombotic events among patients with cerebral venous thrombosis? Findings In this exploratory randomized, open-label clinical trial of 120 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis, no recurrent venous thrombotic events were observed in patients randomized to either the dabigatran or warfarin treatment group; 1 major bleeding event was recorded among users of dabigatran and 2 among users of warfarin. Meaning This study suggests that both dabigatran and dose-adjusted warfarin may be safe options to prevent recurrent venous thrombotic events in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis.
   This randomized clinical trial conducted in 9 countries compares the use of dabigatran with warfarin in stroke prevention among patients who just experienced cerebral venous thrombosis.
   Importance Patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are at risk of recurrent venous thrombotic events (VTEs). Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants have not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials in CVT. Objective To compare the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate with those of dose-adjusted warfarin in preventing recurrent VTEs in patients who have experienced a CVT. Design, Setting, and Participants RE-SPECT CVT is an exploratory, prospective, randomized (1:1), parallel-group, open-label, multicenter clinical trial with blinded end-point adjudication (PROBE design). It was performed from December 21, 2016, to June 22, 2018, with a follow-up of 25 weeks, at 51 tertiary sites in 9 countries (France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, and Spain). Adult consecutive patients with acute CVT, who were stable after 5 to 15 days of treatment with parenteral heparin, were screened for eligibility. Patients with CVT associated with central nervous system infection or major trauma were excluded, but those with intracranial hemorrhage from index CVT were allowed to participate. After exclusions, 120 patients were randomized. Data were analyzed following the intention-to-treat approach. Interventions Dabigatran, 150 mg twice daily, or dose-adjusted warfarin for a treatment period of 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was a composite of patients with a new VTE (recurrent CVT, deep vein thrombosis of any limb, pulmonary embolism, and splanchnic vein thrombosis) or major bleeding during the study period. Secondary outcomes were cerebral venous recanalization and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. Results In total, 120 patients with CVT were randomized to the 2 treatment groups (60 to dabigatran and 60 to dose-adjusted warfarin). Of the randomized patients, the mean (SD) age was 45.2 (13.8) years, and 66 (55.0%) were women. The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 22.3 (6.16) weeks for the dabigatran group and 23.0 (5.20) weeks for the warfarin group. No recurrent VTEs were observed. One (1.7%; 95% CI, 0.0-8.9) major bleeding event (intestinal) was recorded in the dabigatran group, and 2 (3.3%; 95% CI, 0.4-11.5) (intracranial) in the warfarin group. One additional patient (1.7; 95% CI, 0.0-8.9) in the warfarin group experienced a clinically relevant non-major bleeding event. Recanalization occurred in 33 patients in the dabigatran group (60.0%; 95% CI, 45.9-73.0) and in 35 patients in the warfarin group (67.3%; 95% CI, 52.9-79.7). Conclusions and Relevance This trial found that patients who had CVT anticoagulated with either dabigatran or warfarin had low risk of recurrent VTEs, and the risk of bleeding was similar with both medications, suggesting that both dabigatran and warfarin may be safe and effective for preventing recurrent VTEs in patients with CVT.

AB  - Background Understanding the patterns of HIV/AIDS epidemics is crucial to tracking and monitoring the progress of prevention and control efforts in countries. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, mortality, and coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 1980-2017 and forecast these estimates to 2030 for 195 countries and territories.
   Methods We determined a modelling strategy for each country on the basis of the availability and quality of data. For countries and territories with data from population-based seroprevalence surveys or antenatal care clinics, we estimated prevalence and incidence using an open-source version of the Estimation and Projection Package-a natural history model originally developed by the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling, and Projections. For countries with cause-specific vital registration data, we corrected data for garbage coding (ie, deaths coded to an intermediate, immediate, or poorly defined cause) and HIV misclassification. We developed a process of cohort incidence bias adjustment to use information on survival and deaths recorded in vital registration to back-calculate HIV incidence. For countries without any representative data on HIV, we produced incidence estimates by pulling information from observed bias in the geographical region. We used a re-coded version of the Spectrum model (a cohort component model that uses rates of disease progression and HIV mortality on and off ART) to produce age-sex-specific incidence, prevalence, and mortality, and treatment coverage results for all countries, and forecast these measures to 2030 using Spectrum with inputs that were extended on the basis of past trends in treatment scale-up and new infections.
   Findings Global HIV mortality peaked in 2006 with 1.95 million deaths (95% uncertainty interval 1.87-2.04) and has since decreased to 0.95 million deaths (0.91-1.01) in 2017. New cases of HIV globally peaked in 1999 (3.16 million, 2.79-3.67) and since then have gradually decreased to 1.94 million (1.63-2.29) in 2017. These trends, along with ART scale-up, have globally resulted in increased prevalence, with 36.8 million (34.8-39.2) people living with HIV in 2017. Prevalence of HIV was highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2017, and countries in the region had ART coverage ranging from 65.7% in Lesotho to 85.7% in eSwatini. Our forecasts showed that 54 countries will meet the UNAIDS target of 81% ART coverage by 2020 and 12 countries are on track to meet 90% ART coverage by 2030. Forecasted results estimate that few countries will meet the UNAIDS 2020 and 2030 mortality and incidence targets.
   Interpretation Despite progress in reducing HIV-related mortality over the past decade, slow decreases in incidence, combined with the current context of stagnated funding for related interventions, mean that many countries are not on track to reach the 2020 and 2030 global targets for reduction in incidence and mortality. With a growing population of people living with HIV, it will continue to be a major threat to public health for years to come. The pace of progress needs to be hastened by continuing to expand access to ART and increasing investments in proven HIV prevention initiatives that can be scaled up to have population-level impact.

AB  - We report a rare case of post-traumatic cutaneous diphtheria in a patient referred from a hospital in rural India. The diagnosis of cutaneous diphtheria was confirmed by the isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae cultured from the ulcer of the leg, along with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. The patient was kept on isolation and treated with erythromycin for 14 days without antitoxin. He was discharged when his subsequent cultures turned out to be negative. Chemoprophylaxis was also given to his family members. Such a case highlights the revisiting of vaccination strategies and the role of cutaneous carriers in transmission of this deadly disease.

AB  - Objectives To compare propofol and fentanyl to induce conscious sedation in children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy. Study design Randomized controlled trial. Setting Pediatric Pulmonology division at a tertiary care center in Delhi, India. Participants Children aged 3-15 years who underwent flexible bronchoscopy. Intervention Children received either intravenous propofol 1 mg/kg administered as a slow bolus over 1 minute followed by 2 mg/kg/hour infusion, or intravenous Fentanyl 2 mu g/kg administered as a slow bolus over one minute. Outcomes Primary outcome was time to achieve conscious sedation (Ramsay score 3). Secondary outcomes were need for adjuvant midazolam, physician satisfaction, level of cough, recovery features, and side-effects in the groups. Results 53 children (propofol 27, fentanyl 26) were enrolled in the study. The mean (SD) time taken to achieve Ramsay score 03 was lower in propofol than fentanyl [15.7 (4.4) s vs 206 (55) s, P<0.001]. Propofol arm had significantly higher physician satisfaction, less requirement of adjuvant midazolam, less coughing and faster regain of full consciousness. There was no difference in drug side-effects between the groups. Conclusion Propofol has a shorter sedation induction time, less coughing during procedure, less recovery time, and better physician satisfaction compared to fentanyl for flexible bronchoscopy in children.

AB  - Background: Previous epidemiological studies, largely conducted in high-income countries and cross-sectional, have suggested a relatively strong association between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and type 2 diabetes. DDT is widely used in India and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes there is increasing, but the association between these factors has not been explored to date.
   Objective: The objective was to estimate the association of the p,p' isomer of DDE with incident type 2 diabetes in India.
   Methods: A nested case-control study was conducted in a representative prospective cohort of adults from two cities in India. Participants were enrolled in 2010-11 (n=12,271) and followed for annual assessment of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes. Baseline plasma samples from incident cases of diabetes (n=193) and sex-city-matched controls (n=323) were selected for analysis of p,p-DDE. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: At baseline, cases had higher p,p-DDE concentrations: geometric mean (95% CI) 330 (273-399) ng/g lipid compared to 223 (189-262) ng/g lipid among controls. Delhi participants had higher p,p-DDE concentrations: 579 (521-643) ng/g lipid compared to 122 (102-145) ng/g lipid in Chennai. In unadjusted models, being in the highest versus lowest quartile of p,p-DDE was associated with a more than doubling of the odds of diabetes: unadjusted OR (95% CI), 2.30 (1.19, 4.43). However, this effect was no longer significant after adjustment for age: adjusted (95% CI), 0.97 (0.46, 2.06).
   Discussion: Results suggest that levels of p,p'-DDE in Delhi are exceptionally high, but we did not observe a significant association between p,p-DDE and incident type 2 diabetes. As this is the first study to evaluate this association in India, more studies are needed to inform our understanding of the association in this context, including potential routes of exposure.

AB  - With advances in therapeutic methods, there is a high survival rate among leukemia patients, of an extent more than 80%. However, chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat these patients have adverse effects on their overall health profile including fertility. The primary aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed proteins in seminal plasma of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors compared to age-matched healthy controls, which can provide molecular basis of idiopathic infertility in such survivors. Differential proteome profiling was performed by 2D-differential in-gel electrophoresis, protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry and selective differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated by western blotting and ELISA method. Out of eight DEPs identified, five proteins (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, semenogelin 1, lactoferrin, prolactin-inducible protein, and human serum albumin) were upregulated and three (pepsinogen, prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase) were downregulated. Expression profiles of these proteins are suggestive of reduction in semen quality in ALL survivors and can further be explored to determine their fertility status.

AB  - Background: Genomic studies have delineated distinct molecular subgroups of urothelial carcinomas whose prognostic impact extends beyond traditional stage and grade groupings. The 'basal' subgroup shows increased gene expression levels of KRT5, KRT6, and KRT14 and low expression levels of GATA binding protein 3, and is associated with an extremely poor outcome. Identification of this subset is necessary for improved patient management and research on targeted therapies. We aimed to assess the prognostic utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for basal markers: cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and 14 (CK14), and luminal markers: cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and Gata3 in muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas (MIBC).
   Materials and methods: Study was of retrospective design (2014-2017). All chemotherapy na ve patients of MIBC undergoing radical cystectomy were included. IHC was performed on formalin fixed paraffin-embedded whole tumor sections.
   Results: Among 40 cases of MIBC included, 45% (18/40) were positive for one or both basal markers, 37.5% (15/40) were positive for one or both luminal markers, while 15% (6/40) were positive for both basal and luminal markers. One case did not express any of the four markers. MIBCs expressing only basal markers presented at an advanced stage with frequent squamous differentiation and showed a trend towards shorter overall survival. Gata3+ MIBCs showed the best outcome irrespective of expression of other markers, while CK14 + / Gata3- MIBCs were associated with worst outcomes. Gata3-/CK14- MIBCs showed intermediate survival outcomes. CK5/6, CK20 and p53 expression did not significantly correlate with outcome.
   Conclusion: IHC for Gata-3 and CK14 stratified MIBC into distinct prognostic subsets.

KW  - PD-L1
KW  - sebaceous gland carcinoma

AB  - Purpose: Eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) is an aggressive but rare malignancy of ocular region. Over-expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 has been demonstrated in a variety of solid tumors including conjunctival melanoma. PD-L1 is an immunoinhibitory molecule that suppresses the effective T cells response against tumor antigen leading to the progression of tumors. Inhibitors of the interaction of PD-L1 and PD-1 are associated with good clinical response various carcinomas. The prognostic value of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in SGC remains unexplored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate expressions of PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 in SGC and correlate its expression with clinicopathological features and patients survival. Methods: The immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 was evaluated in 30 SGC cases. Results: PD-L1 immunopositivity was detected in 41.9% of the SGC cases. PD-1 expression in tumor infiltrative lymphocytes (TILs) was observed in 53.3% samples. Tumor PD-L1 positivity, PD-1 expression in TILs and tumor size (>10 mm) was associated with reduced disease-free survival. On multivariate analysis only tumor size (>10 mm) and a combined positivity of PD-L1 in tumor cells and PD-1 in TILs with an odds ratio of 5.212 (95% confidence interval 1.449-18.737) continued to be signi.cantly associated with SGC recurrence. Conclusion: PD-L1 is overexpressed in 50% of SGC cases. The combined tumor PD-L1 positivity and TILs showing PD-1 expression within the same SGC patient's samples predict high-risk SGC, suggesting that the up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells and PD-1 positivity within the same SGC patient may aggravate tumor recurrence.

Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein is an activator of DNA damage response and its role in uveal melanoma (UM) is still unexplored. Therefore, the study aims to detect the expression and localization of ATM protein and its association with clinicopathological parameters Methods Expression of nuclear ATM (nATM) was investigated on 69 formalin fixed paraffin embedded choroidal melanoma samples by immunohistochemistry and validated by western blotting. Results were then correlated with clinical and histopathological parameters. Prognostic significance was determined by the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the multivariate analysis by Cox's hazard proportional method. Results Loss of nATM was observed in 65% of cases, which was statistically significant with the reduced disease-free survival (p = 0.042). This loss was more frequently found in cases with high-risk histopathological factors like epithelioid cell type, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and high pigmentation which might help in the progression of melanoma. On multivariate analysis, extraocular spread and loss of nATM were found to be independent prognostic factors (p < 0.05). Conclusion Our data suggest that loss of nATM protein might serve as a poor prognostic marker in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma which may lead to increased risk of metastasis.

AB  - Phyllodes tumor of the breast is a rare mixed tumor of epithelial and mesenchymal origin with an incidence of less than 1% of all primary breast tumors. This tumor is well known for its high potential for local recurrence ranging in 8-40% of patients. Excision of tumor with a 2-cm margin without raising skin flap along with overlying skin and underlying part of pectoralis major muscle described by our team seems to be a guarantee against local recurrence. It was a prospective cohort study conducted at the Department of Surgical Disciplines, AIIMS, New Delhi, India, from March 2011 to December 2016. Patients with large phyllodes tumor were managed with a "radical mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection" whereas women with a small lesion were treated with a wide local excision with a 2-cm margin of healthy breast tissue all around the lesion following our surgical technique. Sixty-one women were enrolled in this study. Twenty-nine patients underwent wide local excision, and 32 patients with large, recurrent, or malignant tumors were managed by radical mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (27 patients) and with ALND in 5 patients with enlarged axillary nodes. None of the patients have developed local recurrence till date with a follow-up period ranging from 2 to 59 months. Excision of tumor with a 2-cm margin without raising skin flap along with overlying skin and underlying part of pectoralis major muscle is a very effective technique to prevent local recurrence.

AB  - Enteric fever is one of the leading causes of infection and subsequent fatality (greater than 1.8 million) (WHO 2018), especially in the developing countries due to contaminated water and food inter twinned with unhygienic practices. Clinical gold standard technique of culture-based method followed by biochemical tests demand 72+ hours for diagnosis while newly developed techniques (like PCR, RT-PCR, DNA microarray etc.) suffer from high limit of detection or involve high-cost infrastructure or both. In this work, a quick and highly specific method, SMOL was established for simultaneous detection of Salmonella paratyphi A and Salmonella typhi in clinical blood samples. SMOL consists of (i) pre-concentration of S. typhi and S. paratyphi A cells using magnetic nanoparticles followed by (ii) cell lysis and DNA extraction (iii) amplification of select nucleic acids by LAMP technique and (iv) detection of amplified nucleic acids using an affordable portable device (costs less than $70). To identify the viability of target cells at lower concentrations, the samples were processed at two different time periods of t = 0 and t = 4 h. Primers specific for the SPA2539 gene in S. paratyphi A and STY2879 gene in S. typhi were used for LAMP. Within 6 h SMOL was able to detect positive and negative samples from 55 human clinical blood culture samples and detect the viability of the cells. The results were concordant with culture and biochemical tests as well as by qPCR. Statistical power analysis yielded 100%. SMOL results were concordant with culture and biochemical tests as well as by qPCR. The sensitive and affordable system SMOL will be effective for poor resource settings.

AB  - Background Whether online resources can facilitate spread of palliative care knowledge and skills in India is an urgent question given few providers and a large, ageing population.
   Objectives We surveyed needs and feasibility regarding e-learning.
   Methods Indian, Australian and North American palliative care experts developed an electronic survey using Qualtrics, emailed to all registrants of the 2017 Indian Association of Palliative Care (IAPC) conference and distributed during the conference.
   Results Of 60 respondents (66% men, 60% doctors), most worked in hospitals and had oncology backgrounds, and 35% were from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Most (90.9%) received palliative care training in India or overseas with 41% trained in a Trivandrum Institute of Palliative Sciences residential course (4-6 weeks). 17% completed the IAPC essential certificate and 22% had undertaken various distance learning courses. Interest in online training was substantial for most aspects of palliative care.
   Conclusion There was a high level of interest and reported feasibility in taking a case-based online course. This pilot survey provides support for online case-based education in India, particularly among physicians.

AB  - Background: Due to low predictive values of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening tools, there is a need for biomarker for screening of OSA patients at an early stage. The aim of the study was to evaluate differentially expressed proteins in blood and urine samples of OSA patients.
   Methods: In this study, we used isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) based proteomics approach to identify differentially expressed proteins, which were subsequently verified and validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in adult OSA patients.
   Results: Seventeen differentially expressed proteins were selected from iTRAQ data for verification, based on their clinical significance and reproducibility among different iTRAQ experiment sets. Five of these proteins (plasma = 2; urine = 3) were further validated in plasma (non-OSA = 42; OSA = 198) and urine samples (non-OSA = 46; OSA = 197). ROC curve analysis for all OSA vs. non-OSA subjects ensured optimal diagnostic utility of two urinary proteins: Endothelial protein c receptor (EPCR) (AUC = 73%, cut-off: 35 pg/ml) and dermcidin (AUC = 74%, cut-off: 4.6 pg/ml). For severe OSA, diagnostic accuracy significantly improved with AUC as 88% and 82% for EPCR (cut-off: 46 pg/ml) and dermcidin (cut-off: 5.2 pg/ml) respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of combined performance of both urinary proteins for severe OSA were 94% and 91% respectively.
   Conclusion: In this study, urinary EPCR and dermcidin emerged as novel biomarkers for screening severe OSA patients. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Apart from their established role in embryonic development, neurotrophins (NTs) have diverse functions in the nervous system. Their role in the integration of physiological and biochemical aspects of the nervous system is currently attracting much attention. Based on a systematic analysis of the literature, we here propose a new paradigm that, by exploiting a novel role of NTs, may help explain the genesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders, opening new avenues for better management of the same. We hypothesize that NTs as an integrated network play a crucial role in maintaining an indivdual's psychological wellbeing. Given the evidence that stress can induce chronic disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which, in turn, is causally linked to several psychiatric disorders, this function may be mediated through the homeostatic mechanisms governing regulation of this axis. In fact, NTs, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known to participate in neuroendocrine regulation. Recent studies suggest epigenetic modification of NT-HPA axis interplay in the precipitation of psychiatric disorders. Our article highlights why this new knowledge regarding NTs should be considered in the etiogenesis and treatment of stress-induced psychopathology.

AB  - Purpose: Retinal hemangioblastomas (RHs) are characteristic of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Early diagnosis of retinal lesions may aid in systemic diagnosis. Early identification of VHL is life-saving and also prevents vision loss. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of RHs. The aim of this study is to report FFA features of RH using ultra-widefield (UWF) imaging. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study of consecutive patients of RH who underwent UWF FFA at a tertiary eye care center. Images were analyzed and assessed by authors. The main outcome measures were (a) the number and size of RH in each eye and (b) vascular characteristics of the retina. UWF-FFA characteristics in each eye were tabulated. The number of clock hours involved by these characteristics and their correlation with the number and size of RH were analyzed. Results: The study evaluated 24 eyes of 13 patients. The mean age was 28.4 years. The median number of RHs in an eye was 3.5 (range 1-16), and the size of RHs varied from 0.1 to 4 disc diameters. Novel UWF-FFA findings noted in this study were the presence of abnormal capillary network in 22 of 24 eyes (91.7%), capillary leakage in 15 of 24 eyes (62.5%), and capillary telangiectasia in 7 of 24 eyes (29.2%). In addition, feeder arterioles and venules showed bulbous projections in 8 of 24 eyes (33.3%). Conclusion: The UWF-FFA characteristics of RH, which have not been described before, were identified. These add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and may pave the way for future therapeutic targets.

AB  - A large section of cellular proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems have oligomeric property. Intently, oligomerization of protein is an invaluable phenomenon from the point of view of protein evolution. This review comprises an overview on modulation of protein oligomerization. The comprehensive modulation of protein oligomerization can be supportive for effective drug designing in the future. The common mechanisms of protein oligomerization are domain swapping and ligand induced dimerization. Infrequent mechanism of protein oligomerization involves point mutations at the dimer interface, post-translational modification and insertion/deletion at the interface. Predominantly, ligand induced oligomerization is the most useful method to regulate the protein oligomerization that can act as a modulator. Thus, functional modulation of oligomeric proteins can be done, both in-vitro and in-vivo, using various artificial and natural modulators, respectively. Though, the biophysical methods, like microscopy and spectroscopy, have strong potential to characterize the oligomeric proteins. Oligomeric proteins can be characterized biochemically too. Hence, this review illustrates the regulation of protein oligomerization using several modulators, in the future, these can be used for effective drug designing to cure several diseases associated with oligomeric proteins.

AB  - Purpose To determine the effect of intravitreal silicone oil (SO) on multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and the changes in mfERG following SO removal.
   Methods Twelve eyes of 12 patients with SO in vitreous cavity with corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) > 20/200 were prospectively enrolled as cases over a period from July 2016 to June 2018. The fellow normal eyes served as control. The eyes were evaluated with P1 and N1 wave amplitude and implicit time on mfERG at baseline, 1 and 4 weeks after SO removal.
   Results The mean age was 44.9 +/- 18.9 (range 18-74) years. The indication for SO injection was retinal detachment (n = 9, three macula-on eyes, six macula-off eyes) and endophthalmitis (n = 3). The median (range) LogMAR CDVA at baseline was 0.54 (0.18-0.78) in cases and did not change post-SO removal (p = 0.29). There was a significant decrease in average P1 and N1 wave amplitude (p = 0.0001 and 0.0001, respectively) and delay in average P1 and N1 wave implicit time (p = 0.0002 and 0.021, respectively) in cases as compared to controls. The macular status and duration of SO tamponade did not have a significant correlation with mfERG parameters. There was a significant increase in average P1 and N1 wave amplitude (p = 0.009 and 0.003, respectively) at 1 week following SO removal but no change in average P1 and N1 wave implicit time (p = 0.41 and 0.37, respectively).
   Conclusion mfERG may be reliably performed for the assessment of macular function in SO-filled eyes. Intravitreal SO exerts an insulating effect on the density of the electric potentials.

   CONCLUSION. ISC is an inflammatory disorder involving the biliary system and resulting in strictures. Although often associated with autoimmune pancreatitis, it may be an isolated disease. Differentiation of ISC from other forms of cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma is difficult but necessary for management. Imaging is important in diagnosing and assessing the extent of disease and planning a management strategy.

AB  - Objectives To describe the sonoelastographic characteristics of the normal endometrium, myometrium, and cervix and to assess their variability with age and different menstrual phases. Methods A total of 56 women were enrolled in this prospective study, who underwent transvaginal ultrasound examinations, including B-mode imaging and shear wave elastography. The elasticity parameters (in kilopascals) of the normal endometrium, myometrium, and cervix were studied. The variability of the mean elasticity value of the endometrium in different menstrual phases and age groups was analyzed. The variability of the mean elasticity of the cervix across different age groups was also studied. Results The mean age of the participants was 40 years (range, 25-69 years). The normal mean elasticity values +/- SDs were 25.54 +/- 8.56 kPa for the endometrium, 40.24 +/- 8.59 kPa for the myometrium, and 18.90 +/- 4.22 kPa for the cervix. A mean endometrial-to-myometrial elasticity ratio was calculated, which was found to be 0.65 +/- 0.22. There was no significant difference in the mean endometrial elasticity values for women in different menstrual phases (P = .176) or in different age groups (P = .376). There was no significant difference in the mean cervical elasticity with age (P = .192). Conclusions Shear wave elastography is a promising adjunct to ultrasound for the evaluation of the uterus, and the results from this study may provide normal data, which may further help in diagnosing various uterine diseases.

AB  - Objective: Resistance to colistin, a last resort antibiotic, has emerged in India. We investigated colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae(ColR-KP) in a hospital in India to describe infections, characterize resistance of isolates, compare concordance of detection methods, and identify transmission events. Design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: Case-patients were defined as individuals from whom ColR-KP was isolated from a clinical specimen between January 2016 and October 2017. Isolates resistant to colistin by Vitek 2 were confirmed by broth microdilution (BMD). Isolates underwent colistin susceptibility testing by disk diffusion and whole-genome sequencing. Medical records were reviewed. Results: Of 846 K. pneumoniae isolates, 34 (4%) were colistin resistant. In total, 22 case-patients were identified. Most (90%) were male; their median age was 33 years. Half were transferred from another hospital; 45% died. Case-patients were admitted for a median of 14 days before detection of ColR-KP. Also, 7 case-patients (32%) received colistin before detection of ColR-KP. All isolates were resistant to carbapenems and susceptible to tigecycline. Isolates resistant to colistin by Vitek 2 were also resistant by BMD; 2 ColR-KP isolates were resistant by disk diffusion. Moreover, 8 multilocus sequence types were identified. Isolates were negative for mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes. Based on sequencing analysis, in-hospital transmission may have occurred with 8 case-patients (38%). Conclusions: Multiple infections caused by highly resistant, mcr-negative ColR-KP with substantial mortality were identified. Disk diffusion correlated poorly with Vitek 2 and BMD for detection of ColR-KP. Sequencing indicated multiple importation and in-hospital transmission events. Enhanced detection for ColR-KP may be warranted in India.

AB  - Background and purpose: Efficacy of sodium valproate in epilepsy is limited by its poor blood brain barrier penetration and side effects. Nanoparticles may offer a better drug delivery system to overcome these limitations. This study evaluated the efficacy of sodium valproate encapsulated in nanoparticles in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced acute and kindling models of seizures in male Wistar rats.
   Methods: Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) based, polysorbate 80 stabilized sodium valproate loaded nanoparticles (nano sodium valproate) and rhodamine loaded nanoparticles (RLN) were formulated by double emulsion- solvent evaporation method and characterized for their size, shape, zeta potential and drug loading percentage. RLN was used to demonstrate blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability of nanoparticles. Serum drug levels were estimated using high performance liquid chromatography. The efficacy of standard sodium valproate (300 mg/kg) and nano sodium valproate (similar to 300, similar to 150 and similar to 75 mg/kg of sodium valproate) were evaluated in experimental animal models of seizures along with their effects on behavioral and oxidative stress parameters. Drugs were administered 60 min before PTZ in acute model. In the kindling model, drugs were administered every day while PTZ was administered on alternate days 60 min after drug administration. All the study drugs/ compounds were administered intraperitoneally.
   Results: RLN were observed to be clustered in cortex which implied that the nanoparticles crossed BBB. Both standard sodium valproate and nano sodium valproate reached therapeutic serum level at 15 min and 1 h, but were undetectable in serum at 24 h. In acute PTZ (60 mg/kg) model, nano sodium valproate (similar to 300 mg/kg of sodium valproate) and standard sodium valproate showed protection against seizures till 6 h and 4 h, respectively. There were significant behavioral impairment and oxidative stress with standard sodium valproate in acute model as compared to nano sodium valproate at 6 h. In kindling model, induced with PTZ (30 mg/kg, every alternate day for 42 days), complete protection from seizures was observed with nano sodium valproate (similar to 150 mg/kg and similar to 75 mg/kg of sodium valproate) and standard sodium valproate (300 mg/kg). Similarly, significant protection from behavioral impairment and oxidative stress was observed with standard sodium valproate and nano sodium valproate as compared to PTZ.
   Conclusion: When compared to conventional therapy, nano sodium valproate showed protection from seizures at reduced doses and for a longer duration in animal models of epilepsy. This study suggests the potential of nano sodium valproate in the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Purpose: A pilot randomized control trial to compare the efficacy and side effects of intralesional and oral propranolol in periorbital and eyelid capillary hemangiomas. Methods: Twenty patients were prospectively randomized to two groups of ten each. Group 1 was initiated on oral propranolol 1 mg/kg/day titrated to final dose of 3 mg/kg/day over 1 week which was continued for 6 months and then tapered over 1 week; Group 2 received 3 doses of direct intralesional propranolol hydrochloride 1 mg/ml; 0.2 ml/cm 4-6 weeks apart. Hemangioma area and corneal astigmatism were measured. Results: Within each group at 6 months there was a significant reduction in area (group 1: 83.48 +/- 11.67%, P = 0.0019; group 2: 67.78 +/- 21.71%, P = 0.0019) and improvement in astigmatism (pre, post: group 1: 2.98D @ 179.8 degrees, 1.13D @ 179.8 degrees, P = 0.0045; group 2: 1.62D @ 90.16 degrees, 0.75D @ 179.9 degrees, P = 0.0001). There was no difference in area reduction (P = 0.056), change in appearance (P = 0.085), ptosis (P = 0.23) and side effects (lethargy, poor feeding; P = 0.171) between the two groups. Conclusion: Efficacy and side effects with intralesional propranolol are comparable to oral propranolol for periorbital and eyelid lesions.

AB  - Protein function prediction is a crucial task in the post-genomics era due to their diverse irreplaceable roles in a biological system. Traditional methods involved cost-intensive and time-consuming molecular biology techniques but they proved to be ineffective after the outburst of sequencing data through the advent of cost-effective and advanced sequencing techniques. To manage the pace of annotation with that of data generation, there is a shift to computational approaches which are based on homology, sequence and structure-based features, protein-protein interaction networks, phylogenetic profiles, and physicochemical properties, etc. A combination of these features has proven to be promising for protein function prediction in terms of improving prediction accuracy. In the present work, we have employed a combination of features based on sequence, physicochemical property, subsequence and annotation features with a total of 9890 features extracted and/or calculated for 171,212 reviewed prokaryotic proteins of 9 bacterial phyla from UniProtKB, to train a supervised deep learning ensemble model with the aim to categorize a bacterial hypothetical/unreviewed protein's function into 1739 GO terms as functional classes. The proposed system being fully dedicated to bacterial organisms is a novel attempt amongst various existing machine learning based protein function prediction systems based on mixed organisms. Experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed deep learning ensemble model based on deep neural network method with F1 measure of 0.7912 on the prepared Test dataset 1 of reviewed proteins.

AB  - Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a common benign lesion that causes significant morbidity due to the failure of modern medical and surgical treatment. Surface ultra-structures of giant cells (GCs) may help in distinguishing aggressive tumors from indolent GC lesions. This study aimed to standardize scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging of GC from GCT of bone. Fresh GCT collected in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium was washed to remove blood, homogenized, or treated with collagenase to isolate the GCs. Mechanically homogenized and collagenase-digested GCs were imaged on SEM after commonly used drying methodologies such as air-drying, tetramethylsilane (TMS)-drying, freeze-drying, and critical point-drying (CPD) for the optimization of sample processing. The collagenase-treated samples yielded a greater number of isolated GC and showed better surface morphology in comparison to mechanical homogenization. Air-drying was associated with marked cell shrinkage, and freeze-dried samples showed severe cell damage. TMS methodology partially preserved the cell contour and surface structures, although the cell shape was distorted. GC images with optimum surface morphology including membrane folding and microvesicular structures on the surface were observed only in collagenase-treated and critical point-dried samples. Collagenase digestion and critical point/TMS-drying should be performed for optimal SEM imaging of individual GCs.

AB  - Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBI, on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map. and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology. were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning. analytic, and problem-solving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures.

AB  - Over the past several years, targeted therapy has been increasingly used in the management of breast cancer. Reported results for targeted therapies are variable, as some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported a strong effect, whereas others reported no or minimal effect on the outcomes. Accordingly, the present study aimed to assess the effect of the addition of targeted therapies to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on tumor response rates, breast conserving surgeries, and survival outcomes. PubMed and the Cochrane register of clinical trials were searched on April 28, 2017 for RCTs comparing addition of targeted therapies to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the screening of records and data extraction were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Publication bias and risk of bias were assessed by the Egger test and the Cochrane tool for risk of bias assessment, respectively. The fixed effect method or random effect method were used to synthesize the results depending on the heterogeneity assessed by the I2 statistic. A total of 17 RCTs including trastuzumab (n = 5), bevacizumab (n = 7), and other targeted therapies (n = 5) were found eligible. Pathologic complete response was significantly higher with trastuzumab (relative risk [RR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.99) and bevacizumab (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.37), but not with other targeted therapies. Bevacizumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer was found to be associated with improved overall (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.90) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.6-71.03). The addition of targeted therapies may not significantly increase breast conserving surgery rates (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12). The addition of targeted therapies, especially trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and bevacizumab for patients with HER2-negative breast cancer significantly increased pathologic complete response, overall response, and clinical complete response but not breast conserving surgery rates.

AB  - Objective This study was aimed to classify and study complications of surgery of the cranial base, primarily from an otorhinolaryngology perspective.
   Design This study was designed with consecutive cohort of skull base surgical cases.
   Setting Tertiary referral academic center.
   Participants Patients having skull-base surgery at a otorhinolaryngology based skull-base unit, from 2002 to 2015.
   Main Outcome Measures Enumeration of complications is the main outcome of this study. Surgical procedures, categorized for complexity as per a unified system, are applicable to endoscopic and open procedures. Complications were categorized as per the British Association of Otolaryngologists coding of surgical complications. Complication classified as major if life-threatening, causing permanent disability, or compromising the result of surgery.
   Results A total of 342 patients ( n =342) were operated; 13 patients' records were excluded due to<6 months posttreatment follow-up. The study group constituted 204 anterior skull-base (endoscopic, 120; open/external, 84) and 125 lateral skull-base procedures. Complication rates noted to increase in both groups with increasing complexity of surgical intervention. Anterior skull-base surgery (total complications, 11%; major, 3%; death, 0.5%) noted to have significantly less surgical complications than lateral skull-base surgery (total complications, 33%; major, 15%; death, 1.6%; p <0.001). Among the anterior procedures no significant difference noted among endoscopic and external approaches when compared across similar surgical complexity.
   Conclusion Despite improvement in surgical and perioperative care, the overall major complication rate in a contemporary otolaryngology led, primarily extradural, skull-base practice is noted at 8%. Perioperative mortality, though rare, was encountered in 1%. A standard method for categorization of surgical complexity and the grade of complications as reported here is recommended.

AB  - Background Worldwide, both the incidence and death rates of pancreatic cancer are increasing. Evaluation of pancreatic cancer burden and its global, regional, and national patterns is crucial to policy making and better resource allocation for controlling pancreatic cancer risk factors, developing early detection methods, and providing faster and more effective treatments.
   Methods Vital registration, vital registration sample, and cancer registry data were used to generate mortality, incidence, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) estimates. We used the comparative risk assessment framework to estimate the proportion of deaths attributable to risk factors for pancreatic cancer: smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. All of the estimates were reported as counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 person-years. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were reported for all estimates.
   Findings In 2017, there were 448 000 (95% UI 439 000-456 000) incident cases of pancreatic cancer globally, of which 232 000 (210 000-221 000; 51.9%) were in males. The age-standardised incidence rate was 5.0 (4.9-5.1) per 100 000 person-years in 1990 and increased to 5.7 (5.6-5.8) per 100 000 person-years in 2017. There was a 2.3 times increase in number of deaths for both sexes from 196 000 (193 000-200 000) in 1990 to 441 000 (433 000-449 000) in 2017. There was a 2.1 times increase in DALYs due to pancreatic cancer, increasing from 4.4 million (4.3-4.5) in 1990 to 9.1 million (8.9-9.3) in 2017. The age-standardised death rate of pancreatic cancer was highest in the high-income super-region across all years from 1990 to 2017. In 2017, the highest age-standardised death rates were observed in Greenland (17.4 [15.8-19.0] per 100 000 person-years) and Uruguay (12.1 [10.9-13.5] per 100 000 person-years). These countries also had the highest age-standardised death rates in 1990. Bangladesh (1.9 [1.5-2.3] per 100 000 person-years) had the lowest rate in 2017, and Sao Tome and Principe (1.3 [1.1-1.5] per 100 000 person-years) had the lowest rate in 1990. The numbers of incident cases and deaths peaked at the ages of 65-69 years for males and at 75-79 years for females. Age-standardised pancreatic cancer deaths worldwide were primarily attributable to smoking (21.1% [18.8-23.7]), high fasting plasma glucose (8.9% [2.1-19.4]), and high body-mass index (6.2% [2.5-11.4]) in 2017.
   Interpretation Globally, the number of deaths, incident cases, and DALYs caused by pancreatic cancer has more than doubled from 1990 to 2017. The increase in incidence of pancreatic cancer is likely to continue as the population ages. Prevention strategies should focus on modifiable risk factors. Development of screening programmes for early detection and more effective treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer are needed. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the use of labial mucosa as a spacer for levator-Muller's recession in correction of severe eyelid retraction.
   Design: Retrospective interventional study.
   Participants: We retrospectively reviewed records of 4 patients with severe upper eyelid retraction not associated with cicatricial diseases of the conjunctiva.
   Method: Surgical correction of eyelid retraction was performed by Levator-Muller's recession using autologous mucosal graft (from lip) as a spacer through transconjunctival approach. Eyelid height and contour were the main outcome measures evaluated after surgery.
   Results: There was resolution of dry eye symptoms in all 4 cases. In 2 cases the corrected eyelid height was within 1 mm of the desired lid position. The lid contour was good in 2 cases and satisfactory in 2 cases because of mild lateral flare. The eyelid height remained stationary till the last follow-up, which ranged from Eyelid height and contour were the main outcome measures evaluated after surgery. 6-30 months (mean: 18 months).
   Conclusions: Labial mucosal graft as a spacer for levator-Muller's recession is a good option for correction of severe upper eyelid retraction. It provides stable eyelid position within 3 months of surgery with no corneal complications.

AB  - Objective The article attempts to describe the indications, classification, and surgical anatomy of the commonly performed urinary diversion procedures, followed by the imaging protocol and radiological appearances of the normal postoperative anatomy and complications related to these procedures. Contents Diversion procedures are used to reroute urine after cystectomy and in patients with refractory neurogenic or outlet obstruction of the urinary bladder. Broadly, these can be classified as continent and incontinent diversions. Patients with urinary diversions frequently undergo radiological investigations for the detection of complications. Commonly, a loopogram or pouchogram is performed few weeks after the surgery to look for leak, whereas CT or MRI is used for long-term follow-up. Postoperative complications can be early (within 30 days of the surgery) or delayed and include leaks, collections, strictures, calculi, parastomal hernia, small bowel obstruction, and oncologic recurrence. Conclusion A variety of urinary diversion procedures are commonly performed and interpretation of the postsurgical anatomy can be overwhelming for the general radiologist. This article provides a basic understanding of the normal anatomy as well as a thorough discussion on the imaging protocol and radiological appearances of the potential complications associated with these procedures.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical profile and predictors of mortality in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Method Demographic and clinical parameters of neonates with congenital diaphragmatic heria (n=37) between January 2014 and October, 2017 were reviewed, and compared among those who survived or expired in hospital. Result Median (range) gestation and birthweight were 38 (37-39) weeks and 2496 (2044-2889) g, respectively. Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) was documented in 19 (51%) neonates and 10 (27%) had associated malformations. Surgery could be performed in 18 (49%), overall mortality was 60%. On univariate analysis, low Apgar scores, presence of malformations, PPHN, need for higher initial peak inspiratory pressure/high frequency ventilation, and requirement of a patch for closure were associated with increased mortality. On multivariate analysis, PPHN remained the only significant risk factor [adjusted RR 3.74 (95% CI 1.45-9.68)]. Conclusion The survival of infants with CDH is low, and PPHN is an important predictor of mortality.

AB  - Cyclodialysis is a rare occurrence and is difficult to treat, it being concealed behind the iris. In view of the varied success outcomes of the different available surgical repair techniques, there is at present no clear consensus regarding their management strategies. Through this article, we intend to appraise the established surgical methods, update the novel techniques in vogue, discuss their outcomes and propose a uniform system to codify these corrective techniques. They have been reclassified under the terms 'exocyclopexy', 'endocyclopexy', 'exocyclotamponade' and 'endocyclotamponade' based on the approach used and their mode of action. The ab-interno techniques (endocyclopexy and endocyclotamponade) are easier to perform, offer good success rates and better safety profiles such that they may be considered as a viable alternative to the standard exocyclopexy in either cataractous or pseudophakic and aphakic eyes.

AB  - Background & objectives: Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is associated with dismal outcome and progression-free survival (PFS) shortens with each subsequent relapse. For patients with recurrent and platinum refractory disease, therapeutic options are limited. Oral metronomic therapy (OMT) is associated with symptomatic relief and stable response in a significant proportion of patients. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of patients with EOC treated with OMT at a tertiary care hospital in north India. Methods: Between January 2011 to December 2017, 36 EOC patients received OMT. Patients' median age was 50 yr (range, 38-81 yr) and they had received a median of two lines of prior chemotherapy. OMT regimen included a combination of cyclophosphamide, etoposide (VP-16) and celecoxib with or without pazopanib along with supportive care. Response rates and outcomes were ascertained using the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup Guidelines. The toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.03. Results: The median CA-125 before initiating OMT was 160 U/ml (range, 42.23-5330 U/ml). The median interval between last chemotherapy and starting OMT regimen was 159 days (range, 1-1211 days). The overall response rate was 50 per cent. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.03-10.33], and the median overall survival was 38 months (95% CI: 25.6-NR). Patients who received two lines of chemotherapy before OMT (P=0.052) and those who received pazopanib-based OMT (P=0.0513) had better PFS. Interpretation & conclusions: For patients with relapse and refractory EOC, OMT could be a reasonable option. A combination of oral etoposide (VP-16) and pazopanib needs further evaluation in a large number of patients in a randomized trial.

AB  - Aim: To determine equivalence of modified gemcitabine and oxaliplatin compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin in unresectable gallbladder cancer (GBC). Primary end-point was overall survival (OS).
   Methods: Open label, prospective, randomised phase III equivalence study. Inclusion criteria included histologically proven unresectable GBC, 18 years or older, adequate organ functions and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group <= 2.
   Sample size: 108 patients were required in each arm to have an equivalence margin of +/- 2 months with power of 80%.
   Treatment: Modified gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (mGemOx)-gemcitabine 900 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 80 mg/m2, maximum 6 cycles; gemcitabine + cisplatin (CisGem)-gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, cisplatin 25 mg/m2, maximum 8 cycles, all day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks.
   Results: Two hundred sixty subjects were recruited between February 2011 and July 2015. Two hundred forty-three patients (119, mGemOx and 124, CisGem) received at least 1 dose and analysed for safety and efficacy (modified intention to treat). Median OS was 8.5 months for whole group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.9-9.1). Median OS in mGemOx was 9 months and 8.3 months in CisGem; p = 0.057 (hazard ratio = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.60-1.02). Restricted mean OS for follow-up limited to 30 months was 11.2 months (95% CI: 9.8-12.6) in mGemOx and 10.4 months (95% CI: 9.1-11.7) in CisGem. Difference of the mean was 0.8 months with 95% CI, exceeding 2 months (-1.1 to 2.7), hence rejecting equivalence. Peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopaenia in mGemOx and nephrotoxicity was higher with CisGem.
   Conclusion: This trial failed to show equivalence of eight cycles of CisGem to six cycles of mGemOx. Numerically OS was better with mGemOx. Toxicities were different. The trial was not powered to answer superiority. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Community-level benefits of screening for active tuberculosis (TB) disease remain uncertain. Project Axshya (meaning free of TB) conducted advocacy, communication, social mobilization, and active case finding among vulnerable/marginalized populations of India. Among 15 districts of Jharkhand state, the project was initiated in 36 subdistrict level administrative units-tuberculosis units (TUs) in a staggered manner between April 2013 and September 2014, and continued till the end of 2015. Seven TUs did not implement the project. We assessed the relative change in the quarterly TB case finding indicators (n = 4) after inclusion of a TU within the project. By fitting four multilevel models (mixed-effects maximum likelihood regression using random intercept), we adjusted for secular (over previous five quarters) and seasonal trends, baseline differences within Axshya and non-Axshya TUs, and population size and clustering within districts and within TUs. After inclusion of a TU within the project, we found a significant increase [95% confidence interval (CI)] in TU-level presumptive TB sputum examination rate, new sputum-positive TB Case Notification Rate (CNR), sputum-positive TB CNR, and all forms TB CNR by 12 (5.5, 18.5), 1.1 (0.5, 1.7), 1.3 (0.6, 2.0), and 1.2 (0.1, 2.2) per 100,000 population per quarter, respectively. Overall, the project resulted in an increase (95% CI) in sputum examination and detection of new sputum-positive TB, sputum-positive TB and all forms of TB patients by 22,410 (10,203, 34,077), 2066 (923, 3210), 2380 (1162, 3616), and 2122 (203, 4059), respectively. This provides evidence for implementing project Axshya over and above the existing passive case finding. (C) 2019 Atlantis Press International B.V.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the effect of intracameral human cord blood stem cells on lasered rabbit trabecular meshwork.MethodsImmediately following diode laser application to the trabecular meshwork, human cord blood stem cells were injected intracamerally, in one eye of 12 albino rabbits. The other eye of ten rabbits was lasered controls and two eyes were normal controls. Rabbits were killed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.ResultsLasered control rabbit eyes showed significant disruption of trabecular architecture, loss and pleomorphism of trabecular endothelial cells and progressive narrowing of trabecular spaces till 12 weeks. In contrast, lasered eyes, concurrently injected with human cord blood stem cells, showed relatively preserved endothelial cellularity and structure of the trabecular meshwork, at all time points. Human CD34- and CD44-positive cells were identified in 7/8 eyes treated with stem cells, at 4 and 8 weeks, and 2 of 3 at 12 weeks. Many PKH26-labeled human cord blood cells were visible throughout the trabecular area at 4 weeks. They gradually decreased in number by 8 weeks, and at 12 weeks, they appeared to be oriented along trabecular beams.ConclusionsThere was a relative preservation of cellularity and architecture of the trabecular meshwork in eyes injected with human cord blood stem cells, as compared to lasered control eyes up to 12 weeks, without significant inflammation. This suggests a probable role for such stem cells in eyes with glaucoma, having trabecular dysfunction.

AB  - Patients with gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy need to be effectively managed as the disease is severely debilitating in view of associated photophobia and glare. Here, we report a rare case of gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy effectively managed by intraoperative anterior segment optical coherence tomography-guided manual deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty in 1 eye and sutureless fibrin glue aided, microkeratome-assisted automated lamellar therapeutic keratoplasty in the other eye.The patient, a 22-year old man, presented with gradual diminution of vision associated with foreign body sensation, glare, photophobia, and watering due to corneal lesions, which were consistent with a diagnosis of gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy. Visual acuity at presentation was 4/60 and 3/60 in the right and left eye, respectively. The patient received customized component lamellar keratoplasty in both eyes, and host tissue was sent for histopathologic examination. Treatment resulted in a best-corrected distance visual acuity of 6/9 and 6/12 in the right and left eye, respectively.The graft was clear and well apposed, with minimal interface haze bilaterally. The histopathologic report suggested intralamellar amyloid deposition in the form of homogenous, acellular eosinophilic deposits in the epithelium and anterior corneal stroma. This is a first report of the exclusive use of a fibrin-aprotinin tissue adhesive to stabilize a donor corneal lamellar graft as a treatment modality for a patient with gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy, suggesting that this treatment could supplant the need for sutures.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the activation of NF kappa B1/p50 in the inflammatory and non-inflammatory environment of uveal melanoma and its association with clinicopathological factors and patient outcome.
   Methods: Activation of NF kappa B1/p50 was evaluated in 75 cases of uveal melanoma by immunohistochemistry. mRNA expression in 58 fresh UM specimen was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blotting was performed to validate the immunohistochemistry results in representative cases.
   Results: Forty-five cases showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear immunoreactivity of NF kappa B1/p50. Increased level of NF kappa B1/p50 activation was more frequent in the inflammatory environment group as compared to non-inflammatory environment group at both transcriptional and translational level. In multivariate analysis, infiltrating macrophages and nuclear immunoreactivity of NF kappa B/p50 (p < .05) in tumor cells were found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor survival.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that nuclear immunoreactivity NF kappa B1/p50 may serve as a useful marker in assessing the prognosis of uveal melanoma patients.

AB  - Robots have the potential to help provide exercise therapy in a repeatable and reproducible manner for stroke survivors. To facilitate rehabilitation of the wrist and fingers joint, an electromechanical exoskeleton was developed that simultaneously moves the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints. The device was designed for the ease of manufacturing and maintenance, with specific considerations for countries with limited resources. Active participation of the user is ensured by the implementation of electromyographic control and visual feedback of performance. Muscle activity requirements, movement parameters, range of motion and speed, of the device can all be customized to meet the needs of the user. Twelve stroke survivors, ranging from the subacute to chronic phases of recovery (mean 10.6 months post-stroke) participated in a pilot study with the device. Participants completed 20 sessions, each lasting 45 minutes. Overall, subjects exhibited statistically significant changes (p 0.05) in clinical outcome measures following the treatment, with the Fugl-Meyer Stroke Assessment score for the upper extremity increasing from 36 to 50 and the Barthel Index increasing from 74 to 89. Active range of wrist motion increased by 19 while spasticity decreased from 1.75 to 1.29 on the Modified Ashworth Scale. Thus, this device shows promise for improving rehabilitation outcomes, especially for patients in countries with limited resources.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that utilizes the quorum-sensing (QS) process to regulate the production of different virulence factors and biofilm. N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C12) is a key QS molecule of P. aeruginosa which interacts with the mammalian immune cells and modulates their function. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of C12-induced apoptosis in neutrophils. Our data show that C12 causes apoptosis in neutrophils through an elevation in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels. Besides, C12 induces phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) generation. C12-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ level is majorly contributed by endoplasmic reticulum store through the activation of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor. Intracellular calcium chelation inhibited C12-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Further, inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter by ruthenium red or Ru360 abrogated C12-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, MMP loss, MPTP opening, mROS production, and PS exposure. These mechanistic insights are expected to provide a better understanding of the role of C12 in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: Lithium remains a cornerstone of prophylaxis in bipolar disorder (BD), but adherence continues to be a major clinical challenge and merits a closer attention. There is scant literature available in Indian as well as Asian context.
   Methods: This study was conducted at Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, New Delhi with an aim to assess the self-reported medication adherence and its correlates among a naturalistic, lithium-maintained cohort (n = 76) with bipolar disorder. Subjects were included if they were on lithium therapy >= 1 year, met DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar disorder and were in clinical remission (>= 1 month). Besides sociodemographic and clinical performa, participants were assessed on medication adherence rating scale (MARS), lithium questionnaire for knowledge and lithium attitude questionnaire (LAQ).
   Results: Mean age was 35.7 +/- 10.6 years (males: 59.2%); median duration of illness and lithium therapy was 84 months and 24.5 months, respectively. Mean MARS score was 6.95 +/- 2.81. Regression analysis (with MARS total as dependent variable) found LAQ score to be the single most significant predictor variable (beta= - 0.681, p < 0.0001), explaining over 75% of the total variance. In regression model with MARS factor-1 score as dependent variable, the 'LAQ score' (beta= - 0.601, p < 0.0001) and 'being accompanied by family during psychiatric visits (always/mostly) in the past year' (beta = 0.193, p = 0.010) emerged as significant predictor variables.
   Conclusion: Adherence in lithium-maintained treatment-seeking cohort of patients with BD remains far from ideal as observed in this naturalistic setting. Lithium-related attitudes and being accompanied by family during psychiatric visits were found to be significant predictors for adherence.

AB  - Background Malnutrition is a major contributor to disease burden in India. To inform subnational action, we aimed to assess the disease burden due to malnutrition and the trends in its indicators in every state of India in relation to Indian and global nutrition targets.
   Methods We analysed the disease burden attributable to child and maternal malnutrition, and the trends in the malnutrition indicators from 1990 to 2017 in every state of India using all accessible data from multiple sources, as part of Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. The states were categorised into three groups using their Socio-demographic Index (SDI) calculated by GBD on the basis of per capita income, mean education, and fertility rate in women younger than 25 years. We projected the prevalence of malnutrition indicators for the states of India up to 2030 on the basis of the 1990-2017 trends for comparison with India National Nutrition Mission (NNM) 2022 and WHO and UNICEF 2030 targets.
   Findings Malnutrition was the predominant risk factor for death in children younger than 5 years of age in every state of India in 2017, accounting for 68.2% (95% UI 65.8-70.7) of the total under-5 deaths, and the leading risk factor for health loss for all ages, responsible for 17.3% (16.3-18.2) of the total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The malnutrition DALY rate was much higher in the low SDI than in the middle SDI and high SDI state groups. This rate varied 6.8 times between the states in 2017, and was highest in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, and Rajasthan. The prevalence of low birthweight in India in 2017 was 21.4% (20.8-21.9), child stunting 39.3% (38.7-404), child wasting 15.7% (15.6-15.9), child underweight 32.7% (32.3-33-1), anaemia in children 59.7% (56.2-63.8), anaemia in women 15-49 years of age 54.4% (53-7-55.2), exclusive breastfeeding 53.3% (51.5-54.9), and child overweight 11.5% (8-5-14-9). If the trends estimated up to 2017 for the indicators in the NNM 2022 continue in India, there would be 8.9% excess prevalence for low birthweight, 9.6% for stunting, 4.8% for underweight, 11.7% for anaemia in children, and 13.8% for anaemia in women relative to the 2022 targets. For the additional indicators in the WHO and UNICEF 2030 targets, the trends up to 2017 would lead to 10.4% excess prevalence for wasting, 14.5% excess prevalence for overweight, and 10.7% less exclusive breastfeeding in 2030. The prevalence of malnutrition indicators, their rates of improvement, and the gaps between projected prevalence and targets vary substantially between the states.
   Interpretation Malnutrition continues to be the leading risk factor for disease burden in India. It is encouraging that India has set ambitious targets to reduce malnutrition through NNM. The trends up to 2017 indicate that substantially higher rates of improvement will be needed for all malnutrition indicators in most states to achieve the Indian 2022 and the global 2030 targets. The state-specific findings in this report indicate the effort needed in each state, which will be useful in tracking and motivating further progress. Similar subnational analyses might be useful for other low-income and middle-income countries. Copyright (C) 2019 World Health Organization; licensee Elsevier.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematologic tumor caused by cell cycle aberrations due to accumulating genetic disturbances in the expression of transcription factors (TFs), signaling oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Though survival rate in childhood ALL patients is increased up to 80% with recent medical advances, treatment of adults and childhood relapse cases still remains challenging. Here, we have performed bioinformatics analysis of 207 ALL patients' mRNA expression data retrieved from the ICGC data portal with an objective to mark out the decisive genes and pathways responsible for ALL pathogenesis and aggression. For analysis, 3361 most variable genes, including 276 transcription factors (out of 16,807 genes) were sorted based on the coefficient of variance. Silhouette width analysis classified 207 ALL patients into 6 subtypes and heat map analysis suggests a need of large and multicenter dataset for non-overlapping subtype classification. Overall, 265 GO terms and 32 KEGG pathways were enriched. The lists were dominated by cancer-associated entries and highlight crucial genes and pathways that can be targeted for designing more specific ALL therapeutics. Differential gene expression analysis identified upregulation of two important genes, JCHAIN and CRLF2 in dead patients' cohort suggesting their possible involvement in different clinical outcomes in ALL patients undergoing the same treatment.

AB  - This research work deployed free radical polymerization for the development of pH-responsive hybrid nanocomposite hydrogels (NCHs) with the formation of improved interpenetrating networks (IPN). The crosslinked biopolymeric system was composed of (chitosan (CH)/guar gum (GG)/polyol) and a nanofiller (Cloisite 30B). The study was aimed to investigate the role of Cloisite 30B as a nanofiller and linseed oil-derived polyol to induce stable interpenetrating networks in chitosan-guar gum-based hydrogels. FT-IR analysis confirmed the formation of crosslinked networks with the formation of hydrogen bonds in the synthesized NCHs. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry revealed high thermal stability of the NCHs. The hydrolytic and soil burial degradation tests confirmed the biodegradability of the synthesized NCHs. An extraordinarily high swelling capacity in a buffer solution of pH 4.0 and 7.4 demonstrated their pH-responsive behavior. It has been demonstrated that even the minimal addition of polyol to the guar gum-based hydrogels has influenced the stability and characteristic features such as high swelling capacity owing to the formation of interpenetrating networks and the biodegradability of the hydrogels.

AB  - Lid loading with upper eyelid gold weight implants is one of the more accepted ways of treating facial paralysis-related lagophthalmos. This study evaluates the short- and long-term outcomes of the technique in terms of objective and subjective functional and aesthetic outcomes. Two groups of 10 patients in each group were included in the study for prospective and retrospective evaluation of outcome of upper eyelid gold weight implant in Indian ethnicity. Assessment of the weight and dimension of gold implant was done in both sexes along with an evaluation of patient satisfaction, medical observations and ophthalmological assessment for corneal integrity, symmetry and exposure. Chi-square test, Friedman's test and Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. The mean weight-length of the implant for appropriate correction was noted as 1.12 g (range 0.9-1.3 g) and 17.8 mm (range 16-20 mm). Initial postsurgical congestion and eyelid oedema was near universal. Comparing the short-term and long-term assessments, palpebral fissure height reduction and eye closure was noted as stable and all subjective parameters were relatively consistent. Nineteen of 20 patients reported satisfaction with the cosmetic and functional results. Upper eyelid loading by gold weight implantation results in consistent and sustained improvement for eye closure in patients with facial paralysis.

AB  - The acute phase management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and polytrauma represents a major challenge. Guidelines for the care of these complex patients are lacking, and worldwide variability in clinical practice has been documented in recent studies. Consequently, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) decided to organize an international consensus conference regarding the monitoring and management of severe adult TBI polytrauma patients during the first 24 hours after injury. A modified Delphi approach was adopted, with an agreement cut-off of 70%. Forty experts in this field (emergency surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensivists) participated in the online consensus process. Sixteen recommendations were generated, with the aim of promoting rational care in this difficult setting.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinological disorder of fertile-aged women. Several adverse pregnancy outcomes and abnormalities of the placenta have been associated with PCOS. By using quantitative label-free proteomics we investigated whether changes in the plasma proteome of pregnant women with PCOS could elucidate the mechanisms behind the pathologies observed in PCOS pregnancies. A total of 169 proteins with >= 2 unique peptides were detected to be differentially expressed between women with PCOS (n = 7) and matched controls (n = 20) at term of pregnancy, out of which 35 were significant (p-value < 0.05). A pathway analysis revealed that networks related to humoral immune responses, inflammatory responses, cardiovascular disease and cellular growth and proliferation were affected by PCOS. Classification of cases and controls was carried out using principal component analysis, orthogonal projections on latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), hierarchical clustering, self-organising maps and ROC-curve analysis. The most significantly enriched proteins in PCOS were properdin and insulin-like growth factor II. In the dataset, properdin had the best predictive accuracy for PCOS (AUC=1). Additionally, properdin abundances correlated with AMH levels in pregnant women.

AB  - Background: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) exhibits poor prognosis due to its detection at an advanced stage. Upregulation of lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin L (CTSL) and cathepsin B (CTSB) has been implicated in several tumorigenic processes. However, no such information in GBC was available. Therefore, the present study was planned to investigate the expression and clinical significance of these cathepsins in GBC. Methods: Activities of CTSL and CTSB were assayed in the gallbladder (GB) tissues obtained from GBC patients (n = 43) and control subjects (n = 69). Protein and mRNA levels were quantified using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR (qPCR), respectively. Finally, serum levels of CTSL and CTSB were estimated by ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used for the assessment of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of these cysteine cathepsins in GBC. The association of combined CTSL and CTSB activity with overall survival was assessed using Kaplan Meier survival analysis. Results: The expression and activity of both CTSL and CTSB were significantly increased (p < 0.050) in tumors of GBC patients as compared to controls. Enzymatic activity of CTSL+B and CTSB exhibited a strong positive association with tumor stage and lymph node involvement in GBC (p < 0.050). Interestingly, the elevated activity of combined CTSL+B was also associated with increased mortality in these patients. Furthermore, significantly enhanced levels of serum CTSL and CTSB were also observed in GBC (p < 0.050) as compared to controls. ROC analysis revealed high diagnostic significance of serum CTSB and CTSL for distinguishing GBC patients from controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 82 and 77%, respectively. Conclusion: This study, for the first time, demonstrates the clinical significance of CTSL and CTSB overexpression in GBC. Our findings may help improve the clinical management of this carcinoma.

AB  - Background Latent tuberculosis infection is attributed in part to the existence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a persistent non-replicating dormant state that is associated with tolerance to host defence mechanisms and antibiotics. We have recently reported that vitamin C treatment of M. tuberculosis triggers the rapid development of bacterial dormancy. Temporal genome-wide transcriptome analysis has revealed that vitamin C-induced dormancy is associated with a large-scale modulation of gene expression in M. tuberculosis. Results An updated transcriptional regulatory network of M.tuberculosis (Mtb-TRN) consisting of 178 regulators and 3432 target genes was constructed. The temporal transcriptome data generated in response to vitamin C was overlaid on the Mtb-TRN (vitamin C Mtb-TRN) to derive insights into the transcriptional regulatory features in vitamin C-adapted bacteria. Statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test predicted that 56 regulators play a central role in modulating genes which are involved in growth, respiration, metabolism and repair functions. Rv0348, DevR, MprA and RegX3 participate in a core temporal regulatory response during 0.25 h to 8 h of vitamin C treatment. Temporal network analysis further revealed Rv0348 to be the most prominent hub regulator with maximum interactions in the vitamin C Mtb-TRN. Experimental analysis revealed that Rv0348 and DevR proteins interact with each other, and this interaction results in an enhanced binding of DevR to its target promoter. These findings, together with the enhanced expression of devR and Rv0348 transcriptional regulators, indicate a second-level regulation of target genes through transcription factor- transcription factor interactions. Conclusions Temporal regulatory analysis of the vitamin C Mtb-TRN revealed that there is involvement of multiple regulators during bacterial adaptation to dormancy. Our findings suggest that Rv0348 is a prominent hub regulator in the vitamin C model and large-scale modulation of gene expression is achieved through interactions of Rv0348 with other transcriptional regulators.

AB  - Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a form of chronic leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is known to occur in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Mostly, in the setting of HIV, it presents as plaques, nodules and occasionally as vesicles. We present a case of EED manifesting as annular plaques in an HIV-positive man, which was predominantly acral in distribution, involving the face also. After starting on dapsone, it disappeared completely in three days.

AB  - Of late, novel magnetic nanomaterials have drawn worldwide attention because of the uniqueness in their properties and uses. In our studies, we have prepared nearly monodisperse zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVIs) of diameter of less than 60 nm in aqueous medium by a reductive precipitation process and pectin as stabilizing agent. The characterization of these nanoparticles was done by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The TEM images confirmed that the average size of the nZVIs was about 25 nm. The resultant nZVIs were then employed to degrade DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) in spiked soil, and their toxicity toward Collembola (Folsomia candida) and Ostracods (Heterocypris incongruens) was measured. The fabricated nZVIs degraded DDT in soil quite effectively. Further, the effects of nZVIs on Collembola and Ostracods were found to be negative. This was due to the oxidation of nZVIs and creation of anoxic conditions thereupon, and the generation of excess Fe(II) in soil. In addition, the negative effects of DDT on ostracod development and Collembola reproduction were found to be quite weak.

AB  - Background: Sub-inflammation and insulin resistance characterize women with PCOS. Data on dietary modulation of inflammation among PCOS women is scant, particularly from Indian subcontinent. The present study aimed to assess the effect of plant based vs. animal origin diets on serum markers of inflammation (primary outcome measure). Methods: This observational case-control study compared age and BMI matched PCOS and apparently healthy women from two populations following different dietary practices. The vegetarian women from New-Delhi (n = 82 PCOS and n = 179 healthy) and non-vegetarian women from Srinagar (n = 62 PCOS and n = 141 healthy) formed the groups. Using a uniform methodology, detailed clinical, biochemical, hormonal, and inflammatory marker assessment was undertaken. Results: The mean age of the overall cohort was 26.23 +/- 4.59 years with a mean BMI of 24.39 +/- 3.72 kg/m(2). Overall pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, hs-CRP and serum resistin) were significantly higher (p <= 0.05) and anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10 and adiponectin) were lower among women with PCOS than healthy subjects. On comparing vegetarian women with non-vegetarians, higher daily calorie intake (1895.46 +/- 258.19 vs. 1860.13 +/- 323.96 Kcal) with a higher protein and fat and lower carbohydrate intake was recorded in the latter, although the percent energy derived from carbohydrates was higher among vegetarians. Clinical and biochemical parameters were comparable among the groups except mFG score, total serum testosterone and serum lipid levels which were higher among non-vegetarian women as compared to their vegetarian counterparts from both categories (PCOS and healthy). Interestingly, vegetarian women with PCOS and healthy women had higher serum pro-inflammatory and lower anti-inflammatory markers compared to their non-vegetarian counterparts. Conclusion: Women with PCOS consuming Indian vegetarian diet have higher pro-inflammatory and lower anti-inflammatory marker levels than their age and BMI matched healthy non-vegetarian counterparts. This interesting observation can be attributed to the dietary composition, among other factors and needs confirmation from well-designed randomized studies on a larger cohort.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to identify risk factors for mortality at admission in children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) with severe dehydration and shock. This was a retrospective chart review of all cases of AGE with severe dehydration and shock admitted to the PICU from 2012 to 2017. Children who died during hospital stay were compared with those who survived. A total of 62 children were admitted with AGE to the PICU during this period. Twenty-four children (39%) died. The following variables were found to be significantly associated with death on univariate analysis: clinical pallor (p = 0.01), thrombocytopenia (p = 0.018), elevated leucocyte count (p = 0.02), hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.02) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, only hypoalbuminemia {RR [95% CI: 2.6 (1.27 to 9.21)]; 0.039} and SAM {RR [95% CI: 4.9 (1.12 to 10)]; 0.045} remained statistically significant. Children admitted with severe dehydration and shock had high mortality rates. These children were a sicker subset with probable sepsis. Severe acute malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia were associated with increased risk of death in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has become a significant public health concern as hospital outbreaks are now being frequently reported and these organisms are becoming difficult to treat with the available antibiotics.
   CASE SUMMARY
   An outbreak of VIM-producing Serratia marcescens occurred over a period of 11 wk (August, 1 to October, 18) in patients admitted to the adult polyvalent intensive care unit of the University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli" located in Naples. Four episodes occurred in three patients (two patients infected, and one patient colonized). All the strains revealed the production of VIM.
   CONCLUSION
   After three decades of carbapenem antibiotics use, the emergence of carbapenem-resistance in Enterobacteriaceae has become a significant concern and a stricter control to preserve its clinical application is mandatory. This is, to our knowledge, the first outbreak of VIM-producing Serratia marcescens in Europe. Surveillance policies must be implemented to avoid future outbreaks.

AB  - Amidase from Bacillus sp. APB-6 with very good acyltransferase activity was purified to homogeneity with a purification fold of 3.68 and 53.20% enzyme yield. The purified protein's subunit molecular mass was determined approximately 42 kDa. Hyperactivity of the enzyme was observed at pH 7.5 (150 mM, potassium-phosphate buffer) and 50 degrees C of incubation. An enhancement in activity up to 42% was recorded with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and dithiothreitol. The kinetic parameter K-m values for substrates: acetamide and hydroxylamine-hydrochloride were 73.0 and 153 mM, respectively. Further, the V-max for acyltransferase activity was 1667 U/mg of protein and the K-i for acetamide was calculated as 37.0 mM. The enzyme showed tolerance to various organic solvents (10%, v/v) and worked well in the biphasic reaction medium. The acyltransferase activity in presence of solvents i.e. biphasic medium may prove highly favorable for the transformation of hydrophobic amides, which otherwise is not possible in simple aqueous phase.

AB  - Little is known about effective interventions to reduce aggressive end-of-life care in patients with cancer. We did a systematic review to assess what interventions are associated with reductions in aggressive end-of-life cancer care. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and PsychINFO for randomised control trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental, and observational studies published before Jan 19, 2018, which aimed to improve measures of aggressive end-of-life care for patients with cancer. We developed a taxonomy of interventions using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to summarise existing interventions that addressed aggressive care for patients with cancer. Of the 6451 studies identified by our search, five RCTs and 31 observational studies met the final inclusion criteria. Using the SEIPS framework, 16 subcategories of interventions were identified. With the exception of documentation of end-of-life discussions in the electronic medical record, no single intervention type or SEIPS domain led to consistent improvements in aggressive end-of-life care measures. The ability to discern the interventions' effectiveness was limited by inconsistent use of validated measures of aggressive care. Seven (23%) of 31 observational studies and no RCTs were at low risk of bias according to Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool. Evidence for improving aggressive end-of-life cancer care is limited by the absence of standardised measurements and poor study design. Policies and studies to address the gaps present in end-of-life care for cancer are necessary.

AB  - SYNGAP1 is a gene that encodes the cytosolic protein SYNGAP1 (SYNaptic GTPase Activating Protein), an essential component of the postsynaptic density at excitatory glutamatergic neurons. SYNGAP1 plays critical roles in synaptic development, structure, function, and plasticity. Mutations in SYNGAP1 result in a neurodevelopmental disorder termed Mental retardation-type 5 (MRD5, OMIM #612621) with a phenotype consisting of intellectual disability, motor impairments, and epilepsy, attesting to the importance of this protein for normal brain development. Here we review the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of SYNGAP1 mutations with a focus on their effect on synaptogenesis, neural circuit function, and cellular plasticity. We conclude by comparing the molecular pathogenesis of SYNGAP1 mutations with those of another neurodevelopmental disorder that affects dendritic function and cellular plasticity, fragile X syndrome. Insights into the molecular similarities and differences underlying these disorders could lead to rationale therapy development.

AB  - History of medicine is rich with the achievements and successes of years of research and development. The Medical Council of India incorporated teaching 'History of Medicine' in the undergraduate medical curriculum in India nearly a decade ago. Despite being included in the medical curriculum by the Medical Council of India, it is not yet a part of the teaching curriculum in the top-ranking medical institutions. Teaching 'History of Medicine' to undergraduate medical students may be a good divergence from the fact-based teaching of undergraduate medical curriculum. It will also help students cherish medical achievements of the past and inculcate in them a sense of pride and belongingness to the medical fraternity.

AB  - Viral zoonoses are some of the significant causes of morbidity and mortality, with epidemiological differences in patterns of these diseases in different geographical regions, and some of these zoonoses remaining as "endemic zoonoses". Certain viral zoonoses are endemic and unique to Saudi Arabia and can be attributed to large number of reservoir animals and arthropods, regular influx of expatriate workforce from different countries, and yearly, large mass religious gathering for the Hajj. An analysis of the published epidemiologic studies of zoonotic and vector-borne viral infections that have occurred in Saudi Arabia was conducted to present a descriptive analysis of such diseases with a particular emphasis on influenza, MERS-CoV and viral hemorrhagic fevers such as dengue, Alkhurma, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and the recent reports of vCJD. The inevitable risk of infection can be minimized and the outbreak of disease can be contained by increasing public awareness of sources and modes of transmission of these diseases. In addition, better diagnostics can improve early diagnosis, helping to reduce spread of the disease and related morbidity and mortality in the region.

AB  - Purpose The incidence of Urothelial carcinoma of bladder (UBC) is gradually increasing by changing lifestyle and environment. The development of a tumor has been noted to be accompanied by modifications in the extracellular matrix (ECM) consisting of CD44, hyaluronic acid (HA) and its family members. The importance of CD44 splice variants and HA family members has been studied in UBC. Methods The cohort of study included 50 UBC patients undergoing radical cystectomy and 50 healthy subjects. The molecular expression of CD44 and HA family members was determined. Effect of CD44 variant-specific silencing on downstream signaling in HT1376 cells was investigated. Combinatorial treatment of 4-MU (4-methylumbelliferone) with cisplatin or doxorubicin on chemosensitivity was also explored. Results Higher expression of HA, HAS2, and CD44 was observed in Indian UBC patients which also showed the trend with severity of disease. Splice variant assessment of CD44 demonstrated the distinct role of CD44v3 and CD44v6 in bladder cancer progression. shRNA-mediated downregulation of CD44v3 showed an increase effect on cell cycle, apoptosis and multiple downstream signaling cascade including pAkt, pERK and pSTAT3. Furthermore, 4-MU, an HA synthesis inhibitor, observed to complement the effect of Cisplatin or Doxorubicin by enhancing the chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells. Conclusions Our findings exhibit involvement of CD44 splice variants and HA family members in UBC and significance of 4-MU in enhancing chemosensitivity suggesting their novel therapeutic importance in disease therapeutics.

AB  - Aim In this study, we investigated the relationship of cerebral tau deposition (F-18-tau-AD-ML 104 PET/CT) with glucose metabolism (F-18-FDG PET/CT) and cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Patients and Methods Seventy subjects (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] score <18 = 37 [AD]; MMSE score, 18-24 = 16 [early AD]) and 17 controls were included in this study. All participants underwent detailed neurological and neuropsychological evaluation, followed by F-18-tau-AD-ML 104 and F-18-FDG PET/CT imaging. Region-wise SUVmax ratios at 50 to 60 minutes postinjection were calculated for F-18-tau-AD-ML 104 and F-18-FDG, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Linear models were used to investigate the association of regional F-18-tau-AD-ML 104 retention with F-18-FDG uptake and cognition (MMSE scores). Results F-18-Tau-AD-ML 104 retention was observed in the parietal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, parahippocampus, frontal lobe, anterior and posterior cingulate, and precuneus in advanced and early AD patient as compared with normal controls with regional hypometabolism in overlapping regions on F-18-FDG PET. Significant negative association was found between F-18-tau-AD-ML 104 regional retention and glucose metabolism in the parietal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, parahippocampus, frontal lobe, anterior and posterior cingulate, and precuneus among patients with advanced and early AD. In advanced and early AD patients, a negative association was found between F-18-tau-AD-ML 104 regional retention (precuneus) and cognition (MMSE score), whereas a positive association was observed between F-18-FDG regional uptake (precuneus) and cognition (MMSE score). Conclusions Tau pathology overlapped with areas of hypometabolism on FDG PET in the brains of AD patients. Tau deposition was found to have negative association with cognitive scores in these patients.

AB  - Purpose: There is a paucity of scientific evidence from the Indian subcontinent regarding the magnitude and burden of Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms (MUPS). This study aims to fill the evidence gap by assessing the prevalence and pattern of MUPS amongst patients attending the Medicine Out-Patient Department (OPD).
   Methodology: The study assessed all consecutive new patients, presenting to the Medicine OPD of a tertiary care center in India over a period of nine months. All consenting patients, between 18 and 60 years of age, irrespective of their reason for consultation were included for the study. The diagnosis in subjects was established by a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and relevant investigations. A diagnosis of MUPS was made in cases with no demonstrable organic cause, and after agreement in the opinion of two independent physicians. All recruited patients with MUPS were subsequently evaluated on a pre-validated symptom checklist of 23 symptoms.
   Results: Out of 976 subjects included, a diagnosis of MUPS was established in 24.6% [95% CI = 21.9-27.3] of the sample. An additional 20.6% met the criteria of persistent MUPS (symptoms > 2 months), and 19.7% of subjects had symptom duration of more than three months, meeting the stricter definition for 'persistent MUPS'. Prevalence was significantly higher in females (p = 0.02), and patients of MUPS were significantly younger (p = 0.004) than patients with other diagnoses. MUPS patients on average complained of 13 +/- 5 symptoms and sought multiple medical consultations [Median (IQR) = 3 (2 - 6)] in the last one year. Non-specific, general symptoms (94.6%) and various types of pain (93.7%) were the most frequent complaints. Pain symptoms, genitourinary symptoms, palpitation, and nausea were more frequent in females as compared to males.
   Discussion: Medically unexplained symptoms are as common in India as in the west and therefore pose a significant burden on the healthcare delivery systems. There is a need to sensitize the medical fraternity and policymakers for this condition to develop effective services.

AB  - In 2014 the International Endohernia Society (IEHS) published the first international "Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias". Guidelines reflect the currently best available evidence in diagnostics and therapy and give recommendations to help surgeons to standardize their techniques and to improve their results. However, science is a dynamic field which is continuously developing. Therefore, guidelines require regular updates to keep pace with the evolving literature. Methods For the development of the original guidelines all relevant literature published up to year 2012 was analyzed using the ranking of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based-Medicine. For the present update all of the previous authors were asked to evaluate the literature published during the recent years from 2012 to 2017 and revise their statements and recommendations given in the initial guidelines accordingly. In two Consensus Conferences (October 2017 Beijing, March 2018 Cologne) the updates were presented, discussed, and confirmed. To avoid redundancy, only new statements or recommendations are included in this paper. Therefore, for full understanding both of the guidelines, the original and the current, must be read. In addition, the new developments in repair of abdominal wall hernias like surgical techniques within the abdominal wall, release operations (transversus muscle release, component separation), Botox application, and robot-assisted repair methods were included. Results Due to an increase of the number of patients and further development of surgical techniques, repair of primary and secondary abdominal wall hernias attracts increasing interests of many surgeons. Whereas up to three decades ago hernia-related publications did not exceed 20 per year, currently this number is about 10-fold higher. Recent years are characterized by the advent of new techniques-minimal invasive techniques using robotics and laparoscopy, totally extraperitoneal repairs, novel myofascial release techniques for optimal closure of large defects, and Botox for relaxing the abdominal wall. Furthermore, a concomitant rectus diastasis was recognized as a significant risk factor for recurrence. Despite still insufficient evidence with respect to these new techniques it seemed to us necessary to include them in the update to stimulate surgeons to do research in these fields. Conclusion Guidelines are recommendations based on best available evidence intended to help the surgeon to improve the quality of his daily work. However, science is a continuously evolving process, and as such guidelines should be updated about every 3 years. For a comprehensive reference, however, it is suggested to read both the initially guidelines published in 2014 together with the update. Moreover, the presented update includes also techniques which were not known 3 years before.

AB  - Objective: Fungal infections of central nervous system (CNS) commonly affect immunocompromised patients, however, recently such cases have been reported even amongst immunocompetent patients.
   Patients & methods: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed outcome of 18 immunocompetent patients with histopathologically proven intracranial Aspergillosis undergoing combined surgical and medical management.
   Results: The age of patients ranged from 5-65 years. Fourteen out of 18 patients had well defined lesions while 4 had diffuse disease. Paranasal sinuses were involved in 8 & cavernous sinus in 3 patients. Six patients had hydrocephalus. Four patients developed infarcts during their clinical course. Surgical interventions included gross (n = 4) or subtotal excision (n = 8), decompressive craniectomy & biopsy of lesion (n = 4), biopsy only (n = 2) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (n = 6). All patients received postoperative antifungal therapy. The duration of follow up ranged from 10-60 months. Overall mortality was 44.4%. Mortality amongst patients undergoing gross total and subtotal excision was 25% & 50% respectively. Patients undergoing DC had a mortality of 25%. Both patients undergoing only biopsy died. Hydrocephalus was associated with a very high mortality (83.3%). Amongst surviving patients (n = 10), 6 patients became disease free & rest 4 had stable disease at last follow up.
   Conclusions: Intracranial aspergillosis is associated with high morbidity & mortality even amongst immunocompetent patients. An aggressive multidisciplinary management is thus needed to improve outcome. Our study shows that a combination of surgical excision or decompressive craniectomy and antifungal therapy can be helpful in improving prognosis of these patients.

TI  - Development of a Unique Retractor for Performing Endoscopic Pituitary Surgery-EASYTRAC

KW  - pituitary
KW  - retractor
KW  - surgery
KW  - TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY
AB  - Background: A unique self-expanding retractor (EASYTRAC (R)) is described, which provides several advantages for endoscopic pituitary surgery-enhanced visualization, creating more space, reducing the mucosal damage, and enhancing the nasal quality of life (QoF). Presented here is the proof of concept.
   Methods: EASYTRAC (R) is made of an aircraft-grade, SS-titanium alloy to provide optimal opening strength with a low profile (0.5 mm thick). It has a nonreflective, smooth surface finish. Patented design and wire pulling method of the EASYTRAC (R) makes it easy to insert and deploy. EASYTRAC (R) is inserted through the submucosal tunnel using a small, unilateral mucocutaneous incision. Following this, the ring attached to the wire is pulled out to deploy the retractor. This provides expansion of the retractor leading to fracture of the septum to one side at the keel of the vomer. The rest of the surgery is performed in the standard manner using an endoscope. The retractor is a single-use, disposable instrument and available in three different sizes.
   Results: Five endoscopic endonasal surgeries have been performed using the EASYTRAC (R) (four pituitary adenomas, one craniopharyngioma). Deviated nasal septum (DNS) was present in two of the surgeries. All surgeries were approached through the right mucoseptal corridor, and presence of DNS did not reduce exposure (<10 minutes for exposure). No hardware problem was observed in any of the cases. lntraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (n = 1) was managed with intraoperative, standard, triple-layer closure with glue and lumbar drain.
   Conclusion: Retractor seems to be safe, easy to use, and effective. The surgeon's capabilities are enhanced by the retractor's dynamicity, minimal fogging of scope, minimal trauma to the mucosa, and adequate space to allow the introduction of three instruments through a single nostril.

AB  - Prostate cancer, unlike other cancers, has been sampled in a non-targeted, systematic manner in the past three decades. On account of the low volume of prostate sampled despite the multiple cores acquired, systematic transrectal (TRUS) biopsy suffered from low sensitivity in picking up clinically significant prostate cancer. In addition, a significant number of cancers of the anterior, lateral peripheral zone, and the apex were missed as these areas were under-sampled or missed during this biopsy protocol. Subsequently, the number of cores acquired was increased with special focus given to targeting the previously undersampled areas. These procedures led to an increase in the complication rates as well as detection of more clinically insignificant cancers. The advent of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its high intrinsic tissue contrast enabled better detection of prostate cancer. This led to the introduction of MRI-targeted biopsies with either MRI-TRUS fusion or under direct (in-gantry) guidance. MRI-targeted biopsies increased the percentage of positive cores and detection of clinically significant prostate cancers; however, these are expensive, time-intensive, require significant capital investment and operator expertise. This article describes the indications, workflow, complications, advantages, and disadvantages of TRUS-guided biopsy followed by MRI-guided biopsies. (C) 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists.

AB  - Cost effective and miniaturized methods aiming for high throughput monitoring of bacterial growth are of great significance, especially for tracking disease progression in early stage as well as in screening antibiotic resistant species. Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical platform for noninvasive monitoring of bacterial growth by encapsulating bacterial cells and carbon nanodots in alginate microspheres. The synthesized carbon nanodots have been explored for electrochemical properties, and its redox properties have been utilized for developing bacterial growth monitoring platform. These synthesized CDs are sensitive to pH change and respond as change in redox potential over time as pH of the medium changes due to growth and metabolic activities of bacteria. We determined the bacterial growth kinetics by measuring the redox potential changes of the carbon nanodots over time. The developed platform has been demonstrated to detect the presence of bacteria, the difference in growth rates of bacteria and its susceptibility to the antibiotic with low bacterial counts (10(3) CFU) in 20 min; thus, redox properties of CDs has the potential to provide a sensitive detection platform.

AB  - Introduction: Serous papillary peritoneal carcinoma (SPPC) is a rare clinical entity. Based on the understanding of the pattern of spread, its multifocality, polyclonality and the high frequency of diffuse, widespread peritoneal metastasis, a robust rationale for cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for SPPC exists. Herein we report the clinical outcomes of SPPC patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) followed by CRS including total parietal peritonectomy and HIPEC.
   Methods: Clinico-pathological data of 22 patients of serous papillary peritoneal carcinoma (SPPC) was retrospectively analyzed from a prospectively maintained database from June 2000 to July 2017. Patients were treated with CRS, total parietal peritonectomy and HIPEC with cisplatin (42 mg/L of perfusate) and doxorubicin (15 mg/L of perfusate) after NACT. Survival curves were calculated from the date of surgery.
   Results: 22 patients underwent CRS, total parietal peritonectomy and HIPEC. The median age was 62 years (Range 47-72). On histological evaluation, 18/30 (60%) parietal peritonectomy specimens showed microscopic disease, when no disease was evident macroscopically at surgical exploration. Grade surgical complications were recorded in 4/22 (18%) patients. There was no postoperative mortality. At a median follow up of 12 months, the five-year overall survival (OS) was 64.9%. The median OS was not reached. Median progression-free survival was 32.9 months and progression-free survival at 5 years was 33.2%.
   Conclusion: CRS with total peritonectomy + HIPEC after NACT, presents as a promising treatment modality for SPPC, and could be associated with good survival results in patients with SPPC. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Currently, pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are recognized with increasing frequency and have become a more common finding in clinical practice. EUS is challenging in the diagnosis of PCLs and evidence-based decisions are lacking in its application. This study aimed to develop strong recommendations for the use of EUS in the diagnosis of PCLs, based on the experience of experts in the field. Methods: A survey regarding the practice of EUS in the evaluation of PCLs was drafted by the committee member of the International Society of EUS Task Force (ISEUS-TF). It was disseminated to experts of EUS who were also members of the ISEUS-TF. In some cases, percentage agreement with some statements was calculated; in others, the options with the greatest numbers of responses were summarized. Results: Fifteen questions were extracted and disseminated among 60 experts for the survey. Fifty-three experts completed the survey within the specified time frame. The average volume of EUS cases at the experts' institutions is 988.5 cases per year. Conclusion: Despite the limitations of EUS alone in the morphologic diagnosis of PCLs, the results of the survey indicate that EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration is widely expected to become a more valuable method.

AB  - Introduction: Myoepithelial carcinoma (MEC) is an extremely rare low grade salivary gland neoplasm [14]. A surgical resection is considered as corner stone of therapy. Role of adjuvant therapy is not clear.
   Methodology: We performed systematic review and individual patient data analysis of 691 patients to look into the impact of adjuvant therapy and different prognostic variable for MEC.
   Results: Data of 691 individual patients were retrieved from 340 publications. Median age of presentation was 56 years (Range: 0-103 years) with a trend of increasing incidence for increase in age. Major salivary glands (36.4%) were the commonest sub-site followed by minor salivary glands, skin and soft tissue, and breast. Median PFS and OS of entire cohort was 48 months (95% CI: 30-65 months) and 167 months (95% CI: 82-251 months). In univariate analysis A R0 resection was associated with significantly better PFS and OS. Median PFS and OS were significantly worse for patients with tumour size >5 cm compared to smaller tumours and for patients with a mitotic index >10/10 high power field (hpf) compared to lower mitotic index. Adjuvant radiation was found to reduce loco-regional recurrence. Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy both were associated with negative impact on survival in univariate analysis. This negative impact on survival was lost in multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion: MEC appears to be a low grade malignancy with good survival outcome. A R0 resection should be the standard of care. Adjuvant radiation should be considered for patients with adverse risk features to improve loco-regional disease control. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To present evaluation of a quality improvement program for Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). Methods This community intervention trial was conducted in Ballabgarh, India during 2012-2014 with two Primary Health Center (PHC) areas being the intervention areas and two PHC areas being non-intervention areas receiving standard care. Interventions included two-day training in technical and communication skills of ASHAs followed by supportive supervision in the field. Intervention was evaluated by comparing pre and post training scores, feedback from postnatal mothers and a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis on baseline and endline knowledge-practice survey of recently delivered mothers with 95% confidence intervals. Results Only 11.1% ASHAs addressed specific barriers for adopting healthy behaviors. Sixty eight (91.8%) ASHAs attended the training after which knowledge improved by 33.3% (p < 0.001). ASHAs in intervention areas were rated by mothers (n = 69) to have better communication skills (81.2% vs. 59.7%, p = 0.005), make more postnatal visits (52.2% vs. 22.2%; p < 0.001), give advice on newborn care (64% vs. 50.5%; p < 0.001) as compared to standard care area ASHAs. Endline survey (n = 1360) showed a significant improvement in frequency of antenatal visits (0.26;0.19-0.33), knowledge about free transport (0.12;0.05-0.18), better cord-care practices (0.15;0.07-0.22), kangaroo mother care (0.19;0.13-0.25), delayed first bath (0.13;0.06-0.20), restrictive handling (0.11;0.06-0.15) and hand-washing (0.19;0.13-0.25). Conclusions Quality improvement program can help improve ASHA's performance which in turn can address higher neonatal mortality in India.

AB  - Aims The 2017 Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) recommends subclassification of atypia of undetermined significance (AUS)/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) into six subcategories. The present study evaluates the risk of malignancy (ROM) and risk of neoplasm (RON) among these. Methods All thyroid aspirates reported as AUS/FLUS over a 4.5-year period, with available histology, were reviewed and subclassified as per TBSRTC. ROM and RON were calculated and compared. Results Of 2554 thyroid aspirates, 281 (11.0%) were AUS/FLUS. Eighty-one with available histology were evaluated. ROM was 51.8%. Cytologic and architectural atypia (AUS-C&A) was the most prevalent (62.9%), followed by Hurthle cell type (19.6%), AUS-A (11.1%), AUS-not otherwise specified (NOS) (7.4%), cytologic atypia (AUS-C) (4.9%) and atypical lymphoid cells (1.2%). Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and adenomatous goitre (AG) were the most common histological diagnoses (27% each). On histology, AUS-C had 2/4 PTC and 2/4 AG on histology. AUS-A had 4/9 follicular neoplasm (FN) and 2/9 non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) while AUS C&A had 18/51 PTC, 13/51 AG, 11/51 NIFTP and 5/51 FN. ROM and RON were similar across subcategories, ROM was the highest for AUS-C&A (58.8%), AUS-C (50%) and AUS-NOS (50%). NIFTP reclassification as non-malignant reduced ROM to 35.8% (absolute reduction of 16% and a relative decrease of 31%) with the greatest relative decrease seen in AUS-A (50%), followed by AUS-C&A (37%), and none in others. Conclusions AUS/FLUS subcategorisation helped to indicate risk for the more likely neoplasm, whether PTC or FN. ROM was the highest for cases with cytological atypia but did not differ significantly across different subcategories. NIFTP changed the ROM of AUS-A and AUS-C&A, since both NIFTP and FN have microfollicles.

AB  - Objective To evaluate effect of one year exercise intervention program on bone mineral accrual in children and adolescent with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods Fifty-two CF children (mean age 149.79 mo) were randomized into experimental (15 boys and 10 girls) and control groups (15 boys and 12 girls). Experimental group performed prescribed exercises three times/week, while control group continued with routine physical activities for one year. Following were assessed at baseline and at one year: Bone mineral density (BMD) of whole body and lumbar spine, pulmonary function, exercise capacity, quality of life and habitual activity. Results Change in whole body and lumbar spine BMD over 12 mo in experimental group was lower by 0.006 g/cm(2) (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02) and higher by 0.001 g/cm(2) (95% CI -0.04 to 0.03) than controls, respectively. However, difference between groups was non-significant for both parameters. Experimental group had a significant improvement in their exercise capacity (p = 0.006), quality of life, and serum vitamin D (p = 0.007) levels. Differences between groups for changes in pulmonary function and habitual activity were non-significant. Conclusions Exercise regime was not associated with significant improvement in BMD of CF patients, but it had a positive impact on both physical and psychological health of these patients.

AB  - Salmonella typhi is a causative organism for typhoid fever. Free Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi) is licensed for use as vaccine for typhoid fever in individuals 2 years of age and older, which has limited memory response. There is dire need of protein or peptide as conjugate partner with Vi polysaccharide to improve shortcomings of Vi vaccine. Prediction of immunogenic peptide was deduced by program T sites. Carbodiimide mediated conjugation of Vi polysaccharide with OmpCp was performed utilizing ADH as linker. Immune response of Vi-conjugates along with control group was tested in mice. Ig and IgG antibodies against Vi polysaccharide was measured by ELISA. Two immunodominant regions (loop number 3a and 7) with high content of T-cell epitopes from OmpC was selected and synthesized. Vi poly/OmpCp ratios in Vi-conjugates were similar to 0.43-0.65. Vi polysaccharide alone elicited very low levels of Vi antibody without any booster effect. Vi-conjugate evoked 20-fold higher immune response compared to free Vi. Further, adequate levels of IgG antibodies were induced only by the Vi-conjugate suggesting that T-helper cells had been induced. Our data suggest that selected short peptide (OmpCp)as a carrier with Vi polysaccharide is assumed to be a promising molecule for candidate vaccine for typhoid fever.

AB  - Introduction: The college students are prone to use internet in a manner that could negatively affect several aspects of their life. The present study is one of the largest studies to be undertaken in India, aimed at understanding the existing pattern of internet use and estimating the prevalence of problematic internet use (PIU) among college students.
   Materials and Methods: The Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 (GPIUS-2) was used to assess the PIU. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to ascertain the relationship between GPIUS-2 total score and demographic and internet use-related variables.
   Results: Of 3973 respondents from 23 engineering colleges located in the different parts of the country, about one-fourth (25.4%) had GPIUS-2 scores suggestive of PIU. Among the variables studied, older age, greater time spent online per day, and use of internet mainly for social networking were associated with greater GPIUS-2 scores, indicating higher risk for PIU. Students who used internet mainly for academic activities and during evening hours of the day were less likely to have PIU.
   Conclusion: This study suggests PIU among engineering college students in India is an important public health concern. There is a need to create awareness among students, emerging adults, parents, and concerned authorities about the harms associated with PIU. Furthermore, there is a need to implement preventive strategies for inculcating pattern of safe and healthy internet usage among them. In addition, there is a need to develop public health policies for prevention and treatment of PIU and conduct further research to enhance our understanding about the same.

AB  - Background: Comparative characteristics of the cricothyroid injection and spray-as-you-go methods for lidocaine administration during diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy are not clear. Objectives: Co-primary outcomes were comparison of cough count from bronchoscope introduction until reaching carina and operator-rated overall procedure satisfaction on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) between groups. Secondary outcomes were cumulative lidocaine dose, procedure duration, assistant-rated cough, willingness to return for repeat procedure, and procedural complications between groups. Methods: Consecutive subjects were randomized (1:1) to either the cricothyroid or the spray-as-you-go method for topical anesthesia to the vocal cords and trachea. All received nasal 2% lidocaine gel and pharyngeal 10% lidocaine spray. Results: A total of 500 subjects were randomized, and 495 subjects were analyzed (248 cricothyroid and 247 spray-as-you-go). Cough count until reaching carina (median [range]) was significantly lower (cricothyroid, 1 [0-10], and spray-as-you-go, 4 [0-30], p < 0.0001) and operator-rated overall procedure satisfaction, VAS (mean +/- standard deviation) (cricothyroid, 7.86 +/- 1.39 and spray-as-you-go, 6.86 +/- 1.59, p < 0.0001) significantly greater in the cricothyroid group. Patient willingness to return for repeat procedure was greater (87.1 vs. 70.5%, p < 0.001)) and cumulative lidocaine dose significantly lower (305.08 +/- 13.40 vs. 322.18 +/- 10.67 mg, p < 0.001) in the cricothyroid group. Minor complications occurred in 6 patients in the cricothyroid group and 9 patients in the spray-as-you-go group. Conclusion: Cricothyroid lidocaine administration is associated with less cough and superior operator-rated procedure satisfaction during bronchoscopy at a lower cumulative lidocaine dose.

AB  - Background: Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are commonly used for management of lumbosacral radicular pain. Midline interlaminar (MIL) or transforaminal (TF) routes are commonly used. The TF route, although associated with higher delivery of drug to the ventral epidural space, has serious complications including spinal cord injury and permanent paralysis reported in literature. Therefore, there is a search for a technically better route with fewer complications and greater drug delivery into the ventral epidural space. Recently, a parasagittal interlaminar (PIL) approach has been defined.
   Objectives: We conducted this study to compare therapeutic effectiveness of 3 techniques of ESIs in patients having unilateral lumbar radiculopathy. Further, effect of ESI on bone mineral density (BMD) and serum osteocalcin levels were studied.
   Study Design: Randomized double-blind trial.
   Setting: Pain clinic of a tertiary care hospital.
   Methods: Sixty-five patients were randomly allocated into group MIL, group PIL, and group TF to receive epidural injection with 80 mg of methylprednisolone and 2 mL of 2% lidocaine. Effective pain relief and improvement in disability were assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MODQ) scores at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. Patients with < 50% relief received additional injection. Primary outcome of study was effective pain relief at 6 months. Mean change in VAS and MODQ scores, BMD, and serum osteocalcin levels were secondary outcome assessed.
   Results: Patients having effective pain relief were significantly higher in group PIL (16 of 20 [80%]) and group TF (15 of 20 [75%]) compared with group MIL. Patients receiving ESI in group PIL and group TF showed significantly lower VAS scores than group MIL (P = 0.02, P = 0.50 at 3 months and P = 0.00, P = 0.02 at 6 months, respectively). Mean MODQ scores in group PIL and group TF were significantly lower than group MIL. However, group PIL and group TF did not significantly differ in MODQ scores. There was no significant change in serum osteocalcin and BMD, as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan at 3 months.
   Limitations: The absence of a placebo control group, small sample size, and relatively short follow-up of 6 months were limitations.
   Conclusions: PIL approach is equivalent to TF and superior to MIL approach in terms of effective pain relief and decrease in disability in patients with unilateral lumbar radiculopathy. This study showed no deleterious effect on BMD.

AB  - Background: Chordoid meningiomas have an aggressive clinical course characterized by frequent recurrences. Recent whole-genome sequencing studies demonstrated Chr22 loss in chordoid meningiomas not accounted for by NF2 mutations. SMARCB1/INI1 is a candidate gene on Chr22, which has not been analyzed extensively in meningiomas. AKT1 mutation has been recently identified to be a driver of meningiomagenesis.
   Materials and Methods: Cases of chordoid meningioma were retrieved along with meningiomas of other subtypes for comparison. INI1 immunohistochemistry was performed. SMARCB1 and AKT1 were analyzed by sequencing.
   Results: Sixteen chordoid meningiomas were identified (1.1% of all meningiomas). Six cases (37.5%) showed loss of INI1 immunoexpression. All other meningioma subtypes (n = 16) retained INI1 immunoexpression. AKT1 E17K mutation was identified in one case (16.7%). Notably, SMARCB1 mutations were not identified in any of the chordoid meningiomas analyzed, including those showing INI1 loss immunohistochemically.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate loss of SMARCB 1/INI1 immunoexpression in chordoid meningiomas, adding to the tumors with INI 1 loss. However, in absence of INI1 mutation, mechanisms for INI1 loss require further evaluation. Identification of AKT1 mutation opens up new avenues for targeted therapy in patients with such aggressive tumors.

AB  - Background. The National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment modified the definition of blindness in 201 7 in line with the internationally accepted definition. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to compute pooled estimate of blindness in India among adults aged 50 years and above by using recent and old definitions of blindness.
   Methods. We retrieved population-based studies/surveys reporting the prevalence of blindness using recent (presenting vision <3/60 better eye) and previous (presenting vision <6/ 60 better eye) definitions in India during 1990-2017 from key search engines and grey literature. Two authors did an independent literature search and extracted relevant information. Pooled prevalence estimates were computed using Stata 12.0 by using the random effects model. Forest and funnel plots were generated. Stratification of results was also performed using two time periods: 1995-2005 and 2006-17.
   Results. A total of 18 published articles/reports were included for recent and 20 for previous definitions of blindness, involving 211 502 participants. The pooled prevalence (95% confidence interval [CI]) obtained for recent and previous definitions of blindness in India was found to be 6.11% (5.07%-7.14%) and 9.91% (8.57%-11.25%), respectively. The stratified pooled prevalence (95% CI) from rapid surveys was 4.81% (3.26%-6.35%) and 4.68% (2.91 %-6.46%) for studies published during 1995-2005 and 2006-17, respectively, using the new definition. The corresponding figures for comprehensive surveys were 9.22% (95% CI 6.48%-1 1.96%) for the period 1995-2005 and 3.81% (95% CI 2.76%-4.84%) for the period 2006-17.
   Conclusion. There is a decrease in the prevalence of blindness in India using recent and previous definitions and a declining trend overtime. High quantum of blindness remains an unfinished public health agenda for implementing programmes in larger populations to reduce its burden.

AB  - In the study, Granger causality frequency analysis based on directed coherence is utilized to detect and quantify directional interaction among heart rate, systolic blood pressure and respiratory signal during postural stress from supine to standing and from standing to supine. The directional information flow during postural stress from supine to standing is dominant on cardiorespiratory interaction, vasculo-respiratory interaction and cardiovascular interaction. Conversely, the reverse postural stress from standing to supine resulted in a contrary effect on both cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular interactions without significant change in vasculo-respiratory interaction. Based on the power change, we observed that postural stress gets affected by both cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular but not by vasculo-respiratory system. Therefore, the directed coherence power calculated for each interaction helps to identify short-term regulatory mechanism during postural stress.

AB  - Background: Cardiac myxoma is the most common primary benign tumor of the heart and it has diverse clinical presentations. It is known to embolize into systemic circulation. However, presentation with complete occlusion of the aorta is uncommon. Case Report: We report an 18-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with features of acute bilateral limb ischemia. Arterial Doppler ultrasonography showed infrarenal aortic occlusion. A bedside cardiac ultrasound was done in the emergency department which clinched the diagnosis of atrial myxoma. Complete surgical excision of the tumor and subsequent histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of atrial myxoma. Why Should an Emergency Physician be Aware of This?: This report puts emphasis on the fact that atrial myxoma, though rare, may be considered as a source of embolism in patients presenting with acute limb ischemia. The importance of bedside ultrasonography for early diagnosis in such presentations is also highlighted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The purpose of our study was to compare magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) as a diagnostic modality against the gold standard of wrist arthroscopy in the evaluation of chronic wrist pain. Materials and Methods: Thirty three patients with chronic wrist pain suspected to have ligament injuries of the wrist were prospectively recruited. They underwent MRA examinations followed by wrist arthroscopy. Arthroscopic findings were compared with radiological findings focusing on three important structures - triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), scapholunate ligament (SLL), and lunotriquetral ligament (LTL). Results: For the 17 patients with TFCC tears/perforations on arthroscopy, MRA gave a sensitivity (SEN) = 88%, specificity (SPE) = 87.5%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) = 87.5%. For the 13 patients with SLL tears on arthroscopy, MRA gave SEN = 77%, SPE = 100%, PPV = 100%, and NPV = 87%. For the 7 patients with LTL tears on arthroscopy, MRA gave SEN = 29%, SPE = 100%, PPV = 100%, and NPV = 84%. A composite correlation between findings on MRA and wrist arthroscopy revealed an overall SEN = 73%, SPE = 96%, PPV = 93%, and NPV = 85% for MRA, with overall accuracy = 88%. Conclusions: The presented diagnostic results of MRA are superior to those of magnetic resonance imaging quoted in literature. MRA is a potent tool for evaluating chronic wrist pain but tends to miss lesions of intrinsic carpal ligaments (SLL and LTL) more than TFCC. Wrist arthroscopy may be recommended when the clinical suspicion is strong.

AB  - Background: Type D personality has been linked to negative outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Our objective was to determine the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Type D personality construct among people with AMI in the Indian clinical setting.
   Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted between August 2016 and July 2017, 200 consecutive patients with AMI admitted to a tertiary care center completed the Tamil version of the Type D scale-14 (DS-14). The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised-Short Form (EPQR-S) was also administered to check the convergent/divergent validity.
   Results: The prevalence of Type D personality was 24%. Results of the principal components analysis revealed a four-factor solution for the Tamil version of the DS-14 which explained more than 75% of the variability. Strong convergent validity with the neuroticism subscale of EPQR-S (r = 0.84, P < 0.001) and divergent validity with the extraversion subscale (r = -0.75, P < 0.001) was noted. The two subscales of the Type D scale, negative affectivity and social inhibition (SI), demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.85 and 0.76, respectively). Dropping item no 14 from the DS-14 led to significant increase in internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.81) for the SI subconstruct.
   Conclusion: Among an Indian Tamil-speaking clinical sample of patients with AMI, Type D is a valid construct and can be assessed using the regional version of the DS-14 which showed a four-factor structure and good psychometric properties. Item no. 14 of the DS-14 scale may need modification for the Indian setting.

AB  - Objectives To compare development/cognition, adaptive function and maladaptive behavior of HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children between 2 to 9 years with HIV-uninfected controls. Methods This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November, 2013 to March, 2015. 50 seropositive HIV-infected, 25 HIV-exposed uninfected and 25 HIV-uninfected children between 2 to 9 years were administered Developmental Profile 3, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 2, and Child Behavior Checklist for assessing development, adaptive function and maladaptive behaviour, respectively. Additional data were obtained by history, examination and review of records. Results Significant developmental/cognitive impairment was observed in 38 (76%), 16 (64%) and 6 (24%) HIV-infected, HIV-exposed uninfected, and HIV-uninfected children, respectively. Significant impairment in adaptive function was found in 12 (24%) and 2 (8%) HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children, respectively. Maladaptive behavior was not seen in any group. Conclusions High magnitude of impaired development/cognition and adaptive function in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children warrants assessment of these domains during follow-up of these children, and incorporation of interventions for these deficits in standard care for this group.

AB  - Background: Aging of the human retina is accompanied by oxidative stress that exerts profound changes in the retinal neurons. It is unknown if oxidative stress influences the cellular components of the retinal vessels in some ways.
   Methods: We examined changes in retinal vessels in human donor eyes (age: 35-94 years; N= 18) by light and transmission electron microscopy, TUNEL and immunohistochemistry for biomarkers of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC; actin), oxidative stress (4-hydroxy 2-nonenal [HNE] and nitrotyrosine), microglia (Iba-1) and vessels (isolectin B-4).
   Results: The earliest changes in the endothelium and pericytes of capillaries are apparent from the seventh decade. With aging, there is clear loss of organelles and cytoplasmic filaments, and a progressive thickening of the endothelial and pericyte basal lamina. Loss of filaments, accumulation of lipofuscin and autophagic vacuoles are significant events in aging pericytes and SMC. Actin immunolabelling reveals discontinuity in arterial SMC layers during eighth decade, indicating partial degeneration of SMC. This is followed by hyalinization, with degeneration of the endothelium and SMC in arteries and arterioles of the nerve fibre layer (NFL) and ganglion cell layer in ninth decade. Iba-1 positive microglia were in close contact with the damaged vessels in inner retina, and their cytoplasm was rich in lysosomes. HNE immunoreactivity, but not of nitrotyrosine, was detected in aged vessels from seventh decade onwards, suggesting that lipid peroxidation is a major problem of aged vessels. However, TUNEL positivity seen during this period was limited to few arteries and venules of NFL.
   Conclusion: This study shows prominent age-related alterations of the pericytes and SMC of retinal vessels. These changes may limit the energy supply to the neurons and be responsible for age-related loss of neurons of the inner retina. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background & objectives: The well-being of donors undergoing frequent plateletpheresis has been a matter of concern. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of frequent plateletpheresis on the haematological parameters (HP) of repeat donors.Methods: The study was conducted during February 2016 to March 2017 on all the repeat plateletpheresis donors undergoing the 2nd plateletpheresis within a month of the first in a tertiary care centre. Donors repeating plateletpheresis 3rd and 4th times were also studied. The values of the HP observed on follow up after plateletpheresis done on three different separators were compared. Results: HPs of the 98 donors were similar at follow up except mean platelet volume (P <0.05). Of the 98 donors, 35 were followed up within a week and 63 were followed up within 8-30 days. No significant alteration was found in the HPs except a significant difference in the variation of platelet counts of the two groups (P=0.025). In 34 donors who presented 3rd time for plateletpheresis (mean gap between 1st and 3rd plateletpheresis=31 days), no significant differences in the HPs were found except the platelet distribution width (P <0.05). Minimal difference in the HP was found in the baseline and the follow up of 3rd plateletpheresis i.e., at 4th plateletpheresis donation. Plateletpheresis through all the three cell separators used had similar effects on the follow up HPs.Interpretation & conclusions: Repeated plateletpheresis can be done without any detrimental effects on the cell counts of the plateletpheresis donors. The three cell separators yielded similar post-donation follow up haematological parameters.

AB  - Lately silk fibroin has gained a lot of popularity as a tissue engineering scaffold due to its exceptional mechanical properties, negligible inflammatory reactions, remarkable biocompatibility, and tunable biodegradability. Nonetheless, 3 dimensional (3D) silk fibroin based scaffolds, which allow simultaneous formation of scaffolds and cell encapsulation with minimal damage to the cells, are unavailable, as most of the methods involve the use of some cell destructive techniques. Thus, cells have to be loaded after the scaffold formation and the study has to rely upon the ability of the cells to penetrate the scaffold to obtain a 3D microenvironment. Hence, these platforms do not allow for a true 3D system replicating the in vivo environment. Here silk fibroin-alginate based beads have been developed, and retain silk fibroin for a longer period of time and allow for simultaneous cell encapsulation as the crosslinking method is cell-compatible. It is demonstrated for the first time that these silk fibroin-alginate beads can be used to encapsulate the cells at varying cell densities depending on the desired application. These beads were further used to study the effect of functional groups on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) differentiation in 3D, by utilizing carboxylic groups naturally present in alginate as well as introducing phosphate groups. The results showed that these beads were able to support the growth and proliferation of hMSCs and induced differentiation solely due to functional groups within 14 days. These beads were better in directing hMSC differentiation into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages compared to 2D surfaces and differentiation media.

AB  - Mycobacterium leprae infection causes bone lesions and osteoporosis, however, the effect of antileprosy drugs on the bone is unknown. We, therefore, set out to address it by investigating osteogenic differentiation from bonemarrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stemcells (MSCs). Out of 7 antileprosy drugs, only clofazimine (CFZ) reduced MSCs viability (IC50 similar to 1 mu M) and their osteogenic differentiation but increased adipogenic differentiation on a par with rosiglitazone, and this effect was blocked by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonist, GW9662. CFZ also decreased osteoblast viability and resulted in impaired bone regeneration in a rat femur osteotomymodel at one-third human drug dose owing to increased callus adipogenesis as GW9662 prevented this effect. CFZ treatment decreased BM MSC population and homing of MSC to osteotomy site despite drug levels in BM being much less than its in vitro IC50 value. In adult rats, CFZ caused osteopenia in long bones marked by suppressed osteoblast function due to enhanced adipogenesis and increased osteoclast functions. A robust increase in marrow adipose tissue (MAT) by CFZ did not alter the hematologic parameters but likely reduced BM vascular bed leading to osteonecrosis (ON) characterized by empty osteocyte lacunae. However, CFZ had no effect on visceral fat content and was not associated with any metabolic and hematologic changes. Levels of unsaturated fatty acids in MAT were higher than saturated fatty acids and CFZ further increased the former. From these data, we conclude that CFZ has adverse skeletal effects and could be used for creating a rodent ON model devoid of extraskeletal effects.

AB  - Background Intentional or unintentional ingestions among children and adolescents are common. There are a number of ingestions amenable to renal replacement therapy (RRT).
   Methods We systematically searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for literature regarding drugs/intoxicants and treatment with RRT in pediatric populations. Two experts from the PCRRT (Pediatric Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy) workgroup assessed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for extraction of data. The data from the literature search was shared with the PCRRT workgroup and two expert toxicologists, and expert panel recommendations were developed.
   Results and Conclusions We have presented the recommendations concerning the use of RRTs for treatment of intoxications with toxic alcohols, lithium, vancomycin, theophylline, barbiturates, metformin, carbamazepine, methotrexate, phenytoin, acetaminophen, salicylates, valproic acid, and aminoglycosides.

AB  - Purpose. Acute bacterial meningitis continues to be a potentially life threatening condition. Hospital-acquired meningitis is rapidly increasing and adding an immense burden to the health system due to the emergence of multidrug resistance isolates. The purpose of this study is to find the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the bacteria detected from hospital- and community-acquired meningitis.
   Methodology. A total of 400 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the suspected meningitis cases were collected and processed for cell count, biochemical examination, Gram staining, latex agglutination and culture. Bacteria grown on blood, chocolate and Mac-conkey agar were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed as per Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines.
   Results. Of the isolates, most prevalent Gram negative organisms in hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis were Escherichia coli 13 (27.08%), Acinetobacter baumannii 12 (25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 5 (10.42%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (8.33%) and Gram positive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus 4 (8.33%), Enterococcus faecium 3 (6.25 %) and CONS 2 (4.16 %). Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 (6.25%) was the predominant organism in community-acquired bacterial meningitis. All the Gram negative isolates were multidrug resistance. Only colistin and imipenem were effective antibiotics against them. Likewise Gram positive organisms were susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. However, E. faecium was only susceptible to Vanco+Teicoplanin.
   Conclusion. In hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis, multidrug resistance Gram negative bacteria are a huge challenge for the treatment of patients. Hence, antimicrobial stewardship should be followed to counteract with the emerging multidrug resistance isolates.

AB  - LIFR functions as a tumor suppressor and metastatic suppressor of breast cancer. The present study investigates the status of LIFR gene in Indian breast cancer patients. A total of 137 breast cancer tissue and 137 adjacent normal tissue which served as controls were analyzed for mutation by automated DNA sequencing, methylation through methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and its corresponding expression at mRNA and protein level using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry respectively in Indian breast cancer patients. All the molecular findings were statistically correlated with clinopathological parameters of the patients to identify its association. LIFR mRNA expression was found to be 2.534 +/- 3.52 fold downregulated with subsequent absence of protein in 67.15% cases (92/137). The absence of LIFR protein coincided with 80.95% (85/105) methylated cases thereby showing a very strong correlation among the LIFR promoter methylation and LIFR protein expression (p = 0.0001). We also observed G2968C nucleotide change in 6/137 cases of exon 20 of LIFR gene resulting in Glu990Gln mutation. Correlation of LIFR promoter methylation with geographic location and age at menopause and LIFR mutation with age at menarche, age at first live birth, molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and lymph node status remained significant even after bonferroni correction (p <= 0.0027). All these data suggests the relevance of these associations in relation to Indian breast cancer patients. The loss of LIFR protein was frequently found in Indian breast cancer patients, and aberrant promoter methylation showed a significant correlation with its downregulation.

AB  - Background. This article reports the results of one of a series of global field studies implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the accuracy, clinical utility, and global applicability of the new diagnostic guidelines for Mental, Behavioural and Neurological Disorders included in the next version of WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).
   Aims of the study. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility ratings of global clinicians implementing the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorders, relative to those applying ICD-10 guidelines. The study also aimed to identify elements of the guidelines that required further refinement or clarification.
   Methods. 1840 global mental health professionals registered with WHO's Global Clinical Practice Network completed the study in one of six study languages. Participants were randomly assigned to apply either the ICD-11 or ICD-10 guidelines to diagnose standardized case vignettes, and to rate the clinical utility of their assigned guidelines.
   Results. ICD-11's diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility were equivalent or superior to that of ICD-10. Global clinicians were significantly more accurate in diagnosing Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Specific Phobia and adult cases of Separation Anxiety Disorder when using ICD-11 and provided high clinical utility ratings for these disorders. Clinicians also found the ICD-11 guidelines easy to use, clear, and a good fit to patients they see in their clinical practice. However, clinicians had difficulty with distinguishing the boundary between disorder and normality for subthreshold cases of anxiety, and also with applying the new ICD-11 guidelines on panic attacks.
   Conclusions. The new diagnostic guidelines for Anxiety Disorders in ICD-11 can be applied in an acceptably consistent manner by global clinicians and perform as well or better than the previous guidelines for ICD-10. Study findings also helped identify aspects of the ICD-11 guidelines that required refinement prior to their publication and areas that should be emphasized in training programs. (C) 2019 IMSS.

AB  - Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder, characterized by dysregulated insulin secretion. Pathogenic variants in at least twelve different genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A, HNF1A, UCP2, TRMT10A HK1, and PGM1) are known to cause CHI. Pathogenic variants in the GLUD1 gene, which encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), account for 5% of the cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Pathogenic variants in GLUD1 typically present in late infancy, are diet and/or diazoxide-responsive and cause protein-induced hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia as insulin secretion is triggered by allosteric activation of GDH by leucine. The authors are presenting three unrelated Indian children, who manifested with fasting as well as dietary protein induced hypoglycemia in late infancy, and were diagnosed to have hyperinsulinemic hyperammonemic hypoglycemia due to pathogenic variants in GLUD1. Although the hypoglycemia responded to diazoxide, delayed diagnosis and irregular treatment had resulted in neurological problems in two of the three children. Early identification, appropriate dietary modifications and regular treatment with diazoxide can prevent adverse neurological outcome.

AB  - Somatic-type malignancy arising in a teratoma of the sinonasal region is extremely unusual, creating a diagnostic dilemma. There are no definite guidelines for management of such cases. A 15-year-old male with a maxillary mass was misdiagnosed as angiomyolipoma, maxillary carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and ter-atocarcinosarcoma, followed by the final diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma arising in an immature teratoma. He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery and chemo-radiotherapy, and is disease-free at 21 months. This case highlights the difficulty faced when diagnosing neoplasms unusual to the head and neck region, particularly on small biopsies, and good outcome following appropriate multimodality management.

Bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines were licensed in the country in 2008, and a nonavalent vaccine was licensed in 2018. Demonstration projects initiated in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat in 2009 introduced HPV vaccination in public health services in India. Following a few deaths in these projects, although subsequently deemed unrelated to vaccination, HPV vaccination in research projects was suspended. This suspension by default resulted in some participants in a trial evaluating two versus three doses receiving only one dose. Since 2016, the successful introduction of HPV vaccination in immunisation programmes in Punjab and Sikkim (with high coverage and safety), government-sponsored opportunistic vaccination in Delhi, prospects of a single dose providing protection, and future availability of an affordable Indian vaccine shows promise for future widespread implementation and evaluation of HPV vaccination in India.

AB  - Objective: The study investigated overall adverse event (AE) burden and specifically psychiatric and behavioral side effects (PBAEs) in persons with epilepsy (PWE) on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) monotherapy. It also assessed their correlation with neuroendocrine and oxidative stress biomarkers.
   Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital between 2016 and 2018. Persons with epilepsy above 18 years on monotherapy of levetiracetam (LEV) and conventional AEDs {carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), or valproate (VPA)) for at least 6 months were enrolled. Validated questionnaires, 'Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 7.02)', 'Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21)', 'Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ)', 'patient-weighted Quality of life Index in Epilepsy (QOLIE-10)', 'Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)', and 'Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (LAEP)' were used to assess the PBAEs, quality of life, sleep quality, and AE profile. A subgroup of PWE recruited consecutively were considered for estimation of the following neuroendocrine biomarker levels: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) which were then correlated with scores of above questionnaires.
   Results: After screening 220 PWE, 163 PWE (58 on LEV and 105 on conventional AEDs) with a mean age of 29 +/- 10 years were enrolled. Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview revealed that LEV group had higher association with PBAEs and lower quality of sleep compared to conventional AEDs (p = 0.032 and 0.046, respectively). Other scales did not show significant difference between LEV and conventional AEDs. In the subset of PWE (n = 74, 36 on LEV and 38 on conventional AEDs), LEV group had more association with the PBAEs (p = 0.010), higher physical aggression and anger components of BPAQ (p = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively), and more AE (p = 0.049) than conventional AED group. However, there was no significant difference in neuroendocrine biomarker levels.
   Conclusion: Levetiracetam had a higher association with PBAEs and more AE when compared to conventional AEDs. There was no differential correlation of AEDs with the following neuroendocrine markers: BDNF, HVA, 5-HIAA, and TAC. These facts necessitate exploration of other mechanisms for LEV-induced PBAEs.

AB  - Obesity has become a major public health concern worldwide due to its high social and economic burden, caused by its related comorbidities, impacting physical and mental health. Dietary fat is an important source of energy along with its rewarding and reinforcing properties. The nutritional recommendations for dietary fat vary from one country to another; however, the dietary reference intake (DRI) recommends not consuming more than 35% of total calories as fat. Food rich in fat is hyperpalatable, and is liable to be consumed in excess amounts. Food addiction as a concept has gained traction in recent years, as some aspects of addiction have been demonstrated for certain varieties of food. Fat addiction can be a diagnosable condition, which has similarities with the construct of addictive disorders, and is distinct from eating disorders or normal eating behaviors. Psychological vulnerabilities like attentional biases have been identified in individuals described to be having such addiction. Animal models have provided an opportunity to explore this concept in an experimental setting. This discussion sheds light on fat addiction, and explores its physiological and psychological implications. The discussion attempts to collate the emerging literature on addiction to fat rich diets as a prominent subset of food addiction. It aims at addressing the clinical relevance at the community level, the psychological correlates of such fat addiction, and the current physiological research directions.

AB  - Multiple transposition procedures have been described for management of lateral rectus palsy. However, relative effect and indications of each procedure are unclear. This systematic review was planned to evaluate functional and anatomical outcomes of vertical rectus transposition (VRT) surgery in patients with lateral rectus palsy. We searched databases in English language, namely, MEDLINE, PubMed Central, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Index Copernicus without any date restrictions in electronic searches, using the search words 'vertical rectus transposition for lateral rectus palsy," "vertical rectus transposition for abducens palsy," "superior rectus transposition," "inferior rectus transposition," and "Hummelsheim procedure." References of the selected publications were also searched to find any relevant studies. We searched for studies that provided data on single VRT and double VRT surgeries for lateral rectus palsies. Three authors independently assessed the related studies gathered from electronic and manual searches. We found 27 studies which were relevant to the review question. As there were no randomized control trials (RCTs) available related to our study question, nonrandomized studies were used to arrive at summarization of outcomes of different transposition procedures. There is a need for prospective RCTs to investigate the different types of transposition procedures for lateral rectus palsy.

AB  - Background. Women's experiences of female sexual difficulties are shaped by cultural expectations.
   Aim of the study. To investigate the cultural validity and clinical utility of the classification of female sexual dysfunctions (FSD) in the International Classification of Diseases - 11th Revision (ICD-11) among Indian Women.
   Methods. A purposive sample of 22 married women with probable sexual problems underwent cognitive interviews that were conducted using a semi-structured guide. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively to help establish the content and cultural validity of the ICD-11 classification of FSD.
   Results. Most participants had limited knowledge of the sexual act, felt unskilled in sex, and were led by their husbands in sexual matters. Many participants reported problems related to sexual dysfunction and sexual pain-penetration. Many participants with sexual pain-penetration issues and some with low sexual desire considered these symptoms to be problematic; however, this was rarely the case with the absence or lack of sexual arousal and orgasm. The application of the 'independent focus of clinical attention' requirement for diagnosis reduced cases by half for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) and almost eliminated all cases of Female Sexual Arousal Dysfunction (FSAD) and Anorgasmia. Hence, this requirement was moved from essential (required) features to `additional features' of the final ICD-11 sexual dysfunction guidelines.
   Conclusion. Advancement toward a more precise nomenclature and classification system of FSD will facilitate better diagnosis which will ultimately lead to improved care for women with sexual dysfunction. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of IMSS.

KW  - IDENTIFY
AB  - Background & objectives: The burden of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease is increasing worldwide. The disease shares clinicoradiological features with tuberculosis (TB), Nocardia and several fungal diseases, and its diagnosis is frequently delayed. The present study was performed to determine the frequency of NTM disease among TB suspects in a tertiary care centre in north India.Methods: In this prospective study, mycobacterial culture isolates from pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens among TB suspects were tested with immunochromatographic assay (ICA). All ICA-negative isolates were considered as NTM suspects and further subjected to 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer gene sequencing for confirmation and species identification. Patients with active disease were treated with drug regimen as per the identified NTM species. Follow up of patients was done to determine clinical, radiological and microbiological outcomes.Results: Of the 5409 TB suspects, 42 (0.77%) were diagnosed with NTM disease. Patients with active disease consenting for treatment were treated and followed up. Thirty four patients had NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) and the remaining eight had extrapulmonary NTM (EP-NTM) disease. Mycobacterium intracellulare and M. abscessus, respectively, were most frequently isolated from NTM-PD and EP-NTM patients. Fifteen NTM-PD and seven EP-NTM patients successfully completed the treatment. Ten patients died due to unrelated causes, five were lost to follow up and another four declined the treatment.Interpretation & conclusions: Our study showed that the frequency of NTM disease was low among TB suspects at a large tertiary care centre in north India and this finding was similar to other Indian studies. More studies need to be done in other parts of the country to know the geographical variation in NTM disease, if any.

AB  - Paraffin immunofluorescence is a well established "salvage" technique in renal pathology when representative glomeruli are not found in the fresh frozen tissue sent for routine direct immunofluorescence studies. A step of enzymatic digestion of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy exposes the antigenic immune complexes and allows staining with fluorochrome-tagged antibodies. We explored the utility of the technique of paraffin immunofluorescence outside the kidney in certain specific scenarios including extra renal amyloid and duodenal macroglobulinemia.

AB  - Background: Facial papules are a feature of several clinical conditions and may present both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
   Aim: To describe a grouped papular eruption on the nose and adjoining cheeks that has not been well characterized previously.
   Materials and Methods: A series of consecutive patients with a papular eruption predominantly involving nose and cheeks were evaluated, treated and followed up prospectively at tertiary care centers. Demographic details, clinical features, histopathology and response to treatment were recorded.
   Results: There were five men and six women (mean age 29.9 +/- 6.9 years) who had disease for a mean duration of 17.3 +/- 11.1 months. All patients presented with a predominantly asymptomatic eruption of monomorphic, pseudovesicular, grouped, skin colored to slightly erythematous papules prominently involving the tip of nose, nasal alae, philtrum and the adjoining cheeks. A total of 15 biopsies from 11 patients were analyzed and the predominant finding was a dense, focal lymphoid infiltrate restricted to the upper dermis with basal cell damage and atrophy of the overlying epidermis. The eruption ran a chronic course from several months to years.
   Limitations: Direct immunofluorescence could not be performed except in one case. Immunohistochemical stains for CD4 and CD8 could not be done owing to nonavailability. Phototesting was undertaken in one patient only.
   Conclusion: Small grouped papules on the nose and adjoining skin with a lichenoid histopathology appear to represent a distinct clinicopathological entity. It may be related to actinic lichen nitidus/micropapular variant of polymorphous light eruption.

AB  - Objectives To describe the pattern and clinical-psychiatric profile of patients presenting with deliberate self-harm attempt to an emergency setting. Methods The study involves the analysis of the case records of 109 consecutive patients with deliberate self-harm evaluated by the psychiatric emergency team at a premier, tertiary care hospital in India over a period of 13 months (January 2015-January 2016). Results Deliberate self-harm had a clinical prevalence of 16.4% (109/666) among total mental and behavioral emergencies attended in the same period. A large majority of attempters were in the age range of 18-39 years (84.4%), and females (58.7%) outnumbered males in total sample. Married females and unmarried males had significantly higher chances of attempting deliberate self-harm (chi(2) = 6.57, p = 0.01). More than half (52.3%) of patients were found to have a diagnosable psychiatric illness at the time of presentation, most common being depressive disorder in 19.3% of overall sample. Past history of a psychiatric illness was evident in only 12.5% of patients. Common methods of deliberate self-harm were prescription drug/psychotropic overdose, poisoning with ingestion of phenyl cleaner or rat-killer poison. Significant gender differences were observed in the nature of precipitating events for deliberate self-harm, with interpersonal relationship problems being significantly more common in women (p = 0.03). Conclusion This study adds relevant and useful information on cross-cutting as well as gender-specific characteristics of patients presenting with deliberate self-harm attempt, from a developing country context. The study findings bear implications for designing interventions for primary and secondary prevention of such behavioral emergencies at a community level.

AB  - Traumatic dental injuries (TDI) or tooth trauma have a global prevalence of 10-15%. These are often the cause of first visit to emergency room. Prognosis of teeth after injury is dependent on type of TDI, emergency treatment and time elapsed till definitive care. The low level of awareness among general public and medical practitioners often leads to delay in seeking treatment which often leads to pain, severe symptoms and poor prognosis. Pediatricians can play a significant role in identification of TDI, health advise, emergency care and referral to dentists. This paper highlights the important features to be noted in children with history of TDI and the key steps which needs to be taken in these situations.

AB  - The tuberculosis associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) frequently complicates the course of HIV/AIDS and HIV-TB treatment and its immunological mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we investigated T-cells frequencies, their secreted chemokines and cytokines. In this prospective case-control study, HIV/AIDS and HIV-TB patients during treatment with highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) and anti-TB treatment were followed for TB-IRIS development. Age, gender. and BMI-matched patients without IRIS constituted as "Controls" (non-IRIS). Activation and proliferation were assessed in CD4 and CD8 cell compartments. CCR4, CCR6 and T-reg cells were also analysed'in PBMCs. Cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, 1L-10, IFN-gamma and TGF-beta 1) and chemokines (IP-10, MCP-1, MIG and RANTES) were measured in culture supernatants. Of 560 enrolled HIV/AIDS patients, TB-IRIS developed in 50 (8.9%) patients (25-paradoxical and 25-unmasking) at a median interval of 35-days (IQR, 24-78). After ART therapy, CD8+ T-cell proportion decreased in both paradoxical and unmasking-TB-IRIS as compared to non-IRIS. Simultaneously, activation of CD4+ T-cells was observed in unmasking TB-IRIS only. Similarly, CD161+ T-cells, Th17-cells and inflammatory cytokines like IFN-gamma, IP-10 and MIG elevated in both TB-IRIS subgroups as compared to non-IRIS.In conclusion, during HAART treatment the dominance of pro-inflammatory cells-and cytokines in TB-IRIS patients favours the development of IRIS event. On the other hand, in non-IRIS patients relative increase of anti-inflammatory cells and cytokines prevents the development of IRIS event.

A1  - RELISH Consortium
TI  - Large expert-curated database for benchmarking document similarity detection in biomedical literature search
T2  - DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION
KW  - RECOMMENDER-SYSTEMS
AB  - Document recommendation systems for locating relevant literature have mostly relied on methods developed a decade ago. This is largely due to the lack of a large offline gold-standard benchmark of relevant documents that cover a variety of research fields such that newly developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed articles. The collected data cover 76% of all unique PubMed Medical Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across different experience levels, research fields or time spent on annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles. The established database server located at https://relishdb.ict.griffith.edu.au is freely available for the downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods. We expect that this benchmark will be useful for stimulating the development of new powerful techniques for title and title/abstract-based search engines for relevant articles in biomedical research.

AB  - Background Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of non-malignant hamartomas in multiple vital organs. TSC1 and TSC2 gene products form TSC heterodimer that senses specific cell growth conditions to control mTORC1 signalling. Methods In the present study 98 TSC patients were tested for variants in TSC1 and TSC2 genes and 14 novel missense variations were identified. The pathogenecity of these novel variations was determined by applying different bioinformatics tools involving computer aided protein modeling. Results Protein modelling could be done only for ten variants which were within the functional part of the protein. Homology modeling is the most reliable method for structure prediction of a protein. Since no sequence homology structure was available for the tuberin protein, three dimensional structure was modeled by a combination of homology modeling and the predictive fold recognition and threading method using Phyre2 threading server. The best template structures for model building of the TSC1 interacting domain, tuberin domain and GAP domain are the crystal structures of clathrin adaptor core protein, Rap1GAP catalytic domain and Ser/Thr kinase Tor protein respectively. Conclusions In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the impact of each novel missense variant based on their TSC1-TSC2 hydrophobic interactions and its effect on protein function.

AB  - Purpose To describe the natural history of diabetic macular edema (DME) with respect to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) outcomes and to identify baseline patient characteristics and systemic factors associated with improvement or worsening of outcomes in sham-treated patients. Methods The study population was sham-treated patients (n = 350) in the 3-year MEAD registration study of dexamethasone intravitreal implant for treatment of DME. Patients had center-involved DME and received sham intravitreal injections in the study eye at >= 6-month intervals. Potential prognostic factors for outcomes were evaluated using multiple linear regression analysis. Results Visual and anatomic outcomes were poorer in patients who left the study early (n = 198) than in study completers (n = 152). Mean change in BCVA from baseline at the last visit with available data was + 0.9 letters; 37.5% of patients had no change in BCVA, 23.2% had gained > 10 letters, and 16.0% had lost > 10 letters. Older age and baseline diabetic retinopathy score > 6 were associated with worse BCVA outcomes; thicker baseline CRT and larger number of hypertension medications used were associated with larger reductions in CRT during the study. Conclusions BCVA and CRT outcomes were variable in this population of DME patients with generally good glycemic control. In DME patients without active treatment, older age and baseline diabetic retinopathy score > 6 were associated with less improvement in BCVA; thicker baseline CRT and a larger number of antihypertensive medications used predicted better improvement in CRT.

AB  - Status of Fok I VDR polymorphism along with vitamin D, Vitamin D receptor (VDR), and cathelicidin levels in Tuberculosis (TB) patients compared to household contacts and implication of these findings in susceptibility to TB is not known. 150 active TB patients, 150 household contacts and 150 healthy controls were recruited from North Indian population. Fok1 VDR polymorphism was studied by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).VDR mRNA and protein levels were studied using quantitative real time PCR (q rt PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Cathelicidin and Vitamin D levels were measured using ELISA and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) respectively. Significant association was found between Fok1 polymorphism and susceptibility to TB (P < 0.0005). VDR mRNA, VDR protein and vitamin D levels were significantly lower in active TB group when compared to household contacts and healthy controls (P < 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.0005 respectively). Cathelicidin levels were higher in active TB patients compared to other groups (P < 0.0001). Expression of VDR and cathelicidin was significantly higher among 'FF' genotypes of VDR (more active form of VDR) compared to 'ff' genotype (less active form of VDR). 'f' allele was associated with increased susceptibility to TB. Higher frequency of 'F' allele, increased VDR expression along with increased vitamin D levels in household contacts compared to active TB group might be responsible for protection against active TB.

AB  - Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired inflammation at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic acid-dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and inflammation, leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in beta-glucocerebrosidase 1 (Gba1), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid metabolic genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.

AB  - BackgroundLittle is known of the outcome of patients with perianal Crohn's disease after stopping anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.
   AimTo evaluate the rate of relapse in perianal Crohn's disease (CD) after stopping anti-TNF therapy.
   MethodsConsecutive perianal CD patients treated with anti-TNF therapy with subsequent discontinuation were retrieved from prospective inflammatory bowel disease database of institutes in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore from 1997 to June 2019. Cumulative probability of perianal CD relapse was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.
   ResultsAfter a median follow-up of 89 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 65-173 months), 44 of the 78 perianal CD patients (56.4%) relapsed after stopping anti-TNF, defined as increased fistula drainage or recurrence of previously healed fistula, after stopping anti-TNF therapy. Cumulative probabilities of perianal CD relapse were 50.8%, 72.6% and 78.0% at 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively. Younger age at diagnosis of CD [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; P = .04] was associated with a higher chance of perianal CD relapse. Among those with perianal CD relapse (n = 44), retreatment with anti-TNF induced remission in 24 of 29 patients (82.8%). Twelve (27.3%) patients required defunctioning surgery and one (2.3%) required proctectomy. Maintenance with thiopurine was not associated with a reduced likelihood of relapse [HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.58-2.12; P = .77]. Among the 17 patients who achieved radiological remission of perianal CD, five (35.3%) developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy after a median of 6 months.
   ConclusionMore than half of the perianal CD patients developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy. Most regained response after resuming anti-TNF. However, more than one-fourth of the perianal CD patients with relapse required defunctioning surgery. Radiological assessment before stopping anti-TNF is crucial in perianal CD.

AB  - Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are rare and devastating tumors with limited therapeutic options. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression represents a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy. One hundred and twenty-six DMGs (89 adult and 37 pediatric) were assessed for immune profile (PD-L1, cluster of differentiation (CD3, CD8) and genetic markers (mutation in 27th amino acid of histone H3 (H3K27M), alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), p53) by immunohistochemistry. Sanger sequencing was done for IDH1 and H3K27M. The thalamus was the commonest site. Four molecular subgroups of DMGs were identified. H3K27M mutation was more frequent in children (P = 0.0001). The difference in median overall survival (OS) was not significant in any of the four molecular subgroups (P > 0.05). PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in H3K27M/IDH1 double-negative adult glioblastomas (GBMs) (P = 0.002). Strong PD-L1 expression was more frequent in grade IV tumors and thalamic location, although the difference was not significant (P = 0.14 and P = 0.19 respectively). Positive PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in median OS in PD-L1-positive versus negative cases among four genetic subgroups (P > 0.05). On univariate analysis, there was no direct correlation of PD-L1 with any genetic alteration, except H3K27M mutation (P = 0.01). CD3 infiltration was similar in both adults and pediatric ages (84.3% and 78.4%, respectively) while CD8 expression was significantly greater in adults compared to children (74.1% vs 37.8%, P = 0.0001). This is the first comprehensive analysis highlighting molecular and immune profiles of DMGs. Despite molecular and clinicopathological diversity, overall survival in DMGs remains dismal. Multicentric studies with larger numbers of cases should be undertaken for stratifying DMGs according to their age, immune and molecular profiles, to develop effective immunotherapies.

TI  - Characterization of biological variation of peripheral blood immune cytome in an Indian cohort
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - SYSTEM
AB  - Immune parameters show characteristic normal baseline levels and variance in the population. We characterised the degree of inter-individual and within-individual variation over one-year time period in 33 immune cell subsets by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 43 healthy young adult volunteers. Our analysis revealed that immune subsets that showed low variability between individuals also showed low short-term fluctuations within-individuals, as well as concordance in siblings. However, when baseline levels and degree of fluctuation were considered together, individuals failed to cluster into discreet groups. Together, the data reveal complex inter-relationships between immune subsets in individuals, and provide insights into the observed heterogeneity between individuals and between multiple immune subsets.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded (GAA) trinucleotide repeat in the FXN gene. The extended repeats expansion results in reduced transcription and, thereby, decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Given the ongoing drug trials, identification of reliable and easily accessible biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic intervention is a foremost requirement. In this study, comparative proteomic profiling of PBMC proteins from FRDA patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls was done using 2D-Differential in-Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed using BioGRID and STRING pathway analysis tools. Using biological variance analysis (BVA) and LC/MS, we found eight differentially expressed proteins with fold change >= 1.5; p <= 0.05. Based on their cellular function, the identified proteins showed a strong pathological role in neuroinflammation, cardiomyopathy, compromised glucose metabolism, and iron transport, which are the major clinical manifestations of FRDA. Protein-protein network analysis of differentially expressed proteins with frataxin further supports their involvement in the pathophysiology of FRDA. Considering their crucial role in the cardiac and neurological complications, respectively, the two downregulated proteins, actin a cardiac muscle 1 (ACTC1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit b (PDHE1), are suggested as potential prognostic markers for FRDA.

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of creatine (Cr) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-weighted MRI at 7 T in the human brain by optimizing the saturation pulse parameters and computing contrast using a Z-spectral fitting approach. The Cr-weighted (Cr-w) CEST contrast was computed from phantoms data. Simulations were carried out to obtain the optimum saturation parameters for Cr-w CEST with lower contribution from other brain metabolites. CEST-w images were acquired from the brains of four human subjects at different saturation parameters. The Cr-w CEST contrast was computed using both asymmetry analysis and Z-spectra fitting approaches (models 1 and 2, respectively) based on Lorentzian functions. For broad magnetization transfer (MT) effect, Gaussian and Super-Lorentzian line shapes were also evaluated. In the phantom study, the Cr-w CEST contrast showed a linear dependence on concentration in physiological range and a nonlinear dependence on saturation parameters. The in vivo Cr-w CEST map generated using asymmetry analysis from the brain represents mixed contrast with contribution from other metabolites as well and relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE). Simulations provided an estimate for the optimum range of saturation parameters to be used for acquiring brain CEST data. The optimum saturation parameters for Cr-w CEST to be used for brain data were around B-1rms = 1.45 mu T and duration = 2 seconds. The Z-spectral fitting approach enabled computation of individual components. This also resulted in mitigating the contribution from MT and rNOE to Cr-w CEST contrast, which is a major source of underestimation in asymmetry analysis. The proposed modified z-spectra fitting approach (model 2) is more stable to noise compared with model 1. Cr-w CEST contrast obtained using fitting was 6.98 +/- 0.31% in gray matter and 5.45 +/- 0.16% in white matter. Optimal saturation parameters reduced the contribution from other CEST effects to Cr-w CEST contrast, and the proposed Z-spectral fitting approach enabled computation of individual components in Z-spectra of the brain. Therefore, it is feasible to compute Cr-w CEST contrast with a lower contribution from other CEST and rNOE.

AB  - Purpose Non-canonical NF kappa B (NC-NF kappa B) pathway plays an influential role in metastasis, which promotes cancer proliferation and progression. The aim of the study was to examine the expression of NC-NF kappa B proteins and their correlation with clinicopathological factors associated with metastatic cases of uveal melanoma (UM) and with the patient outcome. Method Expression of NC-NF kappa B proteins (p52, RelB, and co-expression of p52/RelB) was evaluated in 75 formalin-fixed cases of uveal melanoma by immunohistochemistry. Validation of nuclear immunoreactivity was done by western blotting. Transcriptional status of NC-NF kappa B genes was assessed in 60 fresh tumor tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to determine the presence of native p52/RelB heterodimer in UM. Prognostic relevance was determined using Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan-Meier methods. Results Immunohistochemical expression of p52, RelB, and their co-expression was observed in 81%, 68.7%, 56.2% of metastatic cases, respectively, while their expression was seen only in 38%, 33% and 30% of non-metastatic cases. Loss of BAP-1 was correlated with expression of p52 and RelB proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the putative interaction of p52 with RelB protein in metastatic cases of uveal melanoma. Co-expression of p52/RelB and expression of p52 protein was significantly correlated with decreased metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p = 0.004; p = 0.002) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.004; p = 0.032), while the RelB expression only correlated with reduced MFS (p = 0.003). Conclusion Our data showed that non-canonical NF kappa B proteins were significantly higher in metastatic cases and associated with poor outcome of the patients. Furthermore, the p52 protein could be used as a potential therapeutic biomarker for metastatic cases in uveal melanoma.

AB  - Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based antimicrobial polymeric microspheres were synthesized and characterized in the present study. In first approach, hydrolysis of PAN microsphere was performed in alkaline medium to generate carboxylic groups, followed by iodination to obtain iodine incorporated hydrolyzed polymeric microspheres. In second approach, pendant nitrile groups of the PAN microspheres were reduced by lithium aluminum hydride to generate amino functionality. Incorporation of antimicrobial agent was achieved by reacting glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride onto the amine-terminated microspheres. Polymeric samples obtained by both approaches were characterized by analytical, morphological, and spectral techniques. Hydrolyzed microspheres showed higher aqueous swelling capacity, absorbing almost 2000% water in 10-12days. Both iodinated hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (I(2)HPAN) and quaternized polyacrylonitrile (QPAN) microspheres showed prominent zone of inhibition against both gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. Concentration and time-dependent bacterial mitigation was observed when different amounts of both I(2)HPAN and QPAN microspheres were mixed with bacterial solution. I(2)HPAN established higher killing efficacy than QPAN. PAN-based antimicrobial microspheres have strong potential to be used as broad spectrum antimicrobial matrices insoluble for water disinfection. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB  - Cognitive deficits in Schizophrenia interfere with everyday functioning and social functioning. Strong familial associations in schizophrenia might serve to establish cognitive impairments as endophenotypic markers. Therefore, visuo-spatial working memory simulating day-to-day activities at high memory load was assessed in patients with schizophrenia, their first-degree relatives and healthy controls to explore pre-trial and pre-response EEG microstates and their intracranial generators. Twenty-eight patients with schizophrenia, first-degree relatives and matched healthy controls participated in the study. Brain activity during visuo-spatial working memory task was recorded using 128-channel electroencephalography. Pre-trial and pre-response microstate maps of correct and error trials were clustered across groups according to their topography. Microstate map parameters and underlying cortical sources were compared among groups. Pre-trial (correct) microstate Map 1 was significantly different between controls and patients which could qualify it as a state marker with its intracranial generator localized to right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Pre-response (correct) microstate map was significantly different between controls and first-degree relatives which could be considered an endophenotypic marker for schizophrenia. No significant differences were observed for error trials between groups. rIFG which is involved in the execution of multi-component behaviour and selective inhibitory control could distinguish patients with schizophrenia from their first-degree relatives and healthy controls. Further, microstate based bio-markers have the potential to facilitate diagnosis of schizophrenia at a preclinical stage resulting in efficient diagnosis and better prognosis.

AB  - Background and aims: Internet use has increased worldwide exponentially over the past two decades, with no upto-date cross-country comparison of Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and its correlates available. The present study aimed to explore the pattern and correlates of PIU across different countries in the European and the Asian continent. Further, the stability of factors associated with PIU across different countries were assessed.
   Materials and methods: An international, cross-sectional study with a total of 2749 participants recruited from universities/colleges of eight countries: Bangladesh, Croatia, India, Nepal, Turkey, Serbia, Vietnam, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Participants completed the Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale -2 (GPIUS2) assessing PIU, and the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) assessing the depressive and anxiety symptoms.
   Results: A total of 2643 participants (mean age 21.3 +/- 2.6; 63% females) were included in the final analysis. The overall prevalence of PIU for the entire sample was 8.4% (range 1.6% to 12.6%). The mean GPIUS2 standardized scores were significantly higher among participants from the five Asian countries when compared to the three European countries. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were the most stable and strongest factors associated with PIU across different countries and cultures.
   Discussion and conclusions: The PIU is an important emerging mental health condition among college/university going young adults, with psychological distress being the strongest and most stable correlate of PIU across different countries and cultures in this study. The present study highlighted the importance of screening university and college students for PIU.

AB  - Filamentous fungi secrete various oxidative enzymes to degrade the glycosidic bonds of polysaccharides. Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) (E.C.1.1.99.18) is one of the important lignocellulose degrading enzymes produced by various filamentous fungi. It contains two stereo specific ligand binding domains, cytochrome and dehydrogenase - one for heme and the other for flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) respectively. The enzyme is of commercial importance for its use in amperometric biosensor, biofuel production, lactose determination in food, bioremediation etc. Termitomyces clypeatus, an edible fungus belonging to the basidiomycetes group, is a good producer of CDH. In this paper we have analyzed the structural properties of this enzyme from T. clypeatus and identified a distinct carbohydrate binding module (CBM) which is not present in most fungi belonging to the basidiomycetes group. In addition, the dehydrogenase domain of T. clypeatus CDH exhibited the absence of cellulose binding residues which is in contrast to the dehydrogenase domains of CDH of other basidiomycetes. Sequence analysis of cytochrome domain showed that the important residues of this domain were conserved like in other fungal CDHs. Phylogenetic tree, constructed using basidiomycetes and ascomycetes CDH sequences, has shown that very surprisingly the CDH from T. clypeatus, which is classified as a basidiomycetes fungus, is clustered with the ascomycetes group. A homology model of this protein has been constructed using the CDH enzyme of ascomycetes fungus Myricoccum thermophilum as a template since It has been found to be the best match sequence with T. clypeatus CDH. We also have modelled the protein with its substrate, cellobiose, which has helped us to identify the substrate interacting residues (L354, P606, T629, R631, Y649, N732, H733 and N781) localized within its dehydrogenase domain. Our computational investigation revealed for the first time the presence of all three domains - cytochrome, dehydrogenase and CBM - in the CDH of T. clypeatus, a basidiomycetes fungus. In addition to discovering the unique structural attributes of this enzyme from T. clypeatus, our study also discusses the possible phylogenetic status of this fungus.

AB  - Background Asynchronous activation of left ventricle (LV) due to chronic right ventricular (RV) pacing has been known to predispose to LV dysfunction. The predictors of LV dysfunction remain to be prospectively studied. This study was designed to follow up patients with RV pacing to look for development of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy (PiCMP), identify its predictors and draw comparison between apical vs non-apical RV pacing sites. Methods Three hundred sixty-three patients undergoing dual-chamber and single-chamber ventricular implants were enrolled and followed up. Baseline clinical parameters; paced QRS duration and axis; RV lead position by fluoroscopy; LV ejection fraction (LVEF) by Simpson's method on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE); intraventricular dyssynchrony (septal-posterior wall contraction delay) and interventricular dyssynchrony (aortopulmonary ejection delay) on TTE were recorded. The patients were followed up at 6-12 monthly interval with estimation of LVEF and pacemaker interrogation at each visit. Pacemaker-induced cardiomyopathy (PiCMP) was defined as a fall in ejection fraction of 10% as compared to the baseline LVEF. Patients developing PiCMP were compared to other patients to identify predictors. Results The mean age of study population was 59.8 years, 68.3% being males. Fifty-one percent and 49% patients underwent VVIR and DDDR pacemaker implantation, respectively. After attrition, 254 patients were analysed. PiCMP developed in 35 patients (13.8%) over a mean follow-up of 14.5 months. After multivariate analysis, burden of ventricular pacing > 60% [HR 4.26, p = 0.004] and interventricular dyssynchrony (aortopulmonary ejection delay > 40 msec) [HR 3.15, p = 0.002] were identified as predictors for PiCMP in patients undergoing chronic RV pacing. There was no effect of RV pacing site (apical vs non-apical) on incidence of PiCMP [HR 1.44, p = 0.353). Conclusions Incidence of PiCMP with RV pacing was found to be 13.8% over a mean follow-up of 14.5 months. Burden of right ventricular pacing and interventricular dyssynchrony were identified as the most important predictors for the development of PiCMP. Non-apical RV pacing site did not offer any benefit in terms of incidence of PiCMP over apical lead position.

AB  - This study is a retrospective analysis of 428 cases of electrocution deaths in the region of South Delhi, India, which were autopsied at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, during the 16-year period 2002-2017. The cases were analysed with regard to the age and sex of the victim, season of the year, site of the body, time of day, place of occurrence and presence of entry and exit wounds on the body. The cases represented approximately 1.8% of all autopsy cases during the period. The main findings of the study showed that the majority of cases involved adult males at home during the monsoon season, with a low-voltage electrical supply affecting the upper extremities. This study also confirms that not all cases of electrocution show electrocution marks. Comparison with an older study undertaken within the same population showed no difference in the pattern of cases, apart from a decreasing male-female ratio.

AB  - Aim: The survival in locally advanced cervical cancer remains low. We evaluated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), chemoradiotherapy (CRT), followed by gefitinib maintenance in locally advanced cervical cancer.Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with locally advanced carcinoma cervix were enrolled between July 2012 and May 2013. Patients received 6 weekly doses of NACT Paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 2), followed by CRT and brachytherapy. The analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression was carried out by immunohistochemistry. Gefitinib (250 mg daily) was given as maintenance therapy for 1 year after completion of chemoradiation. Comparison of EGFR expression and survival outcomes was done.Results: Twenty-four of 25 patients completed the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Post-CRT, all patients were started on gefitinib maintenance, and twenty patients completed the intended 1 year of gefitinib maintenance. Nineteen (76%) patients had a radiological complete response to NACT. EGFR was moderately or strongly expressed in 86.3% of the patients. The 3-year overall survival was 69.8%, and 3-year progression-free survival was 51.4%. Expression of EGFR was not found to be a significant factor affecting overall survival or progression-free survival.Conclusions: Weekly neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a good response rate in locally advanced cervical cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiation, followed by gefitinib maintenance gives good survival outcome in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

TI  - Combined resection-recession in true divergence excess sensory exotropia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AAPOS
AB  - PURPOSE To assess the effect of combined resection and recession on the same lateral rectus muscle in patients with true divergence excess sensory exotropia.
   METHODS Patients were divided into two groups. One group of patients underwent combined resection-recession of the lateral rectus muscle in one eye (LR group); the other group, with exodeviation of >40(Delta) for distance underwent additional ipsilateral medial rectus resection (LR + MR group). Postoperative measurements were taken at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.
   RESULTS Eleven patients were included in the study (mean age, 23.5 +/- 6.7 years): 7 in the LR group and 4 in the LR + MR group. For the LR group, mean preoperative deviation was 35.7(Delta) +/- 3.5(Delta) at distance and 16.3(Delta) +/- 3.9(Delta) at near. The mean near-distance disparity (NDD) was 11.4(Delta) +/- 2.7(Delta). The mean lateral rectus recession was 8.6 +/- 1.1 mm: the mean resection, 4.3(Delta) +/- 0.5(Delta) mm. At 3 months, mean deviation at distance was 8.3(Delta) +/- 2.1(Delta); at near, 3.1(Delta) +/- 1.6(Delta) (P = 0.01). The NDD was 5.7(Delta) +/- 2.7(Delta) (P = 0.01). For the LR + MR group, mean preoperative deviations at distance was 65.0(Delta) +/- 12.96(Delta); at near, 35.0 Delta +/- 12.2(Delta). The mean NDD was 30.0(Delta) +/- 4.0(Delta). Mean lateral rectus recession was 9.5(Delta) +/- 1.8(Delta) mm; the mean resection, 4.8(Delta) +/- 0.8(Delta) mm. The mean medial rectus resection was 5.5 +/- 0.6 mm. At 3 months, mean deviation at distance was 8.3(Delta) +/- 2.14(Delta); at near, 3.1(Delta) +/- 1.6(Delta) (P = 0.06). The NDD was 5.7(Delta) +/- 2.7(Delta) (P = 0.06).
   CONCLUSIONS In our study combined resection and recession of the same lateral rectus muscle in patients with divergence excess sensory exotropia significantly reduced the NDD, with no adverse outcomes.

AB  - In 2014, the International Endohernia Society (IEHS) published the first international "Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias." Guidelines reflect the currently best available evidence in diagnostics and therapy and give recommendations to help surgeons to standardize their techniques and to improve their results. However, science is a dynamic field which is continuously developing. Therefore, guidelines require regular updates to keep pace with the evolving literature. Methods For the development of the original guidelines, all relevant literature published up to year 2012 was analyzed using the ranking of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. For the present update, all of the previous authors were asked to evaluate the literature published during the recent years from 2012 to 2017 and revise their statements and recommendations given in the initial guidelines accordingly. In two Consensus Conferences (October 2017 Beijing, March 2018 Cologne), the updates were presented, discussed, and confirmed. To avoid redundancy, only new statements or recommendations are included in this paper. Therefore, for full understanding both of the guidelines, the original and the current, must be read. In addition, the new developments in repair of abdominal wall hernias like surgical techniques within the abdominal wall, release operations (transversus muscle release, component separation), Botox application, and robot-assisted repair methods were included. Results Due to an increase of the number of patients and further development of surgical techniques, repair of primary and secondary abdominal wall hernias attracts increasing interests of many surgeons. Whereas up to three decades ago hernia-related publications did not exceed 20 per year, currently this number is about 10-fold higher. Recent years are characterized by the advent of new techniques-minimal invasive techniques using robotics and laparoscopy, totally extraperitoneal repairs, novel myofascial release techniques for optimal closure of large defects, and Botox for relaxing the abdominal wall. Furthermore, a concomitant rectus diastasis was recognized as a significant risk factor for recurrence. Despite insufficient evidence with respect to these new techniques, it seemed to us necessary to include them in the update to stimulate surgeons to do research in these fields. Conclusion Guidelines are recommendations based on best available evidence intended to help the surgeon to improve the quality of his daily work. However, science is a continuously evolving process, and as such guidelines should be updated about every 3 years. For a comprehensive reference, however, it is suggested to read both the initial guidelines published in 2014 together with the update. Moreover, the presented update includes also techniques which were not known 3 years before.

AB  - Introduction Although deaths due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) have doubled over the past two decades, few data exist to inform screening strategies for early detection of CKD in low-income and middle-income countries.
   Methods Using data from three population-based surveys in India, we developed a prediction model to identify a target population that could benefit from further CKD testing, after an initial screening implemented during home health visits. Using data from one urban survey (n=8698), we applied stepwise logistic regression to test three models: one comprised of demographics, self-reported medical history, anthropometry and point-of-care (urine dipstick or capillary glucose) tests; one with demographics and self-reported medical history and one with anthropometry and point-of-care tests. The 'gold-standard' definition of CKD was an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >= 30 mg/g. Models were internally validated via bootstrap. The most parsimonious model with comparable performance was externally validated on distinct urban (n=5365) and rural (n=6173) Indian cohorts.
   Results A model with age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index and urine dipstick had a c-statistic of 0.76 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.78) for predicting need for further CKD testing, with external validation c-statistics of 0.74 and 0.70 in the urban and rural cohorts, respectively. At a probability cut-point of 0.09, sensitivity was 71% (95% CI 68% to 74%) and specificity was 70% (95% CI 69% to 71%). The model captured 71% of persons with CKD and 90% of persons at highest risk of complications from untreated CKD (ie, CKD stage 3A2 and above).
   Conclusion A point-of-care CKD screening strategy using three simple measures can accurately identify high-risk persons who require confirmatory kidney function testing.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the relationship between myocardial histopathology and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) variables of the right ventricle and postoperative peak systolic right-to-left ventricular pressure ratio (Prv/Plv) in patients undergoing intracardiac repair for tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).
   Methods: Operatively resected crista supraventricularis muscle specimens from 93 patients undergoing intracardiac repair for TOF, aged 18 months to 26 years (mean, 7.02 +/- 5.35 years) were subjected to light microscopy. TDI-derived parameters between the normal and abnormal categories of myocardium, the evolution of Prv/Plv, and its relationship to TDI-derived variables were tested using generalized linear random effects model using xtreg command.
   Results: The incidence of myocyte hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and perivascular fibrosis was 89.2%, 83.8%, and 77.4%, respectively. Although tricuspid annular peak systolic excursion, peak myocardial velocity during systole (s'), and early diastolic basal lengthening of right ventricle (e') continued to improve among patients with myocardial hypertrophy, myocytolysis, and perivascular fibrosis, there was an absence of improvement of the late diastolic relaxation of right ventricular free wall (a') in patients with perivascular fibrosis. Although there was improvement of postoperative Prv/Plv in patients with myocardial fibrosis as compared with normal histology, the values were not statistically significant (beta [standard error] -0.07 [0.08], P = .3).
   Conclusions: The great majority of myocardial tissues in cyanotic TOF indicate pre-existing hypertrophic, degenerative, and fibrotic changes. Perivascular fibrosis affects the diastolic compliance of the right ventricle and may account for the absence of improvement of late diastolic relaxation (a') and greater postoperative Prv/Plv in the absence of a residual surgical lesion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs) are a rare type of astrocytoma, which, similar to other gliomas, can rarely arise from glial nests in the meninges, manifesting as an extra-axial mass. We describe a solitary extraaxial intracranial primary meningeal PXA in the pediatric age group, which was masquerading as a tentorial meningioma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 9-year-old girl presented with features of raised intracranial pressure. Imaging revealed a dural-based mass in the tentorial region suggestive of a meningioma. This suspicion was further strengthened by intraoperative visualization of an extra-axial tumor with wide tentorial attachment. Near-total excision was achieved. Histopathologic examination established the diagnosis of PXA. Given the tumor's apparent meningeal origin and lack of connection with brain parenchyma in imaging and intraoperative findings, primary meningeal PXA was diagnosed. The absence of coexisting tumor foci on spinal magnetic resonance imaging further refined the diagnosis as solitary extra-axial intracranial primary meningeal PXA. The patient received radiotherapy for the residual tumor and was doing well at 6 months after presentation; however, she was lost to follow-up after that.
   CONCLUSIONS: Solitary extra-axial intracranial primary meningeal PXA is an extremely rare entity with only 3 reported cases in the literature including the present case. This is the first report of such a tumor in a pediatric patient. This report also highlights that primary meningeal PXA can manifest as an extra-axial mass lesion and may warrant inclusion in the differential diagnosis of extraaxial mass lesions.

AB  - Pediatric small round cell tumors (PSRCTs) constitute a large proportion of childhood malignancies with overlapping diagnostic and clinical features but radically different therapies. Here, we report a case of 16-year-old male child presenting with diffuse abdominal and mediastinal mass, axillary lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. Bone marrow aspirate showed near total replacement by small round malignant cells. The bone marrow biopsy showed interstitial infiltration by malignant cells, which were CD45- CD3- CD20- MIC2+ FLI1+ and diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma was established. In contrast, flowcytometric immunophenotyping of the bone marrow aspirate showed CD45- cells, which were CD19+ cytCD79a+ CD10+ CD81+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD22+ CD20- consistent with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The extended immunostaining panel on bone marrow biopsy also showed positivity for cytCD79a, CD10, CD19, and BCL-2, whereas fluorescent in-situ hybridization for EWSR1 gene rearrangement was negative. Thus, a final diagnosis of CD45- FLI1+ MIC2+ B-ALL was established. Rare cases of CD45- B-ALL with immunoreactivity for MIC2 and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) have posed a diagnostic challenge for PSRCTs in the recent past. This case report highlights the role of multimodality approach in establishing a correct diagnosis in CD45- PSRCTs to ensure definitive therapy and better clinical outcome.

AB  - Objective: To determine occurrence of malnutrition in children with cystic fibrosis and identify predictors of malnutrition at time of enrolment and after 2 years of follow up.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Setting: Pediatric chest clinic at a tertiary-care center in northern India.
   Patients: Cystic fibrosis patients enrolled between 2009-2015 with at least 3 years follow-up.
   Procedure: Weight and height were noted at enrolment, and after 1 year and 2 years of follow-up. Clinical details, medications, and pulmonary exacerbations during second year were recorded.
   Main outcome measure: Occurrence of malnutrition i.e. weight for age Z-score < -2.
   Results: 61 medical records were reviewed. Occurrence of malnutrition at baseline, and 1- and 2-year follow-up was 65.5%, 54.1% and 57.3%, respectively. Weight for age Z-score at enrolment significantly correlated with time to diagnosis from onset r=0.015, P=0.029). Weight for age Z-score at 2-year follow-up was significantly associated with steatorrhea (P=0.03), increased frequency of stools (P<0.01) and pulmonary exacerbation (P=0.03) during second year. Linear regression showed significant association between weight for age Z-score at 2 years with steatorrhea and pulmonary exacerbations [r=-10.795 (-1.527, -0.062)] and [r=-0.261 (-0.493, -0.028)]. Pulmonary exacerbations during second and third year had significant correlation with weight for age Z-score at the beginning of respective years (r = -0.219, P=0.015).
   Conclusion: Occurrence of malnutrition is high in children with cystic fibrosis in this region, with uncontrolled fat malabsorption and recurrent respiratory infections being significant risk factors.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the temporal profile of arterial functions during the course of pregnancy and also to determine the predictive accuracy of vascular function indices in development of preeclampsia (PE).
   Study design: Longitudinal study, two hundred and eight women participated in the study and vascular functions were assessed at 11-13, 20-22 and 30-32 weeks of gestation.
   Main outcome measures: Flow mediated dilatation (FMD), augmentation index (AIx), pulse wave velocity (PWV).
   Results: Out of 208 women, 13 women developed PE while 70 remained healthy pregnant (HP). In HP women, normalized FMD decreased gradually from 11 to 13 weeks to 30-32 weeks of gestation (p < 0.05). While in PE, Normalized FMD decreased from 11 to 13 to 20-22 weeks of gestation (p < 0.05) and was significantly lower in PE than HP group at 20-22 weeks of gestation (p < 0.05). AIx showed a mid trimester drop in HP group (p < 0.05) while demonstrated a rising trend in PE. Both AIx and PWV were significantly higher in PE than HP group during the course of pregnancy (p < 0.05). AIx demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity at both 11-13 and 20-22 weeks of gestation. Carotid femoral PWV showed an area under curve (AUC) of 78.18% and 69.75% at 11-13 and 20-22 weeks of gestation respectively. Carotid radial PWV showed good accuracy at 20-22 weeks (AUC-77.58%) of gestation.
   Conclusions: Compromised arterial functions precede the onset of PE. AIx and carotid femoral PWV constitute potential predictive marker in early pregnancy for later development of PE.

AB  - Purpose The study evaluated the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) texture parameters in differentiating clear cell renal carcinoma (CC-RCC) from non-clear cell carcinoma (NC-RCC) and in the histological grading of CC-RCC. Materials and methods After institutional ethical approval, this retrospective study analyzed 33 patients with 34 RCC masses (29 CC-RCC and five NC-RCC; 19 low-grade and 10 high-grade CC-RCC), who underwent MRI between January 2011 and December 2012 on a 1.5-T scanner (Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The MRI protocol included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI; at b 0, 500 and 1000 s/mm(2) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps] and T1-weighted pre and postcontrast [corticomedullary (CM) and nephrographic (NG) phase] acquisition. MR texture analysis (MRTA) was performed using the TexRAD research software (Feedback Medical Ltd., Cambridge, UK) by a single reader who placed free-hand polygonal region of interest (ROI) on the slice showing the maximum viable tumor. Filtration histogram-based texture analysis was used to generate six first-order statistical parameters [mean intensity, standard deviation (SD), mean of positive pixels (MPP), entropy, skewness and kurtosis] at five spatial scaling factors (SSF) as well as on the unfiltered image. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the texture parameters of CC-RCC versus NC-RCC, and high-grade versus low-grade CC-RCC. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. A 3-step feature selection was used to obtain the best texture metrics for each MRI sequence and included the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Pearson's correlation test. Results The best performing texture parameters in differentiating CC-RCC from NC-RCC for each sequence included (area under the curve in parentheses): entropy at SSF 4 (0.807) on T2WI, SD at SSF 4 (0.814) on DWI b500, SD at SSF 6 (0.879) on DWI b1000, mean at SSF 0 (0.848) on ADC, skewness at SSF 2 (0.854) on T1WI and skewness at SSF 3 (0.908) on CM phase. In differentiating high from low-grade CC-RCC, the best parameters were: entropy at SSF 6 (0.823) on DWI b1000, mean at SSF 3 (0.889) on CM phase and MPP at SSF 5 (0.870) on NG phase. Conclusion Several MR texture parameters showed excellent diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.8) in differentiating CC-RCC from NC-RCC, and high-grade from low-grade CC-RCC. MRTA could serve as a useful non-invasive tool for this purpose.

AB  - Short stature in children is a diagnostic challenge to the physician. Bone age assessment can be done using various methods. The causes of short stature are variable; often leading to a series of investigations. The endocrine conditions have typical imaging features. This chapter provides a short overview of the methods of bone age estimation, and imaging findings and algorithmic approach towards a child with short stature.

AB  - Objectives To report the distribution pattern of various categories of primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) in children from North India, frequency of warning signs and critical parameters for evaluation. Methods In this retrospective study, 528 children below 18 y of age after clinical assessment and presentation suggestive of PID were further screened by immunophenotyping for immune cell markers by flow cytometry. Results A total of 120 (23%) children were diagnosed with PID with median age at diagnosis being 2.5 y in males and 3.5 y in females and an average delay in diagnosis from onset of symptoms being approximately 5 y. Chronic lower respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal symptoms like persistent diarrhea and failure to thrive were amongst the most common warning signs in these patients. PIDs were classified according to the International Union of Immunological Societies' (IUIS) criteria. The diagnosis of index study subjects included combined humoral and cellular immunodeficiency (29%), phagocytic defects (29%), followed by predominantly antibody deficiency (18%), innate immunity and dysregulation (17%) and other well-defined syndromes (7%). A family history of PID (23%), consanguineous marriage (8%) and previous sibling death (23%) were observed as major clinical predictors/clues for underlying PID. All children received prophylactic antibiotics and/or antifungals in addition to specific therapy for underlying immune deficiency. Conclusions The field of PIDs in India remains largely unexplored and we are faced with various challenges in the diagnosis of PIDs due to lack of awareness as well as absence of equipped immunological laboratory support. The authors propose a methodical step-wise laboratory diagnostic approach that can facilitate early diagnosis and timely intervention of these mis/underdiagnosed disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Herniation of the brain through an osseodural defect has been well described in small children as an uncommon occurrence after closed head injury. Pressure from the growing brain has been implicated in progressive enlargement and reshaping of the fracture line. An analogous phenomenon in adults has been observed in the described cases where neurosurgical intervention led to a persistent dural defect. Transcalvarial herniation of the brain through the dural defect resulted in characteristic neurologic and imaging findings producing symptoms disproportionately greater than expected from the extent of the affected brain, accompanied by enlargement of the underlying ventricle and elevation of the bone flap. Disruption of the axonal conduction due to distortion of the axons in the herniated brain is probably responsible for these observations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A series of 3 cases is described. In all cases, the dural reconstitution at the conclusion of surgery was incomplete. Brain herniation was evident in the postoperative scan. The transcalvarial herniation of the brain was precipitated by either a seizure and resultant brain swelling or persistently raised intracranial tension from a tumor residual. In 2 cases, surgical reexploration resulted in improvement in the neurologic symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic patients with transcalvarial herniation of the brain, identified on imaging, the neurologic syndrome is quite characteristic. Recognition of this condition and prompt treatment lead to lasting neurologic improvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The authors investigated the impact of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on first and recurrent hospitalization in this population.
   BACKGROUND In the STICH (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial, CABG reduced all-cause death and hospitalization in patients with and ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction <35%.
   METHODS A total of 1,212 patients were randomized (610 to CABG thorn optimal medical therapy [CABG] and 602 to optimal medical therapy alone [MED] alone) and followed for a median of 9.8 years. All-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations were analyzed as time-to-first-event and as recurrent event analysis.
   RESULTS Of the 1,212 patients, 757 died (62.4%) and 732 (60.4%) were hospitalized at least once, for a total of 2,549 total all-cause hospitalizations. Most hospitalizations (66.2%) were for cardiovascular causes, of which approximately one-half (907 or 52.9%) were for heart failure. More than 70% of all hospitalizations (1,817 or 71.3%) were recurrent events. The CABG group experienced fewer all-cause hospitalizations in the time-to-first-event (349 CABG vs. 383 MED, adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74 to 0.98; p = 0.03) and in recurrent event analyses (1,199 CABG vs. 1,350 MED, HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.94; p < 0.001). This was driven by fewer total cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations (744 vs. 968; p < 0.001, adjusted HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.81; p = 0.001), the majority of which were due to HF (395 vs. 512; p < 0.001, adjusted HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52-0.89; p = 0.005). We did not observe a difference in non-CV events.
   CONCLUSIONS CABG reduces all-cause, CV, and HF hospitalizations in time-to-first-event and recurrent event analyses.

AB  - In the last two decades, various in vivo MR methodologies have been evaluated for their potential in the study of cancer metabolism. During malignant transformation, metabolic alterations occur, leading to morphological and functional changes. Among various MR methods, in vivo MRS has been extensively used in breast cancer to study the metabolism of cells, tissues or whole organs. It provides biochemical information at the metabolite level. Altered choline, phospholipid and energy metabolism has been documented using proton (H-1), phosphorus (P-31) and carbon (C-13) isotopes. Increased levels of choline-containing compounds, phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters in breast cancer, which are indicative of altered choline and phospholipid metabolism, have been reported using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo NMR studies. These changes are reversed on successful therapy, which depends on the treatment regimen given. Monitoring the various tumor intermediary metabolic pathways using nuclear spin hyperpolarization of C-13-labeled substrates by dynamic nuclear polarization has also been recently reported. Furthermore, the utility of various methods such as diffusion, dynamic contrast and perfusion MRI have also been evaluated to study breast tumor metabolism. Parameters such as tumor volume, apparent diffusion coefficient, volume transfer coefficient and extracellular volume ratio are estimated. These parameters provide information on the changes in tumor microstructure, microenvironment, abnormal vasculature, permeability and grade of the tumor. Such changes seen during cancer progression are due to alterations in the tumor metabolism, leading to changes in cell architecture. Due to architectural changes, the tissue mechanical properties are altered; this can be studied using magnetic resonance elastography, which measures the elastic properties of tissues. Moreover, these structural MRI methods can be used to investigate the effect of therapy-induced changes in tumor characteristics. This review discusses the potential of various in vivo MR methodologies in the study of breast cancer metabolism.

AB  - Introduction Worldwide, 10%-20% of children and adolescents experience mental health conditions. However, most such disorders remain undiagnosed until adolescence or adulthood. Little is known about the factors that influence mental health in children and adolescents, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), where environmental threats, such as poverty and war, may affect optimal neurodevelopment. Cohort studies provide important information on risks and resilience across the life course by enabling tracking of the effects of early life environment on health during childhood and beyond. Large birth cohort studies, including twin cohorts that can be aetiologically informative, have been conducted within high-income countries but are not generalisable to LMIC. There are limited longitudinal birth cohort studies in LMIC.
   Methods We sought to enhance the volume of impactful research in Sri Lanka by establishing a Centre of Excellence for cohort studies. The aim is to establish a register of infant, child and adolescent twins, including mothers pregnant with twins, starting in the districts of Colombo (Western Province) and Vavuniya (Northern Province). We will gain consent from twins or parents for future research projects. This register will provide the platform to investigate the aetiology of mental illness and the impact of challenges to early brain development on future mental health. Using this register, we will be able to conduct research that will (1) expand existing research capacity on child and adolescent mental health and twin methods; (2) further consolidate existing partnerships and (3) establish new collaborations. The initiative is underpinned by three pillars: high-quality research, ethics, and patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE).

AB  - Introduction: High prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) not associated with known risk factors has been reported from coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh. The Study to Test and Operationalize Preventive Approaches for Chronic Kidney Disease of Undetermined Etiology in Andhra Pradesh (STOP CKDu AP) aims to ascertain the burden (prevalence and incidence) of CKD, the risk factor profile, and the community perceptions about the disease in the Uddanam area of Andhra Pradesh.
   Methods: Study participants will be sampled from the Uddanam area using multistage cluster random sampling. Information will be collected on the demographic profile, occupational history, and presence of conventional as well as nonconventional risk factors. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation, and proteinuria will be measured. All abnormal values will be confirmed by repeat testing after 3 months. Cases of CKD not associated with identified etiologies will be identified. Biospecimens will be stored to explore future hypotheses. The entire cohort will be followed up every 6 months to determine the incidence of CKD and to identify risk factors for decline in kidney function. Qualitative studies will be performed to understand the community perceptions and expectations with respect to the interventions.

AB  - Background: The association of depression and epilepsy is thought to be bidirectional. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression in patients on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and factors affecting it.
   Methods: In this preliminary cross sectional study, patients at epilepsy clinic of a tertiary care centre were studied for occurrence of depression, using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) scales. Correlation analysis was carried out to determine the factors associated with presence of depression in these patients.
   Results: A total of 12 AEDs (maximum 5 per patient including older and newer) were prescribed to 933 patients in different treatment regimens over a period of 3 years. The median age of the patients was 22 years (10-77) and among them 63.5% were men. Mild and clinically relevant depression occurred in 279 (29.9%) and 223 (23.9%) patients, respectively. Mean HADS-D and PHQ-2 score was significantly higher with polytherapy as compared to monotherapy (p < 0.001). Patients on levetiracetam exhibited significantly higher HADS-D score in comparison to phenytoin (p < 0.001), carbamazepine (p < 0.001) and sodium valproate (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in PHQ score among patients on monotherapy of different AEDs. Multivariate regression analysis suggested correlation between depression and seizure frequency, total number of AEDs and their load (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Depressive symptoms were found to be present in more than half of the patients with epilepsy which require detailed work up for depression. Levetiracetam was found to be associated with a higher incidence of subclinical depression which needs further investigation.

AB  - CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4) or CD152 is an inhibitory receptor expressed constitutively on CD4+ CD25+ T regulatory lymphocytes and transiently on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Its inhibitory function promotes long-lived anergy in immune cells and prevents autoimmunity. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in T cell-mediated autoimmunity, and thus in susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is encoded by CTLA4 gene in humans. AtoG polymorphism at position +49 of CTLA4 gene is the only polymorphism which changes amino acid sequence from alanine to threonine in the leader sequence, which may affect the function of CTLA-4. Association of CTLA4 polymorphisms with SLE has been investigated in several reports in different ethnic populations from different countries, which have shown highly inconsistent findings. In this review, we have compiled previous studies which have reported the association of CTLA4 A49G polymorphism in SLE and its geographical distribution.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells which hold immense potential in translational research as a novel treatment modality. In recent years, MSCs isolated from various tissues have been used in several clinical trials for the treatment of cardiac injury caused by permanent myocardial loss. However, a better MSCs source and an optimum inducer for in vitro cardiac differentiation are still far reaching and unexplored. The aim of the study was to compare the ability and efficiency of differentiation of MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) and adipose tissue (ADSC) into cardiomyocyte-like cells to aid translational research. To fulfill this aim, freshly isolated BM-MSCs and ADSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes using 5-Azacytidine (6 mu M) and TGF-beta 1 (25 ng/ml). These two differentiation protocols were compared on the basis of morphological, transcriptional, translational and functionality analysis. Both tissue specific MSCs, ADSCs and BM-MSCs, have similar surface marker profile and population doubling time. In both the treatment regimes, BM-MSCs and ADSCs showed morphological changes like flattening of cells and myotube formation in concurrence with structure and multinucleation, with early sign of differentiation in ADSCs. Further, the expression of cardiac specific markers including myosin light chain-2v (Mlc-2v), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SerCa2) were higher in AD-TGF beta 1 group, both at transcriptional and translational level. During functionality analysis by KCl stimulation, increased intracellular calcium fluorescence was observed in AD- TGF beta 1 group as compared to others. Thus, ADSCs proved to be a better choice for stem cell therapy in cardiovascular diseases when induced with TGF-beta 1.

AB  - Cutaneous adverse effects are one of the most frequently observed adverse reactions with anticancer agents. This has only intensified with newer targeted and immunologic agents that present with a wide array of drug toxicities and skin reactions. The spectrum ranges from benign, localized dermatoses to generalized, life-threatening cutaneous toxicities. Herein, the authors review the cutaneous adverse effects observed with conventional chemotherapy as well as targeted agents, including the emerging immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have been revolutionary in the treatment of many malignancies.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the clinical factors associated with repeat Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) or penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) in cases of failed DSAEK. Methods: Retrospective observational study of cases with failed DSAEK admitted to our center for a repeat keratoplasty over 5 years (January 2013-Decemeber 2017) was undertaken. Demographic and perioperative details of all cases and type of repeat keratoplasty were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the factors affecting the type of repeat keratoplasty. Results: A total of 94 eyes with failed DSAEK were evaluated. Repeat DSAEK was performed in 66% and PKP in 34% of cases. Significantly increased odds for requiring PKP were observed in association with stromal scarring [odds ratio (OR) = 2.9, P = 0.018)], trainee surgeons (OR = 4.05, P = 0.008), intraoperative complications (OR = 4.58, P = 0.003), scleral fixated intraocular lens or anterior chamber intraocular lens in situ (OR = 33.8, P < 0.001), secondary glaucoma (OR = 3.02, P = 0.015), peripheral anterior synechiae (OR = 8.6, P < 0.001), preoperative corneal thickness (OR = 1.01, P < 0001), time to primary surgery (OR = 1.03, P = 0.03), post-DSAEK host thickness (OR = 1.01, P < 0.001), and time interval from graft failure to regraft (OR = 1.18, P < 0.001). All eyes with congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, bee-sting-induced corneal decompensation, Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, and multiple failed grafts underwent secondary PKP. All cases (nine eyes) that required surgical intervention for secondary glaucoma underwent secondary PKP (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Repeat DSAEK is feasible in up to two-third of cases of failed DSAEK. A PKP is required in one-third of cases, and various preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors are associated with unsuitability for repeat DSAEK.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the role of quantitative Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters and their histogram analysis in characterizing changes in Osteosarcoma receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and evaluating therapeutic response.
   Methods: Forty patients (N = 40; Male:Female = 30:10; Age = 17.7 +/- 5.9years; Metastatic:localized = 17:23) with histologically confirmed Osteosarcoma treated with 3-cycles of NACT were analyzed prospectively. All patients underwent Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with 11 b-values (0-800 s/mm(2)) using 1.5 T MRI scanner at pre-treatment (t0), after 1-cycle (t1) and after 3-cycles (t2) of NACT. Non-invasive response evaluation of NACT was performed using RECIST1.1 criteria. Apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC) and IVIM parameters Diffusion-coefficient (D), Perfusion-coefficient (D*) & Perfusion-fraction (f) and their relative percentage changes from time-point t0-t1 (Delta 2) and t0-t2 (Delta 2) were evaluated and histogram analysis was performed at three time-points and compared with respect to RECIST1.1 scores.
   Results: Using RECIST1.1 criteria, 11 (27.5%), 21 (52.5%) and 8 (20%) patients were in Partial-responder (PR), Stable-disease (SD) and Progressive-disease (PD) groups respectively. Pre-NACT (t0), average ADC, D,D*& f in tumor volume were 1.36 +/- 0.33 x 10(-3) mm 2 /s, 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, 28.44 +/- 10.34 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s 13.95 +/- 2.83% respectively. Using ANOVA test, during NACT (t1, t2), D*-variance (p = 0.038, 0.003) and f-skewness (p = 0.03, 0.03) and at t2, D*-entropy (p = 0.001) and f-entropy (p = 0.002) and their Delta 2 changes (p = 0.001, 0.003) were statistically significant among response groups. At t1, D*-variance and f-skewness jointly showed AUC = 0.77 & 0.74 in classifying PR (Sensitivity = 73%; Specificity = 70%) and SD (Sensitivity = 74; Specificity = 75%) groups respectively in patient cohort. Delta 1& Delta 2 changes of D*-mean, D*-variance, D*-entropy and f-entropy correlated well (0.5-0.6) with tumor-diameter and tumor-volume changes.
   Conclusions: Quantitative IVIM parameters, especially D* & f and their histogram analysis were informative and can be used as noninvasive surrogate markers for early response assessment during the course of NACT in Osteosarcoma.

AB  - Aim To estimate the proportion of patients arriving with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 9 who had a definitive airway placed prior to arrival. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the data from a multicentre, prospective observational research project entitled Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes in India. Adults aged >= 18 years with an isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were transferred from another hospital to the emergency department of the participating hospital with a GCS less than 9 were included. Our outcome was a definitive airway, defined as either intubation or surgical airway, placed prior to arrival at a participating centre. Results The total number of patients eligible for this study was 1499. The median age was 40 years and 84% were male. Road traffic injuries and falls comprised 88% of the causes of isolated TBI. The number of patients with GCS<9 who had a definitive airway placed before reaching the participating centres was 229. Thus, the proportion was 0.15 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.17). The proportions of patients with a definitive airway who arrived after 24 hours (19%) were approximately double the proportion of patients who arrived within 6 hours (10%) after injury to the definitive care centre. Conclusion The rates of definitive airway placement are poor in adults with an isolated TBI who have been transferred from another health facility to tertiary care centres in India.

AB  - Background While complement blockade with eculizumab is recommended as first-line therapy of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), plasma exchanges (PEX) remain the chief option for anti-factor H (FH) antibody associated disease and when access to eculizumab is limited. Methods We reviewed adverse events (AEs) and adverse outcomes (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or death), in all patients with aHUS managed with membrane-filtration based PEX at one tertiary care center over 5.5 years. Results During January 2013 to June 2018, 109 patients with aHUS (74 with antibodies to FH), aged median (range) 7.6 (0.5-18) year weighing 22.1 (6-90) kg, underwent 2024 sessions of PEX. AE, in 12.1% patients, were usually self-limiting and included chills (5.5%), vomiting/abdominal pain (3.3%), hypotension (1.6%), urticaria (1.5%), seizures (0.2%), hypocalcemia (0.2%), and hemorrhage (0.1%); plasma hypersensitivity and severe reactions were rare. Rate of catheter-related infections was 1.45/1000 catheter-days. Filter reuse (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.26-2.26; P < .001) and >20 sessions of PEX/patient (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.27-3.10; P = .002) were independently associated with adverse events; infusion of IV calcium gluconate during PEX was protective (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.16-0.43; P < .001). Hematological remission was achieved in 96.3% patients after 6 (5-8) PEX sessions; 80.8% and 89.6% patients were dialysis independent by one and 3 months, respectively. Conclusions PEX is safe and associated with satisfactory short-term outcomes in children with aHUS. Prolonged PEX and filter-reuse are associated with complications.

AB  - Aim: To assess the long-term urologic outcomes in follow-up of patients of sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) using urodynamic study (UDS) in addition to clinical and radiologic evaluation.
   Methods: A prospective study of clinical, radiological and urodynamic evaluation in patients with SCT who underwent resection between January 2002-June 2015 and were followed up till January 2016 was conducted.
   Results: Total 57 patients, 42 (73.7%) females and 15 (263%) males with 35 (62.4%) following treatment for benign and 22 (38.5%) for malignant disease were included. Twenty-eight of 57 (49.12%) had urological problems. Clinical complaints in 21 (36.8%) patients included stress urinary incontinence-14 (66.7%), enuresis-9 (42.9%), and poor stream or dribbling of urine-6 (28.6%). Eight of 51 patients (15.7%) had abnormal ultrasound findings, which included contracted, trabeculated thick walled bladder (3), bilateral hydronephrosis (3) and significant post void residue ( PVR) (6). Seven of 57 underwent micturating cystourethrogram (MCU), 5 had an abnormal report[significant PVR (4), small trabeculated bladder (3), reflux (2) and large capacity bladder (1)]. Urodynamic study was done in 27 patients. 18/27 (66.7%) had abnormalities. Six patients without any clinical or ultrasonographic abnormalities had abnormal UDS. Total 28 (49.12%) had urological comorbidities. Three patients had overactive bladder, five dysfunctional voiding, one underactive bladder and one had giggle incontinence. Children were managed by behaviour therapy and pharmacotherapy.
   Conclusion: Urodynamic evaluation could detect abnormalities in patients who had no urinary complaints or abnormality on ultrasound. The abnormalities have a potential for progressive upper tract damage. Urodynamics should be an integral part of urological surveillance in patients operated for SCT.

AB  - A 28-year-old male presented to retina clinic with complains of blurring and distortion in right eye for past 1 week. There was history of implantation of phakic intraocular lens (pIOL) bilaterally 4 months back. Ophthalmic examination revealed a full-thickness macular hole in the right eye. Pars plana vitrectomy with inverted internal limiting membrane flap was planned. Post-operatively, patient had a good gain in vision (20/40) with closure of the hole. Macular hole is an unusual complication of pIOL. A detailed pre-operative fundus screening is indispensable. Early presentation and timely intervention can optimize the visual outcome.

AB  - Aims: The standard of care for carcinoma cervix stage IB2-IVA is five fractions per week of radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin. We compared the standard treatment with six fractions per week of RT with concurrent Cisplatin to see whether the later had improved survival outcomes with comparable toxicities.Settings and Design: 46 patients of carcinoma cervix with stage IB2-IVAwere randomized into two arms.Materials and Methods: Study arm: 46 Gy/23 fractions/26 days, 6 fractions/week with injection CDDP 40 mg/m2 and Control arm: 46 Gy/23 fractions/31 days, 5 fractions/week with injection Cisplatin 40mg/m2. Patients in both the arms received LDR brachytherapy to a dose of 29 Gy at point A.Statistical Analysis Used: The primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Compliance to treatment and treatment toxicities were the secondary end points. P value <= 0.05 were considered significant.Results: The study was carried out during June, 2014-April, 2015. Statistical analysis was done in May, 2019. Of 46 patients, 39 patients completed the treatment. The study and control arms had 17 and 22 patients, respectively. Median follow-up period is 45 months (range: 1-54 months). 3-year DFS rates and OS was 69.5% vs. 72.7% (P = 0.73) and 63% vs. 68% (P = 0.45) in study and in control arm, respectively. There was no significant difference in acute and late radiation toxicities between two arms.Conclusion: Chemoradiotherapy with six fractions per week seems feasible and equally efficacious in terms of survival outcomes and toxicity profile. Further prospective randomized controlled study is required to prove the merit of altered fractionation with concurrent cisplatin.

AB  - Extraneural broad ligament ependymoma is a rare entity. Herein, we present a case of unusually large broad ligament ependymoma in a 32-year-old female with pain and lump in the lower abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen revealed multiple heterogeneously enhancing pelvic masses with lobulated surface in bilateral adnexa along with multiple peritoneal nodules. Her relevant serum tumor markers were unremarkable. Core biopsy revealed tumor composed of elongated cells arranged predominantly in true and pseudoperivascular rosettes. The histopathological differentials included ependymoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and teratoma with neural differentiation. Results of immunohistochemistry favored the diagnosis of ependymoma. Surgical exploration and optimal cytoreduction were done, and a final diagnosis of primary broad ligament ependymoma with peritoneal metastasis was made. The patient received six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and is doing well after 8-month follow-up. The present case highlights the diagnostic workup and management of a rare and an unusually large broad ligament ependymoma with peritoneal metastasis.

AB  - Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare aggressive intrathoracic tumor which is believed to originate from embryonic uncommitted lung mesenchymal cells, which are important for developing the lung. Type I PPB is cystic, type II is cystic and solid, while type III is predominantly solid. Diagnosing type 1 PPB is a challenge for both radiologists as well as pathologists. Owing to its purely cystic nature, type I PPB it is often mistaken for unrelated entities such as congenital pulmonary airway malformation and congenital lobar emphysema which delays surgical intervention. Here, we report two such cases presenting clinically and radiologically as congenital pulmonary airway malformation. On histology, a final diagnosis of type I pleuropulmonay blastoma was made. Thereafter, chemotherapy was administered following complete surgical excision.

AB  - Pairwise similarity judgments and card sorting methodologies are different ways of generating data for similarity matrices used in various analyses such as multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. Pairwise similarity judgments are considered the gold standard methodology, but can be cumbersome for large numbers of stimuli given the geometric increase in number of judgments necessary to fill the matrix. Card sorting methods provide a more expedient means of gathering this information, although they typically generate only binary data. Nonetheless, aggregated matrices generated from card sorts approximate pairwise similarity matrices. The current study used pairwise similarity and card sorting results from two existing studies that used the same stimuli to determine the optimal number of participants needed in a card sorting task to approximate the similarity matrix of pairwise data collection. In these studies, approximately 10-15 participants provided optimal estimation of the similarity matrix, with minimal increases for higher numbers of participants.

AB  - Background Elevated blood pressure incurs a major health and economic burden, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. The Triple Pill versus Usual Care Management for Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) trial showed a greater reduction in blood pressure in patients using fixed-combination, low-dose, triple-pill antihypertensive therapy (consisting of amlodipine, telmisartan, and chlorthalidone) than in those receiving usual care in Sri Lanka. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the triple-pill strategy.
   Methods We did a within-trial (6-month) and modelled (10-year) economic evaluation of the TRIUMPH trial, using the health system perspective. Health-care costs, reported in 2017 US dollars, were determined from trial records and published literature. A discrete-time simulation model was developed, extrapolating trial findings of reduced systolic blood pressure to 10-year health-care costs, cardiovascular disease events, and mortality. The primary outcomes were the proportion of people reaching blood pressure targets (at 6 months from baseline) and disability-adjusted lifeyears (DALYs) averted (at 10 years from baseline). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to estimate the cost per additional participant achieving target blood pressure at 6 months and cost per DALY averted over 10 years.
   Findings The triple-pill strategy, compared with usual care, cost an additional US$9.63 (95% CI 5.29 to 13.97) per person in the within-trial analysis and $347.75 (285.55 to 412.54) per person in the modelled analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated at $7.93 (95% CI 6.59 to 11.84) per participant reaching blood pressure targets at 6 months and $2842.79 (-28.67 to 5714.24) per DALY averted over a 10-year period.
   Interpretation Compared with usual care, the triple-pill strategy is cost-effective for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Scaled up investment in the triple pill for hypertension management in Sri Lanka should be supported to address the high population burden of cardiovascular disease. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare sphingolipid storage disorder caused by arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deficiency, resulting in central and peripheral demyelination. However, an uncommon form of MLD caused by saposin B deficiency is also described (around 10 mutations reported till date). MLD is a systemic disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous system, gall bladder, and kidneys. Acute flaccid paralysis as the initial clinical presentation is previously known in ARSA-deficient MLD. Hereby, we report a child with acute flaccid paralysis with brain magnetic resonance imaging showing nonspecific periventricular leukodystrophy. He had progressive cognitive decline with gall bladder polyposis. ARSA levels were within normal limits. Leukodystrophy gene panel revealed a homozygous pathogenic deletion (Lys227del variant) in prosaposin ( PSAP ) gene. Hence, a final diagnosis of saposin B-deficient MLD was established. The index case highlights the importance of clinical and electrophysiological clues in the diagnosis of such atypical presentations of MLD.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effect of number and combination of b values used on the accuracy of estimated Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) parameters using simulation and clinical data. Materials and methods Simulations with seven combinations of b values were performed for 4, 6, 8, and 13 numbers of b values with six different values of D, D*, and f parameters. Two methodologies were implemented for IVIM analysis: standard biexponential model (BE) and biexponential model with total variation penalty function (BE + TV). Clinical data set of six patients with prostate cancer was retrospectively analyzed using 4, 8, and 13 b values. Results BE + TV method showed lesser error and lower variability in simulation and clinical data, respectively. 8 and 13 b values showed good agreement in the values of parameters estimated with high correlation coefficient (rho = 0.83-0.93). Clinical data showed high spurious noise with lower b values [4 b values leading to high coefficient of variation (CV); however, substantially, lower CV was observed with 8 and 13 b values]. Discussion BE model with TV penalty function is robust to combination of b values used for IVIM analysis. Combination of 8 b values provided a reasonably good accuracy in IVIM parameters.

AB  - Adenovirus infection is a well-known complication in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Brincidofovir (BCV) is an orally bioavailable lipid conjugate of cidofovir, which has activity against adenoviruses. We present a review of adenovirus infections treated with BCV which were unresponsive to cidofovir initially in 4 patients and it was used upfront in one patient. Children with adenovirus infection following HSCT treated with BCV, between July 2014 and February 2018 were recognized. Five patients including 3 male and 2 female with a median age of 10 years (range, 2.2 to 10 y) were identified. The median days of adenoviremia detection was 18 days (range, 7 to 303 d) posttransplant. The median peak viral load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction was 21,38,000 copies/mL (range, 1,77,200 to 31,97,000 copies/mL). The median time from first detection of adenoviremia to become negative was 30 days (range, 15 to 113 d). The sites involved were gastrointestinal tract in all patients and 2 patients had additional respiratory tract involvement. Two patients survived and 3 patients died of sepsis. All patients responded well to BCV and no adverse effect was noticed. We saw the good safety profile and excellent antiadenoviral activity of BCV in pediatric patients receiving HSCT without the nephrotoxicity and it may have a role in preemptive therapy.

AB  - Background Achievement of adequate glycaemic control is important to alleviate complications, improve quality of life and reduce mortality among persons with diabetes. This study estimated the level of glycaemic control and determinants of poor glycaemic control among persons with diabetes in a rural population of North India.
   Methods We randomly selected 245 persons aged >= 18 years with self-reported diabetes from the information of 100,000 individuals available in Health Information Management System of Health Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) Ballabgarh. Glycaemic control was assessed by measurement of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip circumference were measured with standard procedures. Information regarding disease and treatment history was recorded.
   Results Mean age of participants was 56.2 (11.3) years. Mean HbA1c was 8.04% (+/- 2.54), with no significant difference across age and sex. Good glycaemic control (HbA1c<7%) was observed in 41.3%. On multivariate logistic regression, duration of >10 years since diagnosis of diabetes (OR=2.71, 95% C.I. 1.08-6.81), and high serum triglyceride (OR=2.17, 95% C.I. 1.19-3.98) levels were significantly associated with poor glycaemic control, while persons aged > 60 years were less likely of poor glycaemic control.
   Conclusion Achievement of adequate glycaemic control in this population is poor and warrants prompt interventions.

AB  - Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) (OMIM) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused due to mutations in the HEXA gene. To date, nearly 190 mutations have been reported in HEXA gene. Here, we have characterized 34 enzymatically confirmed TSD families to investigate the presence of novel as well as known variants in HEXA gene. Overall study detected 25 variants belonging to 31 affected TSD patients and 3 carrier couples confirmed by enzyme study. Of these 17 patients harbors 15 novel variants, including seven missense variants [p.V206L, p.Y213H, p.R252C, p.F257S, p.C328G, p.G454R, and p.P475R], four nonsense variant [p.S9X, p.E91X, p.W420X, and p.W482X], two splice site variants [c.347-1G>A and c.460-1G>A], and two small deletion [c.1349delC (p.A450VfsX3) and c.52delG (p.G18Dfs*82)]. While remaining 17 patients harbors 10 previously reported variants that includes six missense variants [p.M1T, p.R170Q, p.D322Y, p.D322N, p.E462V, and p.R499C], one nonsense variant [p.Q106X], two splice site variants [c.1073+1G> A and c.459+4A>G] and one 4 bp insertion [c.1278insTATC (p.Y427IfsX5)]. In conclusion, Indian infantile TSD patients provide newer insight into the molecular heterogeneity of the TSD. Combining present study and our earlier studies, we have observed that 67% genotypes found in Indian TSD patients are novel, which are associated with severe infantile phenotypes, while rest 33% genotypes found in our cohort were previously reported in various populations. In addition, higher frequency of the p.E462V and c.1278insTATC mutations in the present study further support and suggest the prevalence of p.E462V mutation in the Indian population.

AB  - Background The coverage of community-based maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) services remains low, especially in hard-to-reach areas. We evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile-phone-and web-based application, Innovative Mobile-phone Technology for Community Health Operations (ImTeCHO), as a job aid to the government's Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Primary Health Center (PHC) staff to improve coverage of MNCH services in rural tribal communities of Gujarat, India. Methods and findings This open cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 22 PHCs in six tribal blocks of Bharuch and Narmada districts in India. The ImTeCHO mobile-phone-and web-based application included various technology-based job aids to facilitate scheduling of home visits, screening for complications, counseling during home visits, and supportive supervision by PHC staff. Primary outcome indicators were a composite index calculated based on coverage of important MNCH services and coverage of at least two home visitations by ASHA within the first week of birth. Primary analysis was intention to treat (ITT). Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to account for clustering. Eleven PHCs each were randomly allocated to the intervention (280 ASHAs, population: 234,134) and control (281 ASHAs, population: 242,809) arms. The intervention was implemented from February, 2016 to January, 2017. At the end of the implementation, 6,493 mothers were surveyed. Most of the surveyed women were tribal (5,571, 85.8%), and reported having a government-issued certificate for living below poverty line (4,916, 75.7%). The coverage of at least two home visits within first week of birth was 32.4% in the intervention clusters compared to 22.9% in the control clusters (adjusted effect size 10.2 [95% CI: 6.4, 14.0], p < 0.001). Mean number of home visits within first week of birth was 1.11 and 0.80 for intervention and control clusters, respectively (adjusted effect size 0.34 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.45], p < 0.001). The composite coverage index was 43.0% in the intervention clusters compared to 38.5% (adjusted effect size 4.9 [95% CI: 0.2, 9.5], p = 0.03) in the control clusters. There were substantial improvements in coverage home visits by ASHAs during antenatal period (adjusted effect size 15.7 [95% CI: 11.0, 20.4], p < 0.001), postnatal period (adjusted effect size 6.4, [95% CI: 3.2, 9.6], p <0.001), early initiation of breastfeeding (adjusted effect size 7.8 [95% CI: 4.2, 11.4], p < 0.001), and exclusive breastfeeding (adjusted effect size 13.4 [95% CI: 8.9, 17.9], p < 0.001). Number of infant and neonatal deaths was similar in the two arms in the ITT analysis. The limitations of the study include potential risk of inaccuracies in reporting events that occurred during pregnancy by the mothers and the duration of intervention being 12 months, which might be considered short. Conclusions In this study, we found that use of ImTeCHO mobile- and web-based application as a job aid by government ASHAs and PHC staff improved coverage and quality of MNCH services in hard-to-reach areas. Supportive supervision, change management, and timely resolution of technology-related issues were critical implementation considerations to ensure adherence to the intervention.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Delivery of community-based maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) services can improve health outcomes and reduce preventable infant deaths. To improve the coverage of proven MNCH services, a new cadre of village-based frontline workers, called Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), was introduced by the government of India in 2005. However, the coverage and quality of MNCH services delivered by ASHAs remains low, especially in hard-to-reach tribal areas. Mobile-phone-technology-based health (mHealth) solutions are promising, innovative strategies with the potential to improve performance of frontline health workers in controlled settings. However, there is a lack of robust evidence about the effectiveness of mHealth solutions implemented within the public health system as a job aid to frontline health workers towards improving coverage of MNCH services. What did researchers do and find? Twenty-two Primary Health Centers (PHCs) were randomly allocated to usual care from public health providers from the government with (11 PHCs, 280 ASHAs, population: 234,134) or without (11 PHCs, 281 ASHAs, population: 242,809) an mHealth intervention. The mHealth intervention included a package of various mobile-phone-technology-based job aids to facilitate longitudinal tracking, scheduling of health services, screening for complications, counseling for behavior change communication, and real-time monitoring and supportive supervision by supervisory staff at PHCs. Twelve months after the implementation, mothers were surveyed. We found that coverage and quality of most of the MNCH services were significantly higher among PHCs that were served by ASHAs who used mHealth as a job aid compared to those who did not. The coverage of at least two home visits within first week of birth was 32.4% in the mHealth intervention group, compared to 22.9% in the control group. A composite index, which was calculated based on coverage of multiple key MNCH services, was 43.0% in the mHealth intervention group compared to 38.5% in the nonintervention group. The ASHAs regularly used and adhered to the mHealth intervention; however, its use was low among the PHC staff. What do these findings mean? To our knowledge, this is the one of the first studies of its kind that assessed effectiveness of multiple mHealth job aids implemented in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) through frontline health workers in an existing public health system throughout the continuum of care to improve wide range of MNCH outcomes among hard-to-reach populations using a robust research methodology. Adequate supportive supervision, change management, and ongoing technology assistance is crucial to ensure satisfactory adherence to the intervention. Our findings support the scale-up of mobile-phone-technology-based interventions as a job aid to frontline health workers to improve health outcomes.

AB  - Immune check-point blockade (ICB) targeting programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1 (PD-1) axis has created paradigm shift in cancer treatment. 'ST-RELA' and 'PF-A' molecular subgroups of ependymomas (EPN) show poor outcomes. We aimed to understand the potential candidature of EPNs for ICB. Supratentorial (ST) Grade II/III EPNs were classified into ST-RELA, ST-YAP, and ST-not otherwise specified (NOS), based on RELA/YAP1 fusion transcripts and/or L1CAM and p65 protein expression. Posterior fossa (PF) EPNs were classified into PF-A and PF-B based on H3K27me3 expression. Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 and CD8 was performed. RelA protein enrichment at PDL1 promoter site was analysed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR). Eighty-three intracranial EPNs were studied. Median tumor infiltrating CD8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) density was 6/mm(2), and was higher in ST-EPNs (median 10/mm(2)) as compared to PF-EPNs (median 3/mm(2)). PD-L1 expression was noted in 17/83 (20%) EPNs, including 12/31 ST-RELA and rare ST-NOS (2/12), PF-A (2/25) and PF-B (1/13) EPNs. Twelve EPNs (14%) showed high CTL density and concurrent PD-L1 positivity, of which majority (10/12) were ST-RELA EPNs. Enrichment of RelA protein was seen at PDL1 promoter. Increased CTL densities and upregulation of PD-L1 in ST-RELA ependymomas suggests potential candidature for immunotherapy.

AB  - Background & objectives: Inhibitors of immune checkpoint regulators, programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), improve outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Tumours expressing PD-L1 protein are more likely to benefit from this targeted therapy. Multiple concurrent clinical trials evaluating different anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have validated five different immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays using varied antibody clones and staining conditions. This study was aimed at identification of a single harmonized PD-L1 assay for tumour tissue conservation and cost-effectiveness in patients with NSCLC.
   Methods: The performance of low-cost, manual, laboratory-developed technique (LDT) PD-L1 IHC assay using the easily available SP142 clone was compared with trial validated Ventana SP263 IHC performed on automated Ventana staining platform on tumour sections of NSCLCs.
   Results: Eighty cases of NSCLC were included. SP263 and SP142 stained both tumour cells and immune cells. The concordance rate of tumour cell staining was about 76 per cent, with SP263 detecting more tumour cells in 16 per cent of cases. The concordance rate of immune cell staining was only 61 per cent, with SP142 detecting more immune cells in 24 per cent of cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of manual SP142 LDT assay against gold standard SP263 Ventana assay were 70, 94, 86 and 86 per cent, respectively, at positivity thresholds of >= 1 per cent tumour cell staining.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The study findings suggested that LDT using SP142 clone showed only moderate concordance with SP263 Ventana assay, and the two assays were not interchangeable. More such validation studies need to be done to generate information that can complement patient therapy in cases of NSCLC.

AB  - Rare missense variants play a crucial role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathophysiology. We report rare/novel missense variants from 154 Indian ALS patients, identified through targeted sequencing of 25 ALS-associated genes. As pathogenic variants could explain only a small percentage of ALS pathophysiology in our cohort, we investigated the frequency of tolerated and benign novel/rare variants, which could be potentially ALS susceptible. These variants were identified in 5.36% (8/149) of sporadic ALS (sALS) cases; with one novel variant each in ERBB4, SETX, DCTN1, and MATR3; four rare variants, one each in PON2 and ANG and two different rare variants in SETX. Identified variants were either absent or present at extremely rare frequencies (MAF < 0.01) in large population databases and were absent in 50 healthy controls sequenced through Sanger method. Furthermore, an oligogenic basis of ALS was observed in three sALS, with co-occurrence of intermediate-length repeat expansions in ATXN2 and a rare/novel variant in DCTN1 and SETX genes. Additionally, molecular dynamics and biochemical functional analysis of an angiogenin variant (R21G) identified from our cohort demonstrated loss of ribonucleolytic and nuclear translocation activities. Our findings suggest that rare variants could be potentially pathogenic and functional studies are warranted to decisively establish the pathogenic mechanisms associated with them.

AB  - Ultrafine gold particles (AuPs) can be emerged as a good candidate in the field of drug delivery as well as in imaging applications. However, little attention has been paid to detailed study of nanoparticle's interaction with blood components before systemic use. An investigation into the interaction of ultrafine AuPs with blood components is must for its clinical application. In present study, the interaction of ultrafine sized AuPs (2 +/- 0.5 nm, 5 +/- 1 nm, and 10 +/- 2 nm) with blood components and its immunogenic property (pro-inflammatory reaction) was investigated. All three sized AuPs did not cause any significant hemolysis. Plasma coagulation study showed significant increase in Prothrombin time (PT) with International Normalized Ratio (INR) value raised to 1.53 with 10 nm AuPs. Maximum prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (3.2 s) was seen with 5 & 10 nm sized AuPs. Maximum thrombin time (TT) prolongation was seen with 2 nm (18.3s) with the difference of 1.4 s as compared to control. Platelet aggregation was faster in case of 5 & 10 nm sized AuPs. All three sized AuPs exhibited in-vitro C3 complement activation whereas they did not stimulate significant proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). These findings further validate the utility of ultrafine AuPs for in-vivo applications.

AB  - Background: Each year approximately five million people die from injuries. In countries where systems of trauma care have been introduced, death and disability have decreased. A major component of developed trauma systems is a trauma quality improvement (TQI) program and trauma quality improvement meeting (TQIM). Effective TQIMs improve trauma care by identifying and fixing problems. But globally, TQIMs are absent or unstructured in most hospitals providing trauma care. The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate a checklist for a structured TQIM.
   Methods: This project was conducted as a prospective before-and-after study in four major trauma cen- tres in India. The intervention was the introduction of a structured TQIM using a checklist, introduced with a workshop. This workshop was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) TQI Programs short course and resources, plus the developed TQIM checklist. Pre- and post-intervention data collection occurred at all meetings in which cases of trauma death were discussed. The primary outcome was TQIM Checklist compliance, defined by the discussion of, and agreement upon each of the following: preventability of death, identification of opportunities to improve care and corrective actions and a plan for closing the loop.
   Results: There were 34 meetings in each phase, with 99 cases brought to the pre-intervention phase and 125 cases brought to the post-intervention phase. There was an increase in the proportion of cases brought to the meeting for which preventability of death was discussed (from 94% to 100%, p = 0.007) and agreed (from 7 to 19%, OR 3.7; 95% CI:1.4-9.4, p =0.004) and for which a plan for closing the loop was discussed (from 2% to 18%, OR 10.9; 95% CI:2.5-47.6, p < 0.001) and agreed (from 2% to 18%, OR 10.9; 95% CI:2.5-47.6, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: This study developed, implemented and evaluated a TQIM Checklist for improving TQIM processes. The introduction of a TQIM Checklist, with training, into four Indian trauma centres, led to more structured TQIMs, including increased discussion and agreement on preventability of death and plans for loop closure. A TQIM Checklist should be considered for all centres managing trauma patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Stress, anxiety, and depression are known to be associated with the development of neurodegenerative disorders through interactions with the underlying pathophysiology. We hypothesized that the presence of these symptoms contributes to cognitive disturbances and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to investigate the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in PD patients relative to healthy individuals. Materials and Methods: Anxiety, stress, and depression levels were assessed using standardized questionnaires in PD without dementia (PDND, n = 30), PD with dementia (PDD, n = 28), and healthy controls (HC, n = 26). Arithmetic subtraction task was used as a stressor. Galvanic skin response, heart rate and salivary cortisol, and alpha-amylase were measured during baseline and after induced stress (arithmetic task). Results: Acute anxiety, acute stress, and depression levels were significantly higher in PDND compared to HC, whereas both acute and chronic anxiety, stress, and depression levels were significantly higher in PDD compared to PDND and HC. Cortisol and alpha-amylase levels were significantly higher in PDND compared to HC during both baseline and postarithmetic task. Posttask levels of cortisol were lower in PDD compared to PDND. Conclusion: This study concludes that higher levels of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase at baseline and poststress task with normal levels of chronic stress and anxiety were associated with no dementia in PD. Presence of higher levels of acute, chronic anxiety, and stress along with depression with lower cortisol reactivity to stressor suggests onset of dementia in Parkinson's patients.

AB  - Innate immunity plays an important role in pathophysiology of tuberculosis which is influenced by various host factors. One such factor is vitamin D which, along with its associated molecule, can alter the host defense against Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (M.Tb.) via altered production of cathelicidin and nitric oxide, both having bactericidal effect. Therefore, assessment of vitamin D and its associated molecules in tuberculosis patients and household contacts as compared to healthy controls were done and the implication of these findings in susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) was studied. 80 active TB patients, 75 household contacts and 70 healthy controls were included. Vitamin D receptor (VDR), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA levels were studied using quantitative PCR. Serum VDR, cathelicidin, and iNOS levels were measured using ELISA. Vitamin D and NO levels were measured in serum using chemiluminescence based immunoassay and greiss reaction based colorimetry kit respectively. Decreased serum levels of vitamin D were observed in active TB patients as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001). VDR and NOS mRNA levels were found to be significantly lower in active TB patients compared to household contacts and healthy controls (p < 0.0001 and 0.005 respectively). VDBP mRNA expression was found to be lower in active TB group as compared to household contacts and healthy controls however the difference was not found to be significant (p > 0.21). Although, mRNA expression of VDR, VDR protein and iNOS along with vitamin D levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in household contacts compared to active TB group. However, levels of iNOS, NO and cathelicidin were found to be higher in TB patients as compared to household contacts and healthy controls (p < 0.01, 0.05 and 0.01 respectively). Higher levels of Vitamin D along with VDR and iNOS expression in household contacts as compared to active TB patients suggest vitamin D might have a protective role against TB plausibly decreasing disease susceptibility. Low vitamin D levels in active TB patients warrants further studies to determine the role of vitamin D supplementation in prevention and treatment of TB.

AB  - Background: Anemia is a common morbidity in elderly persons (aged 60 years or above). In India, in recent years, the number of old age homes (OAHs) and the residents living in them has increased significantly. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of anemia among elderly persons living in OAHs. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among individuals living in OAH in Delhi, India. Using combination of location and type of OAH, 28 clusters of almost equal sizes were created, of which 13 clusters were randomly selected, and all elderly persons living therein were selected for the study. Sociodemographic profile was recorded using a self-designed, semistructured interview schedule. Hemoglobin (Hb) was estimated using HemoCue Hb 201+ system. Binary Logistic regression was used to assess the socioeconomic determinants of anemia. Results: The study included 334 elderly persons, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 75.2 (8.6) years and mean (SD) Hb of 11.6 (1.7) g/dL. The mean (SD) Hb in men was 12.1 (1.7) g/dL compared to 10.9 (1.5) g/dL among women (P < 0.0001). The overall prevalence of anemia was 68.7% (95% confidence interval 63.9, 73.4); among those who were anemic, 47.4% had mild anemia, 47.0% had moderate anemia, and 5.6% had severe anemia. The prevalence of mild anemia was 45% in men compared to 24.8% in women. The odds of anemia among >= 80 years was 2 times that among 60-69 years (P < 0.029). Conclusions: The prevalence of anemia among elderly persons in OAHs is high in Delhi, India and increased with age.

AB  - Purpose: To ascertain if ultrasound (USG) B-scan examination of the optic nerve head (ONH) can be a useful tool to diagnose and quantify glaucomatous cupping. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study of 48 eyes of 48 patients with clear ocular media and cup-disc ratio of (CDR) >= 0.6 were included. The disc was studied by + 90D examination, USG B-scan and ONH Optical coherence tomography (OCT) by three masked observers. Observer-1 assessed the clinical CDR, observer-2recordedopticcup diameter on USG B-scan and observer-3performed ONH OCT to note the software computed average CDR. Measurements of cupping obtained by these 3 methods were compared and their relative strengths determined. The interdependency between variables was further studied using regression analysis. Results: Clinically assessed disc ratios of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and total corresponded to USG cup measures of 1.02 +/- 0.11 mm, 1.23 +/- 0.14 mm, 1.35 +/- 0.072 mm, 1.45 +/- 0.084 mm, 1.75 +/- 0.15 mm and OCT average CDR of 0.62 +/- 0.087, 0.68 +/- 0.060, 0.75 +/- 0.078, 0.81 +/- 0.036, 0.89 +/- 0.038, respectively. There was an excellent correlation between the three arms, with Pearson's co-efficient (r) of 0.87, P < 0.001 between clinical and USG cupping; r = 0.89, P < 0.001 between clinical and OCT cupping; and r = 0.88, P < 0.001 between USG and OCT cupping. A relation of y = 1.64x + 0.03 was obtained between them, where y stands for USG cup diameter and x stands for the observed clinical CDR. Conclusion: Ultrasonographic measurement of optic cup diameter corresponds well to clinical ONH cupping. Therefore, it can reliably be used in quantifying ONH cupping in cases of media opacities which preclude optic disc visualization.

AB  - Hands-on resident surgical training for various ocular procedures is essential to impart good surgical skills to the budding ophthalmologists. Here in this report, we demonstrate a simple and inexpensive technique of performing extraocular muscle surgery on goats' eye. These animal eyes possess soft tissue resemblance to that of human eyes to a greater extent in terms of scleral rigidity, muscle elasticity, its width, thickness, and its insertion onto the sclera. Therefore, rectus muscle recession, resection, and plication surgeries can be performed repeatedly to improve an individual's orientation and practical experience before performing the procedure on human eyes.

TI  - Post traumatic retinal injuries: Does the ocular protective reflex play a crucial role?
T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
KW  - Traumatic retinal dialysis
KW  - Blunt ocular trauma
KW  - Bell's phenomenon
AB  - Traumatic retinal injuries are commonly encountered in most retinal subspecialty clinics. Retinal dialysis, detachment and other complications consequent to blunt trauma are often thought to be due to equatorial expansion of the globe following an antero-posterior compressive force. However, stretching of the globe along the primary anatomical equator may not hold true for the adjusted globe position as a consequence of the protective Bell's phenomenon which gets activated before impact. The upward and outward rolling of the globe likely creates a new equator, with the compressive forces acting along this new plane, thereby leading to stretching along the ocular coats closer to the retinal periphery. Additionally, the coup and countercoup mechanisms with increased vulnerability of temporal sclera predisposes to retinal complications more commonly along the temporal and the nasal retina. Further, retinal complications involving other quadrants can also be explained through understanding of the Bell's phenomenon.

AB  - Purpose: High Dose Rate (HDR) remote afterloading brachytherapy machine and advanced treatment planning system have made it possible to make variations in individual dwell times across a catheter according to tumour density and for sparing normal structures. New inverse planning technique such as Inverse Planning Simulated Annealing (IPSA) has also been introduced. But very few institutions are venturing towards volume based IPSA optimised intracavitary brachytherapy. This study focuses on dwell time deviation constraint (DTDC) feature of IPSA based optimization which restricts the large variation of dwell time across the catheter. Methods and Material: For this retrospective study we have generated IPSA optimised intracavitary brachytherapy plans for 20 cancer cervix applications. The initial DTDC value of each IPSA plan was kept 0.0. Later on gradual increment was made in DTDC values in step of 0.2. Plan modulation index (M) defined by Ryan L. Smith et al was used for characterising the variation of dwell time modulation with respect to gradual increase in DTDC parameter. Results: Plan modulation index gradually decreases with increasing value of DTDC from 0.0 to 1.0. There was the 83% decrease in M value from IPSA of DTDC 0.0 to fully constrained IPSA of DTDC1.0. There is reduction of 8.26% and 6.95% for D2cc values of rectum and bladder respectively for DTDC 1.0 compared to DTDC 0.0.Conclusions: One of the benefits of applying DTDC constrained in IPSA plan is that, it removes local hot spots. It's another advantage is the reduction in rectum and bladder dose.

AB  - Background Although full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) is the gold standard test to detect physiological dysfunction in siderosis, it measures overall retinal function. This study aims to determine if multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) can detect subclinical siderosis in eyes with an iron intraocular foreign body (IOFB).
   Methods Twenty eyes of 20 patients with retained iron IOFB, clear ocular media and good visual acuity (>= 20/120) were enroled in this prospective case-control study. The fellow eyes served as control. These were evaluated with ffERG and mfERG at baseline. Serial mfERG was done till six months after pars plana vitrectomy with IOFB removal. Primary outcomes measures were amplitude and peak time of P1 and N1 wave of mfERG.
   Results The median age was 25 years (range 18-55). Most patients (n = 14/20) presented within a month of trauma. Baseline ffERG showed no difference in either 'a' or 'b' wave amplitude or peak time between cases and controls. However, on mfERG, there was a significant decrease in P1 and N1 wave amplitude and delay in P1 wave peak time in <2 degrees retinal ring in cases as compared to controls (p = 0.001, 0.001 and 0.02 respectively) despite variability in results. At 6 months, P1 amplitude showed significant improvement from baseline in cases (p = 0.010). However, P1 peak time did not show significant recovery (p = 0.65).
   Conclusions mfERG may reveal subclinical electrophysiological retinal dysfunction in eyes with iron IOFB in cases with normal ffERG. P1 peak time may serve as an electrophysiological marker for past retinal damage.

AB  - Morphological studies in developing brain determine critical periods of proliferation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and apoptosis. During these periods both intrinsic and extrinsic pathological factors can hamper development. These time points are not available for the human cochlear nucleus (CN). We have used design-based stereology and determined that 18-22 weeks of gestation (WG) are critical in the development of the human CN. Twenty-three fetuses and seven postnatal brainstems were processed for cresyl violet (CV) staining and immunoexpression of NeuN (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), Ki-67 (proliferation) and TUNEL (apoptosis) and 3-D reconstruction. The volume of CN, total number of neurons selected profiles and the volume of neurons and their nuclei were estimated. Data were grouped (G) into: G1:18-20 WG, G2: 21-24 WG, G3: 25-28 WG and G4 >29 WG. The dimensions of morphologically identified neurons were also measured. The CN primordium was first identifiable at 10WG. Definitive DCN (Dorsal cochlear nucleus) and VCN (ventral cochlear nucleus) were identifiable at 16 WG. There was a sudden growth spurt in total volume of CN, number of neurons and astrocytes from 18 WG. We also observed an increase in proliferation and apoptosis after 22 WG. The number of neurons identifiable by CV was significantly lower than that by NeuN-immunostaining till 25 WG (p = 0.020), after which, both methods were equivalent. Eight morphological types of neurons were identifiable by 26 WG and could be resolved into four clusters by volume and diameter. The CN changed orientation from small, flat and horizontal at 10-16 WG to larger and oblique from 18WG onwards. Prevention of exposure to noxious factors at 18-22 WG may be important in preventing congenital deafness. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Glioma grading between intermediate grades (Grade II vs. III and Grade III vs. IV) as well as multiclass grades (Grade II vs. III vs. IV) is challenging and needs to be addressed. Purpose To develop an artificial intelligence-based methodology for glioma grading using T-1 perfusion parameters and volume of tumor components, and validate the efficacy of the methodology by grading on a cohort of glioma patients. Study Type Retrospective. Population The development set consisted of 53 glioma patients and validation consisted of 13 glioma patients. Field Strength/Sequence Conventional MRI images (2D T-1-W, dual PD-T-2-W, and 3D FLAIR) and 3D T-1 perfusion MRI data obtained at 3 T. Assessment Enhancing and nonenhancing components of glioma were segmented out and combined to form the region of interest (ROI) for glioma grading. Prominent vessels were removed from the selected ROI. Different T-1 perfusion parameters from the ROI were combined with volume of tumor components to form the feature set for glioma grading. Optimization was carried out for selection of the statistic of the T-1 perfusion parameters and the features to be used for glioma grading using sequential feature selection and random forest-based feature selection method. An optimized support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for glioma grading. Statistical Tests Mean +/- SD, analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer test, ROC analysis. Results Classification error for Grade II vs. III was 3.7%, for Grade III vs. IV was 5.26%, and for Grade II vs. III vs. IV was 9.43% using the proposed methodology. The mean of the values above the 90(th) percentile value of T-1 perfusion parameters provided a maximum area under the curve (AUC) for intermediate grade differentiation. Random forest obtained optimal feature set provided better grading results than other methods using the SVM classifier. Data Conclusion It was feasible to achieve low classification error for intermediate as well as multiclass glioma grading using an SVM classifier based on optimized features obtained from T-1 perfusion MRI and volumes of tumor components. Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;50:1295-1306.

AB  - Purpose: People with visual disability need assistive technology to improve their body functioning and performance. The purpose of the present study was to understand the awareness, use and barriers in accessing the assistive technology among young patients attending visual rehabilitation clinic of a tertiary eye care hospital in Delhi. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on consecutively recruited patients registered for the first time in visual rehabilitation clinic of the community ophthalmology department of the tertiary eye centre during June and July 2018. A study tool consisting of 42 assistive technologies was developed. Patients were screened for distance visual acuity both presenting and binocular pinhole vision using an 'E' chart with two optotype (6/18, 6/60). Results: 85 patients (69.4% male) were enrolled from the VR clinic. 83.5% of the patients had a best corrected binocular vision acuity <6/18 to 1/60. There was good awareness of only 2 of the 42 devices (>67% of the participants): near optical magnifiers, walking long canes. There was moderate awareness of 10 devices (34-66% of the participants) and poor awareness of the rest (<33%). Likewise, participants reported moderate usage of 3 out of the 42 devices and poor usage of the remaining devices. Non-availability of devices was the most frequently reported barrier in the study. Conclusion: The awareness and utilization of assistive technologies for visual disability was poor in patients attending visual rehabilitation clinic. Hospitals could procure assistive technologies and introduce strategies to improve awareness as well as promote utilization.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Introduction: Carcinoma of cervix is a common gynaecological malignancy and remains the third most common cancer in developing countries. While nodal metastases are common in cervical cancer, major sites of the less common haematogenous metastases include lung, liver and bones. Bone involvement in cases of carcinoma of cervix is low and the estimates range from 0.8-16 % according to various series.Several patterns of bone involvement are observed in cases of carcinoma of cervix including, (1) direct extension into bone, either from the parametrial extensions of the primary or recurrent pelvic tumor, (2) direct extension into adjacent bone from the pelvic or distant lymph node metastasis (3) regional or systemic haematogenous metastasis to bones.Aims: To evaluate the pattern of metastases in patients of carcinoma of uterine cervix, with particular emphasis on the pattern of bone involvement on contrast enhanced CT. Settings and Design: Retrospective study.Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study, where we reviewed the hospital records and data of patients of cervical cancer who underwent contrast enhanced CT (CECT) of the chest and abdomen over a period of one year between January and December 2016. A total of 100 patients of carcinoma cervix were included. CT images were reviewed by two experienced radiologists. The bony erosion due to pelvic mass or lymphadenopathy was classified as subtle or gross.Results: Bone involvement was seen in 11 out of 100 cases (11% cases). Among 13 cases direct bone involvement by the pelvic mass/recurrence and metastatic lymph nodes (8/11; 72.7%) was slightly more common than thehematogenous bone metastasis (5/11; 45.4% cases). Among the direct bone involvement direct erosion of the underlying bone by the nodal metastasis (6/8; 75%) was twice more common than the direct bone involvement by the pelvic mass/recurrence(2/8; 25%).Conclusions: Direct bone involvement by erosion of adjacent bone by nodal metastasis is the most common mechanism of bone involvement in cases of carcinoma of cervix signifying the high propensity of lymph nodal deposits to erode the underlying bone. This finding of direct bone erosion is not seen in any other gynaecological malignancy and should be promptly looked for in all cases of carcinoma of cervix.

AB  - Objective: "Feel good effect" of exercise is well known. Activation of pain inhibitory mechanisms after exercise is also well documented. Swimming is considered as a beneficial exercise as well as health-promoting sport. The significance of testosterone in swimming exercise-induced analgesia is yet to be understood. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the significance of testosterone in swimming exercise-induced analgesia. Materials and Methods: The basal tail flick latencies of all animals were recorded by using tail flick analgesiometer. In order to observe the effect of testosterone on swimming exercise-induced analgesia, testicles of animals of some groups were surgically removed. Then animals were subjected to swimming sessions of different patterns. After swimming, tail flick latencies were measured. Results: Swimming sessions resulted in increase in pain thresholds of all animals. Castration negatively affected the degree of analgesia achieved in rats. However, daily treatment of testosterone propionate (500 mu g/kg, s.c.) improved swim-induced analgesia in castrated rats. Moreover, daily administration of naloxone hydrochloride (1 mg/kg, i.p.) fifteen min prior to swimming suppressed testosterone therapy resulted in an increase in swim-induced analgesia in castrated animals. Conclusion: We concluded that testosterone plays a significant role in swimming exercise-induced analgesia in male Wistar albino rats and this positive effect of testosterone on pain threshold might be mediated through its probable effect on the endogenous opioid system.

AB  - Alteration of biomarkers is well-documented in breast cancer at locoregional recurrence or metastasis attributed to tumor heterogeneity and change in biology. There is a lack of literature on alteration of biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) at progression. We included 32 patients of upfront MBC. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu documented at baseline and at progression. Median age was 46 (range 26-72) years. Estrogen receptor altered in 6 (18.75%) patients [4 (12.5%) positive to negative and 2 (6.25%) from negative to positive], progesterone receptor altered in 8 (25.3%) patients (6 [18.75%] positive to negative and 2 [6.25%] negative to positive) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu altered in 5 (15.6%) patients (all were positive to negative). Therapy was changed as per new receptor status. Documentation of change in receptor status may be justified to determine further therapy and prognosis in MBC at progression. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background The completeness of a trauma registry's data is essential for its valid use. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of missing data in a new multicentre trauma registry in India and to assess the association between data completeness and potential predictors of missing data, particularly mortality. Methods The proportion of missing data for variables among all adults was determined from data collected from 19 April 2016 to 30 April 2017. In-hospital physiological data were defined as missing if any of initial systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, or Glasgow Coma Scale were missing. Univariable logistic regression and multivariable logistic regression, using manual stepwise selection, were used to investigate the association between mortality (and other potential predictors) and missing physiological data. Results Data on the 4466 trauma patients in the registry were analysed. Out of 59 variables, most (n = 51; 86.4%) were missing less than 20% of observations. There were 808 (18.1%) patients missing at least one of the first in-hospital physiological observations. Hospital death was associated with missing in-hospital physiological data (adjusted OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.02-2.01; p = 0.04). Other significant associations with missing data were: patient arrival time out of hours, hospital of care, 'other' place of injury, and specific injury mechanisms. Assault/homicide injury intent and occurrence of chest X-ray were associated with not missing any of first in-hospital physiological variables. Conclusion Most variables were well collected. Hospital death, a proxy for more severe injury, was associated with missing first in-hospital physiological observations. This remains an important limitation for trauma registries.

AB  - Purpose: In adults, the Status Epilepticus Severity Score (STESS), a clinical score, has been shown to be a good predictor of outcome and treatment response. We devised a pediatric modification of this score: the Status Epilepticus in Pediatric patients Severity Score (STEPSS) and evaluated it in children with status epilepticus.
   Methods: In this prospective study, children aged 1 month to 18 years presenting with seizure duration >= 5 min or actively convulsing to the emergency room were enrolled. STEPSS score was calculated at the time of admission. Outcomes included death, the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) at discharge and treatment response. The diagnostic utility of the STEPSS score to predict unfavourable outcome was evaluated.
   Results: One-hundred and forty children (mean age 5.8 years) were enrolled. Seven children died and overall 15 children had an unfavourable outcome. The predictive accuracy of STEPSS at a cut-off of > 3: for unfavourable outcome (POPC score >= 3) - sensitivity (0.93 [95% CI: 68, 99.8]), specificity (0.81 [95% CI: 0.73, 0.87]), PPV (0.37 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.54]), NPV (0.99 [95% CI: 0.95-1.0]), positive likelihood ratio (4.86), Fl score (0.530); for death - sensitivity (0.86 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.99]), specificity (0.76 [95% CI: 0.68-0.83]), PPV (0.16 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.31]), NPV (0.99 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.0]), Fl score (0.270).
   Conclusions: The STEPSS, a simple bedside clinical score, was found to be useful to predict the outcome and treatment response in children with status epilepticus.

AB  - Purpose: Evaluate role of Strip Meniscometry (SMT) and lower tear meniscus [height (LTMH) & depth (LTMD)] in diagnosis of Dry Eye Disease (DED) and its comparison with TBUT.
   Methods: In a prospective observational cross-sectional study of 120 eyes [60 eyes of 30 DED (Group 1) & 60 eyes of 30 controls (Group 2)] TBUT, Schirmer's, SMT, LTMH and LTMD was done. Subjects > 18 years diagnosed with DED (aqueous deficient) as per Tear film and Ocular surface society-Dry Eye Workshop (TFOS DEWS) II protocol and Ocular surface disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, with no associated systemic risk factor and previous ocular medical/surgical treatment were included as cases and subjects with no history of ocular surface disease as controls. The data was analyzed using t-test & receiver operating characteristic curve.
   Results: TBUT & Schirmer's values were significantly lower in group 1 (p < 0.05). SMT was 2.28 +/- 1.28 (Range 0-6) & 8.11 +/- 1.39 (Range 3-10) in group 1 & 2 respectively (p < 0.05). LTMH was 169.32 +/- 29.84 mu m (Range 85.78-209.11) and 234.41 +/- 19.51 mu m (Range 203.89-289.53) in Group 1 & 2 respectively (p < 0.05). LTMD was 144.32 +/- 33.60 mu m (Range 57.49-190.12) and 206.69 +/- 14.17 mu m (Range 187.12-251.50) in Group 1 & 2 respectively (p < 0.05). The SMT, LTMH and LTMD showed a cutoff value of < 5mm (AUC 0.994, sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 96.7%), 204.96 mu m (AUC 0.998, sensitivity 98.3%, specificity 96.7%) & 190 mu m (AUC 0.995, sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 95%) respectively.
   Conclusion: SMT, ASOCT, LTMD & LTMH are useful non invasive diagnostic tests for DED comparable with TBUT.

AB  - Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of Werner syndrome with corneal blindness due to bilateral primary bullous keratopathy. Werner syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by features of premature aging, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, hypergonadotrophic hypogonad ism, hypertriglyceridemia, scleroderma-like skin changes, and sarcomas. Among ocular manifestations, cataracts, cystoid macular edema, and retinal detachment have been reported. Because these patients show features of premature aging, they have decreased corneal endothelial function and delayed fibroblast growth. To date, there are few reports of wound dehiscence, bleb formation, and bullous keratopathy following surgical insult that have usually occurred after cataract surgery in patients with Werner syndrome.There have been no reports in the literature regarding Werner syndrome presenting with primary corneal decompensation without any inciting factor. Our patient with Werner syndrome had primary bilateral bullous keratopathy and bilateral corneal blindness for 10 years and was eventually rehabilitated by corneal transplant. Hence, this case highlights the importance of early referral of such patients to the ophthalmologist for prompt diagnosis and early treatment so that blindness could be avoided.

AB  - Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase pathway involves several oncogenic genes which can serve as potential targets for therapy. Therefore, aim of the present study is to analyze mutations in the MAP Kinase pathway in pulmonary adenocarcinoma (ADCA) of Indian patients along with clinico-pathologic correlation and determination of the survival status in patients receiving therapy. Blocks and slides of 125 pulmonary ADCA of last 5 years were retrieved. Histo-morphology and tumor content were determined. EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and MEK1 genes were analyzed using Sanger sequencing and Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinico-pathologic correlation and survival analysis were performed. Fifty-eight (46.4%) patients harbored genetic mutations of which 49 had single somatic mutations, 5 had multiple exonic and 4 showed coexisting EGFR and KRAS mutations. EGFR mutations were seen in 24.8%, KRAS in 19.2% and BRAF (non-V600E) in 2.4% cases. There was no difference in progression-free survival of wild-type/single mutations when compared with multiple/coexisting mutations (P=0.09). However, the P value may indicate borderline correlation. To conclude, EGFR and KRAS mutations may coexist in the same patient in lung ADCA. Multiple exonic mutations of KRAS gene formed substantial percentage of our cohort, requiring further exploration. Lung ADCA harbouring BRAF mutations are commonly non-V600E. Testing of all major genetic driver mutations of lung ADCA irrespective of histology and other demographic characteristics is necessary.

AB  - The presence of ovarian or peritoneal metastasis in early-stage cervical malignancy is a rare entity. It often poses a diagnostic challenge whether it is a synchronous primary tumor or a metastatic lesion. A 63-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with Stage 1B1 carcinoma cervix with ascites, and a 5.8 cm x 4.2 cm x 3.5 cm left solid adnexal mass. She underwent Type III radical hysterectomy, excision of peritoneal mass, with bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy and infracolic omentectomy. On histopathology, cervix showed features of adenocarcinoma, and the peritoneal mass revealed similar histomorphology as cervical growth with metastatic tumor deposits in omentum. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was utilized to determine the origin of mass. The early stage disease and histology may not always predict the distant metastasis. Therefore, a thorough pretreatment evaluation, meticulous intraoperative assessment, and IHC are mandatory for optimum management and prognostication.

AB  - Mastalgia is the commonest cause of visit to the breast clinic. The present study was conducted to assess the efficacy of complete estrogen blockade (CEB) with centchroman and LHRH analog goserelin in the treatment of recalcitrant mastalgia. This is a prospective cohort study of 10 patients with recalcitrant mastalgia. Recalcitrant mastalgia was defined as bothersome breast pain with pain scores of six or more on breast pain chart, lasting for at least 7 days in a month even with therapy with first-line drugs for 3 months. The reduction of VAS to 3 or less at 4 weeks of initiation of treatment was the primary objective. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria received CEB for 3 months and were followed for 3 months to see for their symptom relief/recurrence. The pain scores were recorded. Side effects of the drug were noted. The mean pain score at start of study was 7.8. At 4 weeks of initiation of treatment, pain score became zero in five patients and reduced to less than three in three patients. These responders had maximum pain score of 3 during the follow-up period. None of the patients had adverse effect of the magnitude to request cessation of the treatment. There was no difference in characteristics of patients who responded from those who did not. No differences were seen among women with cyclical or noncyclical mastalgia. Complete estrogen blockade is safe and effective for treatment of recalcitrant mastalgia having a good post-treatment effect.

AB  - Purpose: The mechanism of ocular growth eludes us and research on vitreous chamber depth (VCD) is lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of VCD and its ratio to axial length (AL) in relation to ocular biometry. Methods: This retrospective study of patients planned for cataract surgery was performed at a tertiary center. Data regarding AL, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), and central corneal thickness (CCT) of 640 eyes was noted. Anterior segment (AS) was measured as sum of CCT, ACD, and LT, while VCD was calculated as the difference between AL and AS. Correlation of VCD and VCD: AL with ocular biometry was the primary outcome measure. Three groups were formed on the basis of AL and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was applied. Results: Mean VCD was 15.38+/-1.14 mm. Mean VCD: AL was 0.66+/-0.02. VCD had a very strong relation with AL (R = 0.9, P < 0.001) only, whereas VCD: AL had a good--strong relation with AL (R = 0.5, P < 0.001), AS (R = 0.7, P < 0.001), ACD (R = 0.3, P < 0.001), and LT (R = 0.5, P < 0.001). The relation of VCD: AL with AS was very strong across all groups (R =-0.8, P < 0.001 in all groups). 85% of eyes in group with AL < 22 mm had VCD: AL <0.67, conversely 85% of eyes with AL >24.5 mm had VCD: AL >0.67. Conclusion: We found VCD to have the strongest relation with AL. VCD: AL was more consistent and showed a strong relation to ocular biometry across all ALs. This suggests the possible utility of the ratio VCD: AL while evaluating ocular growth, refractive status, and myopia-related complications.

Risk factors, severity, mechanisms, management, complications, and outcomes among ischemic stroke patients were compared between North and South Indian centers. Results: Of the 2066 patients enrolled from North (n = 1060) and South India (n = 1006), North Indian patients were significantly older with fewer men and had lower rates of diabetes (32.8% vs. 38.7%, p < 0.01), dyslipidemia (3.5% vs. 25.7%, p < 0.01), tobacco use (27% vs. 38%, p < 0.001), and alcohol use (30.1% vs. 38.6%, p < 0.01). North Indian patients had higher median National Institute of Health stroke scale scores (10 vs. 9, p < 0.01), more frequent large-artery atherosclerosis mechanism (34% vs. 25.6%, p < 0.001), intravenous thrombolysis (14.0% vs. 6.1%, p < 0.001), and lower rates of pneumonia (10.5% vs. 15.1%, p = 0.02). The three-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, 45.8% vs. 50.3%, p = 0.08) did not differ; however, North Indian patients had higher 90-day mortality (23.5% vs. 13.5%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions The substantial regional differences in stroke risk factors and mechanisms may be partly explained by factors such as differing dietary habits and lifestyle, which can be addressed at a national level. Differences in acute and inpatient stroke care suggest a need for better adoption of national stroke management guidelines.

AB  - Purpose Spinal Cord Society (SCS) and Spine Trauma Study Group (STSG) established a panel tasked with reviewing management and prognosis of acute traumatic cervical central cord syndrome (ATCCS) and recommend a consensus statement for its management.
   Methods A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA 2009 guidelines. Delphi method was used to identify key research questions and achieve consensus. PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched for corresponding keywords. The initial search retrieved 770 articles of which 37 articles dealing with management, timing of surgery, complications or prognosis of ATCCS were identified. The literature review and draft position statements were compiled and circulated to panel members. The draft was modified incorporating relevant suggestions to reach consensus.
   Results Out of 37 studies, 15 were regarding management strategy, ten regarding timing of surgery and 12 regarding prognosis of ATCCS.
   Conclusion There is reasonable evidence that patients with ATCCS secondary to vertebral fracture, dislocation, traumatic disc herniation or instability have better outcomes with early surgery (<24 h). In patients of ATCCS secondary to extension injury in stenotic cervical canal without fracture/fracture dislocation/traumatic disc herniation/instability, there is requirement of high-quality prospective randomized controlled trials to resolve controversy regarding early surgery versus conservative management and delayed surgery if recovery plateaus or if there is a neurological deterioration. Until such time decision on surgery and its timing should be left to the judgment of physician, deliberating on pros and cons relevant to the particular patient and involving the well-informed patient and relatives in decision making.

AB  - Objective: Previous studies evaluating neurophysiological correlates of long-term meditation are constrained by some methodological limitations. The objective of this study was to measure changes in the regional cerebral glucose metabolism during meditation using a novel methodological approach. Design: The present study was a part of a larger, nonrandomized, single-center open-label study. Setting/location: The study was conducted at the Department of Physiology and Department of Nuclear Medicine and Positron Emission Tomography. A dedicated place was set up as a yoga room, away from the positron emission tomography (PET) scanning room in the Department of Nuclear Medicine and Positron Emission Tomography, where meditators performed meditation in a peaceful environment in a sitting posture with eyes closed. The electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded to affirm the meditation objectively. Subjects: Twenty-four sets of PET scans were obtained at 2 different occasions (baseline and postmeditation within 40 min of (18)FDG [(18)fluorodeoxyglucose] injection) from 12 apparently healthy, male, right-handed long-term meditators practicing Preksha meditation (since >5 years, at least 5 days a week) who were recruited from a well-established meditation center in Delhi. Outcome measures: Changes in the regional cerebral glucose metabolism during meditation versus baseline. Results: Regional cluster analysis showed significantly activated well-defined areas of fronto-parieto-temporal regions of the right versus left hemisphere during meditation. Interestingly, right homolog of Broca's area and right lentiform nucleus were hyperactive during meditation in all the meditators. Conclusions: Long-term meditation might potentially enhance the explicit functions of specific parts of the right hemisphere, possibly due to neuroplastic changes in the brain. Importantly, results of the current study are encouraging and show a novel methodological approach to acquire (18)FDG PET/CT (computed tomography) images. The study was registered at Clinical Trial Registry India (CTRI), CTRI/2009/091/000727.

AB  - Disability prevents an individual from performing to the fullest potential. It is multidimensional. Disability may be physical, mental, social, personal, and environmental or a combination of these. The elderly experience an increased burden of disability, especially in areas where there are limited resources and rapid urbanization. Comparison of reported disability is difficult because several definitions and scales are in use. We used the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule version 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) to study the prevalence of disability, and its association with sociodemographic factors among elderly persons residing in an urban resettlement colony, New Delhi, India. The WHODAS 2.0 provides continuous summary scores, where higher scores indicate higher disability, and vice versa. Elderly persons aged 60 years and above were selected by simple random sampling in this community-based cross-sectional study. Trained interviewers administered the semi-structured interview schedule and WHODAS 2.0. The prevalence of disability was 7.4% (5.8% - 9.3%) among the 931 participants. The prevalence was higher among females than males. Female sex, elderly aged 70 years and above, and those who were illiterate had increased risk of higher disability scores. Participants who were in government or private service had 50% decreased risk of having higher disability scores. The burden of disability was high among elderly persons residing in this resettlement colony. Community-based holistic interventions are required to mitigate the disability, and to improve the functioning of elderly persons.

AB  - An electrostatic spray coating process was designed and developed in-house for consistent deposition of polypropylene powder on continuously fed carbon tow to produce a matrix coated towpreg. The electrostatic spray coating process was optimized for fiber volume fraction using Box-Behnken experimental design. An empirical multi-parametric equation was obtained to define the relationship between the process parameters (electrostatic voltage at the gun, velocity of the carbon towpreg, and the distance between the tip of gun and the towpreg) through response surface methodology. Experimental verification of the model showed a validation of similar to 93%. The velocity of the carbon towpreg was found to have a more profound effect on the output response of fiber volume fraction when compared to other process parameters.

AB  - Dormancy is a key characteristic of the intracellular life-cycle of Mtb. The importance of sensor kinase DosS in mycobacteria are attributed in part to our current findings that DosS is required for both persistence and full virulence of Mtb. Here we show that DosS is also required for optimal replication in macrophages and involved in the suppression of TNF-alpha and autophagy pathways. Silencing of these pathways during the infection process restored full virulence in Mtb Delta dosS mutant. Notably, a mutant of the response regulator DosR did not exhibit the attenuation in macrophages, suggesting that DosS can function independently of DosR. We identified four DosS targets in Mtb genome; Rv0440, Rv2859c, Rv0994, and Rv0260c. These genes encode functions related to hypoxia adaptation, which are not directly controlled by DosR, e.g., protein recycling and chaperoning, biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor and nitrogen metabolism. Our results strongly suggest a DosR-independent role for DosS in Mtb.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) comprise a clan of proteins involved in identification and triggering a suitable response against pathogenic attacks. As lung is steadily exposed to multiple infectious agents, antigens and host-derived danger signals, the inhabiting stromal and myeloid cells of the lung express an aggregate of TLRs which perceive the endogenously derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) along with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger the TLR-associated signalling events involved in host defence. Thus, they form an imperative component of host defence activation in case of microbial infections as well as noninfectious pulmonary disorders such as interstitial lung disease, acute lung injury and airways disease, such as COPD and asthma. They also play an equally important role in lung cancer. Targeting the TLR signalling network would pave ways to the design of more reliable and effective vaccines against infectious agents and control deadly infections, desensitize allergens and reduce inflammation. Moreover, TLR agonists may act as adjuvants by increasing the efficiency of cancer vaccines, thereby contributing their role in treatment of lung cancer too. Overall, TLRs present a compelling and expeditiously bolstered area of research and addressing their signalling events would be of significant use in pulmonary diseases.

AB  - Background: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the most serious complication of heart that comprises inflammatory reactions in heart valves. Many studies have demonstrated the contribution of host genetic factors in susceptibility to RHD and many cytokine gene variants have been linked with susceptibility to RHD. We sought to determine the role of genetic variants in IL-1 beta, STAT3, STAT5B and TLR5 genes in conferring risk of RHD in two cohorts of RHD patients.
   Methods: The study included 400 echocardiography confirmed RHD patients and 300 controls from North Indian Population. We categorized RHD patients into two sub-groups based on involvement of heart valves, mitral valve lesion alone (MVL), and combined valve lesions including mitral valve (CVL). Genotyping for all the polymorphisms was done using TaqMan/PCR-RFLP methods.
   Results: Our results showed that the genotypic frequencies of IL-1 beta, STAT3, STAT5B and TLR5 genes polymorphisms were significantly associated with RHD risk. To validate our results, we performed a replication study in additional 200 cases with similar clinical characteristics and results again confirmed consistent findings with RHD risk. In subgroup analysis, STAT3 polymorphism remained significant with MVL in RHD patients.
   Conclusion: IL-1 beta, STAT3, STAT5B and TLR5 genes polymorphism may be useful markers for the identification of individuals with high risk of RHD in the susceptible population. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report the method for fabrication and validation of a standalone handheld optical biosensor for non-invasive monitoring of glucose using saliva. For this, a biodegradable, low-cost test strip for glucose was developed by co-immobilizing glucose oxidase enzyme and bromocresol purple pH sensitive dye. The enzymatic reaction produced pH change and, thus, a change in color of a filter paper strip, which was detected by a standalone electronic meter. The in-house developed meter consisted of an optically isolated region in the chassis for inserting the test strip along with the sample to avoid interferences from ambient wind and light. The developed biosensor had a wide detection range of detection between 32- and 516-mg/dL glucose concentration while the sensitivity of detection was 1.0 mg/dL/count at a limit of detection (LOD) of 32 mg/dL within a response time of 15 s. The device along with strips was validated on clinical samples while comparing salivary glucose level with that of blood glucose level using a commercial glucometer. A very good correlation was found for diabetic individuals (0.80), whereas it was less significant (0.53) for non-diabetic individuals. The device passed Clarke's error grid analysis and hence should be medically acceptable. This simple and low-cost setup should be ideally suited for mass screening of diabetes, apart from being used as a self-monitoring device in a non-invasive and painless manner.

AB  - Recurrent clonal genetic alterations are the hallmark of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and govern the risk stratification, response to treatment and clinical outcome. In this retrospective study conducted on ALL patient samples, the purpose was to estimate the copy number alterations (CNAs) in ALL by digitalMLPA (dMLPA), validation of the dMLPA data by conventional MLPA and RT-PCR, and correlation of CNAs with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) status. The ALL patient samples (n = 151; B-ALL, n = 124 cases and T-ALL, n = 27 cases) were assessed for CNAs by dMLPA for detection of sub-microscopic CNAs and ploidy status. This assay allowed detection of ploidy changes and CNAs by multiplexing of karyotyping probes and probes covering 54 key gene targets implicated in ALL. Using the dMLPA assay, CNAs were detected in similar to 89% (n = 131) of the cases with 66% of the cases harboring >= 3 CNAs. Deletions in CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, and PAX5 genes were detectable in a quarter of these cases. Heterozygous and homozygous gene deletions, and duplications were observed in genes involved in cell cycle control, tumor suppression, lineage differentiation, lymphoid signaling, and transcriptional regulators with implications in treatment response and survival outcome. Distinct CNAs profiles were evident in B-ALL and T-ALL cases. Additionally, the dMLPA assay could reliably identify ploidy status and copy number-based gene fusions (SIL-TAL1, NUP214-ABL, EBF1-PDGFRB). Cases of B-ALL with no detectable recurrent genetic abnormalities could potentially be risk stratified based on the CNA profile. In addition to the commonly used gene deletions for risk assessment (IKZF1, EBF1, CDKN2A/B), we identified a broader spectrum of gene alterations (gains of-RUNX1, LEF1, NR3C2, PAR1, PHF6; deletions of-NF1, SUZ12, MTAP) that significantly correlated with the status of MRD clearance. The CNAs detected by dMLPA were validated by conventional MLPA and showed high concordance (r = 0.99). Our results demonstrated dMLPA to be a robust and reliable alternative for rapid detection of key CNAs in newly diagnosed ALL patients. Integration of ploidy status and CNAs detected by dMLPA with cytogenetic and clinical risk factors holds great potential in further refinement of patient risk stratification and response to treatment in ALL.

AB  - Background: The role of respiratory viruses (RV) in children with cancer having febrile neutropenic episodes has not been well studied. The objectives of our study were to investigate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Respiratory viral infection (RVI). Methods: Children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN) having acute respiratory infections (ARI) were considered as cases and febrile neutropenic cancer patients without ARI were considered as controls. A throat swab sample was obtained for the detection of 21-respiratory pathogens. Results: A total of 81 episodes of FN in cases and 37 episodes of FN in controls were included. Prevalence of RVI (at least 1 RV) was seen in 76.5% of cases and 48.6% of controls (p = 0.005). The mixed-respiratory viruses (co-infections of >= 2 viruses) were seen only in cases (26%) (p = 0.00). Rhinovirus (36.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus (13.6%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Median duration of fever before presentation was more in cases with RVI compared to without RVI [2 (1-5) days vs 1 (1-5) day (p = 0.012)]. The median total duration of febrile period was 4 (IQR, 3-6) days in cases with RVI and 3 (IQR, 1-4) days in cases without RVI (p = 0.005). The median duration of antibiotic days were longer in cases with RVI as compared to patients without RVI [9 (IQR, 7-17) days vs 7 (IQR, 6-10) days (p = 0.046)] respectively. Conclusion: There was high prevalence of RVI in children with cancer and FN; more in association with ARI. The RVI were associated with prolonged febrile period and days of antibiotics therapy.

AB  - Background and aim: To evaluate early serial AFP changes in responders and non-responders to locoregional therapy and identify differences between significant AFP decliners and non-decliners post-treatment. Methods: Case records of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients having AFP >= 20 ng/ml and treated with locoregional therapy were examined retrospectively. Patients with complete details were included. Trends of serial AFP change (from baseline to post-treatment one month) in patients showing early tumor response (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD)) as assessed on multiphasic MRI/CT liver performed at one month following treatment. Receiver operating curves were drawn to estimate the best AFP reduction cut off for differentiating between responders (CR plus PR) from non-responders (PD). AFP decliners (those with AFP level reduction greater than 20% post-treatment) were identified and comparisons of their clinical parameters, tumor response and survival rate were made with AFP non-decliners. Results: HCC patients (n = 126) had mean age of 52.8 years, male:female ratio (4:1), Child's A 94, BCLC stage A/B/C HCC 49/65/12, respectively. On 4-6 weeks' MRI/CT, 46 patients developed CR, 55 PR and 25 PD. Reduction in median AFP level (83% in CR, 19% in PR) occurred in responders while 16% increase occurred in PD patients (non-responders). A 30% AFP reduction could differentiate responders from non-responders with 70% sensitivity and 68% specificity, AUROC 74% (CI 0.64-0.85). AFP decliners showed better survival and tumor response than non-decliners. Conclusions: Serial AFP change can predict tumor response to locoregional therapy in AFP producing HCC patients. AFP decliners have better survival and tumor response than AFP non-decliners.

AB  - Hyperbilirubinemia is a common occurrence in neonates; it may be physiological or pathological. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may result from medical or surgical causes, and can result in irreversible liver damage if untreated. The aim of imaging is the timely diagnosis of surgical conditions like biliary atresia and choledochal cysts. Abdominal ultrasound is the first line imaging modality, and Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) also has a role, especially in pre-operative assessment of choledochal cysts (CDCs). For biliary atresia, the triangular cord sign and gallbladder abnormalities are the two most useful ultrasound features, with a combined sensitivity of 95%. Liver biopsy has an important role in pre-operative evaluation; however, the gold standard for diagnosis of biliary atresia remains an intra-operative cholangiogram. Choledochal cysts are classified into types according to the number, location, extent and morphology of the areas of cystic dilatation. They are often associated with an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction, which is best assessed on MRCP. Caroli's disease or type 5 CDC comprises of multiple intrahepatic cysts. CDCs, though benign, require surgery as they may be associated with complications like cholelithiasis, cholangitis and development of malignancy. Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia puts neonates at high risk of developing bilirubin induced brain injury, which may be acute or chronic. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is the preferred modality for evaluation, and shows characteristic involvement of the globus pallidi, subthalamic nuclei and cerebellum - in acute cases, these areas show T1 hyperintensity, while chronic cases typically show hyperintensity on T2 weighted images.

AB  - Despite advances in the field of male reproductive health, idiopathic male infertility, in which a man has altered semen characteristics without an identifiable cause and there is no female factor infertility, remains a challenging condition to diagnose and manage. Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress (OS) plays an independent role in the etiology of male infertility, with 30% to 80% of infertile men having elevated seminal reactive oxygen species levels. OS can negatively affect fertility via a number of pathways, including interference with capacitation and possible damage to sperm membrane and DNA, which may impair the sperm's potential to fertilize an egg and develop into a healthy embryo. Adequate evaluation of male reproductive potential should therefore include an assessment of sperm OS. We propose the term Male Oxidative Stress Infertility, or MOSI, as a novel descriptor for infertile men with abnormal semen characteristics and OS, including many patients who were previously classified as having idiopathic male infertility. Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) can be a useful clinical biomarker for the classification of MOSI, as it takes into account the levels of both oxidants and reductants (antioxidants). Current treatment protocols for OS, including the use of antioxidants, are not evidence-based and have the potential for complications and increased healthcare-related expenditures. Utilizing an easy, reproducible, and cost-effective test to measure ORP may provide a more targeted, reliable approach for administering antioxidant therapy while minimizing the risk of antioxidant overdose. With the increasing awareness and understanding of MOSI as a distinct male infertility diagnosis, future research endeavors can facilitate the development of evidence-based treatments that target its underlying cause.

AB  - Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome of certain mesenchymal tumors which secrete fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) responsible for causing features of hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia in these patients. Most of them involve the appendicular skeleton and occasionally the craniofacial regions. Involvement of spine is exceedingly rare. Through this paper, the authors present a rare case of a 71-year-old male with TIO due to a lesion in the cervical spine (right C2 lamina) which was proven to be a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor-mixed connective tissue type on histopathology. This is the fifth reported case of TIO localized to the cervical spine. The patient underwent a hemilaminectomy and gross total resection of the tumor following which he made a gradual but steady recovery and does not have any recurrence 24 months after surgery. The authors not only provide a comprehensive literature review of all 18 spinal cases reported till date but also discuss the management of these patients in light of the published literature.

KW  - SERIES
AB  - Background and Aims: Dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning is a widely-used procedure for neuropathic pain which is refractory to other modes of treatment. However, all current techniques depend on thermal or radiofrequency (RF) lesioning of the DREZ. The authors describe a new technique in which mechanical lesioning of DREZ using microscissors.
   Methods: The authors describe their technique of only using straight microscissors for the whole procedure of DREZotomy. No cautery is used except for hemostasis.
   Results: Our technique is a continuing evolution of the original DREZotomy described by Nashold and Sindou, and appears more atraumatic and simpler.
   Conclusion: Microscissor DREZotomy appears to be the most atraumatic way of carrying out DREZ lesioning and overcomes the disadvantages of other methods like thermal and RF lesioning.

AB  - Supratentorial neurenteric cyst is a rare entity. They are usually isointense to slightly hyperintense on T1W images and hyperintense on T2-weighted/fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. There was a diagnostic dilemma in this case due to the cerebrospinal fluid intensity of the cyst on magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative residual lesion predisposes to hemorrhage and seizures.

AB  - Neuraxial anaesthesia techniques are routinely used to manage postoperative pain in patients undergoing lower limb orthopaedic surgery. However, neuraxial anaesthesia is contraindicated in patients with a deformed spine or coagulopathy. Researchers recently described the erector spinae plane block-a safe, easy and effective interfascial plane block for managing chronic thoracic pain. Since then, it has been used for providing analgesia in thoracic, abdominal and hip surgery. We report its analgesic use in two patients undergoing knee surgery: one with lumbar scoliosis undergoing above knee amputation, and the other with haemophilia undergoing bilateral knee arthroplasty.

AB  - Background: The need to study prognosis after incidence of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has fueled researchers to identify predictors apart from neurological, functional, or disability measures. The purpose of this study was to test and validate a newly developed clinico-biomarker assessment module in AIS and also to investigate the role of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after AIS.
   Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled study with sample size of 250 patients suffering from AIS within 2 weeks of the index event were conducted and followed up for a period of three months. Age, gender, stroke subtype, previous stroke history, dysarthria, stroke localization, wakeup strokes, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were dichotomized as present or absent using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) which consists of four subcategories. The additional serum VEGF was scored between land 4 (0-200 = 1, 200-300 = 2, 300-400 = 3, and 400-500 = 4). All these were summed under a clinical biomarker (CB) module with highest score of 30.
   Results: The mean VEGF in 125 patients was 378.4 + 98.9 pg/ml, indicating a moderately high increase with a score of 3 on CB module. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the CB model was fit to predict prognosis and severity [R-2 = 0.86, F (23.4, 6);P= 0.001], with NIHSS subscore, prestroke status, and VEGF being very strong predictors. When only the clinical module was tested on all 250 patients, it was found that the NIHSS subscore, time to stroke onset and prestroke functional status were the most common [R-2 = 0.79; F (45,9);P = 0.005].
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that VEGF is highly upregulated in AIS with severe disability as compared to healthy controls. This biomarker is a strong predictor of severity and functionality when combined with clinical variables three months post the ishemic event.

AB  - Background: Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is predominantly seen in immunocompromised patients, with diabetes mellitus being the most common underlying comorbidity. Microbial aetiology is commonly bacterial, although fungal SBO is encountered in a small fraction of patients. Treatment consists of prolonged antimicrobial therapy, control of underlying comorbidity, and surgical debridement in selected cases. Involvement of cranial nerves is a common complication and is considered a poor prognostic factor. Pseudoaneurysm of internal carotid artery caused by skull base osteomyelitis is a very rare complication, limited to few case reports only. Case: We report the case of a 55-year-old diabetic patient with bacterial SBO who developed pseudoaneurysm of cervical-petrous part of internal carotid artery during the course of treatment. Conclusion: New onset symptoms or persistent symptoms in SBO suggest progressive disease and necessitate re-evaluation of the microbial aetiology and antimicrobial treatment. Skull base osteomyelitis induced aneurysm is rare but can be life threatening, if not identified and managed immediately.

AB  - Background: Auditory hallucinations may persist in a subset of chronic psychotic patients in spite of treatment. It is important to understand the personal meaning and significance of voices in these patients. In spite of its relevance, only a limited literature is available.
   Aim: This exploratory study aimed to assess the beliefs regarding voices in treatment-seeking patients with chronic schizophrenia having persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and assess their relation to the severity of psychosis.
   Materials and Methods: We recruited thirty adult patients with chronic schizophrenia as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition with both lifetime and current significant AVHs (>= 50% days/month). Co-occurring psychiatric disorders were ruled out using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-7.0.0. Patients were assessed using a semi-structured proforma, Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R), Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH)-severity.
   Results: The median age of the patients was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23.8-40.5). The median duration of illness and treatment was 7 years (IQR: 3.4-15.0) and 3 years (IQR: 1.9-10.5), respectively. Higher BAVQ-R scores were found on "malevolence," "omnipotence," and "emotional and behavioral resistance." These beliefs had a significant positive correlation with PSYRATS hallucination subscale, but not with the severity of psychosis (SAPS, SANS, and CGI-SCH). The sample had lower scores for "benevolence" and "engagement" subscales of BAV-Q.
   Conclusion: Overall, the study sample believed AVH to be more malicious and omnipotent rather than benevolent, and resisted the voices, engaging only minimally with them. These beliefs were not related to the severity of psychosis, but were related to the severity of hallucinations. Assessing the beliefs regarding AVH in larger, diverse samples may help to plan behavioral interventions.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the progression of corneal endothelial changes in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) on long-term oral amantadine therapy. Methods: A prospective comparative longitudinal observational study of 90 patients (180 eyes) with PD on more than 6 months of oral amantadine therapy, 30 amantadine naive patients with PD, and 30 healthy controls (age and gender matched). Corneal endothelial cell parameters (endothelial cell density, percentage hexagonality of the cells, and coefficient of variation) and corneal subbasal nerve fiber layer changes were studied over a follow-up period of 1 year. Results: The amantadine patients with PD group had a statistically significant decrease in endothelial cell density (1.51% vs. 0.94% vs. 0.55%) (P = 0.04), decrease of percentage hexagonality of the cells (4.98% vs. 3.56% vs. 2.31%) (P = 0.01), and increase of coefficient of variation (6.12% vs. 4.80% vs. 3.30%) (P = 0.03) compared with amantadine naive patients with PD and controls, respectively. Analysis of changes in the patients with PD based on the daily dosage of amantadine showed greater change in endothelial parameters in patients who were on 400 mg amantadine. Conclusions: Long-term amantadine therapy seems to effect changes on corneal endothelium.

AB  - Objective: Several studies have indicated that decompressive craniectomy (DC) for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is lifesaving. However, there is lack of level 1 evidence to define the role of DC in TBI. We performed a meta-analysis of all the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published so far on the role of DC in adult patients with TBI.
   Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed for articles published until September of 2016 for RCTs of DC in adult patients with TBI. The primary end-point was mortality at six-months. We also evaluated the overall adverse outcomes at six months. Assessment of risk of bias of the RCTs was also performed.
   Results: Three trials evaluating adult population satisfied the eligibility criteria. Pooled analysis involved 285 and 288 patients in DC group and control groups respectively. Patients undergoing DC for TBI had a lower mortality association of nearly 50 percent. However, patients surviving DC were more likely to have a poor neurological outcome compared to patients undergoing medical management.
   Conclusion: Based on the available RCTs on DC in TBI, the results of our meta-analysis show that there is a mortality benefit of performing a DC over the best medical management in adult patients. Furthermore, surviving following DC, a greater incidence of a poor neurological outcome is noted. In the event of small number of high-quality RCTs, our results must be interpreted with caution.

Data on risk factors for self-harm in substance-using population in the Indian context are limited. We aimed to determine the patterns and sociodemographic/clinical predictors of self-harm in patients with substance use disorders.
   Materials and Methods: We assessed 300 male patients on Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory to assess the patterns of self-harm. We performed mediation analysis to determine whether clinical variables acted via sociodemographic variables in their effect on self-harm.
   Results: The occurrence rate of self-harm was 32.7%. It was significantly associated with a younger age, being unmarried/separated, unemployed, history of injecting drug use, high-risk sexual behavior, and cannabis use disorders.
   Conclusion: Self-harm is an important consideration among patients with substance use disorders, and needs to be addressed by the clinicians involved in the care of such patients.

AB  - Purpose: To report a case that presented with post blunt trauma cataract, zonular dialysis, cyclodialysis and iridodialysis and its successful single-sitting management. Methods: After lens aspiration, a capsular tension ring and multipiece intraocular lens were placed in the bag to support the zonules, a single eyelet Cionni ring was fixed in the sulcus to provide endocyclotamponade, and iridodialysis repair was done using the 'stroke and dock technique'. Result: Successful centration of the intraocular lens, closure of the cleft and apposition of the iris root to its base were achieved at the end of the surgery. Conclusion: A single-sitting surgery correcting all the three dialysis can curtail the burden of repeated surgeries and their complications, providing early visual recovery and cost-effectivity.

AB  - Skin phototyping refers to a skin classification scheme based on how the skin responds to sun exposure. The Fitzpatrick classification is the most widely accepted method of skin phototyping, based on a person's tendency to sunburn and ability to tan. Apart from estimating the initial therapeutic dose of UV light, skin phototyping is also useful in predicting the risk of photodamage and skin cancer and the outcome of esthetic procedures. Techniques to type the skin objectively have been developed to address the deficiencies associated with the subjective Fitzpatrick classification. Some skin typing systems have been proposed specifically to predict the response of skin to cosmetic procedures such as chemical peeling and laser resurfacing. We discuss the concept of skin type and its relation to skin color, as well as critically appraising the various available methods of skin typing. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - Developed in collaboration with WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, this study (conducted in India, the UK, and the USA) integrated feedback from mental health service users into the development of the chapter on mental, behavioural, and neurodevelopmental disorders for ICD-11. The ICD-11 will be used for health reporting from January, 2022. As a reporting standard and diagnostic classification system, ICD-11 will be highly influential by informing policy, clinical practice, and research that affect mental health service users. We report here the first study to systematically seek and collate service user perspectives on a major classification and diagnostic guideline. Focus groups were used to collect feedback on five diagnoses: depressive episode, generalised anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar type 1 disorder, and personality disorder. Participants were given the official draft diagnostic guidelines and a parallel lay translation. Data were then thematically analysed, forming the basis of co-produced recommendations for WHO, which included features that could be added or revised to better reflect lived experience and changes to language that was confusing or objectionable to service users. The findings indicated that an accessible lay language version of the ICD-11 could be beneficial for service users and their supporters.

AB  - Cancer is a disease that claims millions of lives each year across the world. Despite advancement in technologies and therapeutics for treating the disease, these modes are often found to turn ineffective during the course of treatment. The resistance against drugs in cancer patients stems from multiple factors, which constitute genetic heterogeneity like gene mutations, tumor microenvironment, exosomes, miRNAs, high rate of drug efflux from cells, and so on. This review attempts to collate all such known and reported factors that influence cancer drug resistance and may help researchers with information that might be useful in developing better therapeutics in near future to enable better management of several cancers across the world.

TI  - Goat lung surfactant for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome among preterm neonates: a multi-site randomized non-inferiority trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
KW  - INFANTS
KW  - SUBSTITUTION
AB  - Objective To investigate the safety and efficacy of goat lung surfactant extract (GLSE) compared with bovine surfactant extract (beractant; Survanta (R), AbbVie, USA) for the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
   Study design We conducted a double-blind, non-inferiority, randomized trial in seven Indian centers between June 22, 2016 and January 11, 2018. Preterm neonates of 26 to 32 weeks gestation with clinical diagnosis of RDS were randomized to receive either GLSE or beractant. Repeat dose, if required, was open-label beractant in both the groups. The primary outcome was a composite of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Interim analyses were done by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB).
   Result After the first interim analyses on 5% enrolment, the "need for repeat dose(s) of surfactant" was added as an additional primary outcome and enrolment restricted to intramural births at five of the seven participating centers. Following second interim analysis after 98 (10% of 900 planned) neonates were enroled, DSMB recommended closure of study in view of inferior efficacy of GLSE in comparison to beractant. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death or BPD between GLSE group (n = 52) and beractant group (n = 46) (50.0 vs. 39.1%; OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.7-3.5; p = 0.28). The need for repeat dose of surfactant was significantly higher in GLSE group (65.4 vs. 17.4%; OR 9.0; 95% CI 3.5-23.3; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions Goat lung surfactant was less efficacious than beractant (Survanta (R)) for treatment of RDS in preterm infants. Reasons to ascertain inferior efficacy of goat lung surfactant requires investigation and possible mitigating strategies in order to develop a low-cost and effective surfactant.

AB  - Objective To estimate the direct causes of mortality among preterm neonates <33 weeks' gestation by examining three large multicentric, hospital-based datasets in India.
   Method Three prospective hospital-based datasets: National Neonatal Perinatal Database (NNPD) of India, Delhi Neonatal Infection Study (DeNIS) cohort, and Goat Lung Surfactant Extract (GLSE)-Plus cohort were analyzed to study the causes of death among preterm neonates of less than 33 weeks' gestation admitted to the participating tertiary care hospitals in India.
   Results A total of 8024 preterm neonates were admitted in the three cohorts with 2691 deaths. Prematurity-related complications and sepsis contributed to 53.5% and 19.8% of deaths in the NNPD cohort, 51.0% and 25.0% in the DeNIS cohort, and 39.7% and 40.9% in GLSE-Plus cohort, respectively.
   Conclusions Nearly a quarter (20-40%) of preterm neonates less than 33 weeks' gestation admitted to Indian NICUs died of sepsis. The study results have implications for health policies targeted to reduce the neonatal mortality rate in India.

AB  - The bowel is a challenging abdominal organ to image. The main reason is the variable location, convoluted morphology and motility. A variety of bowel disorders such as congenital, developmental, inflammatory, infectious and neoplastic lesions can affect children and most of them are either unique to this age group or have a distinct clinico-radiological appearance compared to adults. Imaging plays a very important role in characterizing these lesions and further guiding the management. This is the first part of the series on imaging of bowel disorders in children. This article will cover the imaging modalities used for the evaluation of bowel and the imaging features of congenital /developmental disorders.

AB  - Platelets play a major role in primary hemostasis and thrombus formation. After vascular injury, platelets adhere to injured site and rapidly change their shape that switches the resting platelets to active state. Activated platelets aggregate and secrete biologically active intermediate substances that further potentiate platelet activation through autocrine as well as paracrine mechanisms. The activated platelet expresses certain proteins that are not seen on the resting platelets, thus these proteins serve as markers of platelet activation. Other subsequent events of platelet activation include release of microvesicles and formation of complexes with other circulating cells, like monocytes and neutrophils. Platelet activation markers are useful tools in evaluating risk factors of thrombosis in a variety of clinical conditions. Increased platelet activation has been associated with various pathological conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and other inflammatory diseases. The advancement in technologies helps in determining the status of platelet activation in such clinical conditions. This article focuses on the sources, mechanism and diagnosis of platelet activation and their clinical implications.

AB  - Anaemia is a severe public health problem amongst all vulnerable age groups in India. The National Nutritional Anaemia Prophylaxis Programme initiated in 1970, was revised and expanded to include beneficiaries from all age groups namely children aged 6-59 months, 5-10 yr, adolescents aged 10-19 yr, pregnant and lactating women and women in reproductive age group under the National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) programme in 2011. The dose of iron, frequency and duration of iron supplementation and roles and responsibilities of the functionaries were described. At present, the coverage of beneficiaries with iron and folic acid has been poor at the national level. The prevalence of anaemia has continued to remain high during the last 60 years, and there has been no significant change in the scenario due to various reasons. The constraints in implementation and measures to improve the NIPI programme are discussed in the current article.

AB  - Chest radiographs and CT scans have been the cornerstone of pulmonary imaging given their advantages of being rapid and easily available techniques. However, a significant concern with their use in the pediatric population is the associated ionisation radiation. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pulmonary imaging has lagged behind its adoption in other organ systems. Previously, the lung parenchyma was considered difficult to evaluate by magnetic resonance due to low proton density in the pulmonary tissue, susceptibility artefacts within the lungs, and respiratory motion artefacts. However, in recent years, there have been a multitude of technical advancements to overcome these limitations. MRI can be an excellent radiation-free alternative in patients who require protracted follow-up like in cases such as cystic fibrosis, complicated pneumonias, tuberculosis and mediastinal neoplasms. An added advantage of MRI is that it can provide functional information in addition to the structural information provided by traditional imaging techniques. One of the major reasons of limited use of MRI despite its established utility is the lack of clarity regarding its indications, and a paucity of data on tailored MRI protocols customised to clinical needs. This article aims to review the basic MRI techniques, indications and terminologies used in chest imaging, with special emphasis on imaging findings of common pathologies in the pediatric population.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the role of echocardiographic right ventricular function parameters in predicting postoperative vasoactive inotrope requirement after tetralogy of Fallot repair.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: A tertiary care hospital.
   Participants: Fifty-two children undergoing elective intracardiac repair.
   Interventions: Comprehensive transesophageal echocardiography was performed before and after surgery. Fractional shortening, fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular myocardial performance index, tricuspid annular velocities (S', E', A'), and right ventricular global longitudinal strain and strain rate (RV Gls and RV Glsr) were measured. The ratio of peak systolic pressure of the right and left ventricles (P-rv/lv) was measured directly from the surgical field pre- and post-repair. The inotrope requirement during first 24 postoperative hours was calculated using the mean Vasoactive-Inotropic Score (VIS). Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the relation between echocardiographic parameters and VIS as well as P-rv/lv, and VIS. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to study the predictive strength of parameters.
   Measurements and Main Results: Among the measured parameters, both pre- and post-repair TAPSE had significant negative correlation with the mean VIS (p < 0.05). Both pre- and post-repair right ventricular myocardial performance index and S', E', A', RV Gls, RV Glsr, P-rv/lv also had significant correlation with the mean VIS (p < 0.05). Of these, TAPSE, RV Gls, RV Glsr, and P-rv/lv had significant predictive strength (p < 0.05) and reasonable sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve > 0.6) for predicting high mean VIS (VIS > 20).
   Conclusion: Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, RV Gls, RV Glsr, and P-rv/lv, could predict a postoperative high mean VIS with significant strength and reasonable sensitivity and specificity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Triaging the triage: reducing waiting time to triage in the emergency department at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
KW  - QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
KW  - MORTALITY
AB  - Background Prolonged wait times prior to triage outside the emergency department (ED) were a major problem at our institution, compromising patient safety. Patients often waited for hours outside the ED in hot weather leading to exhaustion and clinical deterioration. The aim was to decrease the median waiting time to triage from 50 min outside ED for patients to <30 min over a 4-month period.
   Methods A quality improvement (QI) team was formed. Data on waiting time to triage were collected between 12 pm and 1 pm. Data were collected by hospital attendants and recorded manually. T1 was noted as a time of arrival outside the ED, and T2 was noted as the time of first medical contact. The QI team used plan-do-study-act cycles to test solutions. Change ideas to address these gaps were tested during May and June 2018. Change ideas were focused on improving the knowledge and skills of staff posted in triage and reducing turnover of triage staff. Data were analysed using run chart rules.
   Results Within 6 weeks, the waiting time to triage reduced to <30 min (median, 12 min; IQR, 11 min) and this improvement was sustained for the next 8 weeks despite an increase in patient load.
   Conclusion The authors demonstrated that people new to QI could use improvement methods to address a specific problem. It was the commitment of the frontline staff, with the active support of senior leadership in the department that helped this effort succeed.

AB  - Aim: To retrospectively evaluate the outcome of patients with intracranial meningeal hemangiopericytomas(MHPCs) and to analyze various factors for recurrence and survival in these patients.
   Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 39 patients undergoing microsurgical resection for MHPCs at our institute from 2009 to 2015.
   Results: Gross total excision (GTE) was achieved in 27 (69.2%) patients, whereas 12 (30.8%) underwent subtotal excision (STE). A total of 25 patients received radiotherapy (RT) (Conventional RT-15; GKT-10), 21 patients had a low grade tumor, while 18 had an anaplastic variant. Twenty patients (51.3%) developed recurrences and the average recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 56 months (range: 12-180 months). Eight patients (20.5%) died during the study period. The average overall survival (OS) was 77.2 months (range: 36-192 months). Two patients (5.1%) developed systemic metastases during follow-up. Patient age was not found to affect RFS or OS. GTE was associated with prolonged RFS and OS but the impact was not statistically significant (P-values = 0.160 and 0.414, respectively). Low tumor grade was associated with statistically significant longer RFS as well as OS (P-values = 0.049 and 0.013, respectively). Addition of adjuvant RT was associated with statistically significant prolongation of RFS (P value = 0.016); however, it was not associated with statistically significant OS benefits (P-value = 0.758).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that a greater extent of excision, lower tumor grade, and addition of adjuvant RT have a positive impact on both RFS and OS: however, low grade and adjuvant RT were the only factors associated with statistically significant prolongation of RFS and only tumor grade was associated with statistically significant OS benefits.

AB  - Background Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease, with involvement of various susceptibility genes. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 is major susceptibility region. This study examined genetic association of HLA genes with T1D. Methods The study recruited 259 T1D patients and 706 controls from north India. PCR-SSP and LiPA were used to type HLA Class I and II alleles. Results At HLA Class I locus, HLA-A*02, A*26, B*08 and B*50 were significantly increased in patients vs controls (39.8% vs 28.9% [Bonferroni-corrected P {P-c} = 0.032], 24.7% vs 9.6% [P-c = 4.83 x 10(-8)], 37.2% vs 15.7% [P-c = 1.92 x 10(-9)], and 19.4% vs 5.5% [P-c = 4.62 x 10(-9)], respectively). Similarly, in Class II region, DRB1*03 showed a strong positive association with T1D (78.7% vs 17.5% in controls; P = 1.02 x 10(-9)). Association of DRB1*04 with T1D (28.3% vs 15.5% in controls; P-c = 3.86 x 10(-4)) was not independent of DRB1*03. Negative associations were found between T1D and DRB1*07, *11, *13, and *15 (13.8% vs 26.1% in controls [P-c = 0.00175], 3.9% vs 16.9% in controls [P-c = 6.55x 10(-6)], 5.5% vs 21.6% in controls [P-c = 2.51 x 10(-7)], and 16.9% vs 43.9% in controls [P-c = 9.94x 10(-10)], respectively). Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher haplotype frequencies of A*26-B*08-DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (10.43% vs 1.96%; P = 7.62 x 10(-11)), A*02-B*50-DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (6.1% vs 0.71%; P = 2.19 x 10(-10)), A*24-B*08-DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (4.72% vs 0.8%; P = 5.4 x 10(-7)), A*02-B*08-DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (2.36% vs 0.18%; P = 3.6 x 10(-5)), and A*33-B*58-DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (4.33% vs 1.25%; P = 0.00019). Conclusions In north India, T1D is independently associated only with HLA-DRB1*03 haplotypes, and is negatively associated with DRB1*07, *11, *13, and *15.

AB  - Inappropriate and uncontrolled use of antibiotics results in the emergence of antibiotic resistance, thereby threatening the present clinical regimens to treat infectious diseases. Therefore, new antimicrobial agents that can prevent bacteria from developing drug resistance are urgently needed. Selective disruption of bacterial membranes is the most effective strategy for combating microbial infections as accumulation of genetic mutations will not allow for the emergence of drug resistance against these antimicrobials. In this work, we tested cholic acid (CA) derived amphiphiles tethered with different alkyl chains for their ability to combat Gram-positive bacterial infections. In-depth biophysical and biomolecular simulation studies suggested that the amphiphile with a hexyl chain (6) executes more effective interactions with Gram-positive bacterial membranes as compared to other hydrophobic counterparts. Amphiphile 6 is effective against multidrug resistant Gram-positive bacterial strains as well and does not allow the adherence of S. aureus on amphiphile 6 coated catheters implanted in mice. Further, treatment of wound infections with amphiphile 6 clears the bacterial infections. Therefore, the current study presents strategic guidelines in design and development of CA-derived membrane-targeting antimicrobials for Gram-positive bacterial infections.

AB  - A 3-year-old girl presented with bilateral asymmetrical partial heterochromia of iris and fundus. The parents also complained of bilateral hearing loss in the child. Suspecting an auditory-pigmentary syndrome, systemic and genetic evaluation was performed. The child had profound sensory-neural hearing loss. Targeted gene sequencing revealed a novel nonsense variation in exon 9 of the MITF gene (chr3:70008440A>T) that was pathogenic for Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type 2A. This case highlights the characteristics of the iris and fundus hypochromia, which may provide a clue toward the diagnosis of WS.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the utility of Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in assessing treatment response in patients of intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). Method and materials MR Enterography (MRE) was done for patients with suspicion of ITB and 19 patients with pre- and post-treatment imaging were included in the analysis. MRE included T1W, T2W, post-contrast T1W, and DWI sequences. DWI was done using b values-0, 400 and 800 s/mm(2), and ADC maps were generated. The trace DW images and ADC values were compared before and after therapy. Composite gold standard (clinical, colonoscopic criteria, and biopsy) was used to assess treatment response and to classify into no response, partial response, and complete response. Results Thirty-one bowel segments were evaluated at baseline and after treatment in 19 patients. Prior to therapy, restricted diffusion was seen in 29/31 (93.5%) segments. After treatment, patients with either complete or partial response (27/31 segments, 15 patients) showed significant rise in mean ADC values from 1.1 +/- 0.37 x 10(-3) to 2.1 +/- 0.64 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (p value < 0.05), whereas no significant change was found in mean ADC values of non-responders (4/29 segments in 4 patients) which increased from 1.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s on baseline scan to 1.32 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s on post-treatment scan (p value = 0.318). An increase in ADC value was found to be a reliable and objective marker of improvement with response to therapy. Conclusion ADC values show good correlation with treatment response in ITB and can be used for objectively quantifying it.

AB  - Broad and potent neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with multiple epitope specificities evolve in HIV-1-infected children. Herein, we studied two antiretroviral-naive chronically HIV-1 clade C-infected monozygotic pediatric twins, AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330, with potent plasma bnAbs. Elite plasma neutralizing activity was observed since the initial sampling at 78 months of age in AIIMS_330 and persisted throughout, while in AIIMS_329 it was seen at 90 months of age, after which the potency decreased over time. We evaluated potential viral characteristics associated with the varied immune profiles by generating single genome-amplified pseudoviruses. The AIIMS_329 viruses generated from the 90-month time point were neutralization sensitive to bnAbs and contemporaneous plasma antibodies, while viruses from the 112-month and 117-month time points were resistant to most bnAbs and contemporaneous plasma. AIIMS_329 viruses developed resistance to plasma neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) plausibly by N160 glycan loss and V1 and V4 loop lengthening. The viruses generated from AIIMS_330 (at 90 and 117 months) showed varied susceptibility to bnAbs and autologous contemporaneous plasma antibodies, while the viruses of the 112-month time point, at which the plasma nAb specificities mapped to the V2 glycan, V3 glycan, and CD4 binding site (CD4bs), were resistant to contemporaneous plasma antibodies as well as to most bnAbs. Chimeric viruses were constructed from 90-month-time-point PG9-sensitive AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330 viruses with swapped V1V2 regions of their respective evolved viruses (at 112 and 117 months), which led to higher resistance to neutralization by PG9 and autologous plasma antibodies. We observed the evolution of a viral pool in the AIIMS_330 donor comprising plasma antibody neutralization-sensitive or -resistant diverse autologous viruses that may have contributed to the development and maintenance of elite neutralizing activity.
   IMPORTANCE Herein, we report the longitudinal development of bnAbs in a pair of chronically HIV-1 clade C-infected monozygotic pediatric twins, AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330, who acquired the infection by vertical transmission. The plasma from both donors, sharing a similar genetic makeup and infecting virus, showed the evolvement of bnAbs targeting common epitopes in the V2 and V3 regions of the envelope, suggesting that bnAb development in these twins may perhaps be determined by specific sequences in the shared virus that can guide the development of immunogens aimed at eliciting V2 and V3 bNAbs. Characterization of the neutralization-sensitive and -resistant viruses coevolving with bNAbs in the contemporaneous AIIMS_330 plasma provides information toward understanding the viral alterations that may have contributed to the development of resistance to bnAbs. Further longitudinal studies in more monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs will help in delineating the role of host and viral factors that may contribute to the development of bnAbs.

AB  - Objective Recent data on sustained hypertension and obesity among school-going children and adolescents in India are limited. This study evaluates the prevalence of sustained hypertension and obesity and their risk factors among urban and rural adolescents in northern India.
   Setting A school-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in the urban and rural areas of Ludhiana, Punjab, India using standardised measurement tools.
   Participants A total of 1959 participants aged 11-17 years (urban: 849; rural: 1110) were included in this school-based survey.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures To measure sustained hypertension among school children, two distinct blood pressure (BP) measurements were recorded at an interval of 1week. High BP was defined and classified into three groups as recommended by international guidelines: (1) normal BP: <90th percentile compared with age, sex and height percentile in each age group; (2) prehypertension: BP=90th-95th percentile; and (3) hypertension: BP >95th percentile. The Indian Academy of Pediatrics classification was used to define underweight, normal, overweight and obesity as per the body mass index (BMI) for specific age groups.
   Results The prevalence of sustained hypertension among rural and urban areas was 5.7% and 8.4%, respectively. The prevalence of obesity in rural and urban school children was 2.7% and 11.0%, respectively. The adjusted multiple regression model found that urban area (relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.7, 95%CI 1.01 to 2.93), hypertension (RRR: 7.4, 95%CI 4.21 to 13.16) and high socioeconomic status (RRR: 38.6, 95%CI 16.54 to 90.22) were significantly associated with an increased risk of obesity. However, self-reported regular physical activity had a protective effect on the risk of obesity among adolescents (RRR: 0.4, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.62). Adolescents who were overweight (RRR: 2.66, 95%CI 1.49 to 4.40) or obese (RRR: 7.21, 95%CI 4.09 to 12.70) and reported added salt intake in their diet (RRR: 4.90, 95%CI 2.83 to 8.48) were at higher risk of hypertension.
   Conclusion High prevalence of sustained hypertension and obesity was found among urban school children and adolescents in a northern state in India. Hypertension among adolescents was positively associated with overweight and obesity (high BMI). Prevention and early detection of childhood obesity and high BP should be strengthened to prevent the risk of cardiovascular diseases in adults.

TI  - A Pristine Approach for the Prominent Premaxilla in Bilateral Cleft Lip and Palate (BCLP) Cases
T2  - CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL
KW  - infant orthopedics
KW  - nonsyndromic clefting
KW  - maxilla
KW  - orthodontics
AB  - Objective: The neonate premaxilla in bilateral cleft lip and palate is often protruding and displaced laterally. Surgeons prefer the premaxilla to be repositioned and centralized to allow a tension-free primary lip repair. This report describes the fabrication of a premaxillary bonnet appliance with silicone material and its successful use in 2 cases of bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP).
   Patients, Participants: Two male BCLP patients of ages 34 days and 10 days, respectively.
   Interventions: Nonsurgical repositioning of the premaxillary segment using silicone cup-bonnet appliance.
   Results: The duration of active treatment by silicone appliance was 36 days in case 1 and 75 days in case 2. The retention period was 2 months and 3 months, respectively. The appliance made of room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone is flexible and softer in comparison to the rigid conventional acrylic appliance and is therefore almost atraumatic. A gentler appliance resulted in enhanced compliance and acceptance by the neonates. There was a noticeable change in the position of the discernible asymmetric premaxilla. Analysis of frontal facial photographs revealed an angular change in the position of the premaxilla (C) by 12 degrees in case 1 and 6 degrees in case 2 in reference to the midfacial plane.
   Conclusion: This silicone appliance provides enhanced compliance and improved retention compared to acrylic appliance since it is a more gentle, flexible, and less traumatic alternative to a rigid acrylic appliance. Further, the RTV silicone appliance can be 3-dimensionally printed for better accuracy following intraoral scanning and thus eliminating the need for impression making in cleft newborns.

AB  - Background: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing worldwide. Identifying and targeting individuals at high risk, is essential for preventing T2D. Several studies point to mobile health initiatives delivered through personal smart devices being a promising approach to diabetes prevention, through weight loss. The aim of the mobile health and diabetes (mDiab) trial was twofold: to achieve 5% weight loss and to look at the association of weight loss with degree of engagement with the mDiab app. Methods: The mDiab randomized control trial was carried out among smartphone users who are at high risk for T2D mellitus in three cities-Chennai, Bengaluru, and New Delhi in India. The intervention was delivered through a mobile phone application along with weekly coach calls for 12 weeks. While individuals in the intervention group individuals received the app, which enabled tracking their weight, physical activity, and diet along with 12 weekly video lessons on T2D prevention and coach calls, the control group received usual care. Results: The intervention group experienced a significant 1 kg weight loss while the control group lost 0.3 kg (P < 0.05). More individuals in the intervention group (n = 139, 15%) met the 5% weight loss target than in the control group (n = 131, 9%). In the intervention group those who viewed the videos experienced greater weight loss (2.4 kg) than those who only attended coach calls (0.9 kg) (P < 0.01). Conclusions: An mHealth intervention helped to achieve moderate weight loss. Future studies should explore the sustainability of this weight loss.

AB  - Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) is a key regulatory molecule of cell signaling, and thereby controls its growth and proliferation, including expression of certain genes. The overexpression of CAMKIV is directly associated with the development of different types of cancers. Hesperidin is abundantly found in citrus fruits and exhibits wide range of pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anticancerous effects. We have investigated binding mechanism of hesperidin with the CAMKIV using molecular docking methods followed by fluorescence quenching and isothermal titration calorimetric assays. An appreciable binding affinity of hesperidin was observed with CAMKIV during fluorescence quenching and isothermal titration calorimetric studies. Efficacy of hesperidin to inhibit the growth of human hepatic carcinoma (HepG2) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cancer cell lines were investigated. Hesperidin has significantly reduced the proliferation of HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells and induces apoptosis by activating the caspase-3-dependent intrinsic pathway through the upregulation of proapoptotic Bax protein. Hesperidin treatment reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential of HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells. All these observations clearly anticipated hesperidin a potent inhibitor of CAMKIV which may be further exploited a newer therapeutic approach for the management of different cancer types.

AB  - Breast cancer is a highly aggressive disease contributing to high mortality rate among females across the globe owing to wide geographical variations, change in lifestyle along with rapid tumor growth, drug resistance, and high metastasis rate. To understand the molecular and genetic basis of breast cancer progression; we studied the role of E26 transformation-specific-1 (Ets-1) transcription factor which is implicated to have a role in carcinogenesis like invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, etc. Our findings revealed an overexpression of Ets-1 gene in 75 breast cancer tumors as compared with their normal adjacent tissues. The findings significantly established a co-relation between Ets-1 expression in breast cancer tissue with hormonal receptor profiles and ductal-lobular histological subtypes in Indian population. In addition, a differential expression pattern of Ets-1 was observed between high, moderate, and low grades of breast cancer patients. The present study demonstrates a crucial role of Ets-1 transcription factor which may serve as a potential biomarker for breast carcinogenesis.

AB  - Scope Cause-effect relationship between vitamin D deficiency and cardiometabolic abnormalities remains undefined. The aim is to investigate the role of vitamin D deficiency in cardiac failure, through possible involvement in myocardial insulin signaling. Methods and results Male SD rats (n = 6) are fed a normal diet (Con), vitamin D-deficient diet [Con(-)], or high-fat, high fructose diet (HFHFrD) for 20 weeks. Cardiac hypertrophy and fetal gene program are confirmed in Con(-) group. Cardiac dysfunction is assessed by echocardiography. Elevated renin, TGF-beta and collagen-1 alpha mRNAs, p-ERK1/2, and perivascular fibrosis indicate cardiac remodeling in Con(-) group. Increased serum insulin, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and decreased glucose tolerance and HDL cholesterol are observed in Con(-) rats. Decreased p-Akt/Akt, GLUT4, SOD2, and catalase, and increased NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 are observed in Con(-) hearts. In H9c2 cells, calcitriol attenuates palmitate-induced insulin resistance. VDR-silenced H9c2 cells show reduced Akt phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation, and 2-NBDG uptake. Findings in Con(-) and HFHFrD groups are comparable. Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency in rats mimic high-fat-, high-fructose-induced metabolic syndrome and cardiac dysfunction. This study demonstrates that vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk factor for heart failure, at least in part, through induction of myocardial insulin resistance.

AB  - Anomalies of origin of coronary arteries are an uncommon occurrence and found in approximately 1-2% of the general population. While a large proportion of these anomalies are clinically silent, a few might be hemodynamically significant and may even result in sudden cardiac death. Comprehensive knowledge of the normal as well as variant anatomies of the coronary artery origin and familiarity with imaging appearances and clinical significance of these anomalies is imperative for precise diagnosis and subsequent planning of treatment, whenever required. Multidetector computed tomography angiography, on account of its non-invasiveness, faster scan times and multiplanar reconstruction capabilities, is increasingly being utilized for characterization of coronary artery origin anomalies and their three-dimensional spatial relations. It shows a superior rate of detection of these anomalies compared to conventional angiography, providing more accurate delineation of the ostium as well as course. With the advent of newer generation CT scanners and use of advanced dose reduction techniques, images can be obtained rapidly having excellent spatial resolution and with minimal radiation dose. In this review article, we present the multidetector CT angiography imaging findings of the spectrum of anomalous coronary artery origin, using a third-generation dual-source CT scanner.

AB  - Microvillous inclusion disease (MVID), also known as congenital microvillus atrophy, was first described by Davidson et al. in 1978. Till date, only a handful of cases with MVID have been described in English literature. It is an autosomal recessive disorder with no sex predisposition and more commonly noted in countries with prevalent consanguineous marriages. These patients usually present with intractable secretory diarrhea in early days of life. The pathognomonic findings of MVID are villous atrophy along with the formation of intracellular microvillous inclusions on electron microscopy. Till date, no curative therapy exists, and prognosis mainly depends upon parenteral nutrition. Small bowel transplantation is one of the treatment options. Clinician and pathologist should consider the possibility of MVID in the differential diagnosis of chronic intractable diarrhea in an infant. Herein, authors are describing a case of intractable diarrhea with MVID phenotype diagnosed in a 3-mo-old male child who presented with intractable diarrhea in an outside hospital, and the diagnostic workup was performed by the authors on endoscopic biopsy sample.

AB  - Aims In thymic carcinomas, focal clear cell change is a frequent finding. In addition to a prominent, diffuse clear cell morphology, some of these carcinomas show an exuberant hyalinised extracellular matrix, and therefore probably represent a separate entity. However, a characteristic genomic alteration remains elusive. We hypothesised that, analogous to hyalinising clear cell carcinomas of the salivary gland, hyalinising clear cell carcinomas of the thymus might also harbour EWSR1 translocations. Methods and results We identified nine archived cases of thymic carcinoma with focal clear cell features and two cases that showed remarkable hyalinised stroma and prominent, diffuse clear cell morphology. These two cases expressed p40 and were negative for Pax8, CD5, and CD117. Programmed death-ligand 1 was highly positive in one case (70%), and negative in the other one. EWSR1 translocation was identified in both cases of hyalinising clear cell carcinoma, and was absent in all nine carcinomas that showed clear cell features without substantial hyalinisation. In one of the EWSR1-translocated cases, a fusion between exon 13 and exon 6 of EWSR1 and ATF1, respectively was identified by next-generation sequencing. Conclusions These findings suggest that the EWSR1 translocation and possibly the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion might be unifying genomic alterations for thymic clear cell carcinomas with prominent hyalinised stroma, for which we propose the term 'hyalinising clear cell carcinoma of the thymus'. Because the immunophenotype is unspecific, testing for the EWSR1 translocation might be helpful in discriminating this entity from other thymic neoplasms or metastases, in particular those with clear cell change.

AB  - POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes) is a rare multisystem paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by peripheral neuropathy and monoclonal plasmacytosis. We report a retrospective analysis of 49 cases from a single tertiary-care center in New Delhi, India, including 10 patients who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Clinical features, responses, and outcomes were similar to the Western and Eastern literature, though with some unique features. Introduction: POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes) syndrome is a rare multisystem paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by peripheral neuropathy and monoclonal plasmacytosis. Retrospective institutional experiences from the Mayo Clinic as well as Chinese, European, and Japanese series have provided important insights into the characteristics and treatment of this disease, but Indian data are extremely limited. We retrospectively analyzed 49 cases from our institute including 10 patients who underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients and Methods: We analyzed clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment details and outcome of all patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome between 1993 and 2017. Results: Complete medical records were available for 49 patients with a median age of 44 years. Male/female ratio was 38:11. Twenty patients (40.8%) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 4. Before 2012, melphalan/prednisolone was the most common regimen provided, while bortezomib/dexamethasone and lenalidomide/dexamethasone were used later. Hematologic response was available for 40 patients, 15 (37.5%) of whom experienced complete response, 13 (32.5%) partial response, and 11 (27.5%) stable disease. The median modified Rank in score at baseline was 4 (range, 1-5), which improved to 3 (range, 1-5). Ten patients underwent consolidation ASCT after a median of 4 cycles of induction. Median melphalan dose was 140 mg/m(2). Engraftment syndrome was observed in 4. After ASCT, all 10 patients experienced hematologic complete response and clinical improvement. Conclusion: This retrospective analysis provides important information on the clinical characteristics of POEMS syndrome in Indian patients, which will help the clinician's decision-making process.

AB  - Metronomic chemotherapy transitioned from the bench to bedside in the early 2000s and since then has carved a niche for itself in pediatric oncology. It has been used solely or in combination with other modalities such as radiotherapy, maximum tolerated dose chemotherapy, and targeted agents in adjuvant, palliative, as well as maintenance settings. No wonder, the resulting medical literature is extremely heterogeneous. In this review, the authors review and synthesize the published literature in pediatric metronomics giving a glimpse of its history, varied applications, and evolution of this genre of chemotherapy in pediatric cancers. Limitations, future prospects, and grey areas are also highlighted.

AB  - Double-outlet right ventricle is a complex congenital heart disease that encompasses various common and rare subtypes. Surgical management of these patients needs to be individualized owing to extremely variable morphology and hemodynamics. Imaging plays a crucial role in determination and characterization of outflow tract morphology. The assessment of ventricular septal defect routability with identification of associated anomalies has therapeutic implications in these patients. Multislice computed tomography with advanced 3-dimensional postprocessing techniques and dose-reduction strategies is invaluable in defining the anatomy and morphology of double-outlet right ventricle with simultaneous assessment of associated anomalies.

AB  - As the upgrading of smartphone technology revolutionizes the field of ophthalmic imaging, we put forward one more of its novel applications. This article presents the possibility of iridocorneal angle (ICA) estimation through smartphone-captured images. Such measured inferior ICA (at 6'o clock position) was comparable to the anterior segment optical coherence tomography measured trabecular iris angle at 500 mu at 270 degrees (P=0.06). They both had an excellent positive correlation (rho=0.81, P<0.001). Therefore, smartphone image-aided angle estimation may be a simple, effective, and economical method for quantification of ICAs, paving a more evident way for identification of angle-closure disease.

AB  - Background Cataract is a major health burden in many countries and a significant problem in India. While observational studies show lower cataract risk with increasing dietary or plasma vitamin C, randomised controlled trials of supplements have been negative. Genetic variants in vitamin C transporter proteins (SLC23A1), especially rs33972313, may provide evidence on a causal association of vitamin C with cataract. Methods We used data from a randomly selected population-based study in people aged 60 years and above in north and south India. Of 7518 sampled, 5428 (72%) were interviewed for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, attended hospital for lens imaging and blood collection and were subsequently genotyped for rs33972313 and rs6596473. Mixed or pure types of cataract were graded by the Lens Opacity Classification System III as nuclear (2404), cortical (494) or posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) (1026); 1462 had no significant cataract and no history of cataract surgery and 775 had bilateral aphakia/pseudophakia. Results rs33972313 was associated with cortical (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.34 to 3.49, p=0.002) and PSC (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.65, p=0.03) but not with nuclear cataract. In analyses of pure cataracts, associations were found only between rs33972313 and pure cortical cataracts (OR 2.29; 95% CI 1.12 to 4.65, p=0.03) and with a standardised cortical opacity score. There was no association with rs6596473 and any cataract outcomes. Conclusions Using an established genetic variant as a proxy for lifetime ascorbate concentrations, our results support a causal association of vitamin C with cataract.

AB  - Purpose To assess the outcomes of intra-lenticular lens aspiration (ILLA) in paediatric cases with anterior dislocation of lens.
   Methods A retrospective review of medical records of cases with anterior dislocation of the lens in children (age < 16 years) that underwent ILLA between June 2017 and May 2018 was performed. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), intraocular pressure (TOP), and anterior segment findings were noted at presentation and follow-up. Surgical notes were reviewed for all cases. Post-operative central corneal thickness (CCT) and central macular thickness (CMT) were recorded.
   Results Eleven eyes of eight patients with a median age of ten years underwent ILLA. There were four males and four females. The median duration of symptoms was 2 months, CDVA was 1.77 logMAR, and TOP was 16 mm of Hg. Ten eyes had corneo-lenticular touch with corneal oedema, and two had raised IOP at presentation. Homocystinuria (n = 2/8), Microspherophakia (n = 2/8), Marfan syndrome (n = 1/8), Buphthalmos (n = 1/8) and Ectopia lentis et pupillae (n = 1/8) were the identifiable causes for anterior dislocation. There were no intra-operative complications in any case. Immediate post-operative corneal oedema and raised IOP was observed in nine and three cases respectively and was treated with medical therapy. The median post-operative CDVA and TOP at 6-months was 1 logMAR and 15 mm of Hg respectively. The median CCT and CMT were 516 and 248 mu m respectively. Five eyes developed a central corneal descemet scar.
   Conclusions ILLA is a safe and effective technique for surgical removal of an anteriorly dislocated lens in paediatric cases.

AB  - Background: We determined the magnitude and clinico-microbiological profile of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) at a tertiary hospital. The diagnostic potential of 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing on periprosthetic tissue samples was evaluated for the diagnosis of PJI. Materials and Methods: This ambispective cohort study consisted of patients who underwent primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty from June 2013 to June 2017. The patients were classified as either infected or noninfected according to criteria set out by the musculoskeletal infection society (MSIS). Three to five periprosthetic tissue samples were collected from each patient for culture and 16S rRNA gene PCR sequencing. Results: Hundred and six patients were diagnosed to have PJI as per the MSIS Criteria. The cumulative incidence of PJI at our Institute at the end of 36 months was 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-2.91). Microorganisms were isolated by periprosthetic tissue culture (PTC) in 84 patients (sensitivity: 79% and specificity: 100%). Gram-negative aerobes were most frequently isolated (61%). Polymicrobial infections were present in 8.3% of cases. The most common infecting microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus (19.5%). Multidrug resistance and methicillin resistance were noted in 54% and 34% of bacterial isolates, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of 16S rRNA PCR of periprosthetic tissue was 86% (95% CI: 74.9-89.9) and 100% (95% CI: 94.7-100), respectively. Periprosthetic tissue 16S rRNA PCR was more sensitive than PTC (P = 0.008), although both were 100% specific (P = 0.99). Conclusions: The incidence of PJI at our Institute compares well with other published reports. Contrary to previous reports, a predominance of Gram-negative PJI's was found. The preponderance of multidrug-resistant organisms in PJI's is worrisome. The high sensitivity and specificity of the 16S PCR assay used in our study support its use in culture-negative PJI suspected cases.

AB  - Aims: Although the proof of concept of the bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BRS) is well documented, device-related adverse outcomes with first-generation BRS indicate longer-term surveillance. The current study provides insights into the safety and performance of the MeRes100, a novel second-generation sirolimus-eluting BRS, beyond one-year up to three-year follow-up (FU).
   Methods and results: A total of 108 enrolled patients with de novo coronary artery lesions who underwent implantation of MeRes100 as part of the first-in-human MeRes-1 trial were followed up clinically beyond one year at two and three years and with multiple modality imaging at six months and two years. At three-year FU, the cumulative major adverse cardiac events rate was 1.87%, in the form of two ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisations. No scaffold thrombosis was reported. Between six months and two years at quantitative coronary angiography, in-segment late lumen loss (LLL) (0.15 +/- 0.22 mm vs. 0.23 +/- 0.32 mm; p=0.18) and in-scaffold LLL (0.13 +/- 0.22 mm vs. 0.24 +/- 0.34 mm; p=0.10) changed insignificantly. IVUS subset analysis revealed a non-significant reduction in mean lumen area (6.17 +/- 1.28 mm2 vs. 5.47 +/- 1.50 mm2; p=0.21) and minimum lumen area (5.14 +/- 1.19 mm2 vs. 4.05 +/- 1.42 mm2; p=0.10) at two years compared to post-procedural measurements. OCT subset analysis demonstrated 99.24 +/- 2.27% neointimal strut coverage.
   Conclusions: The extended outcomes of the MeRes-1 trial demonstrated sustained efficacy and safety of the MeRes100 BRS with maintained lumen patency up to two years by multimodality imaging and no very late scaffold thrombosis up to three-year clinical FU.

AB  - Over 100 genetically distinct causal known loci for hereditary ataxia phenotype poses a challenge for diagnostic work-up for ataxia patients in a clinically relevant time and precision. In the present study using next-generation sequencing, we have investigated pathogenic variants in early-onset cerebellar ataxia cases using whole exome sequencing in singleton/family-designed and targeted gene-panel sequencing. A total of 98 index patients were clinically and genetically (whole exome sequencing (WES) in 16 patients and targeted gene panel of 41 ataxia causing genes in 82 patients) evaluated. Four families underwent WES in family based design. Overall, we have identified 24 variants comprising 20 pathogenic and four likely-pathogenic both rare/novel, variations in 21 early onset cerebellar ataxia patients. Among the identified variations, SACS (n = 7) and SETX (n = 6) were frequent, while ATM (n = 2), TTPA (n = 2) and other rare loci were observed. We have prioritized novel pathogenic variants in RARS2 and FA2H loci through family based design in two out of four families.

AB  - Ammonia is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but its prognostic role in patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the relationship between ammonia levels and severity of HE and its association with organ dysfunction and short-term mortality. We identified 498 patients from two institutions as part of prospective observational studies in patients with cirrhosis. Plasma ammonia levels were measured on admission and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment criteria were used to determine the presence of organ failures. The 28-day patient survival was determined. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify the cutoff points for ammonia values, and multivariable analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The 28-day mortality was 43.4%. Plasma ammonia correlated with severity of HE (P < 0.001), was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (93 [73-121] versus 67 [55-89] mu mol/L, P < 0.001), and was an independent predictor of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.009, P < 0.001). An ammonia level of 79.5 mu mol/L had sensitivity of 68.1% and specificity of 67.4% for predicting 28-day mortality. An ammonia level of >= 79.5 mu mol/L was associated with a higher frequency of organ failures (liver [P = 0.004], coagulation [P < 0.001], kidney [P = 0.004], and respiratory [P < 0.001]). Lack of improvement in baseline ammonia at day 5 was associated with high mortality (70.6%). Conclusion: Ammonia level correlates with not only the severity of HE but also the failure of other organs and is an independent risk factor for mortality; lack of improvement in ammonia level is associated with high risk of death, making it an important biomarker and a therapeutic target.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy is associated with biochemical changes leading to increased nutritional demands for the developing fetus that result in altered micronutrient status. The Indian dietary pattern is highly diversified and the data about dietary intake patterns, blood micronutrient profiles and their relation to low birthweight (LBW) is scarce.
   Methods: Healthy pregnant women (HPW) were enrolled and followed-up to their assess dietary intake of nutrients, micronutrient profiles and birthweight using a dietary recall method, serum analysis and infant weight measurements, respectively.
   Results: At enrolment, more than 90% of HPW had a dietary intake below the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). A significant change in the dietary intake pattern of energy, protein, fat, vitamin A and vitamin C (P <0.001) was seen except for iron (Fe) [chi-squared (chi(2))=3.16, P= 0.177]. Zinc (Zn) deficiency, magnesium deficiency (MgDef) and anemia ranged between 54-67%, 18-43% and 33-93% which was aggravated at each follow-up visit (P <= 0.05). MgDef was significantly associated with LBW [odds ratio (OR): 4.21; P=0.01] and the risk exacerbate with the persistence of deficiency along with gestation (OR: Z34; P= 0.04). Pre-delivery (OR: 0.57; P=0.04) and postpartum (OR: 0.37; P=0.05) anemia, and a vitamin A-deficient diet (OR: 3.78; P=0.04) were significandy associated with LBW. LBW risk was much higher in women consuming a vitamin A-deficient diet throughout gestation compared to vitamin A-sufficient dietary intake (OR: 10.00; P=0.05).
   Conclusion: The studied population had a dietary intake well below the RDA. MgDef, anemia and a vitamin A-deficient diet were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of LBW. Nutrient enrichment strategies should be used to combat prevalent micronutrient deficiencies and LBW.

AB  - In the present work, a collaborative implementation of fractional order proportionalintegral-derivative control and fractional order fuzzy logic control method is investigated for the controlled tracking performance of a manipulator plant. An integral time absolute error measured between the desired and actual output trajectories, which is obtained by the optimal parameters, drives the switching mechanism between the two controllers, fractional order proportional-integral-derivative and fractional order fuzzy logic control, in order to implement the collaboration scheme. Different possible ways of switching mechanism between fractional order proportional-integral-derivative controller and fractional order fuzzy logic control scheme are explored. The resulting controller's parameters are investigated with meta-heuristic technique namely cuckoo search algorithm. The performance of the proposed collaborative scheme is compared with existing control schemes and basic proportional-integral-derivative control method for obtaining the controlled tracking performance. To generalize the use and effectiveness of designed control scheme, the simulation studies are also investigated for a first order plant and an inverted pendulum for the trajectory tracking problem. To analyse the effects of the parameter variations, disturbance rejection, and payload variations, the performance results for the proposed scheme are also presented for robotic manipulator. The proposed controller has a potential application in robotic manipulator control for different applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCEMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and in vivo proton (H-1) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides functional and molecular nature of breast cancer. This study evaluates the potential of the combination of three MR parameters [curve kinetics, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and total choline (tCho) concentration] determined from these techniques in increasing the sensitivity of breast cancer detection.
   Methods: MR investigations were carried out at 1.5 T on 56 patients with cytologically/histologically confirmed breast carcinoma. Single-voxel MRS was used to determine the tCho concentration. 3D FLASH was used for DCEMRI while single shot EPI based DWI was used for ADC determination.
   Results: On DCEMRI, one patient showed type I curve, while 8 showed type II and 47 showed type III curve thus giving a sensitivity of 83.9% as detection rate of malignancy. tCho concentration was above cut-off value (2.54 mmol/kg) for 50/56 cases giving a sensitivity of 89.3%. Among 9 indeterminate DCEMRI cases, tCho showed malignancy in 6 cases with type II curve. DWI detected malignancy in 54/56 cases that included 9 cases that were false negative on DCEMRI, yielding a sensitivity of 96.4%. A total of 54 cases showed malignancy when any two of the three MR parameters was positive for malignancy yielding a sensitivity of 96.4% while it increased to 100% when any one parameters showed positive result.
   Conclusion: DWI showed highest sensitivity of detection compared to DCEMRI and MRS. Multi-parametric approach yielded 96.4% and 100% sensitivity when any two or one of the three parameters was taken as positive for malignancy, respectively. Also the results demonstrated that addition of DWI and MRS play a significant role in establishing the final diagnosis of malignancy, especially in cases where DCEMRI is indeterminate.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of critical illness polyneuropathy and its risk factors in critically ill children mechanically ventilated for 7 days or more. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: PICU of a tertiary care hospital from North India. Patients: Children 1-15 years old admitted in PICU from June 2016 to September 2017, mechanically ventilated for 7 days or more, excluding those with diagnosed neuromuscular disease, stroke, or spinal pathology. Intervention: Demographic details, diagnosis, treatment details, and anthropometry at admission and enrolment were recorded. Nerve conduction studies were performed after enrolment and repeated a week later, if the child was still in PICU. Medical Research Council scoring for muscle strength was performed in survivors. Risk factors including Pediatric Index of Mortality-2 score, sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, use of steroids, neuromuscular-blocking agents, and vasopressors were recorded. Samples for the level of micronutrients (copper, zinc, folate, and vitamin B12) were collected at the time of enrolling the child and at the time of discharge. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-two children were enrolled, of whom 29 had features of critical illness polyneuropathy on evaluation at day 8 of mechanical ventilation (prevalence, 90.6% [95% CI, 80.5-100%]). The polyneuropathy was axonal in 26 (81.2%), mixed in one patient (3.1%), and uncharacterized in two (6.2%). Sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction were present in 31 subjects (96.9%). No risk factors for critical illness polyneuropathy could be identified although the study was not sufficiently powered to do so. The difference between serum micronutrient levels (copper, zinc, folate, and vitamin B12) between patients who developed polyneuropathy, and those who did not, was statistically insignificant. Conclusions: We observed a high prevalence of critical illness polyneuropathy in children in PICU, mechanically ventilated for 7 days or more; almost all of whom had underlying sepsis.

AB  - Objective: Does the administration of intravenous intralipid in women with previous implantation failure at the time of embryo transfer improve pregnancy outcomes in terms of biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and ongoing pregnancy rate?
   Study Design: This was a single blinded randomised controlled trial of 105 subjects with previous failed IVF undergoing self donor oocyte IVF/ICSI from January 2017 to May 2018. Randomisation was by computer generated sequence after oocyte pickup. Results were analysed for 102 women, excluding three women due to poor embryo quality. Women in the study arm(n = 52) received 2 doses of 20% intravenous intralipid (Fresenius Kabi), 4 ml diluted in 250 ml normal saline by slow infusion. The first dose was given immediately after oocyte recovery, and the second dose was given on the day of embryo transfer, 1 h prior to the transfer. The control group (n = 50) received normal saline. Flexible ovarian stimulation protocols were used. All the women received routine luteal phase support with micronised vaginal progesterone.
   Results: 102 women underwent analysis, 52 in the study group and 50 in control group. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics. There was a significant difference in the biochemical pregnancy rate in the intralipid group (40.38%) versus control (16%) [(p = 0.006), RR = 2.5 (1.23-5.16 CIA clinical pregnancy rate [(34.62% vs 14%), p = 0.006, RR = 2.5(1.13-5.40 CI)], implantation rate [(16.6% vs 6.6%), p = 0.012, RR = 2.5(1.18 to 5.41 CI)], and take home baby rate [28.8% vs 10%, p = 0.024, RR = 2.8(1.1-7.3)1. The adjusted odds ratio for clinical pregnancy in women who received intralipid vs placebo was 3.1 (1.02-9.70 95% CI), p = 0.046. No adverse effects of intralipid were observed.
   Conclusion: This study shows a statistically significant increase in implantation rate and live birth rate in women who receive intravenous intralipid with prior implantation failure after IVF/ICSI. These findings concur with other studies; however, literature is limited. The effect of intralipid on the immunological abnormalities in women who experience recurrent implantation failure needs to be investigated further. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Variations in the production and activity of cytokines influence the susceptibility and/or resistance to various infectious agents, autoimmune diseases, as well as the post-transplant engraftment/ rejection. Differences in the production of cytokines between individuals have been correlated to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter, coding or non-coding regions of cytokine genes. The present study aimed at understanding distribution of cytokine gene variants among HIV seropositive subjects including HIV + TB + subjects of Indian origin. Our findings indicate significant association of pro-inflammatory (IL2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene variants (IL4, IL10) with the risk to acquire the HIV infection and development of AIDS related illness in Indian population. Since distribution of genetic polymorphisms varies significantly across different populations, different genotypes might exhibit different disease-modifying effects. An understanding of the immunogenetic factors or AIDS restriction genes is important not only for elucidating the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis but also for vaccine design and its application.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY

KW  - COMPENSATION
AB  - Clinical trials are essential to test the safety and efficacy of new treatments in any population. The paucity of drug trials especially in the neonatal population has led to the widespread use of unlicensed or off-label medications, exposing them to the risks of drug toxicity and ineffective treatment. Ethical and operational challenges are no longer considered valid excuses for not conducting drug trials in neonates. We recently participated in a combined phase-2 and phase-3 trial investigating a new indigenous goat lung surfactant extract (GLSE) for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm neonates. In this article, we share pertinent challenges faced by us during the trial to better inform and foster-positive discussion among drug developers, administrators, regulatory authorities, patient advocacy groups, and researchers. Also, we provide many tools developed for the GLSE trial that can be modified and used by prospective trialists.

AB  - Retinal dialysis is mostly associated with blunt trauma or at times spontaneous. A patient presented to us with fresh rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with no telltale history or signs of trauma. The causative break was retinal dialysis noted on the superonasal periphery. A characteristic peripheral chorioretinal degeneration simulating a coastline almost extending six clock hours was seen in both the eyes. We have discussed this rare presentation and the possibilities of the association between this newly identified lesion and spontaneous retinal dialysis in the following case report.

AB  - Objectives To assess the time and frequency domain measures of cardiac autonomic activity/tone in patients of genetically defined spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1 and 2, as well as to decipher the probable associations among the cardiovascular autonomic parameters and genetic and clinical characteristics. Materials and methods Simultaneous 5-min recording of RR interval (RRI) and blood pressure (BP) for the calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were performed in genotypically confirmed SCA1 (n = 31) and SCA2 (n = 40) patients and healthy controls (n = 40). Additionally, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) was used for scoring of clinical severity in SCA patients. Results Time and frequency domain parameters of HRV, BPV and BRS were depressed in SCA1 and SCA2 subtypes as compared to controls, although there was no statistically significant difference in autonomic tone between the two SCA subtypes. On correlation analysis, autonomic tone parameters were found to be associated with the clinical and genetic features of the SCA subtypes. Also, ICARS was associated with the genotype (CAG repeat length) in SCA2 patents. Conclusions Cardiac autonomic tone is depressed in both SCA1 and 2 as compared to healthy controls while the two SCA subtypes do not differ in terms of autonomic tone. Also, a typical association exists between disease characteristics and autonomic indices.

AB  - Tenecteplase is a product of genetic modification of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator with superior pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. This meta-analysis was to determine whether intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke has better efficacy and safety outcomes than with intravenous alteplase. PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, WHO International clinical trials registry platform (ICTRP), Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), EU Clinical Trials Register (EU-CTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for trials comparing tenecteplase with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke. Functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale at 90 days), early major neurological improvement, rates of any intracerebral haemorrhage, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and mortality rate at 90 days were the outcomes compared. Four randomized controlled trials involving 1334 patients were included. The Tenecteplase group compared to the alteplase group had significantly better early major neurological improvement (RR = 1.56, 95% CI [1.00, 2.43], p = 0.05). There was no significant difference between tenecteplase and alteplase in excellent functional outcome at 90 days, good functional outcome at 90 days, any intracerebral haemorrhage, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality at 90 days. Our meta-analysis found tenecteplase to be significantly favouring one outcome: early major neurological improvement. Other outcomes did not differ between the tenecteplase and alteplase groups. Trials of cost-effective/benefit analysis comparing tenecteplase versus alteplase and tenecteplase versus endovascular treatment are necessary to reinforce the evidence for the potential cost advantage of tenecteplase.

AB  - Background: Metabolic patterns on brain F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can predict the decline in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) or other dementias.
   Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of baseline F-18 FDG-PET in aMCI for predicting conversion to AD or other dementias on follow-up.
   Patients and Methods: A total of 87 patients with aMCI were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent a detailed clinical and neuropsychological examination and FDG-PET at baseline. Each PET scan was visually classified based on predefined dementia patterns. Automated analysis of FDG PET was performed using Cortex ID (GE Healthcare). The mean follow-up duration was 30.4 +/- 9.3 months (range: 18-48 months). Diagnosis of dementia at follow-up (obtained using clinical diagnostic criteria) constituted the reference standard, and all the included aMCI patients were divided into two groups: the aMCI converters (MCI-C) and MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC). Diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET was calculated using this reference standard.
   Results: There were 23 MCI-C and 64 MCI-NC. Of the 23 MCI-C, 19 were diagnosed as probable AD, 1 as frontotemporal demetia (FTD), and 3 as vascular dementia (VD). Of the 64 MCI-NC, 9 had subjective improvement in cognition, and 55 remained stable. The conversion rate for all types of dementia in our series was 26.4% (23/87) and for Alzheimer's type dementia was 21.8% (19/87). The of PET-based visual interpretation was 91.9%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for FDG-PET-based prediction of dementia conversion were 86.9% [confidence interval (CI) 66.4%-97.2%)], 93.7% (CI 84.7%-98.2%), 83.3% (CI 65.6%-92.9%), and 95.2% (CI 87.4%-98.9%), respectively. Kappa for agreement between visual and Cortex ID was 0.94 indicating excellent agreement. In the three aMCI patients progressing to VD, no specific abnormality in metabolic pattern was noted; however, there was marked cortical atrophy on computed tomography.
   Conclusion: FDG-PET-based visual and cortex ID classification has a good accuracy in predicting progression to dementia including AD in the prodromal aMCI phase. Absence of typical metabolic patterns on FDG-PET can play an important exclusionary role for progression to dementia. Vascular cognitive impairment with cerebral atrophy needs further studies to confirm and uncover potential mechanisms.

AB  - Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the thyroid gland are generally considered to be derived from parafollicular endocrine or C cells and are known as medullary thyroid carcinomas. Non-calcitonin-producing NETs of the thyroid are extremely rare in occurrence and pose a significant diagnostic dilemma for the physician and pathologist. We describe a case of a 58-year-old woman who was diagnosed as having primary NET thyroid with normal calcitonin levels and Ga-68 DOTANOC PET-CT scan findings which were done for initial extent evaluation of the disease.

AB  - Metastasis to the breast is a rare occurrence and constitutes less than 2% of all breast tumors. Similarly, ovarian metastases from neuroendocrine tumors are also uncommon, and if the adnexal masses are bilateral, then the chances of it being metastatic rather than being primary range from 88% to 94%. We present a case of 61-year-old woman who in the course of workup for abdominal pain and diarrhea was eventually diagnosed as ileal neuroendocrine tumor with breast, ovarian, and lymph nodal metastases on Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT scan.

AB  - Background and Aims: Many studies have conclusively proven that meditative techniques derived from the Indian systems of philosophy, meditation and ritual classified as "Tantra" can bring about sustained changes in the structure and function of the nervous system of practitioners. The aim of this study is to provide neuroscientists a framework through which to interpret Tantra, and thereby provide a foundation upon which future interdisciplinary study can be built.
   Methods: We juxtapose Tantric concepts such as the subtle body, nadis and mantras with relevant neuroscientific findings. Our premise is that through sustained internalization of attention, Tantric practitioners were able to identify and document subtle changes in their field of awareness, which usually do not cross the threshold to come into our perception.
   Results: The descriptions left by Tantric philosophers are often detailed and empirical, but they are about subjective phenomena, rather than external objects. They also focus on individual experiences, rather than the group-level analyses favored by modem medical science.
   Conclusion: Systematic exploration of Tantric texts can be of tremendous value in expanding our understanding of human beings' experiential reality, by enabling us to build bridges between first-person and third-person approaches to the nervous system. This may open up new avenues for cognitive enhancement and treating neurological diseases.

AB  - Study Objective: To evaluate the outcomes of assisted reproductive technology (ART) after proximal tubal occlusion (PTO) or salpingectomy in patients with hydrosalpinx undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET).
   Design: Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).
   Setting: All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Patients: A total of 165 patients were randomized and subsequently allocated to a PTO group (n = 83) or a salpingectomy group (n = 82).
   Interventions: PTO and salpingectomy.
   Measurements and Main Results: Following surgery, compared with the PTO group, the salpingectomy group showed significant decreases in the ovarian reserve parameters serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH; 3.7 ng/mL vs 2.6 ng/mL; p < .001) and antral follicle count (AFC; 10.6 vs 8.6; p < .001). The salpingectomy group also required a significantly higher dose of gonadotropins (3901 vs 3260; p < .001) and more days of stimulation (11.3 vs 10.2; p < .001) compared with the PTO group. The salpingectomy group had a significantly lower fertilization rate (0.74 vs 0.83; p < .001) and a lower number of grade 1 embryos (4.1 vs 5.6; p = .02); however, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to rates of implantation (22.8% vs 23.7%; p = .87), clinical pregnancy (26.3% vs 33.7%, p = .25), live birth (27.5% vs 32.5%; p = .42), and miscarriage (4.7% vs 3.5%; p = .90)
   Conclusions: PTO is a superior to salpingectomy for the surgical management of patients with hydrosalpinx undergoing IVF-ET in terms of ovarian reserve. However, the 2 surgical techniques are associated with comparable pregnancy rates. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent advancement in understanding cancer etiology has highlighted epigenetic deregulation as an important phenomenon leading to poor prognosis in glioblastoma (GBM). Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is one such important epigenetic modifier reportedly altered in GBM. However, its defined mechanism in tumorigenesis still remains elusive. In present study, we analyzed our in-house ChIPseq data for H3k27me3 modified miRNAs and identified miR-490-3p to be the most common target in GBM with significantly downregulated expression in glioma patients in both TCGA and GBM patient cohort. Our functional analysis delineates for the first time, a central role of PRC2 catalytic unit EZH2 in directly regulating expression of this miRNA and its host gene CHRM2 in GBM. In accordance, cell line treatment with EZH2 siRNA and 5-azacytidine also confirmed its coregulation by CpG and histone methylation based epigenetic mechanisms. Furthermore, induced overexpression of miR-490-3p in GBM cell lines significantly inhibited key hallmarks including cellular proliferation, colony formation and spheroid formation, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with downregulation of multiple EMT transcription factors and promigratory genes (MMP9, CCL5, PIK3R1, ICAM1, ADAM17 and NOTCH1). We also for the first time report TGFBR1 and TGIF2 as two direct downstream effector targets of miR-490-3p that are also deregulated in GBM. TGIF2, a novel target, was shown to promote migration and EMT that could partially be rescued by miR-490-3p overexpression. Overall, this stands as a first study that provides a direct link between epigenetic modulator EZH2 and oncogenic TGF-beta signaling involving novel miR-490-3p/TGIF2/TGFBR1 axis, that being targetable might be promising in developing new therapeutic intervention strategies for GBM.

TI  - Workload Indicators of Staffing Need as a tool to determine nurse staffing for a high volume academic Emergency Department: An observational study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY NURSING
AB  - Introduction: Determination of staffing requirement for an Emergency Department (ED) is often difficult due to random arrivals of a complex mix of cases, fluctuating volumes and lengths of stay. Most staffing strategies are based on patient census, lengths of stay, patient dependency or patient classification systems. However, the actual quantity of workload is seldom employed as a basis to calculate staffing.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the requirement of nurses for a high volume academic ED and to suggest measures to optimally schedule them.
   Methodology: Structured interviews were held with ED nurses to list their health service activities, support and additional activities. Time taken for the activities was calculated based on observations and interviews. Records were perused to obtain annual service statistics. Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) described by World Health Organization was utilized to analyze and determine staffing need.
   Results: The study identified 34 health service activities, 21 support activities and 3 additional activities to be performed by 125 nurses with a total available working time of 187,250 h for an annual volume of 105,103 patients. The WISN ratio was 0.90 which indicates that the current staff strength was inadequate. The Emergency Department requires 13 more full time staff nurses for it to function optimally. In case of reallocation of certain relevant duties to phlebotomists or nursing assistants, the requirement of staff nurses is 102. Consequently, a skill mix ratio of 82% nurses to 18% nursing assistants and phlebotomists is suggested.
   Discussion: The Workload Indicators of Staffing Need is a simple, easy to use method that can prospectively measure direct and indirect nursing activities and translate workload into nursing full time equivalents for the ED. This method is also useful to identify activities that do not require nursing professional skills and prescribe the skill mix of staff.

AB  - Objective: This study presents the results of a systematic literature review conducted to determine most up-to-date information on the natural outcome of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and the most reliable diagnostic techniques.
   Methods: A literature search was performed for articles published during the last 10 years.
   Results: The natural course of patients with cervical stenosis and signs of myelopathy is quite variable. In patients with no symptoms, but significant stenosis, the risk of developing myelopathy with cervical stenosis is approximately 3% per year. Myelopathic signs are useful for the clinical diagnosis of CSM. However, they are not highly sensitive and may be absent in approximately one-fifth of patients with myelopathy. The electrophysiological tests to be used in CSM patients are motor evoked potential (MEP), spinal cord evoked potential, somatosensory evoked potential, and electromyography (EMG). The differential diagnosis of CSM from other neurological conditions can be accomplished by those tests. MEP and EMG monitoring are useful to reduce C5 root palsy during CSM surgery. Notable spinal cord T2 hyperintensity on cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is correlated with a worse outcome, whereas lighter signal changes may predict better outcomes. T1 hypointensity should be considered a sign of more advanced disease.
   Conclusion: The natural course of CSM is quite variable. Signal changes on MRI and some electrophysiological tests are valuable adjuncts to diagnosis.

AB  - This study is conducted to review the literature systematically to determine most reliable outcome measures, important clinical and radiological variables affecting the prognosis in cervical spondylotic myelopathy patients. A literature search was performed for articles published during the last 10 years. As functional outcome measures we recommend to use modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, Nurick's grade, and Myelopathy Disability Index. Three clinical variables that affect the outcomes are age, duration of symptoms, and severity of the myelopathy. Examination findings require more detailed study to validate their effect on the outcomes. The predictive variables affecting the outcomes are hand atrophy, leg spasticity, Bonus, and Babinski's sign. Among the radiological variables, the curvature of the cervical spine is the most important predictor of prognosis. Patients with instability are expected to have a poor surgical outcome. Spinal cord compression ratio is a critical factor for prognosis. High signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images is a negative predictor for prognosis. The most important predictors of outcome are preoperative severity and duration of symptoms. T2 hyperintensity and cord compression ratio can also predict outcomes. New radiological tests may give promising results in the future.

AB  - Anti-inflammatory drugs are well known to reduce the risk of colon cancer and prophylactic use of such agents is gaining acceptance as a cancer prevention therapy. As artesunate, an antimalarial drug, has been shown to exhibit chemopreventive properties, the present study was carried out to evaluate its inhibitory effect on oxidative stress and inflammation in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis. A chemical carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine was injected twice at an interval of 1 week to induce preneoplastic lesions in the colon and the parameters indicating oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated after 8 weeks. Artesunate (50 and 150 mg/kg) and aspirin (60 mg/kg) were administered orally throughout the study. Analysis of colon tissue revealed that both the drugs preserved histoarchitecture, inhibited cellular influx, decreased the levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, downregulated cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor kappa B, and interleukin 1 beta in comparison to the experimental control. Suppression of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signaling by both the drugs were found to contribute to inhibition of colon carcinogenesis. The protection afforded by these drugs was found to be comparable. Our study shows that like aspirin, use of artesunate could also reduce the risk of colon cancer and it has a potential for further evaluation for the treatment purpose.

AB  - Ets-1 is one of the crucial member of transcription factor family which share a unique DNA binding domain. It is predominantly expressed in various tumor subtypes and has shown its association in the regulation of various important genes which include ECM-degrading proteases. Our study aimed to understand the mechanism(s) in the pathogenesis of breast carcinogenesis by Ets-1 transcription factor and its downstream target gene MMP-9. Role of Ets-1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was studied by RNA-interference in combination with pull down and ChIP assays to identify the regulation of MMP-9 in these cell lines. Our results showed that transfection of Ets-1 siRNA in breast cancer cell lines resulted in downregulation of Ets-1 and MMP-9. Ets-1 knock down also showed reduced cell invasion and altered expression of EMT markers. Moreover, we could also predict that MMP-9 gene promoter harbors a binding site for Ets-1 transcription factor may be responsible in direct transactivation of Ets-1 along with EMT markers. Phenotypic changes and molecular alterations that may result in increased aggressiveness/ invasiveness and metastatic nature of cancerous cells may lead to changes in EMT markers. Therefore, these findings may suggest a plausible role of Ets-1 dependent regulation of MMP-9 gene and may have a significant impact on breast carcinogenesis.

AB  - Studies conducted in animal models have suggested that membrane complement regulatory proteins play an important role in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, a total of 100 individuals, with stable CAD and 100 healthy controls, both groups predominantly male, were recruited. We evaluated the plasma levels of complement regulatory proteins (Cregs) CD35, CD46, CD55, and CD59 and their surface expression on granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of these Cregs in total leukocytes was determined by quantitative PCR. The soluble forms of Cregs, C3c, Mannose binding protein-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2), Platelet activating factor-acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH), and inflammatory cytokines were quantified by ELISA. High plasma levels of C3c, indicative of complement activation, in addition to significantly low levels of Cregs, were observed in CAD patients. A significantly lower expression of CD46 and CD55 on the surface of lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes and higher surface expression of CD35 and CD59 on granulocytes (p < 0.0001) was seen in CAD patients as compared to healthy donors. The high expression of CD59 on granulocytes positively correlated with the severity of disease and may serve as a potential marker of disease progression in CAD.

AB  - The quest for detecting bacteria has gained momentum in food and beverage industry for preventing spoilage of products to maintain requisite quality. The present paper describes the development of a SERS immunosensor for the detection of model pathogen, S. typhimurium using strategically synthesized functionalized polymeric magnetic nanoparticles (FPMNPs) as effective capture probe and immuno-magnetic separator. The synthesized probe contains surface diketonic functionalities which covalently link with amino groups of antibodies against Salmonella common structural antigen (CSA-1-Ab) and hence specifically captured the target bacteria. Magnetic core of nanoparticles facilitated easy separation of target bacteria from the milieu of non-specific molecules. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) modified with CSA-1-Ab and external Raman reporter molecules (RRM) were used as signal probes. We compared the signalling attributes of 4-mercapto benzoic acid (MBA) and 5,5'-dithiobis(succinimidyl-2-nitrobenzoate) (DSNB) as RRMs. Capture and signal probes sandwich the target bacteria upon its addition, generating Raman signal from the 'hot-spots' created by signal probe. Under optimal conditions, the SERS intensities of MBA and DSNB at 1588 and 1336 cm(-1) respectively were used to measure the concentration of the pathogen in the range of 101-107 cells mL(-1). Limit of detection (LOD) of MBA and DSNB based immunosensor was measured as 100 cells mL(-1), and 10 cells mL(-1) respectively. Moreover, appreciable recovery (82-114%) was recorded for sensing method for different spiked food products. Thus, the developed magnetically assisted SERS immunosensor is sensitive, specific and has strong potential to be used for detecting contamination in food samples in field conditions.

AB  - Objective
   To describe the relationship between intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) expansion and long-term outcome and to use this relationship to select and validate clinically relevant thresholds of IVH expansion in 2 separate intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) populations.
   Methods
   We used fractional polynomial analysis to test linear and nonlinear models of 24-hour IVH volume change and clinical outcome with data from the Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT)-ICH study. The primary outcome was poor clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 4-6) at 90 days. We derived dichotomous thresholds from the selected model and calculated diagnostic accuracy measures. We validated all thresholds in an independent single-center ICH cohort (Massachusetts General Hospital).
   Results
   Of the 256 patients from PREDICT, 127 (49.6%) had an mRS score of 4 to 6. Twenty-four-hour IVH volume change and poor outcome fit a nonlinear relationship, in which minimal increases in IVH were associated with a high probability of an mRS score of 4 to 6. IVH expansion >= 1 mL (n = 53, sensitivity 33%, specificity 92%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-6.46) and development of any new IVH (n = 74, sensitivity 43%, specificity 85%, aOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.22-5.26) strongly predicted poor outcome at 90 days. The dichotomous thresholds reproduced well in a validation cohort of 169 patients.
   Conclusion
   IVH expansion as small as 1 mL or any new IVH is strongly predictive of poor outcome. These findings may assist clinicians with bedside prognostication and could be incorporated into definitions of hematoma expansion to inform future ICH treatment trials.

AB  - Introduction: Well-structured instructions for authors in journals help researchers in reporting unbiased results, which subsequently facilitates the review process. There have been reports of systematic evaluations of instructions for authors from journals in various medical specialties. However, precise information on the nature and extent of these instructions for authors in addiction science is lacking. Hence, this study systematically evaluated the instructions for authors for journals in addiction science. Methods: A total of 1139 journal titles were retrieved across multiple databases. Finally, 88 exclusive titles fulfilling the eligibility criteria were considered in this study. The four domains evaluated were journal characteristics, reporting, statistical reporting, and ethical requirements. Results: More than half of the journals were published by academic institutions or professional societies. Less than one-fourth of the journals endorsed adherence to various reporting guidelines and endorsed the Consolidated Statements on Randomized Controlled Trials guidelines to the maximum level (14.8%). Approximately, half (48.9%) of the journals had a separate section on statistical analysis. The various parameters of statistical reporting were suboptimally endorsed. Conclusion/Importance: The instructions for authors in addiction science journals provide insufficient information in various domains. There is an urgent need to improve the author instructions segment of addiction science journals so that the process of research dissemination can occur more effectively. A higher rate of endorsement of various reporting guidelines and statistical reporting may help to minimize reporting bias as well as prevent unnecessary delays in the publication of important research findings.

AB  - The topological characteristics of biological networks enable us to identify the key nodes in terms of modularity. However, due to a large size of the biological networks with many hubs and functional modules across intertwined layers within the network, it often becomes difficult to accomplish the task of identifying potential key regulators. We use for the first time a generalized formalism of Hamiltonian Energy (HE) with a recursive approach. The concept, when applied to the Apoptosis Regulatory Gene Network (ARGN), helped us identify 11 Motif hubs (MHs), which influenced the network up to motif levels. The approach adopted allowed to classify MHs into 5 significant motif hubs (S-MHs) and 6 non-significant motif hubs (NS-MHs). The significant motif hubs had a higher HE value and were considered as high-active key regulators; while the non-significant motif hubs had a relatively lower HE value and were considered as low-active key regulators, in network control mechanism. Further, we compared the results of the HE analyses with the topological characterization, after subjecting to the three conditions independently: (i) removing all MHs, (ii) removing only S-MHs, and (iii) removing only NS-MHs from the ARGN. This procedure allowed us to cross-validate the role of 5 S-MHs, NFk-B1, BRCA1, CEBPB, AR, and POU2F1 as the potential key regulators. The changes in HE calculations further showed that the removal of 5 S-MHs could cause perturbation at all levels of the network, a feature not discernible by topological analysis alone.

AB  - Hydatid disease is a rare pathology, but relatively common in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central Asia, and East Africa. It may develop in almost any part of the body, although most hydatid cysts occur in the liver or in the lung. Bone involvement is rare, and accounts for only 0.5% to 4% of all locations. Most of the hydatid cyst are diagnosed on the basis of their clinical and radiological presentation. However, in cases with an atypical presentation, FNAC may be used to evaluate the nature of lesion.

AB  - Background Studies in high-income countries have reported associations between oral health and diabetes. There is however a lack of evidence on this association from low and middle-income countries, especially India. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of common oral diseases and their association with diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study was nested within the second Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Surveillance Study. A subset of study participants residing in Delhi were administered the World Health Organization's Oral Health Assessment Questionnaire and underwent oral examination for caries experience and periodontal health assessment using standard indices. Diabetes status was ascertained by fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin values or self-reported medication use. Information was captured on co-variates of interest. The association between oral health and diabetes was investigated using Multivariable Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression analysis. Results Out of 2045 participants, 47% were women and the mean age of study participants was 42.17 (12.8) years. The age-standardised prevalence (95% confidence interval) estimates were 78.9% (75.6-81.7) for dental caries, 35.9% (32.3-39.6) for periodontitis. Nearly 85% participants suffered from at least one oral disease. Compared to diabetes-free counterparts, participants with diabetes had more severe caries experience [Mean Count Ratio (MCR) = 1.07 (1.03-1.12)] and attachment loss [MCR = 1.10 (1.04-1.17)]. Also, the adjusted prevalence of periodontitis was significantly higher among participants with diabetes [42.3%(40.0-45.0)] compared to those without diabetes [31.3%(30.3-32.2)]. Conclusion We found that eight out of ten participants in urban Delhi suffered from some form of oral disease and participants with diabetes had worse oral health. This highlights the need for public health strategies to integrate oral health within the existing Non-Communicable Disease control programs.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and their derivatives have achieved remarkable success as medicine, targeting both diagnostic and therapeutic applications associated with communicable and non-communicable diseases. In the last 3 to 4 decades, tremendous success has been manifested in the field of cancer therapy, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular and infectious diseases. MAbs are the fastest growing class of biopharmaceuticals, with more than 25 derivatives are in clinical use and 7 of these have been isolated through phage display technology. Phage display technology has gained impetus in the field of medical and health sciences, as a large repertoire of diverse recombinant antibodies, targeting various antigens have been generated in a short span of time. A prominent number of phage display derived antibodies are already approved for therapy and significant numbers are currently in clinical trials. In this review we have discussed the various strategies employed for generation of monoclonal antibodies; their advantages, limitations and potential therapeutic applications. We also discuss the potential of phage display antibody libraries in isolation of monoclonal antibodies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: New strategies to restore sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression and function in radioiodine therapy-refractive anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATCs) are urgently required. Recently, we reported the regulatory role of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR gamma) in ATC cell NIS function. Herein, we identified DN200434 as a highly potent (functional IC50 = 0.006 mu mol/L), selective, and orally available ERR gamma inverse agonist for NIS enhancement in ATC.
   Experimental Design: We sought to identify better ERR gamma-targeting ligands and explored the crystal structure of ERR gamma in complex with DN200434. After treating ATC cells with DN200434, the change in iodide-handling gene expression, as well as radioiodine avidity was examined. ATC tumor-bearing mice were orally administered with DN200434, followed by I-124-positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT). For radioiodine therapy, ATC tumor-bearing mice treated with DN200434 were administered I-131 (beta ray-emitting therapeutic radioiodine) and then bioluminescent imaging was performed to monitor the therapeutic effects. Histologic analysis was performed to evaluate ERR gamma expression status in normal tissue and ATC tissue, respectively.
   Results: DN200434-ERR gamma complex crystallographic studies revealed that DN200434 binds to key ERR gamma binding pocket residues through four-way interactions. DN200434 effectively upregulated iodide-handling genes and restored radioiodine avidity in ATC tumor lesions, as confirmed by I-124-PET/CT. DN200434 enhanced ATC tumor radioiodine therapy susceptibility, markedly inhibiting tumor growth. Histologic findings of patients with ATC showed higher ERR gamma expression in tumors than in normal tissue, supporting ERR gamma as a therapeutic target for ATC.
   Conclusions: DN200434 shows potential clinical applicability for diagnosis and treatment of ATC or other poorly differentiated thyroid cancers.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin has no standard treatment regimen, resulting in recurrences/metastasis. Although, doxorubicin (Dox), an anthracycline antibiotic has demonstrated some degree of efficacy. Molecular imaging can help in assessment of treatment response and prognosis of SCCs. MRI data showed that spin-spin relaxation (T2) time was longer (138 +/- 2 msec) in Dox treated Test-II and there is no significant difference in spin-lattice relaxation (T1) time with respective controls. These findings further corroborated with the histology, proliferation index, apoptotic index, and HMGA1 protein expression. Thus, MRI may be a useful tool for monitoring treatment response noninvasively for skin tumor prognosis.

AB  - India has the highest burden of Tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) worldwide. Innovative technology is the need of the hour to identify these cases that remain either undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed due to the unavailability of appropriate tools at primary healthcare settings. We developed and evaluated 3 kits, namely 'TB Detect' (containing BioFM-Filter device), 'TB Concentration and Transport' (containing Trans-Filter device) and 'TB DNA Extraction' kits. These kits enable bio-safe equipment-free concentration of sputum on filters and improved fluorescence microscopy at primary healthcare centres, ambient temperature transport of dried inactivated sputum filters to central laboratories and molecular detection of drug resistance by PCR and DNA sequencing (Mol-DST). In a 2-site evaluation (n = 1190 sputum specimens) on presumptive TB patients, BioFM-Filter smear exhibited a significant increase in positivity of 7% and 4% over ZN smear and LED-FM smear (p<0.05), respectively and an increment in smear grade status (1+ or 2+ to 3+) of 16% over ZN smear and 20% over LED-FM smear. The sensitivity of Mol-DST in presumptive MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases (n = 148) was 90% for Rifampicin (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-96%), 84% for Isoniazid (95% CI, 72-92%), 83% for Fluoroquinolones (95% CI, 66-93%) and 75% for Aminoglycosides (95% CI, 35-97%), using phenotypic DST as the reference standard. Test specificity was 88-93% and concordance was similar to 89-92% (kappa value 0.8-0.9). The patient-friendly kits described here address several of the existing challenges and are designed to provide 'Universal Access' to rapid TB diagnosis, including drug-resistant disease. Their utility was demonstrated by application to sputum at 2 sites in India. Our findings pave the way for larger studies in different point-of-care settings, including high-density urban areas and remote geographical locations.

AB  - Background This study assessed the safety and efficacy of deep tissue laser therapy on the management of pain, functionality, systemic inflammation, and overall quality of life of older adults with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Methods The effects of deep tissue laser therapy (DTLT) were assessed in a randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, interventional trial. Forty participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either DTLT or sham laser therapy (SLT). In addition to the standard-of-care treatment, participants received either DTLT or SLT twice weekly for 4 weeks and then once weekly for 8 weeks (a 12-week intervention period). The two treatments were identical, except that laser emission was disabled during SLT. Assessments for pain, functionality, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and quality of life (QOL) were performed at baseline and after the 12-week intervention period. The results from the two treatments were compared using ANOVA in a pre-test-post-test design. Results All participants randomized to the DTLT group and 85% (17 of 20) of participants randomized to the SLT group completed the trial. No significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups were observed. After the 12-week intervention period, pain levels significantly decreased in both groups and were significantly lower in the DTLT group than in the SLT group. The Timed Up and Go test times (assessing functionality) were significantly improved in both groups and were 16% shorter in the DTLT group than in the SLT group. Serum levels of IL-6 decreased significantly in both groups. Additionally, serum levels of MCP-1 decreased significantly in the DTLT group but not in the SLT group. Patients' quality of life improved significantly in the DTLT group but not in the SLT group. Conclusions Deep tissue laser therapy significantly reduced pain and improved the quality of life of older patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Background: Titration of basal insulin led by either the physician or the patient is not well understood in India. This analysis of Indian subset of Asian Treat to Target Lantus Study (ATLAS) compared effectiveness of patient-led with physician-led titration of once-daily insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Glargine-U-100) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) uncontrolled on oral antidiabetes drug (OAD). Methods: In this open-label parallel group study, randomized patients (either physician-led or patient-led [self-titration] group) followed the same dose titration algorithm (fasting blood glucose [FBG] target 110 mg/dL [6.1 mmol/L]). The primary endpoint was change in mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at week 24 in the patient-led group versus the physician-led group. Results: Patients (40-75 years) were randomized to either the physician-led group (n = 39) or the patient-led group (n = 36). At week 24, self-titration led to a greater decline in HbA1c than physician-led titration (-1.3% vs. -1.1%). Mean decrease in FBG was more in the patient-led group than in the physician-led group (-53.7 mg/dL vs. -35.5 mg/dL). Mean daily dose of Glargine-U-100 at week 24 was higher in the patient-led group than in the physician-led group (30.0 U vs. 23.8 U). At any time during the study, 30.6% and 7.7% of patients in the patient-led and physician-led groups, respectively, showed target HbA1c level of <7.0% without severe hypoglycemia. Treatment satisfaction and quality of life improved in both groups. Overall, treatment was safe and well tolerated, and none of the events led to treatment discontinuation. Conclusion: Patient-led adjustment of Glargine-U-100 in outpatient setting can be a safe and effective method for glycemic control in Indian patients with T2DM uncontrolled on OADs.

AB  - Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology provides an opportunity to multiply superior animals that could speed up dissemination of favorable genes into the population. In the present study, we attempted to reproduce a superior breeding bull of Murrah buffalo, the best dairy breed of buffalo, using donor cells that were established from tail-skin biopsy and seminal plasma. We studied several parameters such as cell cycle stages, histone modifications (H3K9ac and H3K27me3) and expression of developmental genes in donor cells to determine their SCNT reprogramming potentials. We successfully produced the cloned bull from an embryo that was produced from the skin-derived cell. Growth, blood hematology, plasma biochemistries, and reproductive organs of the produced cloned bull were found normal. Subsequently, the bull was employed for semen production. Semen parameters such as CASA (Computer Assisted Semen Analysis) variables and in vitro fertilizing ability of sperms of the cloned bull were found similar to non-cloned bulls, including the donor bull. At present, we have 12 live healthy progenies that were produced using artificial insemination of frozen semen of the cloned bull, which indicate that the cloned bull is fertile and can be utilized in the buffalo breeding schemes. Taken together, we demonstrate that SCNT can be used to reproduce superior buffalo bulls.

AB  - Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common and recurrent type of primary adult liver cancer without any effective therapy. Plant-derived compounds acting as anticancer agents can induce apoptosis by targeting several signaling pathways. Strigolactone (SL) is a novel class of phytohormone, whose analogues have been reported to possess anticancer properties on a panel of human cancer cell lines through inducing cell cycle arrest, destabilizing microtubular integrity, reducing damaged in the DNA repair machinery, and inducing apoptosis. In our previous study, we reported that a novel SL analogue, TIT3, reduces HepG2 cell proliferation, inhibits cell migration, and induces apoptosis. To decipher the mechanisms of TIT3-induced anticancer activity in HepG2, we performed RNA sequencing and the differential expression of genes was analyzed using different tools. RNA-Seq data showed that the genes responsible for microtubule organization such as TUBB, BUB1B, TUBG2, TUBGCP6, TPX2, and MAP7 were significantly downregulated. Several epigenetic modulators such as UHRF1, HDAC7, and DNMT1 were also considerably downregulated, and this effect was associated with significant upregulation of various proapoptotic genes including CASP3, TNF-alpha, CASP7, and CDKN1A (p21). Likewise, damaged DNA repair genes such as RAD51, RAD52, and DDB2 were also significantly downregulated. This study indicates that TIT3-induced antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities on HCC cells could involve several signaling pathways. Our results suggest that TIT3 might be a promising drug to treat HCC.

AB  - The importance of whole protein extracts from different types of human teeth in modulating the process of teeth biomineralization is reported. There are two crucial features in protein molecules that result in efficient teeth biomineralization. Firstly, the unique secondary structure characteristics within these proteins i.e. the exclusive presence of a large amount of intrinsic disorder and secondly, the presence of post-translational modifications (PTM) like phosphorylation and glycosylation within these protein molecules. The present study accesses the structural implications of PTMs in the tooth proteins through scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The deglycosylated/dephosphorylated protein extracts failed to form higher-order mineralization assemblies. Furthermore, through nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) we have shown that dephosphorylation and deglycosylation significantly impact the biomineralization abilities of the protein extract and resulted in smaller sized clusters. Hence, we propose these post-translational modifications are indispensable for the process of teeth biomineralization. In addition to basic science, this study would be worth consideration while designing of biomimetics architecture for an efficient peptide-based teeth remineralization strategy.

AB  - Amongst the scientific frameworks powered by the Monte Carlo (MC) toolkit Geant4 (Agostinelli et al., 2003), the TOPAS (Tool for Particle Simulation) (Perl et al., 2012) is one. TOPAS focuses on providing ease of use, and has significant implementation in the radiation oncology space at present. TOPAS functionality extends across the full capacity of Geant4, is freely available to non-profit users, and is being extended into radiobiology via TOPAS-nBIO (Ramos-Mendez et al., 2018). A current "grand problem" in cancer therapy is to convert the dose of treatment from physical dose to biological dose, optimized ultimately to the individual context of administration of treatment. Biology MC calculations are some of the most complex and require significant computational resources. In order to enhance TOPAS's ability to become a critical tool to explore the definition and application of biological dose in radiation therapy, we chose to explore the use of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips to speedup the Geant4 calculations at the heart of TOPAS, because this approach called "Reconfigurable Computing" (RC), has proven able to produce significant (around 90x) (Sajish et al., 2012) speed increases in scientific computing. Here, we describe initial steps to port Geant4 and TOPAS to be used on FPGA.
   We provide performance analysis of the current TOPAS/Geant4 code from an RC implementation perspective. Baseline benchmarks are presented. Achievable performance figures of the subsections of the code on optimal hardware are presented; Aspects of practical implementation of "Monte Carlo on a chip" are also discussed.

AB  - A 15-year-old female child with history of bilateral poor vision since childhood presented with sudden onset pain, photophobia, and diminution of vision OD for 10 days. Visual acuity was hand motion OD and 1/60 OS. Slit lamp examination revealed microcornea OU with multiple intrastromal fluid clefts OD and an irregular cornea and iridofundal coloboma OS. A clinical diagnosis of acute corneal hydrops OD was made, and the child was subjected to intraoperative optical coherence tomography guided intrastromal fluid drainage with air tamponade. The corneal edema resolved completely within 2 weeks resuming visual acuity to 3/60 allowing laser delimitation of fundal coloboma OD.

AB  - Background Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a leading cause of acute kidney injury in children. Although international guidelines emphasize comprehensive evaluation and treatment with eculizumab, access to diagnostic and therapeutic facilities is limited in most developing countries. The burden of Shiga toxin-associated HUS in India is unclear; school-going children show high prevalence of anti-factor H (FH) antibodies. The aim of the consensus meeting was to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HUS in children, specific to the needs of the country.
   Methods Four workgroups performed literature review and graded research studies addressing (i) investigations, biopsy, genetics, and differential diagnosis; (ii) Shiga toxin, pneumococcal, and infection-associated HUS; (iii) atypical HUS; and (iv) complement blockade. Consensus statements developed by the workgroups were discussed during a consensus meeting in March 2017.
   Results An algorithm for classification and evaluation was developed. The management of Shiga toxin-associated HUS is supportive; prompt plasma exchanges (PEX) is the chief therapy in patients with atypical HUS. Experts recommend that patients with anti-FH-associated HUS be managed with a combination of PEX and immunosuppressive medications. Indications for eculizumab include incomplete remission with plasma therapy, life-threatening features, complications of PEX or vascular access, inherited defects in complement regulation, and recurrence of HUS in allografts. Priorities for capacity building in regional and national laboratories are highlighted.
   Conclusions Limited diagnostic capabilities and lack of access to eculizumab prevent the implementation of international guidelines for HUS in most developing countries. We propose practice guidelines for India, which will perhaps be applicable to other developing countries.

AB  - Problematic internet use has been reported to be high among school students. An online course was developed with an aim to strengthen the capacity of school teachers and counsellors on early identification, detection and intervention for behavioral addictions involving use of internet. The current report presents the observation from the first batch of participants of this course. Of the 28 teachers and counselors who expressed interest by enrollment in the course, a total of 15 participants provided both the pre and post course evaluation forms. The preliminary findings suggest that the online course is feasible, acceptable and effective in strengthening the capacity of school teachers and counsellors on behavioral addictions involving use of internet.

AB  - Background There is a scarcity of published data on the global prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea, a disorder associated with major neurocognitive and cardiovascular sequelae. We used publicly available data and contacted key opinion leaders to estimate the global prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea.
   Methods We searched PubMed and Embase to identify published studies reporting the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea based on objective testing methods. A conversion algorithm was created for studies that did not use the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2012 scoring criteria to identify obstructive sleep apnoea, allowing determination of an equivalent apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) for publications that used different criteria. The presence of symptoms was not specifically analysed because of scarce information about symptoms in the reference studies and population data. Prevalence estimates for obstructive sleep apnoea across studies using different diagnostic criteria were standardised with a newly developed algorithm. Countries without obstructive sleep apnoea prevalence data were matched to a similar country with available prevalence data; population similarity was based on the population body-mass index, race, and geographical proximity. The primary outcome was prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea based on AASM 2012 diagnostic criteria in individuals aged 30-69 years (as this age group generally had available data in the published studies and related to information from the UN for all countries).
   Findings Reliable prevalence data for obstructive sleep apnoea were available for 16 countries, from 17 studies. Using AASM 2012 diagnostic criteria and AHI threshold values of five or more events per h and 15 or more events per h, we estimated that 936 million (95% CI 903-970) adults aged 30-69 years (men and women) have mild to severe obstructive sleep apnoea and 425 million (399-450) adults aged 30-69 years have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea globally. The number of affected individuals was highest in China, followed by the USA, Brazil, and India.
   Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first study to report global prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea; with almost 1 billion people affected, and with prevalence exceeding 50% in some countries, effective diagnostic and treatment strategies are needed to minimise the negative health impacts and to maximise cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Neutrophils maintain immune homeostasis by engulfing apoptotic cells and debris. We describe the rapid activation of neutrophils after engulfing hemoglobin (Hb)-activated platelets, which are abundant in the circulation of hemolytic patients. Neutrophils from healthy individuals after engulfing Hb-activated platelets express elevated CD11b and secrete significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and elastase within 4-h platelets, but not with free-Hb only in vitro. These neutrophils exhibit early onset of apoptosis and cell death after engulfing Hb-activated platelets, but not with free-Hb only. Further, our data from mice with phenylhydrazine-induced intravascular hemolysis display a gradual decrease in total neutrophil count, but the number of activated neutrophils and neutrophil-platelet aggregates increases, along with the rise of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and MPO in circulation. Our data from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients confirmed the observation of decreased total neutrophil counts, but elevated numbers of activated neutrophils, including neutrophil-platelet aggregates, in parallel with elevated expression of TNFA, IL1B and IL6 genes in neutrophils, also increased levels of these cytokines along with MPO in circulation, and this correlated directly with elevated intravascular hemolysis (high free-Hb in plasma). The patients' neutrophils displayed significant localization of intracellular Hb and platelets, unlike the counterparts from healthy individuals. Together, therefore, our observations suggest that Hb-activated platelets, which are abundant in the circulation of patients with hemolytic disorders, including PNH, promotes early onset of neutrophil activation and increases their proinflammatory response and leads to early apoptosis and cell death.

AB  - Guidelines recommend true whole-body F-18-FDG PET/CT scans from vertex to toes in pediatric lymphoma patients, although this suggestion has not been validated in large clinical trials. The objective of the study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical impact of lesions outside the "eyes to thighs" regular field of view (R-FOV) in F-18-FDG PET/CT staging (sPET) and interim (iPET) scans in pediatric lymphoma patients. Methods: True whole-body sPET and iPET scans were prospectively obtained in pediatric lymphoma patients (11 worldwide centers). Expert panel central review of sPET and iPET scans were evaluated for lymphoma lesions outside the R-FOV and clinical relevance of these findings. Results: A total of 610 scans were obtained in 305 patients. The sPET scans did not show lesions outside the R-FOV in 91.8% of the patients, whereas in 8.2% patients the sPET scans demonstrated lesions also outside the R-FOV (soft tissue, bone, bone marrow, and skin); however, the presence of these lesions did not change the clinical stage of any patient and did not affect treatment decision. Among the 305 iPET scans, there were no new positive F-18-FDG-avid lesions outside the R-FOV, when compared with their paired sPET scans. A single lesion outside the R-FOV on iPET occurred in 1 patient (0.3%), with the primary lesion diagnosed in the femur on sPET that persisted on iPET. Conclusion: The identification of additional lesions outside the R-FOV (eyes to thighs) using F-18-FDG PET/CT has no impact in the definition of the clinical stage of disease and minimal impact in the treatment definition of patients with pediatric lymphoma. As so, R-FOV for both sPET and iPET scans could be performed.

AB  - Aims and objectives: : The study aimed to assess and compare fractional anisotropy (FA) in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF) and arcuate fasciculi (AF) across schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations(AH), without AH, and healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography.
   Methodology: : Right-handed adult (18-50 years) individuals with DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia with AH (group-I; n = 30) were compared to those without lifetime AH (group-II; n = 32) and healthy controls (group-III; n=30). Severity of psychosis in groups-I and II was assessed using SAPS, SANS, and CGI-SCH, and psychopathology was assessed using PSYRATS. The FA was calculated for all images on DTI studio-version 3.0 using tractography technique.
   Results: : All three groups were comparable for age, gender, education and illness-severity. Schizophrenia subjects with AH had significantly lower FA values in bilateral SLF and AF compared to those without AH and healthy controls. No difference was observed in corresponding FA values between schizophrenia without AH and healthy controls.
   Conclusion: : White matter disruptions in bilateral SLF and AF appear to be specific to schizophrenia with AH and must be explored further as potential marker of AH, pending replication in other studies.

AB  - Purpose In preclinical studies, many stem cell/cellular interventions demonstrated robust regeneration and/or repair in case of SCI and were considered a promising therapeutic candidate. However, data from clinical studies are not robust. Despite lack of substantial evidence for the efficacy of these interventions in spinal cord injury (SCI), many clinics around the world offer them as "therapy." These "clinics" claim efficacy through patient testimonials and self-advertisement without any scientific evidence to validate their claims. Thus, SCS established a panel of experts to review published preclinical studies, clinical studies and current global guidelines/regulations on usage of cellular transplants and make recommendations for their clinical use. Methods The literature review and draft position statement was compiled and circulated among the panel and relevant suggestions incorporated to reach consensus. This was discussed and finalized in an open forum during the SCS Annual Meeting, ISSICON. Results Preclinical evidence suggests safety and clinical potency of cellular interventions after SCI. However, evidence from clinical studies consisted of mostly case reports or uncontrolled case series/studies. Data from animal studies cannot be generalized to human SCI with regard to toxicity prediction after auto/allograft transplantation. Conclusions Currently, cellular/stem cell transplantation for human SCI is experimental and needs to be tested through a valid clinical trial program. It is not ethical to provide unproven transplantation as therapy with commercial implications. To stop the malpractice of marketing such "unproven therapies" to a vulnerable population, it is crucial that all countries unite to form common, well-defined regulations/legislation on their use in SCI.

AB  - Background: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has emerged as the forerunner among disease-modifying treatment options for early osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. However, no consensus is available regarding optimum dosing schedules. Purpose: To determine whether multiple injections of PRP (3 injections) provide better short-term and long-term results than a single injection of PRP in a guinea pig model of knee OA. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: 36 Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (weighing similar to 600-800 g) were chosen for this study. The animals were assigned to group DC (disease control group), group G1 (single-PRP group), and group G2 (multiple-PRP group) containing 10, 10, and 12 animals, respectively. Another 4 animals were used for preparation of allogenic PRP. Groups G1 and G2 received 1 and 3 injections of PRP, respectively, at weekly intervals in the intervention knee while the contralateral knee was injected with normal saline. Group DC received no intervention in either knee. Half of the animals from each group (subgroups DC.3, G1.3, and G2.3) were sacrificed at 3 months, and the remaining half (subgroups DC.6, G1.6, and G2.6) were sacrificed at 6 months after intervention. Both knee joints were harvested for histological assessment of articular cartilage and synovium. Results: The mean synovial scores for groups G1 and G2 were significantly better than those for group DC at 3 months. No difference was found between groups G1 and G2 at 3 months. At 6 months, group G2 had significantly better mean synovial scores than group G1 and group DC. The mean articular cartilage scores in group G2 were significantly better than those in group DC at 3 months. However, at 6 months, no significant difference was found among any of the groups in terms of mean articular scores. Conclusion: Both single and multiple injections of PRP exert similar anti-inflammatory effects on the synovium in the short term. However, this effect is sustained in the long term only for multiple injections. Multiple injections of PRP exert a chondroprotective effect, but only in the short term. This effect is not seen with a single injection of PRP.

AB  - Background: In an exploratory analysis of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) trial in children 6-35 months without risk factors for influenza, we evaluated clinical presentation of influenza illness and vaccine impact on health outcomes.
   Methods: This phase III trial was conducted in 13 geographically diverse countries across 5 influenza seasons (2011-2014). Children were randomized 1:1 to IIV4 or control. Active surveillance was performed for influenza-like episodes (ILE); influenza was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The total vaccinated cohort was evaluated (N = 12,018).
   Results: 5702 children experienced >= 1 ILE; 356 (IIV4 group) and 693 (control group) children had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza. Prevalence of ILE was similar in RT-PCR-positive and RT-PCR-negative cases regardless of vaccination. Breakthrough influenza illness was attenuated in children vaccinated with IIV4; moderate-to-severe illness was 41% less likely to be reported in the IIV4 group than the control group [crude odds ratio: 0.59 (95% confidence intervals: 0.44-0.77)]. Furthermore, fever >39 degrees C was 46% less frequent following vaccination with IIV4 than with control [crude odds ratio: 0.54 (95% confidence intervals: 0.39-0.75)] in children with breakthrough illness. Health outcome analysis showed that, each year, IIV4 would prevent 54 influenza cases per 1000 children and 19 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 new influenza case.
   Conclusions: In addition to preventing influenza in 50% of participants, IIV4 attenuated illness severity and disease burden in children who had a breakthrough influenza episode despite vaccination.

KW  - Strawberry Red Spot
KW  - Arterial Spin Labelling
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemangioblastomas of the optic nerve are very rare tumors. They occur in association with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome; however, sporadic occurrences have been reported. We describe here a case of optic nerve hemangioblastoma in the absence of VHL and review the pertinent literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old woman presented with gradually progressive vision loss in the right eye. On examination, the visual acuity on the right was hand movement close to face in all quadrants. Color discrimination was impaired. Fundoscopy revealed optic atrophy and no other retinal pathology. There was relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. No neurocutaneous markers were found. Imaging revealed lesion isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and showing relatively homogenous enhancement on postcontrast study. Multiple flow voids were seen in the intracranial part of the lesion. The proximal part of the intraorbital right optic nerve was enlarged and tortuous with distended optic nerve sheath. A right single-piece fronto-orbital craniotomy was done. A reddish lesion seen involving the right optic nerve just proximal to the chiasm with multiple vessels and a distinct feeding vessel was seen supplying the tumor. The lesion was excised and the optic nerve was sacrificed approximately 1 cm proximal to the chiasm. The postoperative course was uneventful.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Optic nerve hemangioblastoma is a rare occurrence and a high level of suspicion is required preoperatively in the absence of VHL syndrome.

AB  - BackgroundThere is reservation about accepting the notion of widespread vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in sunny countries because information base is largely urban indoors, and the cut-off serum 25(OH)D>75.0nmol/L to define sufficiency is perceived as high.
   ObjectiveWe assessed the vitamin D status of subjects engaged in six types of outdoor jobs with freedom to seek shade, when needed.
   DesignDescriptive observational study.
   Subjects and methodsA total of 573 outdoors, (hawkers, n=144; auto-rickshaw drivers, n=113; manual rickshaw pullers, n=49; fuel-station attendants, n=84; gardeners, n=96; traffic police personnel, n=87) were assessed for serum 25(OH)D, iPTH and total calcium during summer and winter. Bank employees were indoor controls (n=72). Serum 25(OH)D was defined as sufficient if >= 50.0nmol/L and deficient when <30.0nmol/L, as per Institute of Medicine'.
   ResultsMean serum 25(OH)D of 573 outdoors was 44.819.6nmol/L and showed a physiological inverse relation with iPTH (P<0.001). 77.5% of the outdoors did not have VDD. Hawkers, gardeners, fuel-station attendants and rickshaw pullers had sufficient or near sufficient serum 25(OH)D. The mean serum 25(OH)D (30.6 +/- 23.2nmol/L) of indoors though lower by 12.7nmol/L than outdoors was above the cut-off of VDD. Proportions with supranormal iPTH were comparable between outdoors and indoors (14.0% vs 20.8%). Despite winter dip, the mean serum 25(OH)D (31.2 +/- 14.3nmol/l) of outdoors was not deficient.
   ConclusionsVitamin D deficiency is not universal. Most urban outdoor workers do not have VDD.

AB  - Background: Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test is used for screening of transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) in blood donors. Consecutive reactive results in ELISA is due to sample/reagent carryover or donor related. In this study we tried to find out the possibilities of family history/close contacts with patients of hepatitis among these consecutive reactive donors.
   Aim To analyze the consecutive reactive results in ELISA tests for TTI testing on samples of healthy blood donors.
   Material and methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted from January 2016 to July 2018 in a tertiary care hospital, North India. Consecutive reactive results by fourth generation ELISA for TTIs screening were evaluated for possible reasons. Confirmation tests were not done. Reactive donors were contacted telephonically for relevant history of close contact with infected personnel.
   Results: Out of 53,740 donations 1,061 were reactive for TTIs during our study period. Prevalence of Hepatitis B (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) virus infection in blood donors were 1.27%, 0.20% and 0.50% respectively. Consecutive reactive results for HBV were 9.20% (63/685), for HCV 6.0% (16/266) and nil for HIV. There was no sample carryover in this. Out of 79 consecutive reactive donors 69 donated for same patients and 32 were related with infected patient which are statistically significant (p < 0.0001).
   Discussion: This study recommends that in analysis of consecutive positive results in ELISA along with looking for procedure/sample error, there is also a need to take retrospective history of donors for close contact with infected patients.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and/or obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) are frequently comorbid with schizophrenia, though the exact clinical and etiological relationship between them is poorly understood. Here we describe a case that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report of new-onset OCD in a patient who was receiving high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex as an adjuvant therapy for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Thisreport supports our understanding of OCD as a brain disorder involving hyperactivity of pre-frontal cortex and cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuit dysfunction.

AB  - Purpose To report patterns of uveitis in patients with systemic tuberculosis. Methods Records of patients presenting at uvea clinic of a tertiary eye care centre were evaluated retrospectively, and 47 cases with proven systemic tuberculosis were analyzed for patterns of uveitis. Tuberculosis had been proven with a combination of radio imaging and detection of acid fast bacilli in body fluids. All patients had been reviewed by a specialist as applicable before diagnosing tuberculosis. These patients had undergone a thorough ocular workup. Pattern of uveitis was the primary outcome measure. Results Mean age was 35.34 +/- 15.56 years. Lung was the commonest systemic focus, seen in nearly 75% of the cases. Anterior uveitis was the most common presentation (48.9%), followed by posterior (25.5%), panuveitis (10.6%) and intermediate uveitis (10.6%). Multifocal serpiginoid choroidopathy (MSC) was seen in only one patient, while granulomatous choroiditis was the commonest type of posterior uveitis. Conclusions Anterior uveitis is the most frequent type of uveitis seen in patients with proven systemic tuberculosis. Rarity of MSC in such patients indicates possibility of etiologies other than tuberculosis in causing MSC.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to investigate the concordance of dysglycaemia (prediabetes or diabetes) and cardiometabolic traits between women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and their spouses.
   Methods Using hospital medical records, women with GDM (diagnosed between 2012 and 2016) and their spouses were invited to participate in the study and to attend a scheduled hospital visit in a fasting state. Sociodemographic, anthropometric and medical data were collected, and a 75g OGTT with serum insulin estimation, HbA(1c) measurement and fasting lipid profile were performed at the visit. Prediabetes and diabetes were defined using ADA criteria and the metabolic syndrome was defined using IDF criteria.
   Results A total of 214 couples participated in the study. Women were tested at a mean SD age of 32.4 +/- 4.6 years and median (quartile [q]25-q75) of 19.5 (11-44) months following the index delivery, while men were tested at a mean +/- SD age of 36.4 +/- 5.4 years. A total of 72 (33.6%) couples showed concordance for dysglycaemia, while 99 (46.3%) and 51 (23.8%) couples were concordant for overweight/obesity and the metabolic syndrome, respectively. A total of 146 (68.2%) couples showed concordance for any of the above three factors. The presence of dysglycaemia in one partner was associated with an increased risk of dysglycaemia in the other partner (OR 1.80 [95% CI 1.04, 3.11]). Similarly, being overweight/obese (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.22, 3.93]) and presence of the metabolic syndrome (OR 2.01 [95% CI 1.16, 3.50]) in one partner was associated with an increased risk of these conditions in the other partner. Both women and men were more likely to have dysglycaemia if they had a partner with dysglycaemia. Women with a partner with dysglycaemia had a significantly higher BMI, waist circumference and diastolic BP, and a significantly higher probability of low HDL-cholesterol (<1.29 mmol/l) and the metabolic syndrome compared with women with a normoglycaemic partner. No such differences were observed for men with or without a partner with dysglycaemia.
   Conclusions/interpretation The high degree of spousal concordance found in this study suggests social clustering of glycaemic and cardiometabolic traits among biologically unrelated individuals. This provides us with an opportunity to target the behavioural interventions at the level of the married couple', which may be a novel and cost-effective method of combating the current diabetes epidemic.

AB  - Background & objectives: Thymomas are rare, but most common anterior mediastinal lesions. The histomorphologic spectrum of thymic epithelial tumours (TETs) in Indian population has not been explored in depth. This study was aimed to assess the histomorphology of TETs in the Indian patients and correlate clinical parameters with pathological features.
   Methods: It was a retrospective study conducted in a tertiary referral hospital in north India. All morphologically confirmed cases of TETs since 2009 were included. Clinical details and histology slides were reviewed using the Modified Masaoka-Koga staging system and WHO 2015 classification. Clinicopathological correlation and survival analysis were done. A comparative review from other published Indian studies was performed.
   Results: A total of 219 cases of TETs (138 resections and 81 biopsies) were identified. The most common histomorphologic type was B2, and the most frequent stage was L Types A/AB were common in older age (P<0.01). Clinically, higher stage tumours were found mostly in men (P<0.01), and these were Type B thymomas (P<0.01). Myasthenia gravis was more common in women (P<0.02) and in lower stages (P<0.05). Survival analysis revealed significant association between recurrence and tumour stage. Although thymic carcinoma was diagnosed on biopsy, no resectable case was identified.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed that the thymomas in Indian patients were most commonly Stage I tumours of B2 and AB histotypes. Resected thymic carcinomas were conspicuously absent in our study. More studies need to be done to establish the frequency and biology of TETs from India.

AB  - Sleep research has often focussed heavily on polysomnography while ignoring subjective sleep complaints of individuals, especially the young ones. Discordance has been seen between objective and subjective parameters of sleep among children and adolescents. There has been a trend towards worsening of sleep hygiene among adolescents, which may predispose to psychiatric disorders like depression. So, we compared the subjective sleep quality and sleep hygiene among depressed and normal adolescents. A sample of 31 depressed adolescents and 32 healthy controls were compared on sleep parameters using Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS), Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS) and School Sleep Habits Survey. Depressed adolescents were found to have significantly worse sleep quality [ASWS score 3.72 +/- 0.952 vs 4.79 +/- 0.552, p < 0.001], longer sleep onset latency [68.23 +/- 62.98 vs 19.53 +/- 19.48 minutes, p < 0.001], and shorter sleep duration [414.19 +/- 110.78 vs 498.28 +/- 56.86 minutes, p < 0.001]. Sleep quality significantly correlated with depression severity (measured on Children's Depression Rating Scale-revised), i.e., higher the severity of depression, poorer was the sleep quality (r = -0.605, p < 0.01). But sleep hygiene was statistically similar between the two groups [ASHS score 3.21 +/- 0.60 vs 3.36 +/- 0.51, p = 0.293], and was inadequate (< 3.8) among all adolescents irrespective of depression. Hence, despite the lack of evidence from objective sleep measures, there seem to be subjective sleep impairments among adolescents having depression. Future research needs to address the underlying etiological factors and causal directions for depression and sleep impairments among adolescents. Sleep hygiene education must be a part of broader primary prevention strategies for psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition in which affected individuals have difficulties while interacting and communicating socially, and repetitive behaviors. It has a multifactorial etiology. Various risk factors, including genetic and environmental influences, have been explored while trying to understand its causation. As older evidence was suggestive of a high heritability, a majority of research focused on finding the underlying genetic causes of autism. Due to these efforts, there have been advances in the knowledge of some of the genetic factors associated with autism. But a recent trend also shows an increasing interest in exploration of various potential environmental triggers. These efforts have brought us closer to understanding the elusive disorder more so than ever before. The current review discusses the recent trends in research exploring the etiopathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB), once widely prevalent throughout the world, experienced falling incidence rates in early twentieth century in developed nations, even before the introduction of anti-TB drugs, attributed to improved hygiene and living conditions. Active TB may develop following fresh infection or activation of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). LTBI is a state of persistent bacterial viability, however, the host stays asymptomatic and there is no evidence of clinically active tuberculosis. Therefore, treatment of all LTBI is considered as one of the ways to control tuberculosis. Diagnosis of LTBI relies on presence of immune-reactivity to TB antigen and commonly used tests include tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). At present there is no diagnostic test that can identify an individual with LTBI who will progress to develop active disease or remain asymptomatic. Therefore, it is unclear whom to treat. In the current scenario, treatment for LTBI is restricted to high risk groups which include under-5 y contacts of adults with pulmonary TB. Various regimens for treatment of LTBI are evolving and consist of isoniazid (INH) alone for 6-9 mo or combination of INH and rifampicin for 3-4 mo or once a week combination of rifapentin and INH for 3 mo. There is a need for research to identify LTBI, risk factors for progression of LTBI to active disease and a shorter regimen for treatment.

TI  - Impact of repeated blood pressure measurement on blood pressure categorization in a population-based study from India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN HYPERTENSION
KW  - HYPERTENSION
KW  - ADULTS
AB  - Often a single blood pressure (BP) measurement is used to diagnose and manage hypertension in busy clinics. However, repeated BP measurements have been shown to be more representative of the true BP status of the individual. Improper measurement of office BP can lead to inaccurate classification, overestimation of a patient's true BP, unnecessary treatment, and misinterpretation of the true prevalence of hypertension. There is no consensus among major guidelines on the number of recommended measurements at a single visit or the method of arriving at final clinic BP reading. The participants of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), a nationwide survey conducted in India from 2015 to 2016, were used for the analysis. The prevalence and median difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for single as well as combinations of two or more readings were calculated. Cross-tabulation was used to assess classification of individuals based on first BP reading compared with the mean of two or more BP measurements. There was a 63% higher prevalence of hypertension when only the first reading was considered for diagnosis in comparison to the mean of the second and third readings. A decrease of 3.6 mmHg and 2.4 mm Hg in mean SBP and DBP, respectively, was observed when the mean of the second and third readings was compared to the first reading. In those who are identified to have grade 1 or higher categories of hypertension, we recommend three BP measurements, with the mean of the second and third measurements being the clinic BP.

AB  - Objective To investigate gender discrimination in access to healthcare and its relationship with the patient's age and distance from the healthcare facility.
   Design and setting An observational study based on outpatient data from a large referral public hospital in Delhi, India.
   Participants Confirmed clinical appointments.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Estimates from the logistic regression are used to compute sex ratios (male/female) of patient visits with respect to distance from the hospital and age. Missing female patients for each state-a measure of the extent of gender discrimination-is computed as the difference in the actual number of female patients who came from each state and the number of female patients that should have visited the hospital had male and female patients come in the same proportion as the sex ratio of the overall population from the 2011 census.
   Results Of 2377028 outpatient visits, excluding obstetrics and gynaecology patients, the overall sex ratio was 1.69 male to one female visit. Sex ratios, adjusted for age and hospital department, increased with distance. The ratio was 1.41 for Delhi, where the facility is located; 1.70 for Haryana, an adjoining state; 1.98 for Uttar Pradesh, a state further away; and 2.37 for Bihar, the state furthest from Delhi. The sex ratios had a U-shaped relationship with age: 1.93 for 0-18 years, 2.01 for 19-30 years, and 1.75 for 60 years or over compared with 1.43 and 1.40 for the age groups 31-44 and 45-59 years, respectively. We estimate there were 402 722 missing female outpatient visits from these four states, which is 49% of the total female outpatient visits for these four states.
   Conclusion We found gender discrimination in access to healthcare, which was worse for female patients who were in the younger and older age groups, and for those who lived at increasing distances from the hospital.

AB  - Incisive search of innovative compounds for regulating pain, inflammation, and bone damage, with nominal side effects has focused on nutritional supplements. The endeavor of this research work was to investigate, for first time, the inhibitory effect of pomegranate rind extract in established models of nociception and inflammation. Pomegranate (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) and indomethacin (3 mg/kg) was assessed in eddy's hot plate-induced algesia, carrageenan, and Complete Freund's adjuvant-induced models in Wistar rats. Results of study conclude that pomegranate at a dose of 200 mg/kg showed significant (p < 0.001) reduction in paw swelling in both inflammatory experimental models. In addition, observations recorded a significant (p < 0.05) increase in nociceptive threshold. Henceforth, we might say that pomegranate (200 mg/kg) decline pain and inflammation by downregulating the activation of TNF-R1, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, NF-kappa B, oxidative stress markers, and tissue histology. Practical applications The research work represents the first report on inhibitory mechanism of NF-kappa B by pomegranate rind extract, enriched in tannins and flavanoids. The findings of the study provide satisfactory evidence of pomegranate rind in amelioration of adjuvant-induced arthritis. Pomegranate rind, being enrich in bioactive compounds like phenolics and flavanoids possess potent antioxidant activity that might contribute in attenuating rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - Acute liver failure (ALF) caused by hepatitis A is a rare but fatal disease. Here, we developed a model to predict outcome in patients with ALF caused by hepatitis A. The derivation set consisted of 294 patients diagnosed with hepatitis A-related ALF (ALFA) from Korea, and a validation set of 56 patients from Japan, India, and United Kingdom. Using a multivariate proportional hazard model, a risk-prediction model (ALFA score) consisting of age, international normalized ratio, bilirubin, ammonia, creatinine, and hemoglobin levels acquired on the day of ALF diagnosis was developed. The ALFA score showed the highest discrimination in the prediction of liver transplant or death at 1 month (c-statistic, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.92) versus King's College criteria (KCC; c-statistic, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.53-0.59), U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group index specific for hepatitis A virus (HAV-ALFSG; c-statistic, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.76), the new ALFSG index (c-statistic, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.84), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD; c-statistic, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.84), and MELD including sodium (MELD-Na; c-statistic, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84) in the derivation set (all P < 0.01). In the validation set, the performance of the ALFA score (c-statistic, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94) was significantly better than that of KCC (c-statistic, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.79), MELD (c-statistic, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.87), and MELD-Na (c-statistic, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85) (all P < 0.05), and better, but not statistically significant, than that of the HAV-ALFSG (c-statistic, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90; P = 0.28) and new ALFSG indices (c-statistic, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93; P = 0.41). The model was well-calibrated in both sets. Conclusion: Our disease-specific score provides refined prediction of outcome in patients with ALF caused by hepatitis A.

AB  - Introduction: There are 2 standard techniques of laparoscopic groin hernia repair, totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP) and transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP). TEP has the advantage that the peritoneal cavity is not breached but is, however, considered to be more difficult to master when compared with TAPP. We describe herein our experience of TEP repair of inguinal hernia over the last 14 years. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all patients with groin hernia who underwent TEP repair in a single surgical unit between January 2004 and January 2018. Patients' demographic profile and hernia characteristics (duration, side, extent, content, and reducibility) were noted in the prestructured proforma. Clinical outcomes included the operation time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, length of postoperative hospital stay, hernia recurrence, chronic pain, recurrence, seroma, and wound infections. Long-term follow-up was carried out in the outpatient department. Results: Over the last 14 years, TEP repair was performed in 841 patients and a total of 1249 hernias were repaired. The mean age of patients was 50.7 years. There were 748 primary and 345 unilateral hernias. The majority were direct (61%) inguinal hernias. Telescopic dissection was the commonest method of space creation. The average operating time was 54.8 and 77.9 minutes for unilateral and bilateral hernias, respectively. With 81 conversions, the success rate for TEP was 93.5%. Seroma was the most common postoperative complication seen in 81 patients. The incidence of chronic groin pain was 1.4%. The follow-up ranged from 3 months to 10 years, and there were only 3 recurrences (<1%). Conclusion: In conclusion, TEP repair is an excellent technique of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with acceptable complications after long-term follow-up.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this article is to describe the normal anatomy of the root of the small bowel mesentery (RSBM) as well as the multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) features of the various primary and secondary lesions that affect the RSBM.ResultsThe small bowel mesentery attaches the jejunum and ileum to the posterior abdominal wall, the line of attachment forming the RSBM. Several primary as well as secondary lesions involve the RSBM. The RSBM has anatomical contiguity with the mesocolon and other peritoneal ligaments, which forms a route for the spread of infection, neoplasms as well as several other abdominal pathologies. MDCT plays an important role in the evaluation of mesenteric root lesions.ConclusionFamiliarity with the lesions involving the RSBM and their characteristic appearances on MDCT is important in giving thoughtful differential diagnosis and guiding the treating physician in further management.

AB  - Objective: To assess the correlation between fetal blood vessel Doppler measurements and fetal anemia among Rhesus isoimmunized pregnancies after two intrauterine transfusions as a potential guide to therapy.
   Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among 30 women who attended a single hospital in India between April 2, 2015 and October 30, 2016. The participants underwent a third intrauterine transfusion based on a middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) of greater than 1.50 multiples of the median (MoM). Cordocentesis was performed before the third intrauterine transfusion and hematocrit values correlated with the blood vessel Doppler measurements.
   Results: The MCA PSV MoM and fetal hematocrit MoM had a correlation coefficient of -0.43 (95% confidence interval -0.68 to 0.08; P=0.017). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 68%, 57%, 83%, and 33%, respectively. The descending aorta PSV delta and fetal hematocrit delta had a correlation coefficient of -0.54 (95% confidence interval -0.75 to -0.23; P=0.001). An area under the curve of 0.80 (standard error 0.085; P=0.017) had 87% sensitivity and 57% specificity for diagnosing fetal anemia.
   Conclusion: The descending aorta PSV could offer a useful diagnostic adjunct to MCA PSV after two intrauterine transfusions.

AB  - Introduction Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can be considered the epidemic of the 21st century. Particularly, the predicted growth in the size of elderly populations in low-income and middle-income countries is expected to produce a dramatic surge in dementia prevalence and incidence. Although a rising burden of dementia presents an urgent challenge for India, previous efforts to study dementia in the country have relied on non-representative samples in geographically restricted regions. The Harmonised Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD) will provide rich, population-representative data on late-life cognition and dementia and their risk factors for the first time in India.
   Methods The LASI-DAD will recruit a sample of 3000 people aged 60+ years. Their family members or friends, whom respondents nominate as informants, participate in the computer-assisted personal interview. The study sample is drawn from the ongoing, nationally representative Longitudinal Aging Study in India, a multipurpose panel survey of aging. We aim to collect rich data on cognitive and neuropsychological tests, informant reports, and epidemiological data through a comprehensive geriatric assessment, and venous blood collection and assays. For a subsample, we collect neuroimaging data. Data collection is currently in progress in 14 States and Union Territories of India. Clinicians will provide clinical consensus diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the Indian Council of Medical Research and all collaborating institutions. Anonymised data will be available for the larger research community through a secured website hosted by the Gateway to Global Aging Data platform. Research findings from the LASI-DAD team will be disseminated through journal publications and presentations at professional conferences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: India has a high traumatic brain injury (TBI) burden and intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) remains controversial but some patients may benefit.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between ICP monitor placement and outcomes, and identify Indian patients with severe TBI who benefit from ICP monitoring
   METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study at a level 1 Indian trauma center. Patients over 18 yr with severe TBI (admission Glasgow coma scale score < 8) who received tracheal intubation for at-least 48 h were examined. Propensity-based analysis using inverse probability weighting approach was used to examine ICP monitor placement within 72 h of admission and outcomes. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge, 3, 6, and 12 mo. Death, vegetative, or major impairment defined unfavorable outcome.
   RESULTS: The 200 patients averaged 36 [18 to 85] yr of age and average injury severity score of 31.4 [2 to 73]. ICP monitors were placed in 126 (63%) patients. Patients with ICP monitor placement experienced lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted relative risk [aRR]; 0.50 [0.29, 0.87]) than patients without ICP monitoring. However, there was no benefit at 3, 6, and 12 mo. With ICP monitor placement, absence of cerebral edema (aRR 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.84), and absence of intraventricular hemorrhage (aRR 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.82) were associated with reduced unfavorable outcomes.
   CONCLUSION: ICPmonitor placement without cerebrospinal fluid drainage within 72 h of admission was associated with reduced in-patient mortality. Patients with severe TBI but without cerebral edema and without intraventricular hemorrhage may benefit from ICP monitoring.

AB  - We report results on unsupervised organization of cervical cells using microscopy of Pap-smear samples in brightfield (3-channel color) as well as high-resolution quantitative phase imaging modalities. A number of morphological parameters are measured for each of the 1450 cell nuclei (from 10 woman subjects) imaged in this study. The principal component analysis (PCA) methodology applied to this data shows that the cell image clustering performance improves significantly when brightfield as well as phase information is utilized for PCA as compared to when brightfield-only information is used. The results point to the feasibility of an image-based tool that will be able to mark suspicious cells for further examination by the pathologist. More importantly, our results suggest that the information in quantitative phase images of cells that is typically not used in clinical practice is valuable for automated cell classification applications in general.

AB  - Fenestrations are rare but well-known arterial anatomic variations in which a segment of artery divides into two parallel channels that reunite distally. Although fenestrations as such are asymptomatic, they have gained clinical significance because of their association with aneurysms and other intracranial vascular pathologies. Here we present a 35-year-old woman with history of sudden severe occipital headache and vomiting. Imaging revealed a ruptured aneurysm in the distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery arising from one of the limbs of the fenestration. The aneurysm was successfully managed by coiling, and the patient made complete recovery without neurological sequelae.

AB  - Background The aim of the present study was to systematically review and analyze the available evidence on the role of surgery in improving outcomes in patients with migraine headaches. Methods An electronic search of PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Google Scholar databases was performed for English-language articles reporting results of peripheral nerve surgery for migraine headaches. Results The search strategy revealed a total of 1528 records, of which 23 studies were included in the review. A total of 1151 headache patients were treated in the included studies. The trigger site of migraine addressed varied across studies. Meta-analysis of data of 616 patients revealed that migraine surgery significantly reduces migraine headache frequency (random: mean, 9.52; 95% confidence interval, 7.14-11.9; P < 0.00001; I-2 = 94%). Similarly, when data of 797 patients were analyzed, there was statistically significant reduction in migraine headache intensity in patients undergoing migraine headache surgery (random: mean, 3.97; 95% confidence interval, 3.31-4.62; P < 0.00001; I-2 = 94%). On pooling of data of all 23 studies, 8.3% to 76.4% of patients reported complete elimination of headache after surgery, whereas 3.9% to 33.3% had no relief. Conclusions Peripheral nerve decompression surgery is highly effective in reducing migraine headache frequency and migraine headache intensity. However, not all patients benefit from the surgical procedure, with a small subset showing no improvement. Further clinical and anatomical studies are needed to define the exact mechanism of nerve compression in migraine patients and as to why a subset of patients does not respond to surgical treatment.

AB  - Background In a significant percentage of patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), cytology samples represent the only source of tumor tissue. Ancillary immunocytochemistry (ICC) for neuroendocrine markers is an important adjunct for the diagnosis of SCLC. Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a novel neuroendocrine marker proposed as an economical single-marker alternative to the traditional 3-marker panel of chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. To the authors' knowledge, limited studies have evaluated INSM1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the diagnosis of SCLC and reported high sensitivities and specificities. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of INSM1 ICC on direct smears (DS) from patients with SCLC in comparison with IHC on small biopsies (SBs). Methods All available DS and SBs from patients with SCLC who were diagnosed over the previous year were retrieved. Immunostaining for INSM1 was performed on alcohol-fixed DS and formalin-fixed SBs wherever available. A total of 10 DS and SBs from patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma were included for comparison. Nuclear staining for INSM1 in >= 1% tumor cells was interpreted as positive. Results Among a total of 60 patients with SCLC who were included in the current study, a total of 37 underwent INSM1 IHC on SBs and 36 underwent INSM1 ICC on DS. ICC was noninterpretable in 3 DS due to necrosis. The sensitivity of INSM1 IHC was 97% (36 of 37 cases) whereas the sensitivity of INSM1 ICC was 91% (30 of 33 cases) for the diagnosis of SCLC. Among matched IHC and ICC results available for 11 patients, 91% of cases (10 of 11 patients) demonstrated concordant IHC-ICC staining. All cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma were negative for INSM1 (100% specificity). Conclusions INSM1 appears to be a robust and reliable ICC marker for the confirmation of SCLC diagnosis on cytology smears.

AB  - Background: IgG4-related disease is an autoimmune process that presents with tumefactive lesions characterized by storiform fibrosis, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4+ plasma cells, obliterative phlebitis, and often elevated serum IgG4 levels. Central nervous system IgG4-related disease is very rare and usually occurs in the form of hypertrophic pachymeningitis or hypophysitis. Presentation as a large solitary meningioma-like mass with overlying hyperostosis in a young adult has not been reported before. Case summary: A 16-year-old male presented with focal seizures for 5 months. Imaging showed a large, extra-axial, and contrast-enhancing mass lesion in the left frontoparietal region with focal calvarial thickening. Histopathology revealed a fibrosclerotic lesion involving dura with a polymorphic infiltrate of plasma cells, mature lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional eosinophils. Immunohistochemical workup excluded the possibilities of meningioma, lymphoproliferative neoplasms, and histiocytic lesions. Majority of plasma cells were IgG4+ rendering a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. Further serological and imaging workup did not reveal any evidence of systemic involvement. His serum IgG4 levels were normal. Considering a gross total resection of the lesion, no further treatment was given and the patient has been asymptomatic since. Conclusion: IgG4-related lesions of the CNS are under-recognized and accurate diagnosis, especially in those with isolated CNS disease and normal serum IgG4 levels, necessitates robust histopathological and laboratory workup to exclude mimics. They may occur as large dural masses with hyperostosis and differentiation from lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningiomas, in particular, can be challenging. While steroids are the mainstay of treatment in IgG4-related disease, surgical resection may be curative in solitary lesions presenting with compressive symptoms.

AB  - PurposeHigh mortality rate due to liver cirrhosis has been reported over the globe in the previous years. Early detection of cirrhosis may help in controlling the disease progression toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The lack of trained CT radiologists and increased patient population delays the diagnosis and further management. This study proposes a computer-aided diagnosis system for detecting cirrhosis and HCC in a very efficient and less time-consuming approach.MethodsContrast-enhanced CT dataset of 40 patients (n=40; M:F=5:3; age=25-55years) with three groups of subjects: healthy (n=14), cirrhosis (n=12) and cirrhosis with HCC (n=14), were retrospectively analyzed in this study. A novel method for the automatic 3D segmentation of liver using modified region-growing segmentation technique was developed and compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning-based technique. Further, histogram parameters were calculated from segmented CT liver volume for classification between healthy and diseased (cirrhosis and HCC) liver using logistic regression. Multi-phase analysis of CT images was performed to extract 24 temporal features for detecting cirrhosis and HCC liver using support vector machine (SVM).ResultsThe proposed method produced improved 3D segmentation with Dice coefficient 90% for healthy liver, 86% for cirrhosis and 81% for HCC subjects compared to the deep learning algorithm (healthy: 82%; cirrhosis: 78%; HCC: 70%). Standard deviation and kurtosis were found to be statistically different (p<0.05) among healthy and diseased liver, and using logistic regression, classification accuracy obtained was 92.5%. For detecting cirrhosis and HCC liver, SVM with RBF kernel obtained highest slice-wise and patient-wise prediction accuracy of 86.9% (precision=0.93, recall=0.7) and 80% (precision=0.86, recall=0.75), respectively, than that of linear kernel (slice-wise: accuracy=85.4%, precision=0.92, recall=0.67; patient-wise: accuracy=73.33%, precision=0.75, recall=0.75).ConclusionsThe proposed computer-aided diagnosis system for detecting cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) showed promising results and can be used as effective screening tool in medical image analysis.

AB  - Background: Women living with HIV (WLH) in rural communities face challenges to obtaining treatment and accurate disease-related information. Nutritional deficits exacerbate disease progression.
   Setting: WLH were recruited from primary health centers in rural India.
   Method: A quasi-experimental trial of a comprehensive Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha)-supported intervention compared 4 distinct Asha-based programs [(1) standard education (SE) alone; (2) nutrition education (+NE); (3) nutrition supplements (+NS); or (4) nutrition education and nutrition supplements (+NENS)] on key disease and nutrition-related outcomes [CD4 count, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, and hemoglobin]. Assessments occurred at baseline, and months 6 (immediately after intervention), 12, and 18. Multilevel modeling examined effects of program (group) over time.
   Findings: Among 600 WLH enrolled (n = 150 per arm), mean age, CD4 count, and BMI (kg/m(2)) were 34.31, 447.42, and 20.09, respectively, at baseline. At 18-month follow-up, program 4 (+NENS) experienced greatest improvements in CD4 counts compared with program 1 (+SE) [adjusted difference = 223.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 170.29 to 277.32]. For BMI, programs 3 (+NS; adjusted difference = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.39 to 3.26) and 4 (+NENS; adjusted difference = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3.12) exhibited greater gains compared with program 1 (+SE). Programs 3 and 4 were not significantly different from each other (adjusted difference = -0.18, 95% CI: -1.12 to 0.76). Hemoglobin and serum albumin also improved over time; program 4 (+NENS) exhibited the greatest gains.
   Conclusions: A low-cost Asha-supported behavioral and nutritional intervention improved outcomes for WLH. Gains were sustained at 18-month follow-up. Similar approaches may help improve HIV and other infectious disease-related outcomes in vulnerable populations.

AB  - The Asia-Pacific Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease was established in Cebu, Philippines, under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific Association of Gastroenterology with the goal of improving inflammatory bowel disease care in Asia. This consensus is carried out in collaboration with Asian Organization for Crohn's and Colitis. With biologic agents and biosimilars becoming more established, it is necessary to conduct a review on existing literature and establish a consensus on when and how to introduce biologic agents and biosimilars in conjunction with conventional treatments for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in Asia. These statements also address how pharmacogenetics influences the treatments of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and provides guidance on response monitoring and strategies to restore loss of response. Finally, the review includes statements on how to manage treatment alongside possible hepatitis B and tuberculosis infections, both common in Asia. These statements have been prepared and voted upon by members of inflammatory bowel disease workgroup employing the modified Delphi process. These statements do not intend to be all-encompassing, and future revisions are likely as new data continue to emerge.

AB  - Background To report the experience with sternomastoid (SM) myofascial flap for reconstruction/buttressing of lateral pharyngeal wall and floor of mouth defects following transoral onco-surgery. Methods Prospectively collected data from February 2012-January 2018. SM flap harvested as a superiorly based flap supplied by the occipital artery and consisting of only the anterior SM head. Results A total of 42 patients were included (TORS, n = 40; TOUSS, n = 2). Three of 42 patients developed transient pharyngo-cervical communications with subsequent spontaneous healing. Flap loss was not noted in any patient. Forty-one of 42 patients resumed normal swallowing and one patient was PEG dependent. Fifteen of 42 patients had pretreatment metastatic neck nodes. No patient however developed nodal recurrence over a median follow-up of 30 months. Conclusion The modified SM flap as reported here is a simple locally available reconstructive option when undertaking transoral surgery. Oncological concerns may however limit its use in situations with large nodal metastasis or extracapsular spread.

AB  - Indians, a rapidly growing population, constitute vast genetic heterogeneity to that of Western population; however they have become a sedentary population in past decades due to rapid urbanization ensuing in the amplified prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MetS in 10,093 Indian individuals (6617 MetS and 3476 controls) of Indo-European origin, that belong to our previous biorepository of The Indian Diabetes Consortium (INDICO). The study was conducted in two stages-discovery phase (N = 2158) and replication phase (N = 7935). We discovered two variants within/near the CETP gene-rs1800775 and rs3816117-associated with MetS at genome-wide significance level during replication phase in Indians. Additional CETP loci rs7205804, rs1532624, rs3764261, rs247617, and rs173539 also cropped up as modest signals in Indians. Haplotype association analysis revealed GCCCAGC as the strongest haplotype within the CETP locus constituting all seven CETP signals. In combined analysis, we perceived a novel and functionally relevant sub-GWAS significant locus-rs16890462 in the vicinity of SFRP1 gene. Overlaying gene regulatory data from ENCODE database revealed that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16890462 resides in repressive chromatin in human subcutaneous adipose tissue as characterized by the enrichment of H3K27me3 and CTCF marks (repressive gene marks) and diminished H3K36me3 marks (activation gene marks). The variant displayed active DNA methylation marks in adipose tissue, suggesting its likely regulatory activity. Further, the variant also disrupts a potential binding site of a key transcription factor, NRF2, which is known for involvement in obesity and metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Buckling surgery is one of the common procedures performed by the retinal surgeons for visual rehabilitation at the earliest in cases of retinal detachment. The optimal surgical skill in this section can only be achieved with repeated practices and clinical experiences. Here, we describe an easy and inexpensive way to perform, practice, and refine surgical skills by demonstrating this complicated surgery in a simple manner on goat's eyes. The advantages of this technique are real-tissue handling experiences and repeatability of the procedure with almost similar practical implications. Thus, whenever feasible, every attempt should be made to refine the residents or budding ophthalmologists surgical skills by undertaking this technique in their routine curriculum.

AB  - Objective: Prognostic scores help in predicting mortality and functional outcome post intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We aimed to validate the ICH and ICH-GS scores in a cohort of Indian patients with ICH and observe the impact of any surgical intervention on prognostication. Methods: This was an ambispective observational study of primary ICH cases enrolled between January 2014 and April 2018. Observed mortality on ICH and ICH GS scores for the entire cohort and individually for the medically and surgically managed patients was compared to the published mortality in the original derivation cohorts. Results: 617 patients, (464 retrospective and 153 prospective) of ICH were included. In hospital mortality and 30-day mortality was 28.7% and 28.5% respectively. There was a significant association of increasing mortality with increasing ICH and ICH-GS scores. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve for 30-day mortality was 75.9% and 74.1% for ICH and ICH-GS scores respectively. However, mortality observed at individual scores was significantly less than previously reported. Among the surgically intervened patients (n = 265), both the expected mortality at baseline and discriminative ability of ICH and ICH-GS scores for 30-day mortality was significantly reduced following surgical intervention (ROC in surgically intervened groups: 59.9 (52.6-67.2) and 63(56-70) for ICH and ICH-GS scores respectively). Conclusions: Although ICH and ICH-GS scores are valid in Indian population, mortality at individual scores is lower than previously reported. Mortality prediction using ICH and ICH GS scores is significantly modified by surgical interventions. Thus, newer prognostic tools which incorporate surgical intervention need to be developed and validated in future.

AB  - Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) is a biochemical alteration with plasma levels of homocysteine higher than 15 mu nol/L, associated with atherosclerosis, and with vascular thrombosis by disrupting endothelial cells. Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid derived from methionine which is an essential amino acid. Excess homocysteine produced in the body is expelled out by liver and kidney from the systemic circulation. Hhcy is caused by the excess deficiencies of the vitamins like pyridoxine (B6), folic acid (B9), or cyanocobalamin (B12). High protein consumers are usually at risk for hyperhomocysteinemia because of low plasma B12 levels. It is approximated that mild Hhcy occurs in 5-7% of the general population and 40% in patients with vascular disease. Patients with heart failure, impaired renal function, and diabetes should be screened since the prevalence of Hhcy in these patients appears to be quite high. In this article, we hypothesise that citicoline is a novel drug for the management of Hhcy. Furthermore, the side effects of citicoline are also minimal and self-limiting. If this strategy is validated, citicoline will be the cost-effective way to be administered for Hhcy. Many evidences are available which suggest that ignoring homocysteine levels in patients with the vascular disease would be unwise. Thus, there is an urgent need for health care providers to develop effective preventions and interventions program (folic acid, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 supplementation as well as lifestyle change) to reduce this disorder.

AB  - BackgroundAcute variceal bleeding (AVB) in patients with cirrhosis is associated with high mortality, ranging from 12 to 20% at 6weeks. The existing prognostic models for AVB lack precision and require further validation.AimIn this prospective study, we aimed to develop and validate a new prognostic model for AVB, and compared it with the existing models.MethodsWe included 285 patients from March 2017 to November 2017 in the derivation cohort and 238 patients from December 2017 to June 2018 in the validation cohort. Two prognostic models were developed from derivation cohort by logistic regression analysis. Discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC).ResultsThe 6-week mortality was 22.1% in derivation cohort and 22.3% in validation cohort, P=0.866. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) [odds ratio (OR) 1.106] and encephalopathy (E) (OR 4.658) in one analysis and Child-Pugh score (OR 1.379) and serum creatinine (OR 1.474) in another analysis were significantly associated with 6-week mortality. MELD-E model (AUROC 0.792) was superior to Child-creatinine model (AUROC) in terms of discrimination. The MELD-E model had highest AUROC; as compared to other models-MELD score (AUROC 0.751, P=0.036), Child-Pugh score (AUROC 0.737, P=0.037), D'Amico model (AUROC 0.716, P=0.014) and Augustin model (AUROC 0.739, P=0.018) in derivation cohort. In validation cohort, the discriminatory performance of MELD-E model (AUROC 0.805) was higher as compared to other models including MELD score (AUROC 0.771, P=0.048), Child-Pugh score (AUROC 0.746, P=0.011), Augustin model (AUROC 0.753, P=0.039) and D'Amico model (AUROC 0.736, P=0.021).ConclusionIn cirrhotic patients with AVB, the novel MELD-Encephalopathy model predicts 6weeks mortality with higher accuracy than the existing prognostic models.

AB  - Bipolar disorder is a chronic psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of elevated/irritable and depressed moods resulting in the loss of more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) than other major conditions. The neurocognitive impairments in these patients interfere with sustained goal-directed performance and achievement even during the euthymic phase of the illness.
   Methodology: The study aimed to explore the neurocognitive profile of patients in their euthymic phase. We matched 30 patients diagnosed with Bipolar Affective Disorder (BD) in the age range of 20-40 years with 30 healthy controls (with no axis I or II diagnosis, assessed on MINI) matched on age, gender, and education. The neurocognitive profile was assessed using NIMHANS Neuropsychology Battery.
   Results: Euthymic phase patients with bipolar disorder had statistically significant low scores on the speed of processing information as compared to healthy controls. Although impaired in BD group, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on executive functions and memory.
   Conclusion: The findings of the study suggest that cognitive retraining aimed at ameliorating these deficits can be a used as an essential intervention in rehabilitation programs to successfully reintegrate patients with the bipolar affective disorder into the society. The research also indicates that despite the symptomatic recovery between the episodes, impairments in the speed of processing information continue to disrupt performance in patients with Bipolar Disorder.

AB  - Purpose: To report an atypical case of Cogan-Reese syndrome associated with iris cyst in a young adult male.
   Methods: Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination, swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) and ultrasound bio-microscopy (UBM) were done to evaluate and characterize the nature of the iris cyst. Gonioscopy, specular microscopy and confocal microscopy were attempted, but unsuccessful due to the large corneal opacity.
   Results: On slit-lamp biomicroscopy, a large nasal corneal opacity with overlying band-shaped keratopathy was noted, with history suggestive of a trivial non-penetrating trauma and likely healed corneal ulcer. Through the temporal clear cornea, the iris displayed altered pattern with overlying shiny membrane and multiple, small, discrete, hyperpigmented, irregular nodules suggestive of Cogan-Reese syndrome. On the nasal side, an iris cyst with typical 'stuck-on appearance' onto the endothelium was visible. ASOCT and UBM failed to show any evidence of epithelial downgrowth or Descemet membrane disintegrity, ruling out the possibility of a post-traumatic implantation iris cyst.
   Conclusion: The occurrence of iris cyst in this case of Cogan-Reese syndrome is unique, and could be related to the disease pathogenesis, or a rare co-incidental finding.

T2  - CORNEA
KW  - infective keratitis
KW  - Stevens-Johnson syndrome
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the microbiological profile and outcome in cases with infective keratitis in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).
   Methods: Eighty-three eyes of 68 patients with SJS presenting with microbial keratitis were recruited and managed with standard antimicrobial therapy.
   Results: Microbial keratitis developed in 34% of patients with SJS (83 eyes, 68 patients) over a period of 5 years. Four eyes (4.8%) had a history of concurrent topical steroid use at the onset of keratitis. Mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity was 1.8 +/- 0.9 logMAR units. The site of corneal ulceration was central in 52 eyes (62.6%), paracentral in 17 eyes (20.5%), and peripheral in 14 eyes (16.8%). The mean ulcer area was 3.9 +/- 2.7 mm(2). Approximately 15 of 24 (62.5%) culture-positive eyes had bacterial infection, most of which (80%) were caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Polymicrobial infection was noted in 7 of 24 eyes (29.1%). Although 57 of 83 (68.6%) eyes healed with medical therapy, 26 of 83 (31.3%) eyes had corneal perforation and were managed with cyanoacrylate glue application (30.7%) or therapeutic keratoplasty (69.3%). Systemic infection as an inciting factor of SJS and an early presentation for keratitis were the major risk factors associated with corneal perforation. Large mean ulcer size, paracentral ulcers, and punctal involvement were associated with a good visual outcome.
   Conclusions: Infective keratitis in SJS is common, and unlike routine cases, surgical intervention is often required. However, the antibiotic sensitivity pattern suggests that resistance is not that high.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: To describe the outcomes of tuck-in tenon patch graft (TPG) in the management of corneal perforation up to 5-mm size.
   Methods: Thirty-one cases of sterile corneal perforation (3-5 mm) underwent autologous TPG. The technique included, freshening of the edges, measuring the size of defect, creating a 360-degree stromal pocket around the perforation margin, harvesting the tenon graft followed by tucking into the stromal pocket, and application of cyanoacrylate glue or suturing the graft using 10-0 monofilament nylon suture. The main outcome measure was rate of healing (percentage of cases healed).
   Results: The mean age was 52.3 +/- 8.9 years with 22 male and 9 female patients. The various etiologies of corneal perforation included trauma (n = 10), neurotrophic keratitis (n = 11), and peripheral ulcerative keratitis (n = 10). The mean size of corneal perforation was 4.2 +/- 0.6 mm (range 3-5 mm). The mean duration of epithelial healing was 25.7 +/- 6.7 days. Best-corrected visual acuity improved from 1.8 6 0.4 to 1.2 +/- 0.4 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units at 4 weeks after surgery (P <= 0.01). Twenty-seven (87.1%) cases healed with formation of a leucomatous scar at 16.9 +/- 2.7 weeks, whereas 4 cases had a flat anterior chamber. In three-fourths of the cases, a corneal graft was performed. In one case, graft resuturing was performed for post-op aqueous leak, which healed with the formation of a corneo-iridic scar.
   Conclusions: TPG is a safe, simple, inexpensive, and an effective technique for the management of corneal perforations. The advantages include the autologous nature of the graft, cost effectiveness, and easy availability.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of two techniques, for preparation of microkeratome-assisted ultrathin grafts for Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Methods: The study involved 20 eyes of 20 patients with pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, randomized into two groups. Group 1 eyes underwent microkeratome-assisted DSAEK using the single-pass technique for lenticule preparation, whereas group 2 eyes underwent microkeratome-assisted DSAEK using the double-pass technique. Patients were followed up till 6 months, postoperatively. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at final follow-up was considered as the primary outcome measure, whereas graft thickness (GT) contrast sensitivity and endothelial cell loss were considered as the secondary outcome measures. A P value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Baseline characteristics of two groups were comparable. The mean central GT was comparable in both groups at 6 months follow-up [group 1: 98 +/- 24.46 mu m, group 2: 129 +/- 31.46 mu m (P = 0.18)]. Both groups fared equally in terms of BCVA (P = 0.33). Contrast sensitivity was significantly better in group 1 eyes (P = 0.045). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between postoperative BCVA and postoperative GT (R = -0.728, P = 0.016). The percentage endothelial cell loss was slightly higher in group 2 eyes, although not statistically significant. Two eyes in group 2 experienced complications during lenticule preparation. None of the eye experienced any complication in the postoperative period. Conclusion: Both techniques provided grafts with comparable thickness and endothelial cell loss and were associated with comparable BCVA, at final follow-up visit. The contrast sensitivity was, however, better in eyes receiving grafts prepared with the single-pass technique.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Acinetobacter isolates responsible for nosocomial meningitis/ventriculitis in the neurosurgical ICU. The authors also sought to identify the risk factors for mortality following Acinetobacter meningitis/ventriculitis.
   METHODS This was a retrospective study of 72 patients admitted to the neurosurgical ICU between January 2014 and December 2018 with clinical and microbiological diagnosis of nosocomial postneurosurgical Acinetobacter baumanii meningitis/ventriculitis. Electronic medical data on clinical characteristics, underlying pathology, CSF cytology, antibiotic susceptibilities, and mortality were recorded. To evaluate the outcome following nosocomial postneurosurgical Acinetobacter meningitis/ventriculitis, patients were followed up until discharge or death in the hospital. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute factors affecting survival.
   RESULTS The study population was divided into two groups depending on the final outcome of whether the patient died or survived. Forty-three patients (59.7%) were included in the survivor group and 29 patients (40.3%) were included in the nonsurvivor group. Total in-hospital mortality due to Acinetobacter meningitis/ventriculitis was 40.3% (29 cases), with a 14-day mortality of 15.3% and a 30-day mortality of 25%. The 43 (59.7%) patients who survived had a mean length of hospital stay of 44 +/- 4 days with a median Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score at discharge of 6. On univariate analysis, age > 40 years (p = 0.078), admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 8 (p = 0.003), presence of septic shock (p = 0.011), presence of external ventricular drain (EVD) (p = 0.03), CSF white blood cell (WBC) count > 200 cells/mm(3) (p = 0.084), and comorbidities (diabetes, p = 0.036; hypertension, p = 0.01) were associated with poor outcome. Carbapenem resistance was not a risk factor for mortality. According to a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, age cutoff of 40 years (p = 0.016, HR 3.21), GCS score cutoff of 8 (p = 0.006, HR 0.29), CSF WBC count > 200 cells/mm(3) (p = 0.01, HR 2.76), presence of EVD (p = 0.001, HR 5.42), and comorbidities (p = 0.017, HR 2.8) were found to be significant risk factors for mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS This study is the largest case series reported to date of postneurosurgical Acinetobacter meningitis/ventriculitis. In-hospital mortality due to Acinetobacter meningitis/ventriculitis was high. Age older than 40 years, GCS score less than 8, presence of EVD, raised CSF WBC count, and presence of comorbidities were risk factors for mortality.

AB  - Goals: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of point of care tests (POCTs) for diagnosing celiac disease (CD). Background: Recently, POCTs for CD have been developed and are commercially available. Studies have reported significant variability in their sensitivity (70% to 100%) and specificity (85% to 100%). Study: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE databases, and the Cochrane library through June 2017. Positive reference test was defined as villous atrophy along with positive celiac-specific serology and/or clinical improvement after gluten-free diet. Normal duodenal biopsy was defined as negative reference test. Bivariate random-effect model was used to present the summary estimates of sensitivities and specificities along with 95% confidence regions We assessed methodologic quality using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool. Results: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all POCTs (based on tTG or DGP or tTG+Anti-gliadin antibodies) for diagnosing CD were 94.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 89.9-96.5] and 94.4% (95% CI, 90.9-96.5), respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios for POCTs were 16.7 and 0.06, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for IgA-tTG-based POCTs were 90.5% (95% CI, 82.3-95.1) and 94.8% (95% CI, 92.5-96.4), respectively. Conclusions: The pooled sensitivity and specificity of POCTs in diagnosing CD are high. POCTs may be used to screen for CD, especially in areas with limited access to laboratory-based testing. Further research assessing the diagnostic accuracy of individual POCTs and comparing it with other available POCTs is needed.

AB  - Key summary pointsAimTo use an index based on blood biomarkers (serum creatinine and cystatin c) to screen sarcopenia in older adults.FindingsLower value of Biochemical Total Body Muscle mass index (TBMM) (calculated from serum creatinine and cystatin C) was significantly associated with higher risk of sarcopenia.MessageBiochemical Total Body Muscle Mass index based on serum creatinine and cystatin C can be used to screen sarcopenia in older people. AbstractPurposeConsidering the clinical impact of sarcopenia, it would be interesting to get a rapid and sensible screening tool. We conducted a cross-sectional study with the motive to use an index based on serum creatinine and cystatin C to screen sarcopenia in older people in outpatient settings.Methods100 participants above the age of 65years were recruited from the outpatient department of Geriatric medicine of a tertiary care hospital in India. Muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance were measured by DXA scan, hand-held dynamometer and 4m gait speed, respectively. Sarcopenia was identified using Asian working group of sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria. Serum creatinine and cystatin C were measured for all participants. Serum creatinine/cystatin C ratio and biochemical total body muscle mass index (TBMM) were calculated and its association was checked with sarcopenia.ResultsThe prevalence of sarcopenia was 53%. Mean serum creatinine/cystatin C ratio was 74.7924.91. It was not significantly associated with sarcopenia. Mean biochemical TBMM index of participants was 36.40 +/- 7.88 (males-38.77 +/- 7.72, females-31.22 +/- 5.13). The lower value of biochemical TBMM index was significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia (p<0.01). Cut-off value of 40.9 in males (sensitivity-79.41%; specificity-61.76%) and 32.2 in females (sensitivity-78.95%; specificity-66.67%) was proposed for identification of sarcopenia.Conclusion Out of the two indices, only low biochemical total body muscle mass index is significantly associated with sarcopenia and a value of less than 40.9 in males and 32.2 in females can be used to screen sarcopenia in older people.

AB  - Aedes albopictus (Skuse 1894) is prevalent in the urban/peri-urban Port Blair, posing a public health threat, during past outbreaks of chikungunya (2006) and dengue (2010). Despite its vector potential, information on the biology is scanty. Therefore, impact of temperature on survival of immature stages, under laboratory conditions, was studied on F-1 population of Andamans. Ae. albopictus larvae were exposed to static temperatures viz. 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C, 41 degrees C, 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C, and the lethal time to cause 50% (LT50) and 90% mortality (LT90) was computed. To assess adaptive thermotolerance, larvae exposed (37 degrees C and 39 degrees C) were re-exposed to higher temperatures (43 degrees C and 45 degrees C). All larvae survived at 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C for the entire exposure period of 420min, while variable mortality was observed at 41 degrees C, 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Larvae re-exposed to 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C showed an increase in thermotolerance with respect to non-adapted larvae. The results are discussed in the context of survival, development and distribution.

AB  - Background & objectives: The models for implementation of antibiotic stewardship programme (ASP) in the acute care settings of developing countries are lacking. In most of the hospitals, patient turnover is high and a proper system for recording antibiotic-related information and tracking hospital-acquired infections is not in place. This pilot study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India to assess the feasibility of implementation of an ASP in a Medicine unit and to evaluate the effect of implementation as per the criteria applicable in this set up.
   Methods: A pre-post-quasi-experimental non-randomized study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, current practices in the Medicine wards were observed. In the second phase, the ASP was implemented in a single Medicine unit, along with prospective audit and feedback, tracking of the process, as well as outcome measures. Patient risk stratification, blood culture on day one, day 3 bundle, dose optimization, de-escalation and intravenous to oral conversion of antibiotics were the key elements focused upon.
   Results: There was a significant improvement in the appropriateness of antibiotic prescription (66 vs. 86%, P<0.001) and reduction in the mean number of antibiotics used per person (4.41 vs. 3.86, P<0.05) along with decrease in the duration of hospital stay (17 vs. 14 days, P<0.05). There was a significant improvement in sending of blood cultures on day one during the stewardship phase (P<0.001).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The ASP approach used in our pilot study may be feasible and beneficial. However, it needs further confirmation in other settings and on a large scale.

Water and wet soil samples from the periphery of ponds used by the community were collected from districts of Purulia of West Bengal and Champa of Chhattisgarh, India. Samples were processed and decontaminated followed by culturing on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) media. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using 16S rRNA gene target of mycobacteria and species was confirmed by sequencing method. Indirect immune-fluorescent staining of M. leprae from soil was performed using M. leprae-PGL-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using MEGA-X software. From 380 soil samples 86 NTM were isolated, out of which 34(40%) isolates were rapid growing mycobacteria (RGM) and 52(60%) isolates were slow growing mycobacteria (SGM). Seventy-seven NTM isolates were obtained from 250 water samples, out of which 35(45%) were RGM and 42(55%) were SGM. Amongst all the RGM, we isolated M. porcinum, M. psychrotolerans, M. alsenase, M. arabiense and M. asiaticum from Indian environmental samples. M. fortuitum was the most commonly isolated species of all RGM. Out of all SGM, M. holsaticum, M. yongonense, M. seoulense, M. szulgai, M. europaeum, M. simiae and M. chimaera were isolated for the first time from Indian environment. M. intracellulare was the commonest of all isolated SGM. Presence of M. leprae was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent microcopy and PCR method from the same environmental samples. Phylogenetic tree was showing a close association between these NTMs and M. leprae in these samples. Several NTM species of pathogenic and nonpathogenic in nature along with M. leprae were isolated from soil and pond water samples from leprosy endemic regions and these might be playing a role in causing disease and maintaining leprosy endemicity in India.

AB  - Deregulated mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis have been studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); yet, the relevance of mitochondrial-encoded gene expression on AML outcomes is unknown. This study was conducted to assess clinical significance of expression of mitochondrial-encoded genes, namely ND3, SDHB, Cytochrome b, Cytochrome C, and ATP6, in pediatric AML. Pediatric AML patients from July 2013 to June 2016 were enrolled in this prospective study. Relative genes expression was determined using real-time PCR, and expressed as fold change. 123 AML patients were enrolled, median age 10 (range 0.7-18years). ND3 gene expression was significantly increased in poor-risk cytogenetics (P=0.03). In univariate analysis, high ND3 and ATP6 gene expression was significantly associated with inferior EFS (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively) and OS (P=0.02 and P=0.01, respectively), whereas, in multivariate analysis, ND3 gene expression emerged as the only independent prognostic factor for EFS and OS (P=0.04 and P=0.03). ND3 gene expression is a significant predictor of EFS and OS in pediatric AML, and should be evaluated as a potential biomarker.

AB  - In this paper, we developed a mathematical model to find the parameters of prosthetic damper which will provide a similar trajectory for the prosthetic knee joint. Two popular searching methods namely grid searching and optimization are used to determine the damper's parameters. The proposed model is validated with a simulation process using the data of the able-body individuals. We utilized the ground reaction force of sound limb to determine the values of the damper parameters of a prosthetic knee joint for maximum symmetry. Symmetry between knee moments was also improved in the stance period with optimized parameters. Finally, optimization-based searching was observed to be more computationally efficient than the grid-based searching method. The present study will provide a virtual solution to set the prosthetic dampers parameters based on user needs. In the future, the present method can be used for adjusting damping of microprocessor prosthetic knee joint for symmetrical gait pattern. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Head to head comparison between neurology residents and a mobile medical application for diagnostic accuracy in cognitive neurology
T2  - QJM-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
KW  - PERFORMANCE
KW  - ERROR
AB  - Background: A novel Mobile Medical Application (App) App was created on iOS platform (Neurology Dx (R)) to deduce Differential Diagnoses (DDx) from a set of user selected Symptoms, Signs, Imaging data and Lab findings. The DDx generated by the App was compared for diagnostic accuracy with differentials reasoned by participating neurology residents when presented with same clinical vignettes.
   Methods: Hundred neurology residents in seven leading Neurology centers across India participated in this study. A panel of experts created 60 clinical vignettes of varying levels of difficulty related to Cognitive neurology. Each neurology resident was instructed to formulate DDx from a set of 15 cognitive neurology vignettes. Experts in Cognitive Neurology made the gold standard DDx answers to all 60 clinical vignettes. The differentials generated by the App and neurology residents were then compared with the Gold standard.
   Results: Sixty clinical vignettes were tested on 100 neurology residents (15 vignettes each) and also on the App (60 vignettes). The frequency of gold standard high likely answers accurately documented by the residents was 25% compared with 65% by the App (95% CI 33.1-46.3), P < 0.0001. Residents correctly identified the first high likely gold standard answer as their first high likely answer in 35% (95% CI 30.7-36.6) compared with 62% (95% CI 14.1-38.5), P < 0.0001.
   Conclusion: An App with adequate knowledge-base and appropriate algorithm can augment and complement human diagnostic reasoning in drawing a comprehensive list of DDx in the field of Cognitive Neurology (CTRI/2017/06/008838).

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Several clinical studies have shown the efficacy of Lu-177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The purpose of this article is to present results of a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at compiling and outlining efficacy and safety data on Lu-177-PSMA RLT for mCRPC across all studies published to date.
   CONCLUSION. The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that Lu-177-PSMA RLT is an effective treatment of advanced-stage mCRPC that is refractory to standard therapeutic options and that it has a low toxicity profile. High-level evidence from randomized control trials is crucial for confirming the effectiveness of Lu-177-PSMA RLT and for instituting this therapy in the routine clinical care of patients with mCRPC.

AB  - The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the comparative efficacy of 12 week yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) and dietary intervention (DI) alone on adipokines, inflammation, and oxidative stress in Indian adults with metabolic syndrome (Met S). A parallel, two arm, RCT was conducted in Integral Health Clinic (IHC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India from 2012 to 2014. IHC is an outpatient facility conducting YBLI programs for prevention and management of chronic diseases. Two hundred sixty men and women (20-45 years) visiting the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital were diagnosed with Met S and randomized 1:1 to receive 12 week YBLI (n = 130) or DI (n = 130). Primary outcomes were change in plasma levels of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and leptin:adiponectin ratio), markers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6), markers of oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS], 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 12 weeks. YBLI group showed a significant decrease in leptin, leptin:adiponectin ratio, IL-6, 8-OHdG, and TBARS levels, whereas there was a significant increase in adiponectin and SOD levels. No significant changes were noticed in DI alone group. YBLI showed significantly greater reduction in TBARS levels than in DI group, suggestive of reduced oxidative stress in adults with Met S. A 12 week YBLI had a positive impact on oxidative stress versus DI alone in adults with Met S.

AB  - Background and PurposeThe computed tomography angiography (CTA) spot sign is widely used to assess the risk of hematoma expansion following acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, not all patients can receive intravenous contrast nor are all hospital systems equipped with this technology. We aimed to independently validate the Hematoma Expansion Prediction (HEP) Score, an 18-point non-contrast prediction scale, in an external cohort and compare its diagnostic capability to the CTA spot sign.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of the predicting hematoma growth and outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage using contrast bolus CT (PREDICT) Cohort Study. Primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (>= 6mL or >= 33%). We generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparing the HEP score to significant expansion. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) for each score point. We determined independent predictors of significant hematoma expansion via logistic regression.ResultsA total of 292 patients were included in primary analysis. Hematoma growth of >= 6mL or >= 33% occurred in 94 patients (32%). The HEP score was associated with significant expansion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.30). ROC curves comparing HEP score to significant expansion had an area under the curve of 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71). Youden's method showed an optimum score of 4. HEP Scores >= 4 (n=100, sensitivity 49%, specificity 73%, PPV 46%, NPV 75%, aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.09-3.64) accurately predicted significant expansion. PPV increased with higher HEP scores, but at the cost of lower sensitivity. The diagnostic characteristics of the spot sign (n=82, Sensitivity 49%, Specificity 81%, PPV 55%, NPV 76%, aOR 2.95, 95% CI 1.61-5.42) were similar to HEP scores >= 4.ConclusionThe HEP score is predictive of significant expansion (>= 6mL or >= 33%) and is comparable to the spot sign in diagnostic accuracy. Non-contrast prediction tools may have a potential role in the recruitment of patients in future intracerebral hemorrhage trials.

AB  - Cribriform Adenocarcinoma of Minor Salivary Glands (CAMSG) is a recently recognized, distinct neoplasm of minor salivary gland origin. Its histological and cytological features show considerable overlap with other head and neck cancers like papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Presence of cribriform and glomeruloid structures, metachromatically staining matrix, and a lack of colloid can help distinguish CAMSG from PTC.

AB  - Background
   There is limited information related to health behaviors and their related factors among young men in rural setting of India. This study was conducted to investigate multiple health risk behaviors and outcomes among young men aged 18-24 years in rural India.
   Methods
   This was a community-based cross-sectional survey conducted in the Ballabgarh block of Faridabad district, Haryana, India. Information regarding socio-demographic details, substance use, injury & violence, mental health and sexual behaviors were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule. Age adjusted prevalence estimates of behaviors and outcomes are computed along with 95% Confidence Intervals. Mediation analysis was carried out to examine relationships between socio-demographic variables, select behaviors and outcomes reported in the study.
   Results
   A total of 836 young men participated in the study, with mean (SD) age of 20.6 (1.9) years. The age-adjusted prevalence (with 95% Confidence Interval) for ever use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances was 34.2% (33.9, 34.5), 23.4% (23.2, 23.6), and 4.5% (4.4, 4.5), respectively. Loneliness and suicidal thoughts were reported by 237 and 35 youth men with age adjusted prevalence as 28.6%, 95% CI: 28.4-28.8 and 4.3%, 95% CI: 4.23-4.31, respectively. A total of 330 young men met serious injury in past one year (prevalence 39.3%, 95% CI: 39.01-39.67). Almost one-third of men (prevalence 30.6%, 95% CI: 30.34-30.85) had engaged in pre-marital sexual intercourse. Current substance use was found to be significant mediator for associations with socio-demographic variables studied for dependent variables viz. pre-marital sexual intercourse and serious injury.
   Conclusion
   High prevalence of various risk behaviors and outcomes was found in young men aged 18-24 years in our rural setting. It is imperative that multi-component health intervention package be rolled out to address these.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the effectiveness of Hatha yoga therapy is comparable to conventional therapeutic exercises (CTEs) for reducing back pain intensity and back-related dysfunction in patients with chronic nonspecific low-back pain (CNLBP). Design: The study was a prospective randomized comparative trial, divided into two phases: an initial 6-weekly supervised intervention period followed by a 6-week follow-up period. Settings: This study was conducted at Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Centre for Integrative Medicine and Research of a tertiary care hospital. Subjects: Patients between 18 and 55 years of age with complaint of CNLBP persisting >= 12 weeks with pain rating >= 4 on a numerical rating scale (0-10). Intervention: A total of six standardized 35-min weekly Hatha yoga sessions (yoga group) and similarly 35-min weekly sessions of CTEs (CTE group), designed for people with CNLBP unaccustomed to structured yoga or CTE program. Participants were asked to practice on nonclass days at home. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measures were Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) (0-10) and 24-point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ). Secondary outcomes were pain medication usage per week and a postintervention Perceived recovery (Likert seven-point scale) of back-related dysfunction. Outcomes were recorded at the baseline, 6-week follow-up, and 12-week follow-up. Results: Seventy subjects were randomized to either yoga (n = 35) or CTE group (n = 35). Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat, with last observation carried forward. Both yoga and the CTE group have shown significant improvement in back pain intensity and back-related dysfunction within both the groups at 6- and 12-week follow-ups compared to baseline. No statistically significant differences in the pain intensity (DVPRS; at 6 weeks: n = 35, difference of medians 1.0, 95% confidence interval [-5.3 to 3.0], p = 0.5; at 12 weeks: n = 35, 0.0 [-4.2 to 5.0], 0.7) and back-related dysfunction (RDQ; at 6 weeks: n = 35, 1.0 [-9.6 to 10.6], 0.4; at 12 weeks: n = 35, 0.0 [-8.8 to 10.6], 0.3) were noted between two groups. Improvements in pill consumption and perceived recovery were also comparable between the groups. Conclusion: Yoga provided similar improvement compared with CTEs, in patients with CNLBP.

AB  - Rationale A variety of inhaled antigens have been implicated to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). We observed that children force-fed with lentil-based weaning food had persistent respiratory symptoms and radiology similar to HP. Objectives To describe the clinical features of lentil HP. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of records of children with lentil HP attending Pediatric Chest Clinic at a tertiary care hospital in North India from 2008-2018. We included case records with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific for lentil antigen. Measurements and Main Results Nine children (seven boys) were identified with median (IQR) age of onset of symptoms and diagnosis at 9 (6, 12) and 11 (10, 16) months, respectively. Chronic cough (100%), shortness of breath (89%), fever (78%), vomiting (56%), and wheezing (33%) were common symptoms. Fine crackles were heard in 33% of children, none had clubbing. CT scans showed nodular opacities and consolidation in 78% and 67% children, respectively. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed increased neutrophils and lymphocytes (67% and 33%, respectively). All children showed rapid remission with systemic steroids (prednisolone), starting at a median dose of 1 (1, 1.1) mg kg(-1) day(-1). One child had a clinical relapse which was treated with oral steroids again. IgG specific to lentil antigens was elevated in children with lentil HP (21->200 mgA/L) compared with children with other chronic respiratory illnesses (n = 7, <2-11.4 mgA/L). Conclusions Lentil aspiration is an important cause of HP in infants of weaning age with force-feeding practices. Further studies are needed to identify aspirated antigens which cause HP in aspiration prone children.

AB  - Despite the high global prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection, datasets covering the whole hepatitis B viral genome from large patient cohorts are lacking, greatly limiting our understanding of the viral genetic factors involved in this deadly disease. We performed deep sequencing of viral samples from patients chronically infected with HBV to investigate the association between viral genome variation and patients' clinical characteristics. We discovered novel viral variants strongly associated with viral load and HBeAg status. Patients with viral variants C1817T and A1838G had viral loads nearly three orders of magnitude lower than patients without those variants. These patients consequently experienced earlier viral suppression while on treatment. Furthermore, we identified novel variants that either independently or in combination with precore mutation G1896A were associated with the transition from HBeAg positive to the negative phase of infection. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that mutation of the HBeAg open reading frame is an important factor driving CHB patient's HBeAg status. This analysis provides a detailed picture of HBV genetic variation in the largest patient cohort to date and highlights the diversity of plausible molecular mechanisms through which viral variation affects clinical phenotype.

AB  - Born small for gestational age due to undernutrition in utero and subsequent catch-up growth is associated with risk of developing chronic diseases in adulthood. Telomere length has been shown to be a predictor of these age-related diseases and may be a link between birth size, a surrogate for foetal undernutrition, and adult chronic diseases. We assessed the relationship of leukocyte telomere length in adult life with birth outcomes and serial change in body mass index (BMI) from birth to adulthood. Leukocyte relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by MMqPCR in 1,309 subjects from New Delhi Birth Cohort who participated in two phases of the study between 2006-2009 (Phase 6) and 2012-2015 (Phase 7) at a mean age of 39.08 (+/- 3.29), and its association with birth outcomes and conditional BMI gain at 2, 11, and 29 years was assessed in a mixed regression model. We did not find any significant association of RTL with body size at birth including birthweight, birth length, and birth BMI. Gestational age was positively associated with RTL (P = .017, multivariate model: P = .039). Conditional BMI gain at 2 and 11 years was not associated with RTL. BMI gain at 29 year was negatively associated with RTL in multivariate model (P = .015). Born small for gestational age was not associated with RTL in adulthood. Leukocyte telomere attrition was observed in those born before 37 weeks of gestational age as well as in those who gained weight as adults, which may predispose to chronic diseases.

AB  - BackgroundIndigenous communities retain knowledge of the land and food resources rooted in historical continuity within their region of residence. Food systems research can be leveraged to identify strategies to encourage sustainable use of complex multi-species agroforestry systems by indigenous communities contributing to nutritional needs while simultaneously preserving the ecosystems and their benefits to society. Till date, the analyses of food systems have predominantly focused on high income countries often overlooking the alternatives (dietary and production) that would be most relevant to low and middle income countries (LMIC). Thus, innovative methodological approaches are needed to comprehensively characterize diverse food systems in LMICs with special reference to indigenous communities.DesignThis protocol paper describes a food systems approach that will be employed to understand diverse and dynamic food systems of vulnerable tribal communities of Jharkhand, India and leverage their agroforestry systems to improve dietary diversity, nutrition status and address food security. Four tribal groups namely Santhal, Ho, Munda and Sauria Paharia of Godda, West Singhbhum and Khunti districts of Jharkhand would be studied.This will be an exploratory cross-sectional study design, along with a longitudinal component to capture seasonality in dietary intakeand agricultural diversity. A mixed methods approach will be used based on a conceptual framework on drivers of food systems, food supply chain, food environment (both wild & cultivated, and market food environments), as well as consumer behaviour and maternal and child health outcomes in tribal communities. The quantitative surveys will be conducted on socio-economic, demographic profile of households, their availability of, access to and utilization of food environment and nutritional status of reproductive age group women and children under 5years. Qualitative enquiries will examine barriers and facilitators to increase sustainable production, procurement and consumption of indigenous foods. The final outcome would be development of interventions to promote indigenous food consumption.DiscussionBy utilizing a combination of value chain analysis and Optifoods linear programming software' that will use above information on indigenous community, dietary intake, nutritional status and food environment, evidence based interventions promoting indigenous food systems aimed at addressing food and nutritional security of tribal communities will be developed.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the role of topical chloroquine (CHQ) as an adjunct to topical lubricants in the management of mild-moderate dry eye disease (DED) Methods: Prospective comparative pilot study allocated 150 patients with symptoms of mild to moderate DED to receive topical CMC 0.5% three times a day (group I, n = 75) or topical CHQ 0.03% twice a day with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) 0.5% three times a day (group II, n = 75), for three months. Primary outcome measures were ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score and conjunctival impression cytology at 3 months. Secondary outcome measures were TBUT, Schirmer's test, ocular surface staining and any adverse effects at 3 months. Follow up was performed at 1 and 3 months. Results: At three months, the OSDI score was significantly better in the CHQ group as compared with the CMC group (CMC-18.36 +/- 4.03 (SD), CHQ group- 15.9 +/- 5.18 (SD); p = .002). Nelson's score was 0.92 +/- 0.69 (SD) in the CHQ group as compared with 1.60 +/- 0.77 (SD) in the CMC group (p < .001). Abnormal impression cytology was observed in 20% cases in the CHQ group as compared with 61.3% cases in CMC group (p < .001). A significant correlation was observed between Nelson's score and OSDI (Spearman's rho correlation coefficient 0.414, p < .001). TBUT, Schirmer test and ocular surface staining were significantly better in the CHQ group (p < .001). No adverse effects were observed in any group. Conclusion: Topical chloroquine is a useful adjunct to topical lubricants in the management of DED as it decreases the underlying chronic inflammation and helps maintain ocular surface stability.

AB  - Aims In left-sided infective endocarditis (IE), a large vegetation >10mm is associated with higher mortality, yet it is unknown whether surgery during the acute phase opposed to medical therapy is associated with improved survival. We assessed the association between surgery and 6-month mortality as related to vegetation size.
   Methods and results Patients with definite, left-sided IE (2008-2012) from The International Collaboration on Endocarditis prospective, multinational registry were included. We compared clinical characteristics and 6-month mortality (by Cox regression with inverse propensity of treatment weighting) between patients with vegetation size <= 10mm vs. >10mm in maximum length by surgical treatment strategy. A total of 1006 patients with left sided IE were included; 422 with a vegetation size <= 10mm (median age 66.0 years, 33% women) and 584 (median age 58.4 years, 34% women) patients with a large vegetation >10 mm. Operative risk by STS-IE score was similar between groups. Embolic events occurred in 28.4% vs. 44.3% (P < 0.001), respectively. Patients with a vegetation >10mm was associated with higher 6-month mortality (25.1% vs. 19.4% for small vegetation, P = 0.035). However, after propensity adjustment, the association with higher mortality persisted only in patients with a large vegetation >10mm vs. <= 10 mm: hazard ratio (HR) 1.55 (1.27-1.90); but only in patients with large vegetation managed medically [HR 1.86 (1.48-2.34)] rather than surgically [HR 1.01 (0.69-1.49)].
   Conclusion Left-sided IE with vegetation size >10mm was associated with an increased mortality at 6 months in this observational study but was dependent on treatment strategy. For patients with large vegetation undergoing surgical treatment, survival was similar to patients with smaller vegetation size.

AB  - Over the last decade autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has emerged as the standard of care in the management of Multiple Myeloma (MM). However, the cases of early relapse (within 36 months) after the stem cell rescue remains a significant challenge. For a lot of practical purposes, it is crucial to identify whether a patient undergoing ASCT falls into the high-risk group (likely to relapse within 36 months) or a low risk one. Our analysis showed that existing MM staging systems (International Staging System or ISS and Durie Salmon Staging or DSS) are not sufficient to discriminate between the risk groups significantly. To address this, we gathered a total of 39 clinical and laboratory parameters of 347 patients from the Department of Medical Oncology of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). We employed a stacked machine learning model consisting spectral clustering and Fast and Frugal Tree (FFT) technique to come up with a 3-factor multivariate 2-stage staging scheme, which turns out to be extremely decisive about the outcome of the stem cell rescue. Our model comes up with a three-factor (1. if patients has relapsed following remission, 2. response to induction, 3. pre-transplant Glomerular Filtration Rate or GFR) staging scheme. The resulting model stratifies patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with markedly distinct progression-free (median survival - 24 months vs. 91 months) and overall survival (median survival -51 months vs. 135 months) patterns.

AB  - AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ligand-gated channels made up of combinations of GluA1-4 subunits encoded by GRIA1-4 genes. GluA2 has an especially important role because, following post-transcriptional editing at the Q607 site, it renders heteromultimeric AMPARs Ca2+-impermeable, with a linear relationship between current and trans-membrane voltage. Here, we report heterozygous de novo GRIA2 mutations in 28 unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID) and neurodevelopmental abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome-like features, and seizures or developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In functional expression studies, mutations lead to a decrease in agonist-evoked current mediated by mutant subunits compared to wild-type channels. When GluA2 subunits are co-expressed with GluA1, most GRIA2 mutations cause a decreased current amplitude and some also affect voltage rectification. Our results show that de-novo variants in GRIA2 can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, complementing evidence that other genetic causes of ID, ASD and DEE also disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

AB  - Oral diseases, including dental caries, periodontitis, and edentulism (toothlessness), affect about 3.5 billion people worldwide. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the oral health status and treatment needs of government employees employed at an organization in New Delhi. Oral health information was recorded using the standard World Health Organization's (WHO) Oral Health Assessment Tool. A total of 476 employees at various levels of administration were screened at their worksite. Dental caries and periodontal disease were present in more than half of the participants. Around 56% had decayed teeth, 20% had missing teeth, and 16% had filled teeth. Bleeding from gums was seen in 71% and periodontitis in 59% of participants. Preventive treatment and oral health promotion was required in at least 41% of the screened individuals. Annual workplace oral examinations may help in decreasing the oral disease burden and create awareness on the oral health among employees.

AB  - Background
   Although most Indians live in rural settings, data on cardiovascular disease risk factors in these groups are limited. We describe the association between socioeconomic position and cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large rural population in north India.
   Methods
   We performed representative, community-based sampling from 2013 to 2014 of Solan district in Himachal Pradesh. We used education, occupation, household income, and household assets as indicators of socioeconomic position. We used tobacco use, alcohol use, low physical activity, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We performed hierarchical multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and clustering of the health sub-centers, to evaluate the cross-sectional association of socioeconomic position indicators and cardiovascular disease risk factors.
   Results
   Among 38,457 participants, mean (SD) age was 42.7 (15.9) years, and 57% were women. The odds of tobacco use was lowest in participants with graduate school and above education (adjusted OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.09, 0.13), household income >15,000 INR (adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.29, 0.43), and highest quartile of assets (adjusted OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.24, 0.34) compared with other groups but not occupation (skilled worker adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74, 1.16). Alcohol use was lower among individuals in the higher quartile of income (adjusted OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64, 0.88) and assets (adjusted OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59, 0.82). The odds of obesity was highest in participants with graduate school and above education (adjusted OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.85, 2.94), household income > 15,000 Indian rupees (adjusted OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.63, 2.19), and highest quartile of household assets (adjusted OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.39, 3.45). The odds of prevalent hypertension and diabetes were also generally higher among individuals with higher socioeconomic position.
   Conclusions
   Individuals with lower socioeconomic position in Himachal Pradesh were more likely to have abnormal behavioral risk factors, and individuals with higher socioeconomic position were more likely to have abnormal clinical risk factors.

AB  - A new isatin-triazole tethered rhodamine based fluorescent probe R1 (1-(2''-(4'-(((3''',6'''-bis(diethylamino)-3''-oxospiro[isoindoline-1'',9'''-xanthen]-2''-yl)amino)methyl)-1H-1',2',3'-triazolyl)ethyl)indoline-2,3-dione) has been synthesized using click chemistry approach. Probe R1 exhibits a dual sensor property for Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions through turn-on fluorescence response. A prominent colour change from colourless to pink allows the naked eye identification of aforementioned metal ions. R1 forms a 1:2 complex with Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions with binding constants 8.0 x 10(8) and 2.93 x 10(7) M-2, respectively. The binding mode is scrutinised through various spectroscopic techniques which is further supported by theoretical calculations. The detection limit of R1 for Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions is found to be 12.2 nM and 0.33 mu M, respectively. Further, R1 has been evaluated for its potential to detect Cu2+ ions in biological systems using fluorescence cell imaging studies.

AB  - The study aimed to explore the relationship of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) exon 3 (Tyr113His) and exon 4 (His139Arg) polymorphisms and predicted mEH activity with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk. 482 histologically confirmed cases and equal number of matched controls were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Conditional logistic regression models were used to examine the association of polymorphisms with ESCC. We noted exon 3 slow genotype (OR = 6.57; CI 3.43-12.57) as well as predicted low mEH activity (OR = 3.99; CI 2.32-6.85) was associated with the ESCC risk. Elevated ESCC risk estimates were seen in smokers independent of genotypes but the association was stronger among smokers with exon 3 variant (OR = 6.67; 3.29-13.53) and low activity (OR = 7.52; CI 3.46-16.37) genotypes. Positive family history of cancer synergistically increased ESCC risk in the individuals who harbored exon 3 (OR = 13.59; CI 5.63-32.81) or altered mEH activity genotypes (OR = 13.35; CI 5.10-34.94). Significant interaction was seen between mEH exon 3 and exon 4 genotypes (P = 0.006) and between predicted mEH activity and positive family history of cancer (P = 0.018). These findings suggest association of ESCC risk with mEH polymorphisms which get modified by tobacco smoking and positive family history of cancer.

AB  - Although the interplay between endogenous opioids and dopamine (DA) in the basal ganglia (BG) is known to underlie diverse motor functions, few studies exist on their role in modulating speech and vocalization. Vocal impairment is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), wherein DA depletion affects striosomes rich in mu-opioid receptors (mu-ORs). Symptoms of opioid addiction also include deficiencies in verbal functions and speech. To understand the interplay between the opioid system and BG in vocalization, we used adult male songbirds wherein high levels of mu-ORs are expressed in Area X, a BG region which is part of a circuit similar to the mammalian thalamocortical-basal ganglia loop. Changes in DA, glutamate and GABA levels were analyzed during the infusion of different doses of the IL-OR antagonist naloxone (50 and 100 ng/ml) specifically in Area X. Blocking mu,-ORs in Area X with 100 ng/ml naloxone led to increased levels of DA in this region without altering the number of songs directed toward females (FD). Interestingly, this manipulation also led to changes in the spectro-temporal properties of FD songs, suggesting that altered opioid modulation in the thalamocortical-basal ganglia circuit can affect vocalization. Our study suggests that songbirds are excellent model systems to explore how the interplay between mu-ORs and DA modulation in the BG affects speech/vocalization.

AB  - Internalized stigma among individuals with substance use disorders is a major barrier for accessing mental health services. This study aimed to assess internalized stigma among individuals with substance use disorders and to assess the relationship of internalized stigma with the quality of life. This cross-sectional study recruited 201 patients with a clinical diagnosis of at least opioid or alcohol use disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 at a public-funded tertiary care center in India. The study participants were interviewed using a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMIS), and the World Health Organization's Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref) questionnaire. Seven participants (3.5% of the sample) had mild stigma according to ISMI scores, 62 (30.8%) had moderate stigma, and 132 (65.7%) had severe stigma. The various quality-of-life domains generally had a negative correlation with the internalized stigma scores. Participants using opioids as the primary substance of use were more likely to have severe internalized stigma. The experience of internalized stigma and dissatisfaction with quality of life is quite high among people suffering with substance use disorders in India. These results emphasize the need for interventions to reduce internal perception of stigma and improve the quality of life of individuals with substance use disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Central venous catheters (CVCs) implanted in patients with malignancies may often be associated with local or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), which are a major source of morbidity and rarely mortality, making such patients' care difficult and complicated. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study is a single-centre's experience including both paediatric and adult patients with malignancy, who had a CVC inserted and were receiving care at cancer centre of our hospital over a period between January 2017 and June 2018. Results: In the period from January 2017 to June 2018, 73 confirmed cases of CLABSIs among cancer patients were included in this study. The rate of CLABSIs was estimated as 2.1 episodes/1000 CVC days. Out of 73 CLABSI cases, Gram-negative bacilli were the predominant causative agents of CLABSI constituting 72.6% (n = 53/73) of isolated organisms, 21.9% (n = 16/73) of infections were caused by Gram-positive cocci while polymicrobial infections accounted for 5.4% (n = 4/73) of these cases. Conclusion: Over the last 20 years, an epidemiologic shift has occurred among CLABSI in cancer patients. These findings should be considered with the development of interventions that will prevent Gram-negative CLABSI after CVC insertion. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting data on the incidence of CLABSIs in cancer patients at tertiary care hospital from North Indian hospital.

AB  - Routine investigation for recurrent pregnancy loss includes measurement of antiphospholipid antibodies. The lupus anticoagulant has long been associated with increased risks for thrombosis and adverse obstetric outcomes. But there are some disadvantages with lupus anticoagulant (LAC) tests which includes varied sensitivity of different clot based assays. ISTH recommends only 2 assays (preferably DRVVT and APTT-LA) for the identification of lupus anticoagulant but there are some studies which don't support this contention. Our study analyzed 526 samples from high risk pregnancy cases for APLA by all four LAC tests from tertiary centre of northern India. Among all the cases studies 65 cases were positive for lupus anticoagulant 25 of this became negative after 12 weeks. Among the 40 repeated positive assays, dRVVT could able to diagnose 36 cases followed by APTT-LA which could able to diagnose 28 cases, while KCT could able to diagnose 23 cases and dPT could able to diagnose only 14 cases. There were 12 cases in whom all lupus assays were positive. Our study thus concluded that DRVVT was the most sensitive followed by APPT-LA, KCT, dPT. The combination of dRVVT with APTT-LA or KCT appeared to be superior to other combinations. No individual test per se is 100% sensitive for the diagnosis of APLA in high risk pregnancy cases. Further results confirmed that repeated LAC result is required even in a high-risk setting. Positive LAC assay in majority were not associated with exclusively recurrent pregnancy loss but were associated with sporadic stillbirth and thrombosis.

AB  - Introduction: Normal development of placental vascular tree requiring angiogenesis and vasculogenesis is structurally and functionally indispensable for both adequate placental growth and delivery of nutrients from mother to the fetus. Impaired placental angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications which have immediate and long-lasting effects on the mother and her child, such as preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction. The mechanisms underlying the deregulation of placental angiogenesis in PE include a misbalance between the secretion and activity of pro-angiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) and anti-angiogenic (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [sFlt-1]) factors. Considering the important roles of VEGF and sflt1 in pregnancy, functional polymorphisms in these genes may be potentially important as genetic markers for susceptibility to PE. Thus, the aim of the study was to screen for the presence of VEGF and sFlt-1 gene polymorphisms and to measure their levels in PE patients and controls of Indian origin. Material and Methods: Fifty each of clinically diagnosed patients and gestational and maternal age-matched normotensive, nonproteinuric controls were recruited after taking informed consent. DNA isolated from blood samples was processed for polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism to screen for the presence of VEGF + 936C/T, sFlt-1 (+4244G/A, -4771G/T, -523C/G) polymorphisms. Serum levels of VEGF-A and sFlt-1 were measured by Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Decreased frequency of wild type genotype with respect to VEGF + 936C/T and sFlt-1 (+4244G/A, -4771G/T, and -523C/G) polymorphisms was seen in patients. ELISA results showed lower VEGF-A (198.43 +/- 14.63 pg/ml vs. 235.08 +/- 16.72 pg/ml [mean +/- standard error of mean]) and higher sFlt-1 levels (2932.81 [1802.33-5760.46] pg/ml vs. 1114.94 [655.03-2694.35] Median [Range]; P < 0.05) in patients as compared to controls. Preeclamptic women with increased frequency of VEGF + 936CT genotype had lower serum levels of VEGF-A. However, preeclamptic women with increased frequency of GA, AA, GT, TT, CG, and GG genotypes of sFlt-1 (+4244G/A, -4771G/T, -523C/G) polymorphisms had increased serum levels of sFlt-1. Discussion and Conclusion: The present study shows, for the first time, a possible association of VEGF and sFlt-1 polymorphisms with gene expression and altered protein levels in preeclamptic patients of Indian origin.

AB  - Background: Patients undergoing epilepsy surgery are on polytherapy. Drug tapering is usually done after 1 year in adults and after 6 months in children. Sometimes, drugs have to be altered during the perioperative period, which is more commonly seen in hemispherotomy (HS) patients. The present study was done to compare perioperative drug alterations between HS and temporal (TL) lobectomy patients.
   Materials and Methods: Prospective analysis of postoperative HS and TL patients was done. Primary outcomes were drug number, dosage changes, and seizure outcome. Secondary outcome studied was a change in intelligence quotient (IQ) in the two groups.
   Results: At total of 71 patients were included. Perioperative drug stopping (clobazam - CLB) was needed in 3/38 patients in the HS group, due to sedation. Dosage was reduced in 23/38 (60.52%) in HS group, and in 2/33 (6%) in TL group P < 0.001. The most common drug was CLB, with reduction in 21/27 (77.77%) patients, with a mean reduction of 41.21 +/- 4.01%. Two patients required drug substitution in the HS group. About 64/71 (90.1%) patients achieved Class I outcome at a 1-year postoperative time point (TL - 90.9%, HS - 89.47%). There was no change in IQ in any of the groups.
   Conclusion: Perioperative drug alteration is often needed in the HS patients as compared to TL patients. Benzodiazepines have to be reduced to maintain alertness in the HS patients. The increased sedation postoperatively can be due to decreased cortical drive over the reticular activating system, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor denervation hypersensitivity, or increased activity of drugs over the remaining active hemisphere.

AB  - The pathological mechanism underlying glaucoma has always been a complex aspect of this permanently blinding disease but proteomic studies have been helpful in elucidating it to a great extent in several studies. This study was designed to evaluate the expression and to get an idea about the function of two novel markers (ligatin and fibulin-7) identified in human aqueous humor (hAH) in relation to glaucomatous progression. A significant increase in the protein content of glaucomatous hAH compared to that of non-glaucomatous controls (NG-Ctrls) was observed. Ligatin, fibulin-7, and its proteolysis were revealed in hAH of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and NG-Ctrls. Quantification confirmed no significant difference in expression of ligatin, whereas fibulin-7 was significantly (P < 0.05) low in hAH of PACG in comparison to NG-Ctrls and POAG. Importantly the immunohistochemical assay for both indicated their possible involvement in the maintenance of the appropriate structure of TM in vivo. Since oxidative stress is a major contributor to glaucomatous pathogenesis, in vitro analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions indicated intracellular changes in localization and expression of ligatin upon oxidative insult of human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. While no such changes were found for fibulin-7 expression. This was also corroborated with the immunocytochemical assay. Though a study with a small sample size, this is the first report which confirms the presence of ligatin and fibulin-7 in hAH, quantified their differential expression, and indicated the possibility of their involvement in the maintenance of the TM structure.

AB  - A young Indian female visited hospital as a suspected case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with relapsed thrombotic complications with low platelet counts, infarct in middle cerebral artery and thrombi in microvessels. We first confirmed the deficiency of ADAMTS13 metalloprotease in this patient showing improper cleavage of vWF multimers by her plasma unlike her parents and brother. Although patient had very less ADAMTS13 antigen in plasma, but it did not appear to be the cause of deficiency of the enzyme, because her father had similarly low antigen level and he never had prothrombotic complications. While investigating the genetic change in ADAMTS13, we observed four homozygous-SNPs (g.420T > C, g.1342C > G, g.1716G > A and g.2280T > C) in exon 5, 12, 15 and 19 respectively in patient and her father unlike the heterozygous form of same SNPs in mother and brother. Further to investigate the cause of ADAMTS13 deficiency, we observed an elevated level of antibody against ADAMTS13 in patient unlike her father and other family members. Our study therefore provides the molecular approach of diagnosis of TTP in this patient and also highlights the use of such techniques in India. More importantly, study provides the clue of alternate treatment such as immunosuppressant therapy to this patient.

AB  - Systemic administration of chemotherapeutic drugs is widely used in the treatment of cancer. However, a good understanding of drug transport barriers that influence the treatment efficacy is still lacking. In this study, a voxelized numerical model based on dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed to study the transport and efficacy of three different chemotherapeutic drugs, namely methotrexate, doxorubicin and cisplatin in human brain tumors. DCE-MRI data provides realistic heterogeneous vasculature of the tumor, the permeability of tissue to contrast agent, interstitial volume fraction (porosity) of the tissue and patient-specific arterial input function (AIF). The permeability of tissue to aforementioned drugs is determined by correlating it with the permeability of tissue to the contrast agent. The model is employed to simulate drug concentration in the tissue and compare the effect of heterogeneous vasculature on the distribution of the drugs in the tumor. The drug accumulation is observed to be higher in high permeability areas initially, and in higher porosity areas at later times. Furthermore, it is observed that methotrexate remains in the interstitial space of the tumor in higher concentration for a longer duration as compared to other two drugs, facilitating more tumor cell killing.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs), the small circulating vesicles released from urine samples of tuberculosis (TB) patients, contain a pool of biomarkers. We recently detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and CFP-10 (Rv3874) biomarkers from the urinary EVs of pulmonary TB (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) patients by immuno-polymerase chain reaction (I-PCR) assay and the results were compared with the analogous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The detection limits of both purified LAM and CFP-10 were determined to be 1 fg/mL with I-PCR, which was 106 times lower than ELISA. Detection of LAM and CFP-10 biomarkers in urinary EVs of TB patients by I-PCR showed superiority over ELISA. Notably, LAM I-PCR revealed sensitivities of 74.3 and 67.9% in PTB (n = 74) and EPTB (n = 53) patients, respectively, with specificities of 91.5-92.8% (n = 116). Moreover, the sensitivities attained with LAM I-PCR were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than with CFP-10 I-PCR. After further improving the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, our I-PCR based on LAM detection in urinary EVs may be used as an adjunct test for rapid diagnosis of TB.

AB  - Introduction: Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a painful mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. It is usually idiopathic and can be treated with drugs used for neuropathic pain such as pregabalin, gabapentin, and amitriptyline. Objectives: This study was done to study the effect of triamcinolone acetonide on drug refractory MP. Methods: This study was a retrospective case file review. Results: Eight patients were treated with local injections of triamcinolone. The patients were followed up for a period of 4 months to 54 months. There was significant symptomatic improvement with six patients having complete improvement and all patients reporting >50% improvement. Patients who had recurrence of symptoms on follow up received up to four injections as per their requirement and repeated injections also produced >50% symptom relief. Conclusion: Triamcinolone acetonide injected locally seems to be an effective and safe treatment for refractory MP. A randomized control trial has been planned to look for efficacy and safety.

AB  - Background: It is hypothesized that the duodenal mucosal damage in patients with celiac disease (CeD) is caused by the mucosa-infiltrating lymphoid cells. This study aimed to analyze the immune effective and regulatory T (Treg) cells in duodenal biopsies from treatment-naive adult patients with CeD having different histological grades and controls. Patients and Methods: Dual-color immunohistochemical staining was done in a total of 234 duodenal biopsies, including 132 controls and 102 adult patients with CeD using CD20, CD3:CD4, CD3:CD8, CD4:FoxP3, CD8:FoxP3, and TCR alpha beta:TCR gamma delta antibodies. The density of these lymphoid cells in lamina propria and mucosal epithelium was compared between controls and CeD, with different modified Marsh grades. Results: Densities of CD4+ T cells in lamina propria and CD8+gamma delta intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were significantly more in biopsies from patients with CeD, than in controls. An increasing linear pattern of IELs, CD3+ T cells, and CD20+ B cells was observed with increasing grades of villous abnormalities. Although CD8+ FoxP3+ Treg cells were significantly more in biopsies from patients with CeD, there was no significant difference in CD4+ FoxP3+ Treg cell infiltrate between both the groups. Conclusion: Our finding in this observational study generates interest to study the local intestinal mucosal immunity in CeD in detail. A study to prove the failure of CD4+ FoxP3+ Treg cell recruitment in CeD and its direct functional impact may yield valuable information regarding loss of mucosal tolerance.

TI  - Neurogenic Fever in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Treated with Propranolol: A Case Report
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
KW  - Neurogenic fever
KW  - severe traumatic brain injury
KW  - propranolol
AB  - The causes of intractable fever in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients can be diverse. Neurogenic fever (NF) which is a rare entity can develop due to autonomic dysregulation in the absence of infection or any other cause of fever. It manifests as fever, tachycardia, paroxysmal hypertension, dilated pupils, tachypnea, and extensor posturing in cases of severe TBI, brain neoplasms or brain haemorrhage. We found propranolol to be effective in controlling many of the manifestations of neurogenic fever in our patients with severe TBI. Fever in severe TBI patients is not an uncommon phenomenon, but when intractable with negative fever workup, a central cause should be considered. Propranolol is deemed as one of the most efficacious drugs for managing NF due to dysautonomia. We want to apprise the readers about this entity and its treatment with beta-blockers.

AB  - Investigation of locomotion patterns provides a useful scenario for many applications like locomotion classification in the prosthesis, gait rehabilitation, and pathological gait analysis. Locomotion classification for prosthesis use has been of great importance for the development of intelligent prosthesis. Electromyography (EMG) has shown promising results in the past as a sensing modality to represent the locomotion patterns in different terrain. However, EMG suffers from various limitations to be widely accepted. A force myography (FMG) system has been developed to analyze its feasibility as an alternate sensing modality to EMG. Data from eight force sensitive resistors (FSR) along with foot switches were collected from six healthy subjects for five different locomotion modes i.e. level walk (LW), ramp ascent (RA), ramp descent (RD), stair ascent (SA) and stair descent (SD). To estimate the characteristics of FMG, the variance ratio and correlation coefficient were calculated for intra and inter-class locomotion respectively. A lower variance ratio in anterior FMG in all locomotion modes was observed, indicating the high repeatability of FMG signal. Further, the lower correlation coefficient between level walking (LW) and other locomotion modes SA & SD, promises FMG to be a potential information source for future application in locomotion classification. Results of the present study demonstrate the prospective of FMG in the representation of different locomotion and its possible application in lower limb prosthetic control. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the effect of ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFFA)-guided targeted retinal photocoagulation (TRP) in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with macular edema after intravitreal Ranibizumab (RBZ). Methods: 33 eyes of 32 treatment naive patients diagnosed as BRVO with macular edema were prospectively randomized to 0.5 mg Ranibizumab only (RBZ group) (n = 17) or Ranibizumab with UWFFA-guided laser (RBZ + TRP group) (n = 16). Both groups received three injections at monthly intervals and PRN henceforth. RBZ + TRP group additionally underwent UWFFA-guided TRP of peripheral capillary nonperfusion areas 1 week post injection. Outcome measures included improvement in visual acuity, central subfoveal thickness (CST), and the number of injections required with a minimum follow-up of 9 months. Results: Both groups showed significant improvement in mean BCVA (25.7 +/- 8.19 letters, P < 0.001 vs. 23.38 +/- 7.56 letters, P < 0.001; in RBZ and RBZ + TRP group, respectively) and reduction in mean central subfoveal thickness (379.12 +/- 242.7 mu m, P < 0.001 vs. 253.75 +/- 137.9 mu m, P < 0.001 in RBZ and RBZ + TRP group, respectively) at 9 months. The number of injections in the RBZ group (5.76 +/- 1.3) was significantly greater than RBZ + TRP (4.06 +/- 0.99) (P < 0.001). Both groups had significant improvement in contrast sensitivity and mean deviation on visual fields; however, the difference between the groups was not significant (P = 0.62 and P = 0.79, respectively). Conclusion: UWFFA-guided TRP reduced the number of injections of Ranibizumab in patients having BRVO with macular edema, while maintaining similar benefits in the improvement of BCVA, central subfoveal thickness without deleterious effect on the visual field, and contrast sensitivity.

AB  - Aims: Guidelines recommend hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a diagnostic test for type 2 diabetes, but its accuracy may differ in certain ethnic groups.
   Methods: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes by HbA1c, fasting glucose, and 2 h glucose was compared in 3016 participants from Chennai and Delhi, India from the CARRS-2 Study to 757 Indians in the U.S. from the MASALA Study. Type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol/L, 2-h glucose >= 11.1 mmol/L, or HbA1c >= 6.5%. Isolated HbA1c diabetes was defined as HbA1c >= 6.5% with fasting glucose < 7.0 mmol/L and 2 h glucose < 11.1 mmol/L.
   Results: The age, sex, and BMI adjusted prevalence of diabetes by isolated HbA1c was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.2-4.0), 3.1% (95% CI: 2.3-4.1), and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4-1.8) in CARRS-Chennai, CARRS-Delhi, and MASALA, respectively. The proportion of diabetes diagnosed by isolated HbA1c was 19.4%, 26.8%, and 10.8% in CARRS-Chennai, CARRS-Delhi, and MASALA respectively. In CARRS-2, individuals with type 2 diabetes by isolated HbA1c milder cardio-metabolic risk than those diagnosed by fasting or 2-h measures.
   Conclusions: In Asian Indians, the use of HbA1c for type 2 diabetes diagnosis could result in a higher prevalence. HbA1c may identify a subset of individuals with milder glucose intolerance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The Indian population is facing highest dengue burden worldwide supporting an urgent need for vaccines. For vaccine introduction, evaluation and interpretation it is important to gain a critical understanding of immune memory induced by natural exposure. However, immune memory to dengue remains poorly characterized in this region.
   Methods: We enumerated levels of dengue specific memory B cells (MBC), neutralizing (NT) and binding antibodies in healthy adults (n = 70) from New Delhi.
   Results: NT-antibodies, binding antibodies and MBC were detectable in 86%, 86.56% and 81.63% of the subjects respectively. Among the neutralizing positive subjects, 58%, 27%, 5% and 10% neutralized all four, any three, any two and any one dengue serotypes respectively. The presence of the neutralizing antibodies was associated with the presence of the MBC and binding antibodies. However, a massive interindividual variation was observed in the levels of the neutralizing antibodies (range, <1: 50-1: 30,264), binding antibodies (range, 1: 3,000-1: 134,000,) as well as the MBC (range = 0.006%-5.05%).
   Conclusion: These results indicate that a vast majority of the adults are immune to multiple dengue serotypes and show massive interindividual variation in neutralizing/binding antibodies and MBCs emphasizing the importance of monitoring multiple parameters of immune memory in order to properly plan, evaluate and interpret dengue vaccines.

AB  - Background: Corticosteroids are the most common agents used in the treatment of alopecia areata (AA), however, their long-term use is associated with severe side effects. Therefore, other immunosuppressive agents have been tried and azathioprine appears to be an effective and promising alternative. Objective: The main objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of 300 mg once weekly azathioprine pulse (WAP) and 5 mg betamethasone on 2 consecutive days every week in the management of AA. Materials and Methods: In this open-label, randomized comparative study, 50 patients of AA with >10% scalp area involvement were treated with either 300 mg WAP or 5 mg betamethasone on 2 consecutive days every week for 4 months or till complete scalp hair regrowth and followed up for next 5 months. Primary efficacy parameters were average percentage scalp hair regrowth and change in average Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score at 4 months. Results: Twenty patients in WAP group and 21 patients in betamethasone group completed the study. The median percent scalp hair regrowth and the median change in SALT score was 44.52 and 9.5 in WAP group compared to 71.43 and 14 in betamethasone group at 4-month, respectively, which were statistically similar in two groups, however, side effects were significantly higher in betamethasone group. On further follow-up at 9 months, 10 (50%) patients in WAP group and 13 (62%) patients in betamethasone group achieved complete hair regrowth. Lack of control group was a limitation of our study. Conclusion: WAP and betamethasone therapy, both appear to be effective in the treatment of AA. However, betamethasone caused several side effects; therefore, WAP can be used as a better alternative to corticosteroids in AA.

AB  - Rationale & Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has wide-ranging and long-term consequences for young people and their families. The omission of outcomes that are important to young people with CKD and their caregivers limits knowledge to guide shared decision making. We aimed to identify the outcomes that are important to young people with CKD and their caregivers.
   Study Design: We used the nominal group technique whereby participants identified and ranked outcomes and explained their priorities.
   Settings & Participants: Young people with CKD (stages 1-5, dialysis, or transplantation) and their caregivers were purposively sampled from 6 centers across Australia, the United States, arid Canada.
   Analytical Approach: Importance scores were calculated (scale of 0-1), and qualitative data were analyzed thematically.
   Results: 34 patients (aged 8-21 years) and 62 caregivers participated in 16 groups and identified 48 outcomes. The 5 highest ranked outcomes for patients were survival (importance score, 0.25), physical activity (0.24), fatigue (0.20), lifestyle restrictions (0.20), and growth (0.20); and for caregivers, kidney function (0.53), survival (0.28), infection (0.22), anemia (0.20), and growth (0.17). 12 themes were identified reflecting their immediate and current priorities (wanting to feel normal, strengthening resilience, minimizing intrusion into daily life, imminent threats to life, devastating family burdens, and seeking control over health) and considerations regarding future impacts (protecting health/development, remaining hopeful, concern for limited opportunities, prognostic uncertainty, dreading painful and invasive procedures, and managing expectations).
   Limitations: Only English-speaking participants were recruited.
   Conclusions: Kidney function, infection, survival, and growth were the highest priorities for patients with CKD and their caregivers. Young people with CKD also prioritized highly the outcomes that directly affected their lifestyle and sense of normality, while caregiver's highest priorities concerned the long-term health of their child, current health problems, and the financial and family burdens of caring for a child with CKD.

AB  - Background: An efficient inventory control system would help optimize the use of resources and eventually help improve patient care. Objectives: The study aimed to find out the surgical consumables using always, better, and control (ABC) and vital, essential, and desirable (VED) technique as well as calculating the lead time of specific category A and vital surgical consumables. Methods: This was a descriptive, record-based study conducted from January to March 2016 in the surgical stores of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The study comprised all the surgical consumables which were procured during the financial year 2014-2015. Stores ledger containing details of the consumption of the items, supply orders, and procurement files of the items were studied for performing ABC analysis and calculating the lead time. A list of surgical consumables was distributed to the doctors, nursing staff, technical staff, and hospital stores personnel to categorize them into VED categories after explaining them the basis for the classification. Results: ABC analysis revealed that 35 items (14%), 52 items (21%), and 171 items (69%) were categorized into A (70% annual consumption value [ACV]), B (20% ACV), and C (10% ACV) category, respectively. In the current study, vital items comprised the majority of the items, i.e., 73% of the total items and essential (E) category of items comprised 26% of all the items. The average internal, external, and total lead time was 17 days (range 3-30 days), 25 days (range 5-38) and 44 days (range 18-98 days), respectively. Conclusions: Hospitals stores need to implement inventory management techniques to reduce the number of stock-outs and internal lead time.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the association of polymorphisms in four genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Asian Indian adolescents.
   Methods: In this case-control study, 218 Asian Indian adolescents with overweight/obesity and 86 lean healthy adults without fatty liver were enrolled. Hepatic steatosis was assessed and graded by ultrasonography (USG). Serum insulin, lipids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), TNF-alpha, adiponectin and apolipoprotein C3 were measured and genotyping was done. Frequencies of variant and wild genotypes in all adolescents and in the subgroups without steatosis, with grade 1 steatosis and with grade 2 or 3 steatosis were compared to those in the controls. The frequencies were also compared in the overweight adolescents with grade 2 or 3 steatosis and without steatosis.
   Results: Variant genotypes of polymorphisms -863 C>A and -1031 T >C of the TNFA gene, 455 T >C of the APOC3 gene and the wild type of +276 G >T of the ADIPOQ gene were associated with obesity with odds ratios (OR, 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 2.5 (1.5-4.4), 2.5 (1.5-4.2), 2.0 (1.1-3.6) and 2.5 (1.4-5.0), respectively. Polymorphisms 455 T >C of APOC3 and rs738409 C>G of PNPLA3 were associated with NAFLD. Fasting insulin and triglycerides (TG) were higher in the adolescents with homozygous variant polymorphisms -1031 T> C of TNFA and 455 T> C of APOC3 genes, respectively.
   Conclusions: Several polymorphisms were noted to have a significant association with obesity and NAFLD in Asian Indian adolescents.

AB  - Objective: Primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) is a rare entity, necessitating accurate and early diagnosis, as its management is very different from that of other neoplasms intrinsic to the thyroid. Materials and Methods: Cases diagnosed between January 2009 and March 2015 were retrieved, and clinical details were noted. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for immunophenotyping, and cases were classified according to the World Health Organization 2017 classification of hematolymphoid neoplasms. Results: Eleven patients with PTL were identified, with a mean age of 64.6 years (range: 40u76 years), including three males and eight females. Duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 36 months (mean: 9.3 months). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was most frequent, followed by extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. Most DLBCLs were nongerminal center type. BCL2 was positive in all DLBCLs. Strong p53 immunopositivity was not seen in any of the cases analyzed. Conclusion: Histopathological evaluation supplemented by IHC is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PTL. Combined chemoradiotherapy appears to be the best treatment modality, irrespective of histological type. MIB-1 and MUM1 IHC may have a role in identifying DLBCL, particularly in small biopsies. Role of p53 and BCL2 needs further evaluation.

AB  - Objective: To characterize the in vitro replication fitness, viral diversity, and phylogeny of dengue viruses (DENV) isolated from Indian patients.
   Methods: DENV was isolated from whole blood collected from patients by passaging in cell culture. Passage 3 viruses were used for growth kinetics in C6/36 mosquito cells. Parallel efforts also focused on the isolation of DENV RNA from plasma samples of the same patients, which were processed for next-generation sequencing.
   Results: It was possible to isolate 64 clinical isolates of DENV, mostly DENV-2. Twenty-five of these were further used for growth curve analysis in vitro, which showed a wide range of replication kinetics. The highest viral titers were associated with isolates from patients with dengue with warning signs and severe dengue cases. Full genome sequences of 21 DENV isolates were obtained. Genome analysis mapped the circulating DENV-2 strains to the Cosmopolitan genotype.
   Conclusions: The replication kinetics of isolates from patients with mild or severe infection did not differ significantly, but the viral titers varied by two orders of magnitude between the isolates, suggesting differences in replication fitness among the circulating DENV-2.

AB  - Skin tissue engineering has attained several clinical milestones making remarkable progress over the past decades. Skin is inhabited by a plethora of cells spatiotemporally arranged in a 3-dimensional (3D) matrix, creating a complex microenvironment of cell-matrix interactions. This complexity makes it difficult to mimic the native skin structure using conventional tissue engineering approaches. With the advent of newer fabrication strategies, the field is evolving rapidly. However, there is still a long way before an artificial skin substitute can fully mimic the functions and anatomical hierarchy of native human skin. The current focus of skin tissue engineers is primarily to develop a 3D construct that maintains the functionality of cultured cells in a guided manner over a period of time. While several natural and synthetic biopolymers have been translated, only partial clinical success is attained so far. Key challenges include the hierarchical complexity of skin anatomy; compositional mismatch in terms of material properties (stiffness, roughness, wettability) and degradation rate; biological complications like varied cell numbers, cell types, matrix gradients in each layer, varied immune responses, and varied methods of fabrication. In addition, with newer biomaterials being adopted for fabricating patient-specific skin substitutes, issues related to escalating processing costs, scalability, and stability of the constructs under in vivo conditions have raised some concerns. This review provides an overview of the field of skin regenerative medicine, existing clinical therapies, and limitations of the current techniques. We have further elaborated on the upcoming tissue engineering strategies that may serve as promising alternatives for generating functional skin substitutes, the pros and cons associated with each technique, and scope of their translational potential in the treatment of chronic skin ailments.

AB  - Objective Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) is an aggressive extranodal lymphoma of NK-cell or T-cell lineage. Its clinical features overlap with those of several sinonasal mass lesions. While the histopathological features are well described, diagnosis is often difficult, owing to presence of extensive coagulative necrosis, so that repeated biopsies may sometimes be necessary for correct diagnosis. Literature on cytological findings of ENKTL is limited. Methods Cytomorphological features of cases of histologically confirmed ENKTL having corresponding cytology samples were reviewed retrospectively, to identify distinctive features that could possibly suggest this entity. Results Aspirates from five patients were studied: four from cervical nodes, one from cheek swelling and one from pleural fluid. Two aspirates were reported as positive for malignancy, two as atypical lymphoid proliferation and one was non-diagnostic. Pleural fluid was reported as malignant, favouring a diagnosis of carcinoma. On cytology, aspirates showed medium to large cells with folded, indented nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm, some with tongue-like cytoplasmic protrusions. A distinctive feature was presence of large loose clusters of tumour cells with arborising capillaries running through them. Interestingly, necrosis was consistently absent. Subsequent biopsies from palate (three cases) and nasal masses (two cases) confirmed the diagnosis of ENKTL. Conclusions Suspicion of ENKTL on cytology is crucial for timely diagnosis to avoid diagnostic delay, especially when only highly necrotic biopsy samples are available. Awareness of distinctive cytomorphological features is required to make fine needle aspiration an effective diagnostic tool for initial diagnosis and for evaluation of possible recurrences.

AB  - IntroductionMolecular classification of medulloblastomas (MB) is prognostically and therapeutically relevant and helps in better risk-stratification. Translation of this subgrouping to routine practice still remains a challenge. The most pathologistaccessible techniques for molecular subgroupinginclude immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in-situ hybridization(FISH) and NanoString.Objectives(1) Molecular subgrouping of MBs by IHC and FISH, and NanoString assay (2) To compare their efficacy and cost for applicability in resourceconstrained centers.MethodsNinety-five cases of MB with adequate tissue were included. Molecular subgrouping was performed by IHC for -catenin, GAB1 and YAP1; FISH for MYC amplification, and sequencing for CTNNB1, and by NanoString Assay on the same set of MBs. A subsetof cases was subjected to 850k DNA methylation array.ResultsIHC+FISH classified MBs into 15.8% WNT, 16.8% SHH, and 67.4% non-WNT/non-SHH subgroups; with MYC amplification identified in 20.3% cases of non-WNT/non-SHH. NanoString successfully classified 91.6% MBs into 25.3% WNT, 17.2% SHH, 23% Group 3 and 34.5% Group 4. However, NanoString assay failure was seen in eight cases, all of which were>8-years-old formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Concordant subgroup assignment was noted in 88.5% cases, while subgroup switching was seen in 11.5% cases. Both methods showed prognostic correlation. Methylation profiling performed on discordant cases revealed 1 out of 4 extra WNT identified by NanoString to be WNT, others aligned with IHC subgroups; extra SHH by NanoString turned out to be SHH by methylation.ConclusionsBoth IHC supplemented by FISH and NanoString are robust methods for molecular subgrouping, albeit with few disadvantages. IHC cannot differentiate between Groups 3 and 4, while NanoString cannot classify older-archived tumors, and is not available at most centres. Thus, both the methods complement each other and can be used in concert for high confidence allotment of molecular subgroups in clinical practice.

AB  - Objective Anti-neoplastic drug cisplatin is prescribed widely for treatment of a variety of malignancies. Its use has been restricted lately due to severe renal toxicity. The purpose of current study was to investigate the effect of pitavastatin (a hypolipidaemic drug) in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in rats. Method Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were treated with different doses of pitavastatin (0.16, 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg per day p.o.; 10 days). On 7th day of the study, rats were administered cisplatin (8 mg/kg i.p.). Rats were euthanized (11th day), and blood and tissues were processed to evaluate biochemical, histopathological and ultrastructural parameters along with the analysis of immunohistochemistry and DNA-fragmentation studies. Protein expressions were analysed to demonstrate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Key findings In the study group with cisplatin insult, KFT parameters were found to be elevated, concentration of apoptotic markers was found to be increased, histopathological and ultramicroscopical architecture was found to be distorted and the expression of MAPK proteins was also found to be elevated as compared to the normal group rats. Pitavastatin treatment alleviated all these anomalies. Conclusion Cisplatin-induced acute renal injury was improved on administration of pitavastatin via inhibition of MAPK and apoptotic pathway.

AB  - Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the biometric changes in Indian pediatric cataract and postoperative refractive status. Methods: A total of 147 patients were recruited into three groups: age < 6 months, age between 7 months and 18 months, and age between 19 and 60 months and prospectively observed for 6 months. Exclusion criteria were preterm birth, microphthalmia, microcornea, megalocornea, uveitis, glaucoma, and traumatic or complicated cataract. Axial length and keratometry, the primary outcome measures, were taken preoperatively under general anesthesia before surgery. These children were followed up for 6 months to look for refractive and biometric changes. T-test and linear regression with the logarithm of independent variables were done. Results: All unilateral cataractous eyes (n = 25) and randomly selected bilateral cases (n = 122) were included in the analysis, for a total of 147 eyes. Mean age was 17.163 +/- 13.024 months; axial length growth was 0.21, 0.18, 0.06 mm/month, and keratometry decline was 0.083, 0.035, 0.001 D/month in age groups 0-6, 7-18, and 19-60 months, respectively. The visual acuity improved in log MAR from 1.020 to 0.745 at 6 months postoperatively. There was statistically significant (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.575, P < 0.001) between age and postoperative refraction. There were no intraocular lens (IOL) -related complications seen in the immediate postoperative period. Peripheral opacification was seen in 102 eyes and central opacification in 1 eye at a 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: Indian eyes have a lower rate of axial length growth and keratometry change in comparison with western eyes implying smaller undercorrection in emmetropic IOL power for Indian pediatric eyes to achieve a moderate amount of hyperopia.

AB  - Patients with a significant left-to-right shunt at ventricular level may become inoperable at an early age due to irreversible pulmonary vascular disease. On the other hand, even suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension due to mitral stenosis remains treatable. We report a 24-year-old patient with large ventricular septal defect, severe mitral stenosis and cyanosis who improved after surgical correction of both the lesions. This emphasises the importance of additional post-capillary pulmonary hypertension in Eisenmenger syndrome.

AB  - Background: Brennan's rodent paw incision model has been extensively used for understanding mechanisms underlying postoperative pain in humans. However, alterations of physiological parameters like blood pressure and heart rate, or even feeding and drinking patterns after the incision have not been documented as yet. Moreover, though eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes contribute to inflammation, tissue levels of these inflammatory mediators have never been studied. This work further investigates the antinociceptive effect of protein C after intra-wound administration.
   Methods: Separate groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used for quantitation of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and leukotriene B4 level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as estimation of cardiovascular parameters and feeding and drinking behavior after paw incision. In the next part, rats were subjected to incision and 10 mu g of protein C was locally administered by a micropipette. Both evoked and non-evoked pain parameters were then estimated.
   Results: COX, particularly COX-2 activity and leukotriene B4 levels increased after incision. Hemodynamic parameters were normal. Feeding and drinking were affected on days 1 and 3, and on day 1, respectively. Protein C attenuated non-evoked pain behavior alone up to day 2.
   Conclusions: Based upon current observations, Brennan's rodent paw incision model appears to exhibit a prolonged period of nociception similar to that after surgery, with minimal interference of physiological parameters. Protein C, which is likely converted to activated protein C in the wound, attenuated the guarding score, which probably represents pain at rest after surgery in humans.

AB  - Introduction: The current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches have limited benefit in symptom management of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) urging clinicians and researchers to seek newer avenues of management. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promise in this aspect from a neuromodulatory perspective. The current study aims to study the response to tDCS as an adjunctive treatment in patients with treatment-resistant OCD.
   Materials and Methods: This open-label study was conducted among 20 patients with treatment-resistant OCD. All participants received 20 sessions of tDCS with the cathode at the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the anode at right occipital area. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the secondary outcome was evaluated on the clinical global impression (CGI) and side effect checklist for tDCS.
   Results: There was a significant improvement from baseline in the mean scores of Y-BOCS and CGI scales after tDCS intervention. An improvement of 35% Y-BOCS score change was observed in 15% of participants. Short-lasting side effects were reported as mild headache and localized tingling sensation.
   Conclusion: Cathodal tDCS at SMA may be a useful approach to manage treatment-resistant OCD. The use of tDCS was not associated with any significant harmful consequence to the participants.

AB  - Objective: To describe the ultra-wide field imaging features of pigmented para-venous retino-choroidal atrophy. Design: Retrospective review at a tertiary care centre. Participants: Eight eyes of five patients with pigmented para-venous retino-choroidal atrophy who presented to our retina clinic over last 2 years. Methods: Retrospective review of ultra-wide field pseudo-colour and short wave autofluorescence imaging was performed. In vivo histology of the macula and areas of retino-choroidal atrophy was studied with swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Results: The median age was 40 years (range: 22-67 years). Best corrected visual acuity ranged from perception of light to 20/20. The para-venous retino-choroidal atrophy and pigment clumping not only involved the major arcade vessels but also extended into the peripapillary area and retinal periphery. The affected areas demonstrated hypoautofluorescence with sharp hyperautofluorescent borders. Macular atrophy, epiretinal membrane and optic disc pallor were noted in two eyes each. In all cases, the affected pigmentary area had disorganization of inner retinal layers, disruption of outer retinal layers and retinal pigment epithelium and markedly thinned out choroid on swept source optical coherence tomography. Concurrent involvement with retinitis pigmentosa in the fellow eye was noted in two patients. Conclusion: Ultra-wide field imaging of pigmented para-venous retino-choroidal atrophy sheds light onto the widespread retino-choroidal abnormalities. Concurrent disc and macular involvement may jeopardize the visual function. Pigmented para-venous retino-choroidal atrophy may be considered as a self-limited form of retinitis pigmentosa.

AB  - Purpose: To study the etiology, clinical features, management options, and visual prognosis in various types of atypical macular holes (MHs).
   Methods: A review of the literature was performed, which focused on the etiopathogenesis of atypical or secondary MHs, their differentiating clinical features, management strategies, and varied clinical outcomes. Idiopathic or age-related, myopic, and traumatic MHs were excluded.
   Results: Atypical or secondary MHs arise out of concurrent ocular pathologies (dystrophy, degeneration, or infections) and laser/surgery. The contributing factors may be similar to those responsible for idiopathic or typical MHs, i.e., tangential or anteroposterior vitreofoveal traction or cystoid degeneration. The management is either observation or treatment of the underlying cause. The prognosis depends on the background pathology, duration of disease, and baseline visual acuity governed by the size of MH and morphologic health of underlying RPE and photoreceptors. The closer the morphology of atypical MH is to that of an idiopathic MH, the better the surgical outcome is.
   Conclusion: With the advancements in retinal imaging, atypical MHs are now more frequently recognized. With increasing understanding of the underlying disease processes, and improvement in investigations and surgical treatment, management of atypical MHs may improve in the future.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether a less-invasive approach to surgery for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with lower health care costs and costs of lost productivity over time, compared to open surgery.
   Methods: We compared direct medical costs and indirect productivity costs associated with treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) in the ROSE (Radiosurgery or Open Surgery for Epilepsy) trial. Health care use was abstracted from hospital bills, the study database, and diaries in which participants recorded health care use and time lost from work while seeking care. Costs of use were calculated using a Medicare costing approach used in a prior study of the costs of ATL. The power of many analyses was limited by the sample size and data skewing.
   Results: Combined treatment and follow-up costs (in thousands of US dollars) did not differ between SRS (n = 20, mean = $76.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 50.7-115.6) and ATL (n = 18, mean = $79.0, 95% CI = 60.09-103.8). Indirect costs also did not differ. More ATL than SRS participants were free of consciousness-impairing seizures in each year of follow-up (all P < 0.05). Costs declined following ATL (P = 0.005). Costs tended to increase over the first 18 months following SRS (P = 0.17) and declined thereafter (P = 0.06). This mostly reflected hospitalizations for SRS-related adverse events in the second year of follow-up.
   Significance: Lower initial costs of SRS for medial temporal lobe epilepsy were largely offset by hospitalization costs related to adverse events later in the course of follow-up. Future studies of less-invasive alternatives to ATL will need to assess adverse events and major costs systematically and prospectively to understand the economic implications of adopting these technologies.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the causes and management outcomes of acquired corneal opacity in a preschool age group (0-5 years) at a tertiary care hospital.
   Methods: Medical records of all cases (0-5 years) with acquired corneal opacity presenting to the cornea clinic of a tertiary eye care hospital from February 2013 to January 2014 were evaluated for age of onset, age at presentation, sex, laterality, cause of opacity, visual acuity, nutritional status, and socioeconomic class of the parents. The etiology of corneal opacity and the type of intervention with outcome at 3 months follow-up were recorded.
   Results: A total of 106 cases were included in the study. The most common cause of corneal scarring was healed infective keratitis (35.8%). Chemical injury, mechanical trauma, and keratomalacia were the other causes, affecting 21.8%, 20.8%, and 16% of the cases, respectively. Optical iridectomy was the most commonly performed procedure (35.8%), followed by lens aspiration with intraocular lens implantation (17.9%) and penetrating keratoplasty (17%). The mean corrected visual acuity (spectacle or contact lens) at the time of presentation and at 3 months after treatment was 2.9+/-0.3 (perception of light) and 2.2+/-0.9 (hand motions) logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units, respectively.
   Conclusions: Chemical injury and keratomalacia are the major causes of acquired corneal opacity in preschool age groups in India and are associated with poor visual prognosis.

AB  - Purpose: Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs/HAIs) are the most common adverse occurrences during health care delivery. Across the globe, millions of patients are affected by HAIs annually, with a higher burden and impact in developing nations. a major lacuna in planning preventing protocols is the absence of National Surveillance Systems in most low-middle income countries, which also prevents allocation of resources to the high-priority areas. Among all the HAIs, there is a huge global burden of SSIs, in terms of morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, increased antimicrobial treatment as well as attributable mortality. Method: This manuscript details the process of establishment of an SSI surveillance protocol at a level-1 trauma centre in North India. Result and Conclusion: Surveillance is an essential tool to reduce this burden. It is also an important primary step in recognizing problems and priorities, and it plays a crucial role in identifying risk factors for SSI and to be able to target modifiable risk factors. Therefore, it is imperative to establish reliable systems for surveillance of HAIs, to regularly estimate the actual burden of HAIs, and to use these data for developing indigenous preventive measures, tailored to the country's priorities.

AB  - Background & objectives: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of primary headache disorder. Its chronic form is often the most ignored and challenging to treat. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a novel technique in the treatment of chronic pain. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the effect of low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) on pain status in chronic TTH (CTTH) by subjective and objective pain assessment.Methods: Patients (n=30) diagnosed with CTTH were randomized into rTMS (n=15) and placebo (n=15) groups in this study. Pre-intervention detailed history of patients was taken. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain and questionnaires [Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), McGill Pain Questionnaire, Pain Beliefs Questionnaire, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Test, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and WHO-Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief version] were filled, and objective assessments such as nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) and conditioned pain modulation were done. The tests were repeated after 20 sessions (5 days/week). In the rTMS group, 1200 pulses in eight trains of 150 pulses each were given at 1Hz over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RDLPFC). In the placebo group, the rTMS coil was placed such that magnetic stimulation did not reach the cortex.Results: The NRS score decreased significantly (P<0.001) and NFR thresholds increased significantly (P=0.011) in the rTMS group when compared to placebo group.Interpretation & conclusions: Subjective improvements in the NRS, HIT-6, McGill Present Pain Intensity, trait of anxiety and psychological pain beliefs were observed. The increase in the thresholds of NFR served as an objective marker for improvement in pain status. Further studies need to be done to confirm our preliminary findings.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate and understand the association of global and MTHFR gene specific methylation in preeclampsia and recurrent miscarriages in light of MTHFR C677T polymorphism.
   Methods: The subjects comprised of recurrent miscarriage cases, their gestation matched controls, preeclampsia cases and matched controls. A set of women at full term were also recruited. Fasting blood sample (similar to 5 ml) was drawn from all the participants followed by DNA extraction, global DNA methylation and MTHFR gene specific methylation. MTHFR C677T polymorphism was analysed by PCR followed by RFLP.
   Results higher: Global DNA methylation at maternal front (p = 0.04) and hypomethylation of MTHFR gene at fetal front (p = 0.001) might be a characteristic of preeclampsia. Recurrent miscarriage cases were having significantly (p = 0.002) hyper MTHFR gene specific methylation as compared to controls. Women carrying CT genotype were found to be having significantly (p = 0.001) higher global DNA methylation in PE cases and MTHFR gene specific methylation (p = 0.005) in RM cases. Intergenerational analysis revealed similar patterns of global DNA methylation and MTHFR gene specific methylation among both PE and RM cases at maternal and fetal fronts.
   Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of global DNA methylation in Preeclampsia and MTHFR gene specific methylation in recurrent miscarriages. MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism in association with global and gene specific methylation seem to play a pivotal role in PE and RM respectively.

AB  - Introduction: Body adiposity measured by percentage of body fat (BF%) is found to be better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than body mass index (BMI). Limited information exists showing relationship between BMI and BF% in North Indian population. Objectives: To study the relationship between BMI and BF% among North Indian adult females across various age strata and level of BMI. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) among randomly selected females. BMI using standard techniques and BF% using bioelectrical impedance analysis was estimated. Linear regression was performed using general linear model with BF% as dependent variable and BMI as main independent variable. Results: Mean (+/- 2 SD) age of participants was 41.3 +/- 15.7 years. Mean BMI (+/- SD) was 23.3 (+/- 4.6) kg/m(2), whereas mean fat mass (+/- 2 SD) and BF% (95% CI) was 19.2 (+/- 7.9) kg and 33.6 (+/- 6.9) %. BMI and BF% were highly correlated among obese (r = 0.77), whereas least correlated (r = 0.32) in underweight females. Across age strata, correlation between BMI and BF% was maximum in 18-35 years age group (r = 0.95), whereas least in females >= 56 years (r = 0.67). Age and BMI together predicted 73% of variability in BF% in hierarchical linear regression model. Conclusions: In this population, we have found strong correlation between BMI and BF% particularly at higher level of BMI and in younger females. There is need to conduct more robust prospective longitudinal studies to assess BF%, which is a better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Introduction: In developing countries, preeclampsia is still a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, affecting nearly 8%-10% of pregnancies and overall death. Apart from various stresses that placenta undergoes while pregnancy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been the center of attraction for several researchers all across the globe. Imbalance in circulating pro- and anti-angiogenic agents in maternal serum has also been linked with the upregulation of stress at subcellular level. The present study is an attempt to demonstrate the role of pro-angiogenic factor in mitigating ER stress in trophoblast cells. Material and Methods: Evaluation of expression of ER stress markers (eIF2 alpha, X-box binding protein-1, and ATF6) at various time points was done after exposure of varying concentration (s) of pro-angiogenic factor (from preeclamptic mothers) to trophoblast cells (BeWo cells). Expression was also analyzed when BeWo cells were exposed to recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) along with serum from preeclamptic mothers. Molecular techniques used were immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis. Results: Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis demonstrated upregulated expression of studied ER stress markers in BeWo cells when they were exposed to Preeclampsia (PE) sera. Exogenous addition of recombinant VEGF along with preeclamptic sera significantly reduced the expression of ER stress markers. Discussion and Conclusion: In the present study, significantly reduced expression of ER stress markers in BeWo cells indicates an interrelationship of angiogenic factor and molecular transmembrane sensors. Further experimentations thus may provide a strong base for the modulation of ER stress sensors, which could be effective in minimizing ER stress in preeclamptic pregnancies and thus would bring a new hope to numerous women worldwide.

AB  - Phenylephrine is currently the vasopressor of choice during elective caesarean section, but it can cause reflex bradycardia. Noradrenaline, a potent alpha-agonist and weak beta-agonist, may be associated with a lower incidence of bradycardia. However, comparative information is limited. This double-blind randomised controlled trial compared the effects of 100 mu g phenylephrine and 5 mu g noradrenaline administered as boluses for the treatment of postspinal hypotension during elective caesarean section in women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy. Hypotension was defined as a decrease of >= 20% from baseline systolic arterial pressure, or an absolute value < 100 mmHg. Ninety women were included in the study. The primary outcome was the incidence of maternal bradycardia < 60 beats.min(-1). There was no difference in the incidence of bradycardia (37.8% with phenylephrine vs. 22.2% with noradrenaline; p = 0.167), number of hypotensive episodes, number of boluses required to treat the first hypotensive episode or reactive hypertension. The total number of boluses used was higher in the phenylephrine group (p = 0.01). Maternal heart rate at 1 min after vasopressor administration was non-significantly lower using phenylephrine vs. noradrenaline (p = 0.034, considering p < 0.01 as statistically significant). The umbilical artery pH was higher using phenylephrine than with noradrenaline (p = 0.034). In conclusion, both vasopressors reversed postspinal hypotension without a statistically significant difference in maternal bradycardia. However, in view of the lower umbilical artery pH when using noradrenaline, further research is warranted to study its placental transfer and fetal metabolic effects.

AB  - Introduction: In a previous study, we demonstrated clinical and dosimetric feasibility of single partial arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for accelerated hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to lumpectomy cavity for early breast cancer. In this dosimetric study, we compared dual partial arcs versus single arc.
   Patients and Methods: Fifteen consecutive patients for treatment with hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy with SIB using VMAT were planned with single partial arc in an earlier study, initial result of which is published elsewhere. The comparative dosimetric plan was created using two partial arcs. Skewness and kurtosis test, Paired Student's t-test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied for statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: Most planning targets are better achieved with dual arc technique. Coverage of planning target volume (PTV) whole breast (PTVWB) and PTV lumpectomy cavity (PTVBOOST) was significantly improved with dual partial arc without significant difference in conformity index and homogeneity index. Dual arc improved dosimetric parameter significantly. Mean dose (D-mean) and maximum dose (D-max) of whole breast PTV as well as D-max of PTVBOOST; ipsilateral and contralateral lung D-mean, D-max, 5 Gy volume (V-5); contralateral lung D-mean, D-max, V-5; Heart V-25 and V-18; D-mean of 5 mm thickness skin; D-mean and D-max of ribs; and D-mean and D-max of contralateral breast were improved with dual arc.
   Conclusion: This is first of its kind study establishing the advantage of dual partial arcs in the current context. Dual partial arcs improved dosimetry over single partial arc. Significant dose reduction can be achieved for multiple crucial organs at risk.

AB  - Emergency care systems (ECS) address a wide range of acute conditions, including emergent conditions from communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, pregnancy and injury. Together, ECS represent an area of great potential for reducing morbidity and mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is estimated that up to 54% of annual deaths in LMICs could be addressed by improved prehospital and facility-based emergency care. Research is needed to identify strategies for enhancing ECS to optimise prevention and treatment of conditions presenting in this context, yet significant gaps persist in defining critical research questions for ECS studies in LMICs. The Collaborative on Enhancing Emergency Care Research in LMICs seeks to promote research that improves immediate and long-term outcomes for clients and populations with emergent conditions. The objective of this paper is to describe systems approaches and research strategies for ECS in LMICs, elucidate priority research questions and methodology, and present a selection of studies addressing the operational, implementation, policy and health systems domains of health systems research as an approach to studying ECS. Finally, we briefly discuss limitations and the next steps in developing ECS-oriented interventions and research.

AB  - We aim to present a case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, in major molecular response for 5 years of treatment with imatinib 400mg OD. He presented with recurrent melena for one and a half years, requiring 11 U of packed red cell transfusion since then. Various causes of bleeding in CML, such as thrombocytopenia, disease progression related to accelerated phase/blast crisis or imatinib-induced cytopenia were ruled out. His investigations revealed reduced plasma fibrinogen (150 mg/ml; range 200-450 mg/ml). The platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time were 314x10(6)/l, 13 s (control 13 s), 31 s (control 30 s) and 16 s (control 16 s), respectively. Platelet aggregometry revealed normal platelet aggregation with adenine-di-phosphate, epinephrine and ristocetin, and reduced response with arachidonic acid (30%). Bleeding subsided with transfusion of fresh frozen plasma. Moreover, his medication was changed to nilotinib 300mg BD. Thereafter, his subsequent repeat investigations were normal. Platelet function defects in CML both pretherapy and on tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been described in the literature. However, concomitant hypofibrinogenemia has rarely been reported.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of platelet transfusions in critically ill children with an underlying oncologic diagnosis and to examine effects of prophylactic versus therapeutic transfusions. Design: Subgroup analysis of a prospective, observational study. Setting: Eighty-two PICUs in 16 countries. Patients: All children (3 d to 16 yr old) who received a platelet transfusion during one of the six predefined screening weeks and had received chemotherapy in the previous 6 months or had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the last year. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 548 patients enrolled in the parent study, 237 (43%) had an underlying oncologic diagnosis. In this population, 71% (168/237) of transfusions were given prophylactically, and 59% (139/237) of transfusions were given at a total platelet count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L, higher than the current recommendations. Those with an underlying oncologic diagnosis were significantly older, and received less support including less mechanical ventilation, fewer medications that affect platelet function, and less use of extracorporeal life support than those without an underlying oncologic diagnosis. In this subpopulation, there were no statistically significant differences in median (interquartile range) platelet transfusion thresholds when comparing bleeding or nonbleeding patients (50 x 10(9)/L [10-50 x 10(9)/L] and 30 x 10(9)/L [10-50 x 10(9)/L], respectively [p = 0.166]). The median (interquartile range) interval transfusion increment in children with an underlying oncologic diagnosis was 17 x 10(9)/L (6-52 x 10(9)/L). The presence of an underlying oncologic diagnosis was associated with a poor platelet increment response to platelet transfusion in this cohort (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.95; p = 0.035). Conclusions: Children with an underlying oncologic diagnosis receive nearly half of platelet transfusions prescribed by pediatric intensivists. Over half of these transfusions are prescribed at total platelet count greater than current recommendations. Studies must be done to clarify appropriate indications for platelet transfusions in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Use of artificial intelligence in medicine in an evolving technology which holds promise for mass screening and perhaps may even help in establishing an accurate diagnosis. The ability of complex computing is to perform pattern recognition by creating complex relationships based on input data and then comparing it with performance standards is a big step. Diabetic retinopathy is an ever-increasing problem. Early screening and timely treatment of the same can reduce the burden of sight threatening retinopathy. Any tool which can aid in quick screening of this disorder and minimize requirement of trained human resource for the same would probably be a boon for patients and ophthalmologists. In this review we discuss the current status of use of artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy and few other common retinal disorders.

AB  - Objective: To comprehensively analyze the prognostic factors responsible for affecting outcomes following cochlear implantation in prelinguals.
   Study Design: Retrospective cohort study from June 2004 to November 2015.
   Setting: Tertiary care center.
   Patients: Patients who had undergone cochlear implantation during June 2004 to November 2015 for prelingual sensorineural hearing loss with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.
   Intervention: Patients were evaluated for the presence of 20 risk factors possibly influencing postimplantation outcomes using a questionnaire.
   Main Outcome Measures: Assessment for speech and auditory function was done at the last follow-up with speech intelligibility ratings (SIR) and categories of auditory performance (CAP) scores, respectively.
   Results: One hundred fifty-one patients were included in this study. On univariate analysis for CAP, age at implantation, noncompliance to pre and postimplantation auditory and speech habilitation, poor parental motivation, socioeconomic status and literacy were found to be associated with lower scores (p<0.05). Whereas, for SIR, additionally, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and inner ear malformation were statistically significant negative predictors on univariate analysis. Finally, factors responsible for low CAP scores on multivariate analysis were poor parental literacy, poor socioeconomic status, irregular pre/postimplantation rehabilitation, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. While for SIR, additionally age at implantation was also a significant negative predictor. Increasing IQ and duration of implant use were associated with higher CAP (univariate) and SIR scores (univariate and multivariate) (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: We were able to demonstrate negative impact of higher age at implantation, minimal cognitive disorder, adverse parental/socioeconomic profile, and poor compliance to pre/postimplantation auditory verbal habilitation on auditory and speech outcomes.

AB  - Head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas are tumors with propensity mostly for locoregional spread. The most frequent sites of metastasis include lung, bone, liver, adrenal, heart, and kidney. Distant metastasis to axillary lymph nodes from buccal mucosa cancer is extremely rare. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case reported where a gentleman who was treated for carcinoma right buccal mucosa developed left axillary lymph node metastasis at 6(th) year of follow-up.

AB  - Aim The purpose of this study was to examine treatment-related neurochemical changes in 28 unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients using H-1-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS). Methods We included subjects diagnosed with OCD (n = 28), each with a total duration of illness of less than 5 years, as a study group and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 26). The inclusion criteria for the OCD group were right-handed individuals aged 18 years or older who had not been on any specific treatment for OCD for the last at least 8 weeks and who had no other psychiatric comorbidity. A pre-post and case-control design was employed in which OCD patients underwent H-1-MRS at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment with escitalopram (n = 21). Clinical assessment was carried out using a semi-structured pro forma Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 before and after treatment. Volume-localized H-1-MRS was carried out with a 3-Tesla Philips MR scanner. Results Our data suggested higher levels of myoinositol (mI), total choline (tCho), and glutamate+glutamine (Glx) in the medial thalamus at pre-assessment in OCD subjects as compared to healthy controls and a significant reduction in tCho and Glx after treatment in OCD subjects. The mI levels in the caudate nucleus and Glx levels in the anterior cingulate cortex were significantly correlated with disease severity on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Conclusion Our study supports the hypothesis of a hyper-glutaminergic state (as suggested by increased Glx levels) and neurodegeneration (as suggested by increased tCho and mI in the thalamus) in cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuitry in OCD patients as suggested by previous studies using MRS as well as other functional imaging studies.

Diagnosis of LCH is often difficult and can be delayed because of its rarity. The present study highlights the cytomorphological features in a large cohort of cases. An accurate cytological diagnosis may avoid unnecessary biopsy and guide appropriate management. Method Fourty seven (47) cases of LCH diagnosed on cytological material & fine-needle aspiration (FNA) over a period of 14 years (2003-2016) were retrieved from the archives. The cytological smears were evaluated and microscopic findings collected by semi-quantitative assessment done by two different pathologists Result The age at the diagnosis of the patients ranged from 9 months to 28 years. The majority of cases were in the age group of 0-5 years. The most common site was head and neck region, which included cervical lymphadenopathy and scalp swelling. Two cases were diagnosed each from inguinal lymph node and bronchio-alveolar lavage (BAL). Cytological smears in the majority of the cases were moderate to highly cellular (58%) and showing abundant Langerhans cell in (72%) of cases. Areas of necrosis were seen in 38%, while 78% of cases showed giant cells. The majority of cases showed mild eosinophilia (61%), sparse lymphocytosis (83%) and mild neutrophilic infiltration (64%). There were 1-2 mitoses per 10 high power field in 12 cases (25.5%). No abnormal mitoses were identified. Conclusion The presence of cells with features of Langerhans cells associated with the expression of selected immunohistochemical markers allow the diagnosis of LCH on cytological samples, sparing more invasive procedure as a biopsy.

AB  - A four-year-old child with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM) was planned for inferior and medial rectus muscle recession surgery, adjusted with the status of forced duction test. Due to pathological changes within the muscles subsequent to innervational abnormality, intraoperatively the inferior rectus muscle was pulled into two following the insertion of muscle hook. Moreover, the snapped muscle fibers could not be identified, thus further surgery was abandoned and an observation was commenced. At the end of 6 weeks, there was a significant reduction in the amount of hypotropia but clinically significant perverted convergence with esotropia necessitated further surgical intervention. A second surgical intervention consisting of medial rectus transposition to superior rectus with 3 mm recession was performed to achieve acceptable results in the primary gaze.

AB  - Optic disc photographic assessment was performed using an unmodified iPhone Xs Max. A video recording of the disc and peripapillary area was obtained in 5 patients. Good quality screenshots were acquired from the video, and, from them, a single best quality image was selected. This was compared with their respective standard optic disc stereo photograph. A glaucomatologist blinded to the type of image acquisition studied these images and concluded that both images could help well in the identification of glaucomatous optic disc features; however, the stereo photograph had better clarity than the iPhone static image. Nevertheless, the iPhone offered the advantage of real-time video assessment of the disc and peripapillary area and could serve as a practical and handy tool for telemedicine and teaching purposes.

AB  - Introduction: Antimicrobial-resistant HAI (Healthcare associated infection) are a global challenge due to their impact on patient outcome. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes (AMSP) is needed at institutional and national levels. Assessment of core capacities for AMSP is an important starting point to initiate nationwide AMSP. We conducted an assessment of the core capacities for AMSP in a network of Indian hospitals, which are part of the Global Health Security Agenda-funded work on capacity building for AMR-HAIs. Subjects and Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's core assessment checklist was modified as per inputs received from the Indian network. The assessment tool was filled by twenty hospitals as a self-administered questionnaire. The results were entered into a database. The cumulative score for each question was generated as average percentage. The scores generated by the database were then used for analysis. Results and Conclusion: The hospitals included a mix of public and private sector hospitals. The network average of positive responses for leadership support was 45%, for accountability; the score was 53% and for key support for AMSP, 58%. Policies to support optimal antibiotic use were present in 59% of respondents, policies for procurement were present in 79% and broad interventions to improve antibiotic use were scored as 33%. A score of 52% was generated for prescription-specific interventions to improve antibiotic use. Written policies for antibiotic use for hospitalised patients and outpatients were present on an average in 72% and 48% conditions, respectively. Presence of process measures and outcome measures was scored at 40% and 49%, respectively, and feedback and education got a score of 53% and 40%, respectively. Thus, Indian hospitals can start with low-hanging fruits such as developing prescription policies, restricting the usage of high antibiotics, enforcing education and ultimately providing the much-needed leadership support.

AB  - Purpose To report the intra-familial phenotypic variation of granular corneal dystrophy (GCD) across different age groups.
   Method Two cases of GCD belonging to the same family (mother and daughter) were assessed and clinical findings were noted.
   Result An 18-year-old female with complaint of glare, on examination showed brownish granules involving bowman's layer and superficial corneal stroma suggesting a diagnosis of Bowman layer dystrophy. Screening of her mother revealed multiple diffuse white granular opacities with snowflake appearance involving the central cornea. The intervening cornea was clear and limbus was not involved. Focal illumination showed deep stromal involvement. All these findings were typical of GCD. Genetic analysis revealed mutation of TGF beta-1 located on 5q31 which was consistent with our clinical diagnosis of GCD.
   Conclusion Variable clinical presentation of GCD in different age groups can lead to diagnostic dilemma. Screening of family members can be helpful especially when dealing with early cases of GCD.

AB  - The first consensus report of the working party of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) set up in 2004 on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) was published in 2009. With international groups volunteering to join, the APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) was formed in 2012, which continued to collect prospective ACLF patient data. Based on the prospective data analysis of nearly 1400 patients, the AARC consensus was published in 2014. In the past nearly four-and-a-half years, the AARC database has been enriched to about 5200 cases by major hepatology centers across Asia. The data published during the interim period were carefully analyzed and areas of contention and new developments in the field of ACLF were prioritized in a systematic manner. The AARC database was also approached for answering some of the issues where published data were limited, such as liver failure grading, its impact on the Golden Therapeutic Window', extrahepatic organ dysfunction and failure, development of sepsis, distinctive features of acute decompensation from ACLF and pediatric ACLF and the issues were analyzed. These initiatives concluded in a two-day meeting in October 2018 at New Delhi with finalization of the new AARC consensus. Only those statements, which were based on evidence using the Grade System and were unanimously recommended, were accepted. Finalized statements were again circulated to all the experts and subsequently presented at the AARC investigators meeting at the AASLD in November 2018. The suggestions from the experts were used to revise and finalize the consensus. After detailed deliberations and data analysis, the original definition of ACLF was found to withstand the test of time and be able to identify a homogenous group of patients presenting with liver failure. New management options including the algorithms for the management of coagulation disorders, renal replacement therapy, sepsis, variceal bleed, antivirals and criteria for liver transplantation for ACLF patients were proposed. The final consensus statements along with the relevant background information and areas requiring future studies are presented here.

AB  - A 11-year-old boy presented with complaints of blurred vision and on evaluation was found to have X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) with angle-closure glaucoma. Clinical and genetic evaluation of first-degree family members was done. His brother had a milder form of XLRS with shallow anterior chamber. Topical dorzolamide 2% and timolol 0.5% were used to control intraocular pressure. Genetic analysis revealed a novel three base pair deleterious mutation (c. 375_ 377 del AGA) in exon-5 of the RS1 gene in three members of the family.

AB  - Background: The concturent occurrence of many noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factors is common, and it can play a synergistic role in occurrence of NCDs. Objectives: This study aimed to identify the magnitude of clustering of NCD risk factors, patterns of risk factors emerged in clustering, and variations in clustering of risk factors based on socioeconomic factors. Methods: Across-sectional survey was undertaken in an urban area of Puducheny among 2399 adults during 2014-2015. Sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors were assessed through a validated STEPS survey tool. Individuals with three or more risk factors were classified to have clustering of NCD risk factors. Socioeconomic positions in relation to clustering were identified through Chi-square analysis followed by multiple logistic regression where clustering at family and area was adjusted through multilevel modeling techniques. Results: Of the 2399 adults, 1741 (73%) had clustering of NCD risk factors. Inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, high salt intake, and high waist circumference are the three predominant risk factors across all subgroups. Adults belonging to Christian religion (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-5.2), aged 35 years and over (adjOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-6.0), and illiterates (adjOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-5.5) are more likely to have clustered NCD risk factors compared to others. Conclusions: Clustering of NCD risk factors is highly prevalent in this region and mainly driven by dietary practices and obesity measures. There is an urgent need to reorient the health system toward integrated approach with mandated inclusion of nutritionist in NCD health service delivery.

KW  - SOFT-TISSUE SARCOMAS
AB  - PURPOSE: There is no study till date determining the spectrum of adverse events of pazopanib in Indian patients with advanced sarcoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study by analyzing the case records of metastatic sarcoma patients treated with pazopanib from January 2016 to July 2017 in sarcoma medical oncology clinic. Toxicity was assessed according to CTCAE v.4.03 criteria. SPSS version 23 was used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients received pazopanib. The median age was 41 years (range, 19u75 years), with a male predominance (54.5%). Twenty-six patients (78.8%) had ECOG performance status 1 at the time of pazopanib initiation. The most common type of sarcoma was synovial sarcoma, and the mean duration of pazopanib intake in patients was 4.12 months. The median follow-up was 13 months. Median progression-free survival was 5 months, and median overall survival was 18 months. Overall response rate was 6.0%. Out of the 33 patients, 42.4% (n = 14) received it after first line of therapy. Six patients (18.2%) required dose reductions due to toxicity. Thirteen (39.4%) patients experienced CTCAE grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities experienced among patients were handufoot skin reaction (18.2%) and proteinuria (9.1%). No significant difference was seen when analyzed for variables such as age, sex, ECOG performance status, comorbidities, and number of previous lines received in patients experiencing grade 3 and 4 toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of adverse events in Indian patients at doses lower than the recommended dose is distinctly different from the western population. However, this unique toxicity profile needs to be validated in prospective studies.

TI  - Multistep Grading System for Evaluation of Chronic Ocular Sequelae in Patients With Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS
KW  - RISK-FACTORS
KW  - CLASSIFICATION
AB  - PURPOSE: To propose a new scoring system for grading of chronic ocular sequelae in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).
   DESIGN: Reliability and validity analysis.
   METHODS: PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eyes of 200 patients with chronic ocular SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) were included in the study. Settings: Single center, tertiary eye care referral center. PROCEDURE: All patients with SJS/TEN with chronic (more than 1 year) ocular sequelae were recruited for the study. Corneal, eyelid, and conjunctival signs were evaluated and given scores ranging from 0 to 5 depending on the increasing severity. Twelve signs (6 corneal, 3 conjunctival, and 3 eyelid) were evaluated to obtain the total severity score for each eye. Based on the corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and total score, each eye was graded using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correlation of CDVA with the severity score determined on the basis of 12 corneal, eyelid, and conjunctival signs.
   RESULTS: Mean age was 24.09 +/- 10.9 years. The most common inciting agent for SJS was oral medications (85%). The scores of 12 ocular surface parameters correlated significantly with CDVA (P < .001). ROC analysis revealed 4 grades of total severity score of 0-11 (stage 0), 12-16 (stage 1), 17-22 (stage 2), and 23-53 (stage 3). The total severity score correlated significantly with logMAR visual acuity grades with an agreement of 60.7% using Cohen's kappa analysis (kappa coefficient = 0.420 +/- 0.03). The most common stage of total severity score was stage 3 in 49% of eyes (196/400), followed by stage 0 (107/400, 26.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The multistep scoring system of chronic ocular features in SJS/TEN sequelae is a useful tool to grade all levels of severity. This may help to evaluate the efficacy of the surgical intervention by comparing preoperative with postoperative ocular grades. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To study the trends in collection, storage and utilization of donor corneas in eye banks in India. Methods: The data was collected from 12 eye banks in India that collected more than 1000 corneas per year. The retrospective analysis of the parameters like characteristics of the donor and the host, storage media used, number of eyes collected, number of eyes utilized, causes of non-utilization of the tissue and the procedures performed was done. Results: A total of 20,564 eyes were collected by the 12 eye banks during the year 2013-2014. Voluntary eye donation (VED), and hospital cornea retrieval program (HCRP) contributed to 59.6% and 40.4% of tissue procurement respectively. Whole globe enucleation (52.3%) was more commonly performed as compared to in-situ excision of the donor corneas. The most commonly used storage media at all eye banks was McCarey-Kaufman (MK) media (83.3%). The utilization rate of the donor eyes was 50.5%. The most frequent indication for corneal transplantation was infection (active infection -33.13%, healed infection -10.78%) followed by Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK) (13.57%). Full thickness keratoplasty (optical penetrating keratoplasty -47.23%, therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty -31.74%) was performed most often followed by endothelial keratoplasty (12.41%) in the developing country. Conclusion: VED still contributes to majority of the donor tissue retrieval in India. The majority of the eye banks still utilize whole globe enucleation technique and store tissues in MK media. Trends from previous years showed a change towards HCRP, in-situ excision technique and preservation in the long-term storage media.

AB  - Background: Extracranial head and neck schwannomas are rare tumors which are often clinically misdiagnosed. Preoperative diagnosis of these tumors is challenging but imperative for surgeons so as to avoid nerve damage during excision. Materials and Methods: Sixteen patients diagnosed with extracranial head and neck schwannomas over a period of 2 years were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical details including preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and/or computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were retrieved. FNAC smears and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were evaluated. Results: Among these 16 tumors, 6 (37.5%) were located in the lateral aspect of neck, 4 (25%) in scalp, 2 (12.5%) in orbit, and one each (6.25%) in palate, tongue, submandibular gland and parotid gland. The mean patient age was 31.3 years. FNAC was performed in 14 cases, of which 8 cases (58.3%) showed features of benign nerve sheath tumor (BNST), two cases (14.2%) were inconclusive with possibility of mesenchymal lesion, two cases (14.2%) were inadequate, one case (8.3%) showed features suggestive of schwannoma, and a diagnosis of nerve sheath tumor inconclusive for malignancy was rendered in a single case. The sensitivity of FNAC in diagnosis of BNST was 71.4%. CT or MRI was performed in five cases, of which an accurate diagnosis was rendered only in one case of orbital schwannoma. Conclusion: Imaging has a limited role in the preoperative diagnosis of head and neck schwannomas owing to nonspecific radiological features. Cellular aspirate smears are helpful in accurate diagnosis even at unusual locations.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the accuracy of a new, modified grading scheme involving a short vertical slit beam, at the inferior angle for peripheral anterior chamber depth (PAC) and angle estimation and its correlation with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT). Methods A cross-sectional study of consecutive phakic patients, above 40 years of age, was performed. Using a short, vertical slit beam not reaching the pupil, the inferior angle at the sclerolimbal junction was evaluated, photographed and assessed by a ratio of peripheral anterior chamber depth to peripheral corneal thickness (PAC:PCT) and iridocorneal angle (ICA) on ImageJ software. The inferior angle at the same meridian was also recorded on ASOCT. Results Based on the PAC:PCT ratio, the subjects were divided into four groups: I (<1/4), II (1/4-1/2), III (>1/2-1) and IV (>1). The clinically assessed angle by short vertical slit beam correlated well with ASOCT values, trabecular-iris angle (TIA) (r=0.918; p<0.001) and scleral spur angle (r=0.903, p<0.001). The mean difference between ICA and TIA on ASOCT was 0.797(0); 95% limits of agreement:-5.767(0) to 7.361(0) (+/- 1.96 SD). For angles graded narrow on ASOCT (TIA <20(0)), using a cut-off of peripheral PAC:PCT <1/4, the area under the curve was 0.918 with a sensitivity of 85.2% and a specificity of 88.2%. There was good agreement between ImageJ parameters with those assessed subjectively on photograph of the slit beam examination by a glaucoma fellow (weighted kappa=0.74) as compared with a general ophthalmologist, where there was moderate agreement (weighted kappa=0.57). Conclusion A short, vertical slit lamp beam evaluation at the inferior angle is an easy and relatively accurate method for both peripheral anterior chamber depth and angle assessment. It correlated well with ASOCT and can be used as a more reliable screening tool to identify eyes with possibly occludable angles.

AB  - The force-length characteristics of dense connective tissues (DCTs) vary non-linearly as a function of strain rate. However, there is no class of OpenSim (R) available to incorporate the effect of strain rate into the OpenSim (R) model. In this work, a new plugin for OpenSim (R) was developed to incorporate the non-linear strain rate behaviour of dense connective tissues (DCTs) of the human knee. Experimental force-length plots from the literature were used to extract the shape factor, scale factor, the coefficient of viscosity and elastic stiffness corresponding to specific strain rates. A new class object termed as NonLinearLigament was formulated using a customized plugin based on a structural constitutive model. A test platform was created to evaluate the force-length patterns at multiple strain rates ranging from 0.0001 s(-1) to 100 s(-1) for the DCT bundles. Knee kinematics of 25 DCT bundles were subjected to forward simulation at various strain rates. To understand the significance, the force length characteristics of each of the DCTs were simulated as a function of strain rate for both existing Ligament class of OpenSim (R) and the proposed NonLinearLigament class. In the proposed ligament class, higher forces were observed with an increase of strain rate in DCTs. Existing Ligament class in OpenSim (R) was devoid of any changes at different strain rates. In summary, the developed plugin takes into account the short term viscoelastic behaviour of DCTs and hence, would help in accurate modelling of tissue behaviour specifically for dynamic situations.

AB  - BackgroundMyasthenia gravis is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by easy fatigability and diurnal variation in skeletal muscle weakness. Aim of therapy is to prevent crisis and maintain remission. However, despite standard therapy, some remain refractory to treatment.Aims and objectivesTo look for efficacy of rituximab in treating refractory myasthenia gravis (MG) in the form of MGFA-PIS score, number of crisis, and dose reduction in immunotherapies.Material and methodsA retrospective study was performed in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) referred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) from January 2012 to December 2017 with follow-up of at least 6 months.ResultsEight refractory MG patients (six AchR positive and two Musk-positive) were identified on oral corticosteroids and azathioprine. After four cycles of rituximab, all patients showed a dose reduction of whom seven were completely tapered off prednisone and there was a 53.8% dose reduction in azathioprine. All patients were continued on AZA after RTX infusion unless contraindicated. Seven achieved minimal manifestation (MM)2 status as per the MGFA-PIS scale. None of the patients had infusion associated reactions or cytopenia post-RTX infusion.ConclusionIn this small retrospective study, we used RTX as induction therapy and results suggest that repeated RTX infusions may not be necessary as it adds to cost of therapy, especially in LMIC like India.

AB  - Corneal blindness is one of the major causes of reversible blindness, which can be managed with transplantation of a healthy donor cornea. It is the most successful organ transplantation in the human body as cornea is devoid of vasculature, minimizing the risk of graft rejection. The first successful transplant was performed by Zirm, and since then, corneal transplantation has seen significant evolution. It has been possible because of the relentless efforts by researchers and the increase in knowledge about corneal anatomy, improvement in instruments and advancements in technology. Keratoplasty has come a long way since the initial surgeries wherein the whole cornea was replaced to the present day where only the selective diseased layer can be replaced. These newer procedures maintain structural integrity and avoid catastrophic complications associated with open globe surgery. Corneal transplantation procedures are broadly classified as full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty and partial lamellar corneal surgeries which include anterior lamellar keratoplasty [sperficial anterior lamellar keratoplasty (SALK), automated lamellar therapeutic keratoplasty (ALTK) and deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK)] and posterior lamellar keratoplasty [Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK)] broadly.

AB  - Background: Limited data are available on the epidemiology of breast cancer (BC) in India.
   Objective: To study the epidemiological characteristics of BC patients attending a tertiary care hospital in National Capital Territory of India.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted and information from 320 women with confirmed BC was collected on a questionnaire for demographic profile, socioeconomic status (SES), reproductive risk factors, and family history of BC. Information on clinical presentation and staging of BC was recorded. Anthropometric assessment for body mass index (BMI) was done. Data were analyzed and presented as mean +/- standard deviation and frequency tables.
   Results: The mean age at diagnosis of BC was 47 +/- 10 years. Fifty-three percent of patients were illiterate or only primary school education. About 74% of patients were from urban areas. Only 11% of patients were from upper SES and 26% from lower SES. Forty-seven percent of patients had stage II followed by 36% with stage III BC. About 15% patients had experienced early menarche (<13 years of age) and 15% of women had attained late menopause (>51 years of age). About 42% of patients had <3 children and 15% patients had a family history of BC. About 38% patients were overweight and 21% were obese.
   Conclusion: Other than the established risk factors, other factors such as lack of education, SES, and higher BMI were present in our study. A higher percentage of women were diagnosed with BC at later stages. There is a need for educating women about BC, self-examination of breast, and screening programs for early detection of BC.

AB  - Hepatoblastoma (HB) constitutes less than 1% of all pediatric malignancies and is the most common malignant tumor of liver in children. The fine-needle aspiration cytological (FNAC) diagnosis and sub-typing of this tumor is challenging, which is of critical importance from its treatment point of view. All cases with a clinicoradiological impression of "HB" during the study period of 1 year were subjected to ultrasound-guided (USG) FNAC and cell blocks were prepared in all cases. Detailed cytopathological examination was carried out based on the cytomorphological pattern and the cell blocks were used to correlate the findings and the final diagnoses were confirmed with the histopathological findings. Four cases were included during this study period. All were children, whose age ranged from 3 months to 10 years. All of them presented with mass per abdomen and increased serum alfa-feto protein (AFP) levels. On a detailed cytological examination, the clinical impression of HB was confirmed in all four cases with a subsequent histological correlation. Based on their distinct cytomorphological pattern, three of them were accurately sub-typed as"fetal type," wile the fourth was an "embryonal type of HB." All four cases had the evidence of extramedullary hematopoeisis. We conclude that a precise preoperative FNAC diagnosis with accurate sub-typing of HB is possible purely on cytomorphologic basis which has prognostic and therapeutic implications. Cell blocks are of great use for ancillary studies. Extramedullary hematopoiesis serves as an important "clue" in diagnosis.

AB  - Background Paediatric vaccination against influenza can result in indirect protection, by reducing transmission to their unvaccinated contacts. We investigated whether influenza vaccination of children would protect them and their household members in a resource-limited setting.
   Methods We did a cluster-randomised, blinded, controlled study in three villages in India. Clusters were defined as households (ie, dwellings that shared a courtyard), and children aged 6 months to 10 years were eligible for vaccination as and when they became age-eligible throughout the study. Households were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer- based system to intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) or a control of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the beginning o f the study; vaccination occurred once a year for 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza in a vaccinated child with febrile acute respiratory illness, analysed in the modified intention-to-trea t population (ie, children who received at least one dose o f vaccine, were under surveillance, and had not an influenza infection within 15 days o f last vaccine dose). The secondary outcome for indirect effectiveness (surveillance study) was febrile acute respiratory illness in an unvaccinated household member o f a vaccine study participant. Data from each year (year 1: November, 2009, to October, 2010; year 2: October, 2010, to October, 2011; and year 3: October, 2011, to May, 2012) were analysed separately. Safety was analysed among all participants who were vaccinated with at least one dose o f the vaccine. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00934245.
   Findings Between Nov 1, 2009, to May 1, 2012, we enrolled 3208 households, of which 1959 had vaccine-eligible children. 1010 households were assigned to IIV3 and 949 households were assigned to IPV. In 3 years, we vaccinated 4345 children (2132 with IIV3 and 2213 with IPV) from 1868 households (968 with IIV3 and 900 with IPV) with 10813 unvaccinated household contacts. In year 1, influenza virus was detected in 151 (10%) of 1572 IIV3 recipients and 206 (13%) of 1633 of IPV recipients (total IIV3 vaccine efficacy 25.6% [95% Cl 6.8-40.6]; p=0.010). In year 2, 105 (6%) of 1705 IIV3 recipients and 182 (10%) of 1814 IPV recipients had influenza (vaccine efficacy 41.0% [24.1-54.1]; p<0.0001). In year 3, 20 (1%) of 1670 IIV3 recipients and 81 (5%) of 1786 IPV recipients had influenza (vaccine efficacy 74.2% [57.8-84.3]; p<0.0001). In year 1, total vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 14.5% (-20.4 to 39.3). In year 2, total vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H3N2) was 64.5% (48.5-75.5). Total vaccine efficacy against influenza B was 32.5% (11.3-48.6) in year 1, 4.9% (-38.9 to 34.9) in year 2, and 76.5% (59.4-86.4) in year 3. Indirect vaccine effectiveness was statistically significant only in year 3 (38.1% [7.4-58.6], p=0.0197) when influenza was detected in 39 (1%) of 4323 IIV3-allocated and 60 (1%) of 4121 IPV-allocated household unvaccinated individuals. In the IIV3 group, 225 (12%) of 1632 children in year 1, 375 (22%) of 1718 in year 2, and 209 (12%) of 1673 in year 3 had an adverse reaction (compared with 216 [13%] of 1730, 380 [21%] of 1825, and 235 [13%] of 1796, respectively, in the IPV group). The most common reactions in both groups were fever and tenderness at site. No vaccine-related deaths occurred in either group.
   Interpretation IIV3 provided variable direct and indirect protection against influenza infection. Indirect protection was significant during the year of highest direct protection and should be considered when quantifying the effect of vaccination programmes. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The associations between gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs), and cortical dysplasias remain debatable. We report five cases of drug refractory epilepsy with temporal lobe lesions. On resection, histopathological examination showed distinctive areas of gangliogliomas and DNETs with cortical dysplasia. The coexistence of the above three lesions as distinct entities in a single lesion is virtually unknown. This points to the presence of a possible etiological relationship among them. Finally, we also delve into a plausible hypothesis for such a pathogenesis.

AB  - Pain sensitivity is a recognized feature of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) but the contribution of spinal nociceptive circuitry to this phenomenon is unknown. Therefore, the objectives were to study the changes in spinal nociception i.e. nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) in patients with FMS and to investigate correlation if any, between NFR threshold, pain duration and tender points in FMS. One hundred and three patients with FMS and 74 healthy volunteers participated in the study. To record NFR, rural nerve was stimulated in the retro malleolar region and the reflex response was recorded from the short head of biceps femoris muscle. NFR was elicited at significantly lower [21.0(18.0-25.0)V] thresholds in FMS group when compared to healthy subjects [30.0(24.75-35.0)V; p = 0.001] indicating hyperalgesic response to electrocutaneous stimulation in FMS patients. The latency and other parameters of NFR were comparable in both the groups. No significant correlation was found among NFR threshold and pain duration or tender points. On the basis of results of present study, it may be concluded that the functional deficit of the spinal nociceptive system can contribute to hyperalgesia in FMS. This is first study that correlates a marker of central hyper-excitability (NFR threshold) with clinical symptoms (pain duration and tender points) of FMS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study describes an efficient method for isolation and purification of protein extracts from four types of human teeth i.e. molar, premolar, canine, and incisor. Detailed structural characterization of these protein extracts was done by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) which showed that a major fraction of the proteins present are unstructured in nature including primarily random coils in addition to the other structures like extended beta (beta) structure, poly-l-proline-type II (PPII) helix, turns, with only a small fraction constituting of ordered structures like alpha (alpha) helix and beta sheets. These resultant labile structures give the proteins the necessary flexibility that they require to interact with a variety of substrates including different ions like calcium and phosphates and for other protein-protein interactions. We also did initial studies on the mineralization of calcium phosphate with the protein extracts. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) show an increase in the size of calcium phosphate accumulation in the presence of protein extracts. We propose that protein extracts elevate the crystallization process of calcium phosphate. Our current biophysical study provides novel insights into the structural characterization of proteins from human teeth and their implications in understanding the tooth biomineralization. As per our knowledge, this is the first report which focuses on the whole protein extraction from different types of human teeth as these extracts imitate the in vivo tooth mineralization.

AB  - Recently, cell membrane-derived nanoparticles, particularly of RBCs, have been explored for delivery of hydrophilic solutes of varied size and complexities. So far, these naturally derived nanoparticles show a significant overlap with liposomes in terms of stability, solute encapsulation, and release. Unlike hydrophilic molecules, which are loaded inside the aqueous core, hydrophobic moieties largely partition inside the lipophilic shell, hence fate of these nanocarriers may be different. Since vesicles have more complex membrane architecture (due to natural lipids and additional proteins and glycoproteins), ease of loading hydrophobic drug, its release pattern, and overall particle stability cannot be compared to those of synthetic lipid-based carriers. Therefore, we derived nanovesicles (NVEs) from RBC membrane, loaded with hydrophobic drug camptothecin (CPT) and labeled noncovalently with amphiphilic fluorophore (CM-DiI). Although both CPT and CMDiI are known to partition inside the membrane, the overall stability of NVEs and composition of membrane proteins, particularly CD47, "marker of self', did not change. Additionally, the developed NVEs were found to be nonphagocytic even in the presence of serum and showed minimal stimulation of macrophages to release cytokines. Further, this system showed slow release but strong retention of CPT and CM-DiI, respectively, over 24 h, hence appropriate for theranostic applications. Also, NVEs were internalized by lung carcinoma cells and possessed slightly higher toxicity than free CPT. When injected intravenously in balb/c mice, these nanovesicles showed higher retention in blood over 48 h and insignificant accumulation in vital organs like heart and kidneys, thus suggesting its potential for in vivo application. We believe that this system has superior stealth and comparable physicochemical properties to synthetic lipid-based nanocarriers; hence, it can be further developed as personalized medicine.

AB  - Background: Cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. We analyzed national data to examine the prevalence of CVD risk factors among adult cancer survivors in the United States. Methods: Participants included adults >= 18 years of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2002 to 2013-2014. CVD risk factors included hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking, and physical activity. Prevalence of 1, 2, or >= 3 CVD risk factors was compared between cancer and noncancer participants. All CVD risk factors were adjusted for age and smoking and additionally for sex. Differences in CVD risk factors among cancer and noncancer participants were identified using logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 35,379 eligible participants, 2906 (8.4%) had a history of cancer. The proportion of participants having a single CVD risk factor was lower among cancer survivors compared with noncancer participants (25.8% vs. 33.9%, P < 0.001). The proportions of participants having two CVD risk factors (33.5% vs. 24.6%, P < 0.001) and >= 3 CVD risk factors (27.4% vs. 16.4%, P < 0.001) were higher among cancer survivors. However, these associations lost significance upon adjusting for age. The odds of total hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.40) and total diabetes (OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.08-1.65) were significantly higher among cancer survivors. Conclusions: Our study showed that adult cancer survivors in the United States had higher levels of CVD risk factors primarily due to age-related factors, in addition to cancer complications. There is a significant need for improved CVD risk assessment and prevention services for cancer survivors.

AB  - BackgroundRecently, in India, there has been a shift from NDM to OXA48-like carbapenemases. OXA-181 and OXA-232 are the frequently produced variants of OXA48-like carbapenemases. OXA48-like carbapenemases are also known to be carried on transposons such as Tn1999, Tn1999.2 and it is also associated with IS1R carried on Tn1999. In India, there are no previous reports studying the association of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) with OXA48-like carbapenemases. The present study was aimed at determining the genetic backbone of OXA48-like carbapenemases to determine the role of MGEs in its transfer and to investigate the Inc plasmid type carrying bla(OXA48-like).ResultsA total of 49 carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae which included 25 isolates from South India and 24 isolates from North India, were included in the study. Whole genome sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM was performed to study the isolates. OXA-232 was present in 35 isolates (71%). In 19 isolates (39%), bla(OXA48-like) was associated with MGEs. Insertion sequences such as ISX4, IS1, IS3, ISKpn1, ISKpn26, ISKpn25, ISSpu2, ISKox1, IS4321R, ISEc36, and ISPa38; and transposons such as TnAs3 and Tn2, were present. Isolates from northern and southern India belonging to same sequence type (ST) had diverse genetic backbone for bla(OXA48-like). ST14 isolates from north had IS5 and Tn3 families while from south they had IS1, IS5 and IS630 families. ST231 from north had IS5, IS6 and Tn3 families with bla(OXA-232) while from south, IS1, IS3 and IS5 families were observed; with ISKpn26 being present among isolates from both the regions. bla(OXA48-like) was predominantly found on ColKP3 plasmid. ST231 was the predominant ST in 22 isolates (45%).ConclusionOXA-232 is the predominant variant of OXA48-like carbapenemase with ST231 being the commonest ST of OXA48-like carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae in India. Diverse MGEs have been associated with both bla(OXA-232) and bla(OXA-181) which contribute to their spread. The MGEs in the present study are different from those reported earlier. There is no clonal expansion of bla(OXA48-like) producing K. pneumoniae since diverse STs were observed. Monitoring the genetic backbone of OXA48-like carbapenemase is essential to better understand the transmission dynamics of XDR K. pneumoniae.

AB  - Introduction: Treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major challenge. The increase in multi-drug resistant bacteria has not been accompanied by the validation of new drugs, or by any new antimicrobial strategies to exploit the available agents. VAP due to Gram-negative bacteria has increased mortality, both due to the resistant pathogens themselves and due to inappropriate treatment. Local epidemiology, patients' characteristics and clinical responses provide the most important information for therapeutic decision-making. Moreover, data on VAP therapy due to resistant bacteria are lacking, and the choice of treatment is often based on clinical practice and individual experience. Areas covered: This review summarizes the strategies available for treating the three most prevalent resistant Gram-negative organisms causing VAP: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. The review covers the results of a Pubmed search, clinical practice guidelines and reviews, and the authors' experience. Expert opinion: The existing evidence focuses on bloodstream infections or other sites rather than pneumonia and there are no recommendations for the treatment of VAP by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, especially for combination regimens. The approval of new drugs is needed to provide effective and safe alternatives for treating carbapenemase-producing strains. Precision medicine and personalized approach are also fundamental in future research.

AB  - Introduction
   Women in developing countries continue to face barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, with marginalized women facing increased challenges to accessing care. The Diagonal Interventions to Fast-Forward Enhanced Reproductive Health (DIFFER) project implemented a package of interventions for female sex workers and women from the general population which integrated horizontal health services for the general population with existing vertical targeted interventions aimed at sex workers with an aim to improve SRH and HIV services. We present an outcome evaluation of the DIFFER project in terms of uptake rates for SRH services among sex workers in Mysore, India.
   Methods
   Ashodaya Samithi, a sex worker-led organization, implemented the DIFFER strategy through their community-based clinic and a Well Women Clinic (WWC), established at a partner private hospital that provided SRH services for women living with HIV. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the intervention that included a baseline (2012-13) and end of project (2015-16) cross sectional surveys (CSS), focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews, and analysis of service statistics from 2013-2016.
   Results
   The CSS found that condom use, STI testing, and treatment were high before, and throughout the intervention; cervical cancer screening and treatment increased significantly, from 11.5% to 56% (aOR 9.85, p<0.001) and HIV testing in the last 3 months increased from 26.3% to 73.3% (aOR 7.25, p<0.001). The proportion of sex workers using any SRH service in the past year doubled from 25.7% to 51.4% (aOR 2.91, p<0.001). Service statistics showed similar trends. The FGDs and key informant interviews showed that women and stakeholders held high levels of satisfaction with the strategy, and affirmed potential for scale up.
   Conclusion
   The DIFFER strategy demonstrated that SRH service uptake can occur in conjuction with HIV services offered to sex workers. This model of integrated service delivery has been accepted by policy makers and needs further analysis for scaling up.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to report the clinical and radiological outcome of using the modern porous metal cup in patients undergoing acute total hip arthroplasty (THA) for selected subset of acetabular fractures. Patient and methods: Eighteen patients with acetabular fracture underwent acute THA with modern porous metal cup from a single manufacturer. Fifteen males and three females with a mean age of 46.4 years (range 21-57 years) were ambispectively followed up for a minimum period of 48 months. All patients were evaluated clinically with Harris Hip Scores (HHS) and radiographically with serial X-rays. Results: No patient was lost to follow-up. The HHS was excellent in nine patients, good in six patients, fair in two patients, and poor in one patient. All the fractures were united and the cups were well integrated. There was no lucent line seen in any acetabular zones on the X-rays. One patient had infection, which resolved with debridement. There was one dislocation following fall, which was reduced by closed means and remained stable. One of the two patients with heterotopic ossification had restricted movement of hip but not restricting the activities of daily living. No failures of acetabular component were seen in the study. Conclusion: The current study showed that the modern porous metal cup provides sufficient primary stability and appear suitable for primary THA in acute acetabular fractures at mid-term follow-up: (i) In selected fractures, acute THA can be extended to young adult patients as well. (ii) Modern porous metal cup may provide sufficient stability with or without additional fixation required.

AB  - This study aimed to determine whether there is an influence of interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene promoter polymorphisms on IL-6 plasma levels and its role in the development of ischemic stroke in young Indians. One hundred young patients with ischemic stroke (age >= 45 years) and equal number of age- and sex-matched controls were genotyped for 174G>C, -572G>C, and -597G>A promoter polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma IL-6 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls (patients: 28.61 +/- 8.61 pg/mL, controls: 7.60 +/- 4.10 pg/mL, P = .001). Both -174G>C (allelic chi(2)/P value: 4.79/.028, genotypic chi(2)/P value: 5.3/.021) and -572G>C (allelic chi(2)/P value: 9.63/.00113 Genotypic chi(2)/P value: 74/.0002) polymorphisms exhibited genotypic as well as allelic significant association with the disease phenotype. Comparison was made between patients and controls for all 3 polymorphisms using a recessive model with respect to plasma IL-6 levels; no polymorphism showed any significant correlative association with the increased IL-6 levels (P = .31, .51, .32). Interleukin 6 is an inflammatory marker that is considerably influenced by nongenetic factors and is not a good candidate gene for studying genetic components associated with ischemic stroke. It seems that the variability in IL-6 levels is an integrated effect of nongenetic influences and the inflammatory events that follow ischemic stroke instead of being its cause. It is suggested that there is no direct association between -174G>C, -572G>C, and -597G>A polymorphisms and elevated IL-6 levels in the development of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Atypical Parkinson syndromes (APSs) often have symptoms that overlap with those of Parkinson's disease (PD), especially early in the disease, making these disorders difficult to diagnose. Previous studies have demonstrated an association of oligomeric alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn), a key element in the pathogenesis of PD, with Sirtuin (SIRT)2 proteins for modulating PD. We aimed to evaluate SIRT protein expression in serum of PD patients and compare it with APSs and normal elderly control (GC) and to correlate this with alpha-Syn. SIRT protein expression was evaluated in sera of 68 PD; 34 APS and 68 GC without any neuro-psychiatric illness as controls by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SIRT2 expression was correlated with alpha-Syn in PD and GC. Significant (p < 0.0001) differences were observed between serum SIRT2 concentration in PD and APS and GC as well as between APS and GC. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed the strong cut-off value to differentiate PD from APS and GC and also APS from GC. Significant correlation was observed among SIRT2 levels in early PD patients with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn & Yahr (H & Y) and increased duration of disease. In addition, a strong positive correlation of SIRT2 with alpha-Syn (p < 0.0001) was observed. However, no such difference was detected for serum SIRT1 in cases of PD and APS or for GC. The present study is the first to report elevated serum SIRT2 in PD. The study also provided a simple test to distinguish PD from APS and may have translational utility for diagnosis.

AB  - G-quadruplex structure forming motifs are among the most studied evolutionarily conserved drug targets that are present throughout the genome of different organisms and susceptible to influencing various biological processes. Here we report highly conserved potential G-quadruplex motifs (PGQs) in three essential genes (espK, espB, and cyp51) among 160 strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Products of these genes are involved in pathways that are responsible for virulence determination of bacteria inside the host cell and its survival by maintaining membrane fluidity. The espK and espB genes are essential players that prevent the formation of mature phagolysosome and antigen presentation by host macrophages. The cyp51 is another PGQ-possessing gene involved in sterol biosynthesis pathway and membrane formation. In the present study, we revealed the formation of stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures by Mycobacterium PGQs using a combination of techniques (NMR, circular dichroism [CD], and gel electrophoresis). Next, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and CD melting analysis demonstrated that a well-known G-quadruplex ligand, TMPyP4, binds to and stabilizes these PGQ motifs. Finally, polymerase inhibition and qRT-PCR assays highlight the biological relevance of PGQ-possessing genes in this pathogen and demonstrate that G-quadruplexes are potential drug targets for the development of effective anti-tuberculosis therapeutics.

AB  - Background: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), an important cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), is characterized by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Autoantibodies to factor H (FH), a chief regulator of this pathway, account for a distinct subgroup. While high anti-FH titers predict relapse, they do not correlate well with disease activity and their functional characterization is required.
   Methods: Of 781 patients <18-year-old of aHUS in the nationwide database from 2007 to 2018, 436 (55.8%) had anti-FH antibodies. Clinical features and outcome of patients managed in the last 6-year (n = 317) were compared to before (n = 119). In plasma samples of 44 patients, levels of serial circulating FH immune complexes (CIC), free FH, soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9), sheep red blood cell (SRBC) lysis and epitope specificity (n = 8) were examined. Functional renal reserve, ambulatory hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and proteinuria were evaluated in a subset.
   Results: Patients presented with markedly elevated anti-FH titers (10,633.2 +/- 998.5 AU/ml). Management varied by center, comprising plasma exchange (PEX; 77.5%) and immunosuppression (73.9%). Patients managed in the last 6-year showed better renal survival at mean 28.5 +/- 27.3 months (log rank P = 0.022). Mean anti-FH titers stayed 700-1,164 AU/ml during prolonged follow-up, correlating with CIC. Patients with relapse had lower free-FH during remission [Generalized estimating equations (GEE), P = 0.001]; anti-FH levels >= 1,330 AU/ml and free FH <= 440 mg/I predicted relapse (hazards ratio, HR 6.3; P = 0.018). Epitope specificity was similar during onset, remission and relapse. Antibody titer >= 8,000 AU/ml (HR 2.23; P = 0.024), time to PEX >= 14 days (HR 2.09; P = 0.071) and PEX for <14 days (HR 2.60; P = 0.017) predicted adverse renal outcomes. Combined PEX and immunosuppression improved long-term outcomes (HR 0.37; P = 0.026); maintenance therapy reduced risk of relapses (HR 0.11; P < 0.001). At 4.4 +/- 2.5 year, median renal reserve was 15.9%; severe ambulatory, masked and pre-hypertension were found in 38, 30, and 18%, respectively. Proteinuria and LVH occurred in 58 and 28% patients, respectively.
   Conclusion: Prompt recognition and therapy with PEX and immunosuppression, is associated with satisfactory outcomes. Free-FH predicts early relapses in patients with high anti-FH titers. A significant proportion of impaired functional reserve, ambulatory hypertension, proteinuria and LVH highlight the need for vigilant long-term follow-up.

AB  - The present study was planned to evaluate the benefit of synergetic effect of Metformin plus Myo-inositol versus Metformin alone in infertile polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women undergoing ovulation induction. One hundred and twenty infertile PCOS women were randomized: Group I (n = 60) received Metformin (500 mg) plus Myoinositol(600 mg) three times a day; Group II received Metformin 500 mg three times a day. Subjects were advised to try for spontaneous conception. Those who did not conceive after 3 months, were given three cycles of ovulation induction + intrauterine insemination. Hormonal and biochemical profile parameters were done at baseline and after 3 months of therapy. Primary outcome measure was live birth rate. Secondary outcomes were improvement in menstrual cycle, hormonal and biochemical parameters, spontaneous conception, abortions, multiple pregnancy, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Baseline demographic, hormonal and biochemical parameters were comparable in two groups. There was a significant improvement in menstrual cycles (cycle length and bleeding days) in Group I as compared to Group II. The improvement in biochemical and hormonal parameters were comparable in the two groups after 3 months. Live birth rate was significantly higher in the Group I as compared to Group II [55% (33/60); 26.67% (16/60); p = .002]. The study concluded significantly higher live birth rate in women receiving the combination as compared to metformin alone.

AB  - In the present study, we have evaluated the nephroprotective effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia chebula in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity model. Standardised extract was orally administered to Wistar rats for 10 days at different doses. On day 7, 8 mg/kg of cisplatin was administered intra-peritoneally to rats in all groups. T. chebula, in a dose-dependent manner significantly inhibited the elevation of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and oxidant stress markers. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed the increased levels of apoptotic markers and cytokines in cisplatin group were significantly lowered by T. chebula extract. The cisplatin-treated rats kidney showed diffused tubular necrosis and infilteration of inflammatory cells which was reversed in the treatment group. Chemical characterisation of extract by HPLC revealed the presence of corilagin, chebulinic, chebulagic, chebulic, gallic and ellagic acid. The findings of this study discovered that T. chebula ameliorated oxidative and histological damage caused by cisplatin.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with genetic and environmental contributions. Hallmarks of the disease are the appearance of immune complexes (IC) containing autoreactive Abs and TLR-activating nucleic acids, whose deposition in kidney glomeruli is suspected to promote tissue injury and glomerulonephritis (GN). Here, using a mouse model based on the human SLE susceptibility locus TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1, also known as ABIN1), we investigated the pathogenesis of GN. We found that GN was driven by TLRs but, remarkably, proceeded independently of ICs. Rather, disease in 3 different mouse models and patients with SLE was characterized by glomerular accumulation of patrolling monocytes (PMos), a cell type with an emerging key function in vascular inflammation. Consistent with such function in GN, monocyte-specific deletion of ABIN1 promoted kidney disease, whereas selective elimination of PMos provided protection. In contrast to GN, PMo elimination did not protect from reduced survival or disease symptoms such as IC generation and splenomegaly, suggesting that GN and other inflammatory processes are governed by distinct pathogenic mechanisms. These data identify TLR-activated PMos as the principal component of an intravascular process that contributes to glomerular inflammation and kidney injury.

AB  - Introduction: Preanalytical conditions are critical for blood sample integrity and poses challenge in surveys involving biochemical measurements. A cross sectional study was conducted to assess the stability of select biomarkers at conditions that mimic field situations in surveys.
   Material and methods: Blood from 420 volunteers was exposed to 2 - 8 degrees C, room temperature (RT), 22 - 30 degrees C and > 30 degrees C for 30 min, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours prior to centrifugation. After different exposures, whole blood (N = 35) was used to assess stability of haemoglobin, HbA1c and erythrocyte folate; serum (N = 35) for assessing stability of ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), vitamins B12, A and D, zinc, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), tryglicerides, albumin, total protein and creatinine; and plasma (N = 35) was used for glucose. The mean % deviation of the analytes was compared with the total change limit (TCL), computed from analytical and intra-individual imprecision. Values that were within the TCL were deemed to be stable.
   Result: Creatinine (mean % deviation 14.6, TCL 5.9), haemoglobin (16.4%, TCL 4.4) and folate (33.6%, TCL 22.6) were unstable after 12 hours at 22-30 degrees C, a temperature at which other analytes were stable. Creatinine was unstable even at RT for 12 hours (mean % deviation: 10.4). Albumin, CRP, glucose, cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, vitamins B12 and A, sTfR and HbA1c were stable at all studied conditions.
   Conclusion: All analytes other than creatinine, folate and haemoglobin can be reliably estimated in blood samples exposed to 22-30 degrees C for 12 hours in community-based studies.

T2  - OPHTHALMIC SURGERY LASERS & IMAGING RETINA
AB  - Preoperative embolization is currently widely followed in the treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) to reduce intraoperative bleeding. However, embolization can result in untoward complications like stroke and blindness. The authors present the case of a 14-year-old boy with recurrent JNA who developed hemi-central retinal artery occlusion after embolization of branches of the external carotid artery. It was managed by intraocular pressure reduction and globe massage to dislodge the possible embolus. At 4 weeks' follow-up, there was near complete recovery in visual acuity; however, residual hemi-field defect persisted.

AB  - India has the largest number of dengue cases in the world, contributing approximately 34% of the global burden. The framework for a geospatially enabled early warning and adaptive response system (EWARS) was first proposed in 2008. It was meant to be a decision support system for enhancing traditional surveillance methods for preventing mosquito-borne diseases in India by utilizing remote sensing data and fuzzy logic-based mathematical predictive modeling. This conceptual paper presents a significant evolution of EWARS such that it synthesizes inputs from not only traditional surveillance and reporting systems for dengue but also from the public via participatory disease surveillance. Two smartphone-based applications have been developed to support EWARS. The firstMOSappallows field health workers to upload surveillance data and collect key data on environmental parameters by both direct observation and via portable microclimate stations. The secondDISappcollects relevant information directly from the community to support participatory disease surveillance. It also gives the user a real-time estimate of the risk of exposure to dengue in proximity to their home and has an educational component that provides information on relevant preventive measures. Both applications utilize a new mosquito abundance measurethe mosquito perception index (MPI)as reported by the user. These data streams will feed into the EWARS model to generate dynamic risk maps that can guide resource optimization and strengthen disease surveillance, prevention, and response. It is anticipated that such an approach can assist in addressing gaps in the current system of dengue surveillance and control in India.

AB  - Lipids foster energy production and their altered levels have been coupled with metabolic ailments. Indians feature high prevalence of metabolic diseases, yet uncharacterized for genes regulating lipid homeostasis. We performed first GWAS for quantitative lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) exclusively in 5271 Indians. Further to corroborate our genetic findings, we investigated DNA methylation marks in peripheral blood in Indians at the identified loci (N= 233) and retrieved gene regulatory features from public domains. Recurrent GWAS loci-CELSR2, CETP, LPL, ZNF259, and BUD13 cropped up as lead signals in Indians, reflecting their universal applicability. Besides established variants, we found certain unreported variants at sub-genome-wide level-QKI, REEP3, TMCC2, FAM129C, FAM241B, and LOC100506207. These variants though failed to attain GWAS significance in Indians, but largely turned out to be active CpG sites in human subcutaneous adipose tissue and showed robust association to two or more lipid traits. Of which, QKI variants showed significant association to all four lipid traits and their designated region was observed to be a key gene regulatory segment denoting active transcription particularly in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Both established and novel loci were observed to be significantly associated with altered DNA methylation in Indians for specific CpGs that resided in key regulatory elements. Further, gene-based association analysis pinpointed novel GWAS loci-LINC01340 and IQCJ-SCHIP1 for TC; IFT27, IFT88, and LINCO2141 for HDL; and TEX26 for TG. Present study ascertains universality of selected known genes and also identifies certain novel loci for lipids in Indians by integrating data from various levels of gene regulation.

AB  - Introduction: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a broad heterogeneous diagnostic construct. Previous studies have shown that it can be resolved into several symptom-clusters which are proposed to be associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the serotonergic pathway (5-HTTLPR, 5HTR1A, 5-HTR2A).
   Methods and material: In a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary level mental health care set-up in north India, 80 out-patients with MDD were evaluated with Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and then genotyping was done. The different clinical and genetic variables were compared across the factor structures of MADRS. Also, the comparison of the genetic data of cases was done with the pre-existing database of the non-blood related healthy ethnically-matched controls.
   Results: There was no significant association between age, gender, other clinical variables, SNPs like 5-HTTLPR SS/SL, rs6295 CC/CG/GG, rs6311GG/GA/AA, rs6313 CC/CT/TT and different factor-structures like 'detachment' consisting of items like concentration difficulty, lassitude, inability to feel; 'psychic anxiety' consisting of suicidal thoughts and inner tension; 'mood-pessimism' consisting of symptoms like apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts and 'vegetative symptoms' like decreased sleep, poor appetite. Neither there was any association between genotype of the cases compared with the controls.
   Conclusions: No significant association was obtained between the four-factor structures of depression in MADRS and serotonin transporter and receptor SNPs in a study with a small sample size. This study evaluates whether depression symptom-clusters have distinct genotypic determinants and necessitates more comprehensive studies for unravelling the genetic determinants of depression.

AB  - Application of color on the external body surface before, during, and after death, such as during a festivity, cultural occasion, or after death ritual, can present as an artifact at forensic autopsy. The present study is a retrospective review of body color artifacts collected from postmortem reports, inquest papers and photographs of each individual case autopsied at our institutes during a 12 year period from 2004 to 2015. The reason for body colorations were various festivities, after death rituals and beautification products, among others. The body coloration mimicked antemortem changes, such as cyanosis, injury, jaundice, and congestion, as well as postmortem changes, such as postmortem lividity and early decomposition changes. These artifacts were differentiated by seeing the body before the washing of the color, history of the application of the color, and by various additional features, such as unusual appearance, distribution, and sites. They were not supported by any other findings on the body to consider them as genuine antemortem or postmortem findings.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is central to phosphate homeostasis. The author examined if blood levels of FGF23 allow discrimination of classic hypophosphatemic ricketsfrom other causes of non-nutritional rickets with hypophosphatemia. Forty-two children (median age:102 mo) with non-nutritional rickets and hypophosphatemia were clinically classified as having distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA, n=12), Fanconi syndrome (n=8), classic hypophosphatemic rickets (n=11), vitamin D dependent rickets (n=7) and Dent disease (n=4). Median blood FGF23 (measured by C-terminal ELISA) concentrations were similar in all groups (P=0.24). These levels did not correlate with phosphate, tubular maximum for phosphate, calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine, and parathormone levels. Patients with distal RTA showed variable degree of proximal tubular dysfunction that resolved following alkali supplements. Blood FGF23 levels did not satisfactorily differentiate classic hypophosphatemic rickets from other causes of hypophosphatemic rickets.

AB  - Escherichia coli (E. coli) colonizes human intestinal tract and is usually harmless to the host. However, several strains of E. coli have acquired virulent genes and could cause enteric diseases, urinary tract and even brain infections. Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) which can result in bloody diarrhoea and could potentially lead to deadly heamolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). STEC is one of the important food borne pathogens that causes food poisoning leading to diarrhoea and number of STEC outbreaks have occurred across the world. The use of standard antibiotics to treat STEC infection is not recommended as it increases the production of shiga toxin which could lead to HUS. Therefore, use of alternative approaches which include use of plant products to treat STEC infections have been gaining attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum) against STEC strains isolated from various patient and food samples using in vitro assays. The microbiological isolation of STEC from various patient and food samples resulted in eight STEC isolates of which seven strains were multidrug resistant. Antibacterial assay results indicated that all the strains exhibited dose dependent sensitivity towards garlic with zone of inhibition diameters ranging from 7 to 24mm with 15 mu l of fresh garlic extract (FGE). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of FGE for isolates ranged from 30 to 140 mu l/ml. Interestingly, the biofilm formation ofall isolates in presence of 4% of FGE decreased by 35 to 59%. FTIR analysis indicated that treatment with 1% FGE results in compositional and content changes in thebiofilm. In addition, the total carbohydrate content of biofilm was reduced by 40% upon 1% FGE treatment. The results of the present study report for the first time theantibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of garlic against STEC. The findings will enable development of novelgarlic organosulfide based drugs for the prevention and treatment of STEC infections.

AB  - Elevated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is reported to correlate with B symptoms, response rate and survival in adult patients. The authors studied prognostic significance of IL-6 expression by immunohistochemistry on Hodgkin-Reed Sternberg cells and background reactive cells in a retrospective cohort of pediatric HL patients treated with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) from January 2009 through December 2013. Of 142 patients, tissue blocks were retrieved in 110 patients. On logistic regression analysis, IL-6 expression on background cells alone was among the factors associated with inferior response rate (OR-9.9, 95%CI-1.2, 78.3; p=0.03). On multivariate analysis, IL-6 expression on background cells alone had significant impact on 5 y freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) (HR-7.7, 95% CI-1.2, 48.6; p=0.03). IL-6 expression by immunohistochemistry in the background cells is an independent poor predictor of response and FFTF in pediatric HL. Further prospective studies in children are needed to confirm the current findings and whether IL-6 expression can be used to stratify treatment.

AB  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited heart failure condition, mostly found to have genetic abnormalities, and is a leading cause of sudden death in young adults. Whole exome sequencing should be given consideration as a molecular diagnostic tool to identify disease-causing mutation/s. In this study, a HCM family with multiple affected members having history of sudden death were subjected to exome sequencing along with unaffected members. Quality passed variants obtained were filtered for rarity (MAF>0.5%), evolutionary conservation, pathogenic prediction, and segregation in affected members after removing shared variants present in unaffected members. Only one non-synonymous mutation (p. Glu186Lys or E186K) in exon 6 of P2X7 gene segregated in HCM-affected individuals which was absent in unaffected family members and 100 clinically evaluated controls. The site of the mutation is highly conserved and led to complete loss of function which is in close vicinity to ATP-binding site-forming residues, affecting ATP binding, channel gating, or both. Mutations in candidate genes which were not segregated define clinical heterogeneity within affected members. P2X7 gene is highly expressed in the heart and shows direct interaction with major candidate genes for HCM. Our results reveal a significant putative HCM causative gene, P2X7, for the first time and show that germ-line mutations in P2X7 may cause a defective phenotype, suggesting purinergic receptor involvement in heart failure mediated through arrhythmias which need further investigations to be targeted for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Objective: The technique of distraction, compression, extension, and reduction (DCER) is effective to reduce, realigns, and relieve cranio-spinal compression through posterior only approach.
   Methods: Study included all patients with atlantoaxial dislocation and basilar invagination (BI) with occipitalized C1 arch. Study techniques included Nurick grading, computed tomography scan to study atlanto-dental interval, BI, hyper-lordosis, and neck tilt. Sagittal inclination (SI), coronal inclination (CI), cranio-cervical tilt, presence of pseudo-joints, and anomalous vertebral artery were also noted. Patients underwent DCER with/without joint remodeling or extra-articular distraction (EAD) based on the SI being < 100 degrees, 100 degrees-160 degrees, or > 160 degrees respectively. In cases with pseudo-joints, joint remodeling was performed in type I and EAD in type II. Customized 'bullet shaped' PSC spacers (n = 124) and prototype of the universal craniovertebral junction reducer (UCVJR, n = 36) were useful.
   Results: A total of 148 patients with average age 27.25 +/- 17.43 years, ranging from 3 to 71 years (87 males) were operated. Nurick's grading improved from 3.14 +/- 1.872 to 1.22 +/- 1.17 (p < 0.0001). Fifty-two percent of total joints (n = 154/296 joints) were either type I (19%)/type II (33%) pseudo-joints. All traditional indices such as Chamberlein line, McRae line, atlanto-dental interval, and Ranawat line improved (p < at least 0.001). BI, SI, and CI values correlated with type of pseudo-joints (p < 0.0001). Side of neck tilt correlated with the type of pseudo-joint (p < 0.0001). Cervical hyperlordosis improved significantly (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Occipito-C2 pseudo-joints are important in determining the severity of BI. Asymmetrical pseudo-joint causes coronal/neck tilt. Type of pseudo-joint can strategize by DCER. Customized instruments and implants make technique safe, effective and easier.

AB  - Purpose: Bilateral eye surgery in the same session may be required for advancing stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of immediate sequential bilateral vitreoretinal surgery (ISBVS) in stage 4 ROP. Methods: In a retrospective interventional study at a tertiary care center, 60 eyes of 30 infants who underwent ISBVS for stage 4 ROP between December 2015 and May 2017 were studied. In cases with clear retrolental access, 25G or 27G lens sparing vitrectomy (LSV) was performed and in the rest 25G lensectomy with vitrectomy (LV) was performed through clear corneal entries. The final anatomical outcome measures were the status of tractional retinal detachment (TRD) and macular status. Results: The mean gestational age was 28.4 +/- 2.0 weeks and birth weight was 1214.5 +/- 329.7gms. The mean postconceptional age at surgery was 40.8 +/- 2.2 weeks. Stages 4a and 4b were present in 86.7% and 13.3% eyes respectively. LSV was performed in 95% eyes whereas LV was performed in the rest. None of the eyes developed lens touch, choroidal hemorrhage, postoperative hypotony, corneal decompensation, or endophthalmitis. At last follow-up (mean 45 weeks, range 20-68 weeks), macula was attached in 90% eyes with the TRD resolved completely in 61.7% eyes and significantly decreased in another 25% eyes. Sequalae included macular drag, epiretinal membrane, and progression to fibrotic stage 5 disease. Conclusion: ISBVS is safe and effective for bilateral stage 4 ROP and should be recommended in rapidly progressive cases.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the short-term incidence, clinical features, and management of glaucoma in children after successful surgery for stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Methods: The retrospective study included all eyes undergoing successful surgery for stage 4 ROP with good outcomes at a tertiary eye care center between June 2014 and June 2016. Cases developing postoperative glaucoma underwent examination under anesthesia for measurement of intraocular pressures (IOP), corneal diameters, Retcam-assisted fundus imaging, and gonioscopy. Outcomes of glaucoma management were evaluated. Results: Hundred eyes of 70 babies underwent successful surgery for stage 4 ROP (with postoperative attached retina, and minimal sequelae) with minimum follow-up of 15 months. Six eyes (6%) developed postoperative glaucoma. Of these, four eyes had undergone lens-sparing vitrectomy and two were managed with lensectomy and vitrectomy (LV). Median time duration for development of glaucoma after primary vitreous surgery was 17.5 weeks. Two cases could be managed with topical IOP-lowering agents alone, whereas four required filtering surgeries (trabeculotomy with trabeculectomy and 0.04% mitomycin C [MMC] application). Average IOP decreased from 25 +/- 2.36 to 12.2 +/- 2.05 mmHg at 12 months from glaucoma diagnosis. Conclusion: Glaucoma is a potential adverse event following successful vitreous surgery for stage 4 ROP. A combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy along with MMC gives favorable outcome.

AB  - A safe technique for entry incisions and closure in stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) surgery is being described. Three 23G clear corneal incisions are made which allow for safe and snug entry of 25G calibrated infusion and 25G instruments for performing lensectomy, membrane removal and vitrectomy. At the end of surgery, air is injected and corneal entries are hydrated for sutureless closure. The technique was performed in 50 eyes of 36 children with stage 5 ROP. The hybrid technique ensured safe entry and exit with stable anterior chamber during surgery. None of the cases developed retinal breaks during surgical entry nor had any complications such as hypotony, flat anterior chamber, hyphaema or corneal edema in post operative period. Clear corneal entry using 23G incisions for 25G instrument access is a safe and effective technique for performing lensectomy and vitrectomy with sutureless closure in cases with stage 5 ROP.

AB  - We report a case of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in an infant with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), with the challenges faced in diagnosis, and subsequent management. Poor fundus contrast and blanching of retinal vessels on indentation caused significant visualization problems in detection of ridge and extraretinal vessel proliferation. Careful examination revealed zone 2 Stage 3 ROP with preplus disease in both eyes. Laser photocoagulation was attempted, but laser uptake was poor. The disease regressed over 3-week close follow-up. ROP along with OCA is a rare finding. There is a need for high index of suspicion and caution while screening and managing such babies.

AB  - A preterm infant with zone 1 aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity developed infectious endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. Urgent empirical intravitreal therapy with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and dexamethasone along with intravenous therapy with amikacin and meropenem helped in early resolution. Vascularization/ activity of disease subsided on follow-up, media cleared, and laser photocoagulation was completed. Later the disease reactivated, developed vitreous membranes and central retinal traction, for which 25-gauge lens-sparing vitrectomy was performed. Emergent treatment helped in salvaging the eye from both aggressive ROP disease and devastating endophthalmitis. Rationale approach to such a case is being discussed.

AB  - Scrub typhus is largely ignored in India particularly during outbreaks of viral fever. The disease course is often complicated leading to fatalities in the absence of treatment. However, if diagnosed early and a specific treatment is initiated, the cure rate is high. We report here five cases of scrub typhus to highlight the fact that high clinical suspicion for such a deadly disease is an absolute necessity.

AB  - Fe/Ti-layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been hydrothermally prepared and characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for evaluation of its structure, morphology, and optical properties. The purpose of doping Ti4+ with Fe3+ toward the synthesis of Fe/Ti LDH is to extend the absorption of the nanomaterial to longer wavelength, which is known to exhibit higher electron transport performance. To provide a practical realization, electron transport modeling across the band gap has been interpreted using exponential, Gaussian, and mixed Gauss-exponential distribution. The conduction band energy (E-C) has been calculated by using the observed values of band gap (E-g) and potential of the LDH. A detailed study has been undertaken to investigate the pattern of theoretical density of the LDH on the basis of unknown (E-C = 0) and known (calculated) values of E-C. Fermi-Dirac statistics has been used extensively for estimating the occupancy probability of electron (e(-))-hole (h(+)) pair formation within the valence and conduction bands, respectively, with different temperatures, as well as for given energy levels. Monte Carlo simulations have also been performed to evaluate the suitability of the choice of the model, on the basis of the probability of availability of e(-) s within the conduction band. To provide a practical realization of the suggested models, electronic transition across the band gap of Fe/Ti LDH has been extensively investigated.

AB  - The outcome of single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction depends largely on the anatomic placement of bone tunnel. The lateral intercondylar ridge (LIR) and bifurcate ridge (BR) are useful bony landmarks for femoral tunnel placement. The purpose of our study was to compare the bony landmarks of ACL footprint on femur by three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) scan and arthroscopy in chronic ACL-deficient knees. Fifty patients above 18 years of age who were diagnosed of having ACL tear were selected for the study. All the cases were more than 6 months old since the injury. Preoperative 3D CT scan of the affected knee was obtained for each of them. They underwent single-bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction. Measurements were done on the preoperative 3D CT and arthroscopy to quantify the position of the LIR and BR. The proximodistal distance of lateral femoral condyle was 21.41+/-2.5 mm on CT scan and 22.02+/-2.02 mm on arthroscopy. On preoperative 3D CT scan, the midpoint of the LIR was found to be located at a mean distance of 11.17 +/- 2.11 mm from the proximal margin of the lateral femoral condyle. On arthroscopy, it was at 10.18+/-1.52 mm from the proximal margin the lateral femoral condyle. The "bifurcate ridge"(BR) was not visible in any of the cases during arthroscopy or CT scan. We concluded that LIR is an easily identifiable bony landmark on arthroscopy in all cases. It can also be identified on CT scans. BR is not identified both on arthroscopy and CT scans in chronic ACL tears. The arthroscopic measurements of bony landmarks are quite close to those of CT scan. Midpoint of LIR is at 52.185% of the proximodistal distance on CT scan evaluation and it is at 46.21% on arthroscopic evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) after intracranial surgery is a rare complication. Cerebellar hemorrhage is the most commonly described remote site hemorrhage after surgery for supratentorial pathologies. Although this is a rare complication 0.04% to 0.8%, it can be devastating in terms of patient outcome. There are various hypotheses to explain the occurrence of RCH. We report 6 cases of RCH after surgery for supratentorial lesions, discuss the pathophysiology, and review the pertinent literature.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial lesions at our center between 2015 and 2017. We identified 6 patients who developed RCH among 1200 patients who underwent surgery and reviewed the demographic data, diagnosis, surgical procedure, and final outcome.
   RESULTS: A total of 1200 patients underwent surgery for supratentorial pathologies between 2015 and 2017. Six patients developed RCH (incidence, 0.5%); 5 were male and 1 was female, with a mean age of 46.4 years. One patient underwent suboccipital decompression for RCH; the rest 5 were managed with close observation and serial imaging. The Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of 5 was observed in 4 patients, GOS of 4 in 1 patient at discharge, and GOS of 1 in 1 patient who succumbed to severe pulmonary infection after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: RCH is a rare complication but can lead to catastrophic results. Loss of large volumes of cerebrospinal fluid or sudden alteration in intracranial pressure due to removal of a mass lesion is the likely etiology. Although majority of cases may be managed conservatively, in a subset of cases with neurologic deterioration, surgery may be required as a life-saving procedure.

Results Twenty-four per cent of rural and 40.5 % of urban participants knew that a high-salt diet causes high blood pressure. Nearly one-fifth of both rural and urban participants knew that there should be a maximum daily limit for consumption of salt. In rural and urban areas, 46.6 and 45.1 %, respectively, perceived it important to reduce the salt content of their diet; however, only 3.7 and 10.2 %, respectively, reported taking some actions. Participants reported they were consuming 'too little salt', 'just the right amount of salt' or 'too much salt', but their corresponding mean (95 % CI) actual salt consumption (g/d; as measured by 24 h urinary Na excretion) was higher, especially among rural participants (rural: 9.2 (8.13, 10.22), 8.5 (8.19, 8.77) or 8.4 (7.72, 8.99); urban: 5.6 (4.67, 6.57), 5.7 (5.32, 6.01) or 4.6 (4.10, 5.14), respectively). Conclusions Knowledge about the deleterious health impact of excess salt consumption is low in this population. Tailored public education for salt reduction is warranted with a particular focus on rural residents.

AB  - BACKGROUND : Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in children remains challenging due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease. Detection of TB using urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen was evaluated in children with presumed TB.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS : Children with presumed intrathoracic tuberculosis (ITTB) and lymph node TB (LNTB) were enrolled. Expectorated or induced sputum or gastric aspirates from ITTB patients and fine-needle cytological aspirates from LNTB patients were subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen staining, MGIT (TM) 960 (TM) culture and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF testing. Urine samples were tested to detect LAM, and the sensitivity and specificity calculated.
   RESULTS : Of 280 children with presumed ITTB and 101 with presumed LNTB, respectively 71(25.3%) and 25 (24.7%) were categorised as 'confirmed TB', 70 (25%) and 33 (32.7%) as 'unconfirmed TB', and 139 (49.6%) and 43 (42.5%) as 'unlikely TB'. Respectively 8 (2.8%) children with ITTB and 3 (2.9%) with LNTB were positive on smear, 56 (20.0%) and 23 (22.7%) on Xpert, and 50 (17.8%) and 9 (8.9%) on culture. LAM assay sensitivity was 73.2% in confirmed ITTB cases, and 76% in confirmed LNTB cases; LAM assay specificity in children with ITTB and those with LNTB initiated on anti-tuberculosis treatment was respectively 92% and 93%. Detection of TB using the LAM assay was significantly better than detection using Xpert (P < 0.05 vs. P < 0.002).
   CONCLUSION : Urinary LAM testing showed high specificity and sensitivity, was detected in more cases initiated on treatment than reference tests, and improved disease detection by 38.5% in ITTB patients and by 41.6% in LNTB patients.

AB  - BackgroundEndobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and endoscopic ultrasound with an echobronchoscope-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) are useful modalities in the evaluation of mediastinal pathologies in adults. However, sparse data are available in children.
   ObjectiveTo describe the utility and safety of EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA in children with mediastinal pathologies of unknown etiology.
   DesignChart review.
   SettingPediatric Chest and Tuberculosis Clinics, Department of Pediatrics, AIIMS, New Delhi from May 2015 to March 2018.
   PatientsChildren <18 years of age with mediastinal pathologies of undefined etiology.
   MethodsCase records of children who underwent EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA were reviewed. Data on demographic profile, clinical features, laboratory investigations, the technique of EBUS-TBNA/ EUS -B- FNA, complications, and findings were collected.
   ResultsThirty children (19 males) with mean (SD) age of 9.6 (3.5) years underwent endobronchial procedures. Median (IQR) weight(kg) and height(cm) were 29(19.5,35) and 134(125,150) respectively. Tuberculosis was the most common preprocedure clinical diagnosis(73.3%), followed by lymphoma(13.3%). Presenting features were fever (80%), cough (53.3%), hepatomegaly (13%), peripheral lymphadenopathy (21.7%), and positive tuberculin skin test (63.3%). Approximately one fourth were on antitubercular therapy without definite evidence of TB. Conscious sedation was used for the procedures: midazolam and fentanyl (n=22), propofol(n=8). Transesophageal, transtracheal, and both routes were used in 20(66.6%), 7(23.3%), and 3(10.1%), respectively. Lymph-nodes were sampled in 24 children (subcarinal in 16, right paratracheal in 4 and both in 4). Mean (SD) size of lymph node (in cm) on EBUS was 1.93(+/- 0.5) and median (IQR) number of FNAC needle passes per node were 2(2,4). The diagnosis was confirmed in 11 (36.6%, tuberculosis in 10 by GeneXpert/MGIT/cytopath and lymphoma in one) patients. Only 3.3% had a minor complication.
   ConclusionEBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA are helpful in children with undiagnosed mediastinal pathology with fair diagnostic yield and excellent patient safety profile.

AB  - Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT, EC. 2.7.7.3) catalyzes an essential step in the reaction that transfers an adenylyl group from adenosine tri phosphate (ATP) to 4'-phosphopantetheine (pPant) yielding 3'-dephospho-coenzyme A (dPCoA) and pyrophosphate (PP) in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme PPAT from Acinetobacter baumannii (AbPPAT) was cloned, expressed and purified. The binding studies of AbPPAT were carried out with two compounds, tri-sodium citrate (TSC) and L-ascorbic acid (LAA, vitamin-C) using fluorescence spectroscopic (FS) and surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) methods. Both methods provided similar values of dissociation constants for TSC and LAA which were of the order of 10(-8) M and 10(-5) M respectively. The computer aided docking studies indicated fewer interactions of IAA with AbPPAT as compared to those of TSC. The freshly purified samples of AbPPAT were crystallized. The crystals of AbPPAT were soaked in the solutions containing TSC and LAA. However, the crystals of the complex of AbPPAT with LAA did not diffract well and hence the structure of the complex of AbPPAT with LAA could not be determined. On the other hand, the crystals of the complex of AbPPAT with TSC diffracted well and the structure was determined at 1.76 angstrom resolution. It showed that TSC bound to AbPPAT at the ATP binding site and formed several intermolecular contacts including 12 hydrogen bonds. The results of binding studies for both TSC and LAA and the structure of the complex of AbPPAT with TSC clearly indicated a potential role of TSC and LAA as antibacterial agents.

AB  - PurposeMultiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy marked by uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of plasma cells in bone marrow. Despite presence of numerous diagnostic markers for MM, their invasive and non-specific nature demands identification of some effective biomarker. Small non-coding RNAs, i.e., microRNAs being secreted out in circulation could depict the change in homeostasis. Earlier, we reported diagnostic potential of a proteoglycan, Versican (VCAN) in MM, hence, VCAN linked cell-free microRNAs have been explored to study their diagnostic involvement in MM.MethodsBiopsy proven MM patients and controls were recruited. The relative microRNA expression of VCAN linked microRNAs (miR-143, miR-144, miR-199, and miR-203) along with levels of VCAN have been investigated in bone marrow supernatant fluid (BMSF) and blood serum and their correlation were done with clinico-pathological parameters. The diagnostic potential was assessed using ROC curve.ResultsRelative microRNA expression of all microRNAs was found significantly lower in MM patients in both BMSF and serum while VCAN levels were substantially higher in patients. VCAN levels showed positive trend while microRNAs expression showed negative trend with severity of disease. miR-203 showed significant correlation with myeloma-associated parameters and also showed optimum sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of MM in serum.ConclusionsDownregulation of cell-free microRNAs illustrates their importance in MM. The negative trend of microRNAs with disease progression suggests their diagnostic significance. Correlation of miR-203 with myeloma clinical parameters along with optimum sensitivity and specificity affirms its non-invasive diagnostic potential in MM which could further be validated in larger patient cohort.

AB  - PurposeWe put forward a physical levitation method to hook and flip the chopped nuclear fragments that could not be solely drawn by vacuum during phacoemulsification, due to various reasons such as a non-rotating nuclei or posterior polar cataracts where hydrodissection was unsuccessful or contra-indicated, respectively.MethodA Sinskey hook is insinuated through the crack of the divided nuclei into a plane behind the nuclear pie to hook and flip' the chopped piece, heading it towards the phacoemulsification probe. This simple step disassembles the nuclear chunk, thereby creating space to facilitate the dismantling of the rest of the fragments. The remnant epinuclear cushion guards the posterior capsule, mitigating the chances of serious intra-operative complications.ResultWe have employed this technique in 17 eyes during similar situations. No specific intra-operative complications were observed; all surgeries were uneventful. A Sinskey hook utilised for this step ensures safety and familiarity, none encountered posterior capsular rent. This technique not only eases the surgery, but also decreases the anticipated intra-operative and post-operative complications.ConclusionHook and flip technique' thus proves useful whenever dismantling difficulties are encountered during phacoemulsification.

AB  - Introduction Pregnancy is characterised by a high rate of metabolic shifts from early to late phases of gestation in order to meet the raised physiological and metabolic needs. This change in levels of metabolites is influenced by gestational weight gain (GWG), which is an important characteristic of healthy pregnancy. Inadequate/excessive GWG has short-term and long-term implications on maternal and child health. Exploration of gestational metabolism is required for understanding the quantitative changes in metabolite levels during the course of pregnancy. Therefore, our aim is to study trimester-specific variation in levels of metabolites in relation to GWG and its influence on fetal growth and newborn anthropometric traits at birth.
   Methods and analysis A prospective longitudinal study is planned (start date: February 2018; end date: March 2023) on pregnant women that are being recruited in the first trimester and followed in subsequent trimesters and at the time of delivery (total 3 follow-ups). The study is being conducted in a hospital located in Bikaner district (66% rural population), Rajasthan, India. The estimated sample size is of 1000 mother-offspring pairs. Information on gynaecological and obstetric history, socioeconomic position, diet, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol consumption, depression, anthropometric measurements and blood samples is being collected for metabolic assays in each trimester using standardised methods. Mixed effects regression models will be used to assess the role of gestational weight in influencing metabolite levels in each trimester. The association of maternal levels of metabolites with fetal growth, offspring's weight and body composition at birth will be investigated using regression modelling.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the ethics committees of the Department of Anthropology, University of Delhi and Sardar Patel Medical College, Rajasthan. We are taking written informed consent after discussing the various aspects of the study with the participants in the local language.

   Methods: Multiple strategies were used for statewide implementation of mPower Heart e-CDSS at noncommunicable diseases clinics across the government health facilities in Tripura: formation of a technical coordination-cum-support unit, change management, enabling environment, adapting the intervention with user focus, and strengthening the Health Information System.
   Results: The effective delivery of a new health system intervention requires engagement at multiple levels including political leadership, health administrators, and health professionals, which can be achieved by forming a technical coordination-cum-support unit. It is important to specify the role and responsibilities of existing manpower and provide a structured training program. Enabling environment at health facilities (providing essential equipment, space and time, etc.) is also crucial. Successful implementation also requires that patients, health care providers, the health system, and leadership recognize the immediate and long-term benefits of the new intervention and have a buy-in in the intervention. With constant encouragement and nudge from administrative authorities and by using multiple strategies, 40 government health facilities adopted the mPower Heart e-CDSS. From its launch in May 2017 until November 20, 2018, a total of 100,810 eligible individuals were screened and enrolled, with 35,884 treated for hypertension, 9,698 for diabetes, and 5,527 for both hypertension and diabetes.
   Conclusions: Multiple strategies, based on implementation principles, are required for successful scaling up of research-based interventions.

AB  - Hyoid bone syndrome is a type of cervicofacial pain that is caused by degeneration of the greater cornu of the hyoid at the attachment of the stylohyoid ligament. We report four patients who presented with deep-seated, dull, aching, temporomandibular (TMJ) pain that radiated from the greater cornu of the hyoid bone and did not respond to conservative management. Diagnostic tests included a local anaesthetic block and digital palpation of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. All four patients responded well to methylprednisolone 40 mg/ml at the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, which resulted in complete resolution of their symptoms. No patients developed postoperative complications. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons involved in the treatment of orofacial pain should consider this less documented condition in their differential diagnosis when treating temporomandibular disorders.

AB  - Anemia is an under-recognized morbidity among adult males causing significant productivity loss. A study was done among adult males (>= 18 years) in a rural area of Haryana, India to estimate the prevalence and determinants of anemia and to explore their attitude and beliefs about anemia. Mixed methods approach was adopted. A total of 1219 participants were selected by multistage simple random sampling for the cross-sectional study and were administered a questionnaire followed by hemoglobin measurement using HemoCue method. Six focus group discussions were conducted. Age adjusted prevalence of anemia was 27.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 27.4-28.4%]. Anemia was found to be positively associated with age more than 50 years (OR: 2.7 (95% CI: 1.7-4.2) in age group 50-59 years and 3.6 (95% CI: 2.3-5.6) in age group >= 60 years as compared with age group 18-24 years) and presence of chronic co-morbidity (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.2). There were misconceptions among study participants about the role of specific dietary factors in causation of anemia. Poor purchasing capacity was cited as main reason for not consuming iron rich diet. Anemia was a common morbidity in this study population. (C) 2019 Atlantis Press International B.V.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to mediate activity-dependent changes in the developing auditory system. Its expression in the brainstem auditory nuclei, auditory cortex and hippocampus of neonatal chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) in response to in ovo high intensity sound exposure at 110 dB (arrhythmic sound: recorded traffic noise, 30-3000 Hz with peak at 2700 Hz, rhythmic sound: sitar music, 100-4000 Hz) was examined to understand the previously reported altered volume and neuronal number in these regions. In the brainstem auditory nuclei, no mature BDNF, but proBDNF at the protein level was detected, and no change in its levels was observed after in ovo sound stimulation (music and noise). Increased ProBDNF protein levels were found in the auditory cortex in response to arrhythmic sound, along with decreased levels of one of the BDNF mRNA transcripts, in response to both rhythmic and arrhythmic sound stimulation. In the hippocampus, increased levels of mature BDNF were found in response to music. Expression microarray analysis was performed to understand changes in gene expression in the hippocampus in response to music and noise, followed by gene ontology analysis showing enrichment of probable signaling pathways. Differentially expressed genes like CAMK1 and STAT1 were found to be involved in downstream signaling on comparing music versus noise-exposed chicks. In conclusion, we report that BDNF is differentially regulated in the auditory cortex at the transcriptional and post-translational level, and in the hippocampus at the post-translational level in response to in ovo sound stimulation.

AB  - Mastalgia is defined as pain in the breast for more than 1week of menstrual cycle. A number of drugs have been recommended for its treatment. However, there is some debate among the experts about the most beneficial agent. In this study, we compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of centchroman and tamoxifen in the treatment of mastalgia. We recruited 106 ladies with mastalgia in a two-arm parallel design open-labelled randomised controlled trial with a non-inferiority hypothesis comparing 3-month therapy with either centchroman or tamoxifen. The response of therapy was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0-10, on 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Direct and indirect costs were computed for each patient. Baseline mean VAS score was 6.25 in tamoxifen and 6.49 in centchroman group. Women in both groups enjoyed significant pain relief (pain score became <3). The number of patients who achieved VAS less than 3 were 51 (96.2%) in centchroman and 49 (92.5%) in tamoxifen group at the end of 3months of treatment. Centchroman was found to be more effective than tamoxifen (p<0.001). Cost per unit successful relief of mastalgia in the centchroman group was 393 Nepalese Rupees and that in the tamoxifen group was 311.5 Nepalese Rupees. Centchroman is not inferior to Tamoxifen in relieving mastalgia. Tamoxifen proved more cost-effective than centchroman because of lower cost of tamoxifen in Nepal.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus causes a variety of symptoms and diseases and has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. A global population drift in clinical S. aureus isolates towards reduced antimicrobial susceptibility is being reported. In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creep of vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin and rifampicin against clinical S. aureus isolates at an Indian tertiary centre from January 2012 to December 2016 were investigated.
   Methods: All consecutive, non-duplicate S. aureus isolates (n = 1466) recovered from hospitalised patients identified by VITEK((R))2 were included in the study. Clinical isolates were tested against 20 antibiotics and were evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Statistical significance of the MIC creeps of four antimicrobials (vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin and rifampicin) was ascertained.
   Results: S. aureus isolates recovered from all clinical samples demonstrated high resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and penicillin (75-100%) and low resistance to amikacin, linezolid, netilmicin, nitrofurantoin, teicoplanin and vancomycin (0-13%). The MIC90 values (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) for vancomycin, linezolid and rifampicin decreased, whereas the MIC90 for teicoplanin increased. The change in the geometric mean MIC of rifampicin was found to be statistically significant. A statistically significant and progressive MIC creep was observed for teicoplanin and rifampicin.
   Conclusion: Despite remaining susceptible, S. aureus is not inert to antibiotic pressure. Implementation of preventive measures in healthcare settings is required worldwide to combat the increasing number of infections by this pathogen.

AB  - Objective: To compare TCu380Ag and TCu380A intrauterine contraceptive devices after 1 year of use.
   Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted among healthy married women aged 20-35 years who attended the family planning clinics of three tertiary centers in India between August 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. The TCu380Ag group (n=300) received one of three sizes of this device depending on uterocervical length: maxi (8.0-9.0 cm), normal (7.0-8.5 cm), or mini (6.0-7.5 cm). The remaining 300 participants received TCu380A. Follow--up was conducted at 3--monthly intervals to assess continuation rate, acceptability, efficacy, adverse effects, and complications.
   Results: The TCu380Ag group had a higher continuation rate than the TCu380A group at 1 year (84.0% vs 75.8%; P=0.01), with an efficacy of 99.6% versus 100.0% (P>0.05). Overall estimated continuation rates were 94.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.7%96.4%) and 88.4% (95% CI 83.2%-91.5%), respectively (P=0.026). Use of TCu380Ag was associated with fewer adverse effects (heavy menstrual bleeding, abdominal pain, or expulsion) when compared with TCu380A (P>0.05 for all comparisons). Discontinuation rates owing to adverse effects were 6.59% for TCu380Ag versus 13.26% for TCu380A (P=0.01).
   Conclusions: Varying sizes of TCu380Ag could provide an alternative to TCu380A.

AB  - Background In India, community-based acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) burden studies are limited, hampering development of prevention and control strategies.
   Methods We surveyed children <10 years old at home weekly from August 2012-August 2014, for cough, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, ear discharge, and shortness of breath. Symptomatic children were assessed for ALRI using World Health Organization definitions. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained from all ALRI cases and asymptomatic controls and tested using polymerase chain reaction for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), and influenza viruses (IV). We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using logistic regression to calculate etiologic fractions (EF). We multiplied agent-specific ALRI incidence rates by EF to calculate t he adjusted incidence as episodes per child-year.
   Results ALRI incidence was 0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.20) episode per child-year. Association between virus and ALRI was strongest for RSV (aOR= 15.9; 95% 0=7.3-34.7; EF =94%) and least for IV (aOR =4.6; 95% CI = 2.0-10.6; EF= 78%). Adjusted agent-specific ALRI incidences were RSV (0.03, 95% CI =0.02-0.03), hMPV (0.02, 95% CI =0.01-0.02), PIV (0.02, 95% CI = 0.01-0.02), and IV (0.01, 95% CI = 0.01-0.01) episode per child-year.
   Conclusions ALRI among children in rural India was high; RSV was a significant contributor.

AB  - Background & objectives: Survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has improved in the past two decades following use of novel agents and autologous stem cell transplantation. To determine predictors of long-term outcome, data of MM patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) at a tertiary care centre in north India were retrospectively analyzed.
   Methods: Between 1995 and 2016, 349 MM patients underwent ASCT. Patients' median age was 52 yr, ranging from 29 to 68 yr, 68.2 per cent were males. Thirty three per cent patients had international staging system (ISS) Stage III and 68.5 per cent had received novel agents-based induction. High-dose melphalan (200 mg/m(2)) was used for conditioning; patients with renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate <40 ml/min) received melphalan 140-150 mg/m(2).
   Results: Post-transplant, 317 of 349 (90.8%) patients responded; complete [complete response (CR)] -213 (61%)], very good partial response (VGPR) -62 (17.8%) and PR in 42 (12%)]. Induction with novel agents, pm-transplant chemosensitive disease, transplant in first remission and serum albumin (>= 3.5 g/dl) were predictors of significant response. At a median follow up of 73 months, median overall survival (OS) was 90 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 70.8-109.2], and progression-free survival (PFS) was 41 months (95% CI 33.0-49.0). On multivariate analysis, achievement of CR post-transplant, transplant in first remission, ISS Stages I and II (vs. III), absence of extramedullary disease and serum albumin >= 3.5 g/dl were predictors of prolonged OS. For PFS, achievement of post-transplant CR and transplant in first remission were predictors of superior outcome.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Treatment with novel agents, achievement of complete remission post-transplant, ISS Stages I and II, absence of extramedullary disease and transplant in first remission were predictors of long-term survival for patients with MM.

AB  - In mammalian cells, human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bonded enzyme, plays a central role in the cholesterol homeostasis via the negative feedback mechanism. The present study indicates that the interactions of novel peptides with the catalytic domain of HMGCR, provides an alternative therapeutic candidate for reducing cholesterol. The potential natural origin of HMGCR peptide inhibitors were filtered from the peptide library using the molecular docking, which revealed three strong candidates for inhibition. This information was used for synthesizing peptides, which were evaluated for inhibition against HMGCR. The stronger docking interactions were confirmed by experimental dissociation constant (K-D) values of 9.1 x 10(-9) M, 1.4 x 10(-8) M and 1.2 x 10(-8) M for peptides NALEPDNRIESEGG (Pep-1), NALEPDNRIES (Pep-2) and PFVKSEPIPETNNE (Pep-3) respectively. The immunological based interactions show a strong evidence of peptide-HMGCR complexes. The LDL uptake showed enhancements after treatments with peptides in the extracellular environment of HepG2 cells, which was further, corroborated through increase in the immunofluorescence signal of the localized LDL-R protein expression on the cell membrane. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of transcription factors were significantly up-regulated showing regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in peptide treated HepG2 cells. The binding of transcription factors, sterol regulatory element (SRE) and cAMP-response element (CRE) on HMGCR promotor further confirms the cholesterol biosynthesis regulation. All the above results suggested a key role of peptide/s in alleviating cholesterol accumulation in tissue via inhibition of rate-limiting HMGCR enzyme.

AB  - Introduction: BK polyomavirus is ubiquitous and remains dormant in the urothelial tract, reactivating and replicating in the immunocompromised state especially in the setting of post-renal transplantation where it is believed to be directly oncogenic based on recent reports. Its oncogenic role in the immunocompetent host is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the association of BK polyomavirus in Urothelial Carcinoma.
   Material and methods: Patients with suspected urothelial carcinoma (UC) admitted under Department of Urology over a period of one year were recruited and transuretheral bladder tumor (TURBT) resection was performed, along with sampling of cystoscopically normal-appearing urothelium away from the tumor. In addition, cystectomy specimens with UC were included, with sampling of grossly normal-appearing urothelium away from the tumor. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for SV40 T-Antigen and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) using BK polyomavirus specific probe was performed on the paired samples (tumor and normal).
   Results: Twenty-three TURBT and 14 cystectomy specimens were assessed. None of the cases showed evidence of BK polyomavirus infection in tumor or in surrounding mucosa by IHC. CISH performed in ten cases were also found to be negative. In comparison, one post-renal transplant urothelial carcinoma in our experience showed diffuse SV40 staining.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that BK polyomavirus infection is not associated with urothelial malignancy in the immunocompetent setting unlike in the immunocompromised setting where it should always be investigated for.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the characteristics and morbidity due to ocular auto-stimulation (OAS) in stage 5 Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). Methods: Stage 5 ROP cases presenting to ROP clinic of a tertiary care centre from January 2017 to December 2017 were recruited. Eye-pressing was elicited on history from parents and categorized as infrequent (performed < 50% of waking time) or frequent (>= 50% of time). B-scan ultrasonography was performed for configuration of retinal detachment (open or closed funnel). Keratometry was performed in eyes undergoing vitrectomy under general anaesthesia using automated hand-held keratometer. The outcome measures were the presence and characteristics of OAS, enophthalmos, corneal opacity and keratometry values. Results: Out of 93 eyes of 49 babies, 78.5% (n = 73) had OAS. Gestational age, birth weight, sex, retinal funnel configuration, and visual function did not significantly affect OAS. However, post-conceptional age was significantly greater in eyes with OAS (95% CI: 63.1 to 69.9 weeks) than those without OAS (95% CI: 52.4 to 63.4 weeks) (P = 0.018). OAS occurred frequently in 32.8% (n = 24/73) eyes, more commonly in eyes with light followability. Keratometry did not differ significantly with the presence of OAS (P = 0.88). Enophthalmos, corneal opacity, posterior synechiae were noted in 79.5% (58/73), 21.9% (16/73), and 28.8% (21/73) eyes with OAS, respectively. Enophthalmos occurred significantly in eyes with OAS (P = 0.001), while corneal opacity and posterior synechiae did not (P = 0.071 and 0.91, respectively). Conclusion: OAS and its resultant morbidity are common occurrences in stage 5 ROP. The post-conceptional age and residual visual function may govern the characteristics of OAS.

AB  - Background Influenza is associated with an increase in the risk of cardiac and other vascular events. Observational data and small randomized trials suggest that influenza vaccination may reduce such adverse vascular events.
   Research Design and Methods In a randomized controlled trial patients with heart failure are randomized to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine or placebo annually for 3 years. Patients aged >= 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure and NYHA functional class II, III and IV are eligible. Five thousand patients from 10 countries where influenza vaccination is not common (Asia, the Middle East, and Africa) have been enrolled. The primary outcome is a composite of the following: cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and hospitalizations for heart failure using standardized criteria. Analyses will be based on comparing event rates between influenza vaccine and control groups and will include time to event, rate comparisons using Poisson methods, and logistic regression. The analysis will be conducted by intention to treat i.e. patients will be analyzed in the group in which they were assigned. Multivariable secondary analyses to assess whether variables such as age, sex, seasonality modify the benefits of vaccination are also planned for the primary outcome.
   Conclusion This is the largest randomized trial to test if influenza vaccine compared to control reduces adverse vascular events in high risk individuals.

AB  - Introduction: There is scarce data available on community based prevalence of Anxiety Disorders (ADs) amongst adolescents in north Indian settings.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of anxiety disorders, and associated factors amongst adolescents in a rural community of Ballabgarh block, district Faridabad, Haryana.
   Methods: Participants (10-19 years) were enrolled through simple random sequence from a sampling frame of adolescents residing in 28 villages of Ballabgarh block using household survey technique. They were screened using Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) tool and then subjected to confirmatory diagnosis using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children/Adolescent (MINI KID). All adolescents with ADs were assessed for co-psychiatric morbidities using MINI-KID and functional impairment using Children Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). Prevalence and 95% Confidence intervals are reported. Additionally, socio-demographic factors were elicited using a semi-structured interview schedule and associations were determined using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 678 adolescents participated in this study with mean age (SD) as 14.2 (2.5) years. The age adjusted prevalence of anxiety disorders was found to be 16.6% (95% CI: 16.0-17.2). The most prevalent anxiety disorder among participants was social anxiety disorders followed by specific phobias. Female sex and low socioeconomic status were associated with anxiety disorders. Two third of adolescents with ADs had no functional impairment and almost one third were found to have one or more co-existing psychiatric co-morbidity.
   Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of ADs in rural north Indian community settings warranting adequate health system response at primary care level.

AB  - Background/Aims Uncomplicated crown fracture is the most common traumatic dental injury. The International Association of Dental Traumatology has recommended fragment reattachment as the best method for restoring uncomplicated crown fractures of permanent teeth. Dehydration can affect fracture resistance after reattachment. However, a standard protocol for rehydration is still lacking. Hence, the aim of this study was to design a humidification chamber and assess its efficacy for improving the rehydration of tooth fragments and increasing fracture resistance after reattachment. Materials and Methods Sixty mandibular bovine incisors with similar dimensions and free of any structural deformities were fractured and randomized into five groups: Group I, Control Group (sound teeth); Group II (dehydrated for 24 hours); Group III (rehydrated in distilled water for 15 minutes); Group IV (rehydrated in a humidification chamber for 15 minutes); and Group V (restored with composite). A humidification chamber was designed and used for rehydration for 15 minutes in Group IV. Fragments in Group III were immersed in distilled water for 15 minutes. Reattachment procedures and materials remained the same in all groups. Fracture resistance was tested in a universal testing machine, and statistical analysis was done by Stata-14. Results The Control Group with sound teeth (Group I) exhibited a maximum value of 282 +/- 10.32 N, while Group II (fragment reattached without rehydration) had the least fracture resistance, 49.75 +/- 5.2 N. Rehydration by means of the humidification chamber protocol (Group IV) resulted in significantly higher fracture resistance (150.54 +/- 6.49 N) than in Group III (rehydration by means of immersion). Conclusions Fracture resistance after fragment reattachment was significantly affected by the rehydration of fragments for 15 minutes in the humidification chamber. Fragment reattachment after rehydration showed better fracture resistance than the composite restorations.

AB  - Malignant ectomesenchymoma (MEM) is an exceedingly rare rapidly progressing tumor of soft tissues of the central nervous system, believed to be derived from neural crest cells. The majority of cases have been observed in young children or adolescents. So far only 11 patients with intracranial manifestations (with confirmed clinicopathological data) have been documented. We report the first case of adult intracranial MEM in a 54-year-old man who presented with a 4 months history of headache and weakness of right side of the body. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a homogenously enhanced dural-based lesion in the left fronto-temporo-parietal lobe with significant perilesional edema and mass effect. No metastatic disease was identified and the lesion was grossly resected. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination revealed mature and immature neurons and bizarre astrocytes admixed with a mesenchymal spindle cell (rhabdomyoblastic) component. Specific risk factors that contribute toward the development of MEM are unknown. Due to the scarcity of reported cases the role of adjuvant therapy is unclear.

AB  - Background: Malignant tumors of the trachea (MTT) account for 0.01-0.4% of all cancer cases. The rarity of the tumor along with different histologies makes it is a great challenge on how to optimally treat tracheal tumors and most of the available data is from small retrospective data series. We performed a systematic review and individual patient data analysis to evaluate the patterns of care and survival outcomes in patient with MTT.
   Methodology: A comprehensive search in Pub Med and Google scholar was done to find all possible publications related to malignant tumors of the trachea. The data on patient demograpphy, treatment, survival and recurrence pattern of individual patient was collected from the published data and was entered in a predesigned proforma. Progression free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS] was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of documented progression and death respectively. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis and uni-variate analysis was performed using log rank test. SPSS v16 was used for all statistical analysis.
   Results: 733 patients were included in this analysis. The most common histology was adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The gender ratio was 4.43:1[male:female] in patients with SCC while it was 0.85:1 [male:female] in ACC. Smoking and age > 50 years were associated with worse OS. The estimated median overall survival for entire cohort was 96 months. Survival was significantly better in patients with ACC than in patients with SCC [165 vs. 14 months, p < 0.001]. The use of definitive surgery was associated with a significantly better survival of 180 months when compared to 48 months with radiation as local therapy, [p < 0.001]. The radiation dose used also affected survival in patients with SCC with a better median OS of 24 months in patients who recieved more than 60 Gy vs 6 months in whom the dose was less than 60 Gy although not statistically significant (p = 0.011).
   Conclusion: ACC and SCC are the most common MTT. ACC has better prognosis compared to SCC. Surgery seems to provide better outcomes than radiation for ACC and sarcoma. Role of definitive radiotherapy versus surgery in SCC needs to be further studied.

AB  - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has currently become an inseparable tool in the gastroenterologist's armamentarium for treatment of pancreaticobiliary disorders. Given the increase in number of therapeutic ERCP procedures today, the need for prompt and correct diagnosis of its complications is pivotal. This review discusses the mechanisms, risk factors, imaging findings and general management aspects of common and rare complications of ERCP. Furthermore, the review elaborates on imaging indications, recommended protocol and normal imaging findings post ERCP.

AB  - Purpose: To detect and quantify the directional interaction changes between cardio-respiratory system during postural change.
   Method: Traditional frequency domain analysis based on power spectrum and coherence are insufficient to quantify nonlinear structures and complexity of physiological subsystems. Recently, Granger causality is found as preferable method for evaluation of causality i.e., directional interaction. Frequency domain Granger causality based on directed coherence has been used in this study to identify directional interaction between cardiac and respiratory signal during postural change from supine to standing for healthy subjects.
   Result: ECG and respiration signal are recorded for this study. The beat-to-beat variability series from ECG provides heart rate (RR) and the respiration amplitude corresponds to RESP time series. It was observed that respiration is responsible for the changes in ECG signal during supine position as compared to standing. The outflow of information from RESP to RR increases during supine results in stronger interaction but reduces during standing result in reduction of interaction. Similarly, the effect of RR on RESP is found significant only during standing.
   Conclusion: The proposed directed coherence approach detects the cardio-respiratory regulation during postural change and provide information about coupling changes during this transition. (C) 2019 AGBM. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - CD38 on CD8 + T cells is considered a reliable marker of HIV disease progression. Withania somnifer, a traditional ayurvedic medicine, has Th1 immunomodulatory properties. PBMCs from 38 HIV patients were exposed to Withania somnifer root extract at standardized concentration. An overall decline in the percentage of CD38 expressing CD8 + T lymphocytes was observed, though the statistical significance was varied with different categories of HIV patients. Withania somnifer could have promising impact on HIV disease and therefore warrants a further study on larger parameters.

AB  - ObjectiveTo prospectively assess the growth parameters in a cohort of children with classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia, comprehensively profile their clinical data and evaluate the prevalence of testicular adrenal rest tumors among affected boys.MethodsChildren with congenital adrenal hyperplasia aged 0-18 y were prospectively followed up for six mo to 2 y (mean follow-up: 176 mo). Baseline data were obtained by interviewing parents and from clinic records. Anthropometry, biochemical parameters, X-ray for bone age, and ultrasound scrotum (in boys >5 y) for testicular adrenal rest tumors were performed.ResultsAmong the 81 children (32 boys, 49 girls), two-thirds (57) had salt-wasting and the remaining had simple virilizing type and the mean age at enrolment was 6.2 +/- 4.9 y. The overall height standard deviation score was -0.6 (-2.0 to 0.8) with a greater compromise in children in the age groups 0-2 y and>10 y and those with salt-wasting type. Overall, 25 (31%) children had short stature and 45 (55.6%) had growth velocity below the reference range. Bone age advancement beyond 2 standard deviation score was seen in 46% of children assessed. Testicular adrenal rest tumors were detected in 5 out of 21 boys (23.8%).Conclusions p id=Par4 The auxological pattern observed in this homogenously-managed Indian pediatric cohort with congenital adrenal hyperplasia highlights that infancy and peri-pubertal age groups are the most vulnerable, reiterating the importance of diligent growth monitoring. The high prevalence of testicular adrenal rest tumors merits the incorporation of annual ultrasound in the follow-up protocol of these patients.

AB  - Several attempts have been made to engineer a viable three-dimensional (3D) bone tissue equivalent using conventional tissue engineering strategies, but with limited clinical success. Using 3D bioprinting technology, scientists have developed functional prototypes of clinically relevant and mechanically robust bone with a functional bone marrow. Although the field is in its infancy, it has shown immense potential in the field of bone tissue engineering by re-establishing the 3D dynamic micro-environment of the native bone. Inspite of their in vitro success, maintaining the viability and differentiation potential of such cell-laden constructs overtime, and their subsequent preclinical testing in terms of stability, mechanical loading, immune responses, and osseointegrative potential still needs to be explored. Progress is slow due to several challenges such as but not limited to the choice of ink used for cell encapsulation, optimal cell source, bioprinting method suitable for replicating the heterogeneous tissues and organs, and so on. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in bioprinting of bone, their limitations, challenges, and strategies for future improvisations. The generated knowledge will provide deep insights on our current understanding of the cellular interactions with the hydrogel matrices and help to unravel new methodologies for facilitating precisely regulated stem cell behaviour.

AB  - The teleost species Notopterus notopterus (Pallas) possess bundled photoreceptors in their retina. It was found that the margin of the inner portion (the vitreal half) of photoreceptor bundles emits thin processes. Each process terminates on the contralateral photoreceptor bundle, or the processes from adjacent photoreceptor bundle may fuse. The site of the inner half of the photoreceptor bundles from where they arise shows minimal support of the photoreceptor bundles by retinal pigment epithelium, and so it is likely that those accessory structures may aid to hold the photoreceptor bundles in correct orientation.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate whether methylprednisolone (MP) administered via any route improves postoperative outcomes (pain, trismus, and oedema) following mandibular third molar surgery. An electronic search of the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar databases was performed to identify studies published in English up until January 2018. A total of 28 studies were included in the review: 25 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and three controlled clinical trials. Studies were grouped according to the route of administration of MP for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Three studies were of 'high' quality and 22 were of 'medium' quality; three studies had a high risk of bias. Within the purview of the limitations of this review, the results showed that MP administered via any route significantly improves oedema in the early postoperative period, but has no effect on late postoperative oedema. Oral and intra-masseteric MP also seems to reduce pain and trismus in the early postoperative period. The results also indicate that oral MP may reduce late postoperative pain, while intra-masseteric MP may improve the late trismus outcome. More high quality RCTs are required to provide stronger evidence on the use of MP in third molar surgery.

AB  - Introduction Shorter duration of treatment for the management of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) would be a significant improvement in the care of patients suffering from the disease. Besides newer drugs and regimens, other modalities like host-directed therapy are also being suggested to reach this goal. This study's objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin-containing anti-TB treatment (ATT) regimen in comparison to the standard 6-month ATT regimen in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive drug-sensitive pulmonary TB.
   Methods and analysis We are conducting a multicentric, randomised open-label controlled clinical trial to achieve the study objective. The intervention group will receive isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E) and pyrazinamide (Z) along with 1000 mg of daily metformin (Met) for the first 2 months while the control group will receive only HRZE. After 2 months, both the groups will receive HRE daily for 4 months. The primary endpoint is time to sputum culture conversion. Secondary endpoints will include time to detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of study drugs, drug-drug interactions, safety and tolerability of the various combinations and measurement of autophagy and immune responses in the study participants.
   Ethics and dissemination The ethics committee of the participating institutes have approved the study. Results from this trial will contribute to evidence towards constructing a shorter, effective and safe regimen for patients with TB. The results will be shared widely with the National Programme managers, policymakers and stakeholders through open access publications, dissemination meetings, conference abstracts and policy briefs. This is expected to provide a new standard of care for drug-sensitive patients with pulmonary TB who will not only reduce the number of clinic visits and lost to follow-up of patients from treatment but also reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

AB  - It is well known that quality of hearing decreases with increasing age due to changes in the peripheral or central auditory pathway. Along with the decrease in the number of neurons the neurotransmitter profile is also affected in the various parts of the auditory system. Particularly, changes in the inhibitory neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) are known to affect quality of hearing with aging. To date, there is no information about the status of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the human IC during aging. We have collected and processed inferior colliculi of persons aged 11-97 years at the time of death for morphometry and immunohistochemical expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) and parvalbumin. We used unbiased stereology to estimate the number of cresyl-violet and immunostained neurons. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the relative expression of the GAD67 mRNA. We found that the number of total, GABAergic and PV-positive neurons significantly decreased with increasing age (p < 0.05). The proportion of GAD67-ir neurons to total number of neurons was also negatively associated with increasing age (p = 0.004), but there was no change observed in the proportion of PV-ir neurons relative to GABAergic neurons (p = 0.25). Further, the fold change in the levels of GAD67 mRNA was negatively correlated to age (p = 0.024). We conclude that the poorer quality of hearing with increasing age may be due to decreased expression of inhibitory neurotransmitters and the decline in the number of inhibitory neurons in the IC.

AB  - Evidence regarding clinical predictors of prognosis of lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is scant. This retrospective study included 65 pediatric patients with LBL registered at our center from January 2003 to January 2017. Low albumin, high white blood cell count at baseline, and symptom duration < 30 days emerged as adverse factors. Patients with 2 or 3 of these factors had worse overall survival.
   Background: There is a lack of clinical predictors for prognosticating lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). In view of this lacuna, we evaluated outcomes and prognostic factors for LBL treated with a uniform protocol at our center. Patients and Methods: This study included consecutive patients of pediatric LBL aged <= 18 years from January 2003 to January 2017. Patients were staged using the St Jude staging system. All patients were treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia like BFM90 protocol. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. A statistical model was made using stepwise regression and forward selection of the factors predicting event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Sixty-five patients were evaluated with a median age of 12 years (range, 1-18 years) and male: female ratio of 2.25: 1. Fifty-four patients presented with mediastinal disease. Median follow-up was 54.57 months (range, 0.6-140.5 months). EFS at 10 years was 62 +/- 6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.73) and OS 71 +/- 5% (95% CI, 0.57-0.81). In multivariate analysis, symptom duration <= 30 days, white blood cell (WBC) count > 12000/mL and serum albumin <= 3.5 g/dL predicted inferior EFS and OS. A prognostic model with these 3 factors suggested that those without any of these risk factors had an OS of 92 +/- 5% whereas those with 2 or 3 factors had an OS of 37 +/- 14%. Conclusion: Our outcomes are 15% to 20% lower than in the published literature. Low albumin level, high WBC count at baseline, and symptom duration < 30 days emerged as adverse predictors for EFS and OS. These clinical predictors and prognostic model for pediatric LBL should be validated in prospective cohorts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mucormycosis due to Mucorales is reported at large numbers in uncontrolled diabetics across India, but systematic multicenter epidemiological study has not been published yet. The present prospective study was conducted at four major tertiary care centers of India (two in north and two in south India) during 2013-2015 to compare the epidemiology, treatment strategies and outcome of mucormycosis between the two regions. Molecular techniques were employed to confirm the identity of the isolates or to identify the agent in biopsy samples. A total of 388 proven/probable mucormycosis cases were reported during the study period with overall mortality at 46.7%. Uncontrolled diabetes (n = 172, 56.8%) and trauma (n = 31, 10.2%) were the common risk factors. Overall, Rhizopus arrhizus (n = 124, 51.9%) was the predominant agent identified, followed by Rhizopus microsporus (n = 30, 12.6%), Apophysomyces variabilis (n = 22, 9.2%) and Rhizopus homothallicus (n = 6, 2.5%). On multivariate analysis, the mortality was significantly associated with gastrointestinal (OR: 18.70, P = .005) and pulmonary infections (OR: 3.03, P = .015). While comparing the two regions, majority (82.7%) cases were recorded from north India; uncontrolled diabetes (n = 157, P = .0001) and post-tubercular mucormycosis (n = 21, P = .006) were significantly associated with north Indian cases. No significant difference was noted among the species of Mucorales identified and treatment strategies between the two regions. The mortality rate was significantly higher in north Indian patients (50.5%) compared to 32.1% in south India (P = .016). The study highlights higher number of mucormycosis cases in uncontrolled diabetics of north India and emergence of R. microsporus and R. homothallicus across India causing the disease.

AB  - Most surgical texts recommend the skinflap elevationin mastectomy at a plane between small and large fat lobules. However, raising a skin flap at this plane results in necrosis of skin in 10 to 15% cases. Objective of mastectomy is to remove the tumor along with entire breast parenchyma containing ducto-lobular units. Pre-mammary fascia is interposed between subcutaneous fat and breast parenchyma. Most of the terminal ducto-lobular units (TDLUs) reach superficially the plane of pre-mammary fascia. Raising a skin flap superficial to pre-mammary fascia would allow the surgeon to remove most of the breast parenchymal tissue without leaving any TDLUs under the flaps. The depth of pre-mammary fascia was measured by ultrasound in 50 patients at four spots, one in each quadrant of the breast before mastectomy. The distance between dermis and nearest TDLU was measured histologically at the same four spots in 50 mastectomy specimens. Maximum depth of pre-mammary fascia by sonography was observed in upper outer quadrant (UOQ) (mean=1.8cm) and minimum in lower inner quadrant (LIQ) (mean=1.2cm). Histologically maximum depth of TDLU was found in UOQ (mean=1.9cm) and the minimum depth in the LIQ (mean=1.3cm). There was a very strong correlation between sonographic and histologic measurements (Pearson's rho=0.93). This study demonstrated that ducto-lobular tissue is located deep to pre-mammary fascia. Skin flap elevation at the plane of pre-mammary fascia would ensure complete removal of breast tissue during mastectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal management of complex anterior circulation aneurysms is an enigmatic challenge because of frequent involvement of major vessel bifurcation, choroidal vessels, and lenticulostriate/thalamostriate perforators. Cerebral ischemia associated with prolonged clipping time is a major concern pertinent to their surgical management, especially in patients with poor cross-flow. To circumvent this hurdle, single/double-barrel low-flow superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (M3/M4-MCA) can be performed, which can maintain distal cerebral perfusion while facilitating safe clip reconstruction of complex MCA and supraclinoidal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms involving ICA bifurcation or supraclinoidal ICA aneurysms with poor cross-circulation-insurance bypass, as well as supplement/alter blood flow after MCA aneurysm trapping-flow-alteration bypass.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review of consecutive neurosurgical patients operated over 2 years at this center was performed. Patients with complex MCA and ICA aneurysms who were treated with STA-MCA bypass were included. The clinical profile, pre- and postoperative images, intraoperative imaging, and patient outcomes were recorded. Surgical reconstruction of aneurysm was the treatment of choice due to involvement of choroidal/thalamostriate perforators, MCA/ICA bifurcation, complex aneurysm morphology, or dissecting/thrombosed nature of aneurysm. STA-MCA low-flow bypass was performed using M3/M4 segment of MCA as the recipient in anticipation of prolonged temporary clipping time on M1-MCA, supraclinoidal ICA aneurysms with suspected ICA terminus involvement, or need for possible trapping of fusiform MCA aneurysm. The saccular/fusiform part of aneurysm was clip reconstructed and the partially thrombosed dissecting segment was opened for thrombectomy and trapped using proximal and distal clips after good patency of bypass was confirmed. The distal MCA flow was restored adequately and confirmed intraoperatively using indocyanine green angiography and micro-Doppler ultrasonography.
   RESULTS: MCA (n = 4) and supraclinoid-ICA (n = 1) aneurysms were managed successfully using this strategy, which involved 6 STA-MCA bypass procedures (insurance and flow-alteration bypass, 3 each). Postoperative check angiograms demonstrated patent bypass in all 5 patients. Four patients had favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0/1); one had recovering hemiparesis and aphasia (modified Rankin Scale score 4).
   CONCLUSIONS: This series highlights the surgical strategy and safety for successfully managing complex MCA and ICA aneurysms using low-flow STA-MCA revascularization procedures.

AB  - Purpose: The Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) is an efficient tool for rapid detection of depression, an important comorbid condition in persons with epilepsy (PWE). Since social and cultural differences can potentially affect the cutoff score of NDDI-E, in this study, the reliability and validity of the Indian version of the NDDI-E in PWE was determined.
   Method: After ethical clearance, 217 PWE above 18 years of age, on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), attending neurology outpatient department (OPD) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India, were evaluated for depression using the NDDI-E (Indian version) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-Module A, version 6.0.0) as reference standard. Informed consent was taken before recruitment. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Cronbach's alpha, a measure of the internal consistency and reliability, were carried out to validate cutoff and questionnaire, respectively.
   Results: Of the 217 PWE (112 males/105 females), mean age of 28.6 +/- 9.4 years, with generalized (69.1%) or focal seizures (30.9%), 41.5% and 10.6% were diagnosed with depression using MINI and NDDI-E Indian version (at cutoff > 15), respectively. However, at a cutoff score of >11, the Indian version of NDDI-E had a sensitivity of 96.67%, a specificity of 8425%, a positive predictive value of 81.31%, and a negative predictive value of 9727%. ROC analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9547 (confidence interval (CI) 95% = 0.929-0.979; standard error (SE): 0.0127). With the Indian version of NDDI-E, the Cronbach's a value was 0.877.
   Conclusion: A periodic assessment of PWE using a quickly administrable and reliable tool for screening depression is highly desirable given the high incidence. In the Indian population with a cutoff of >11, NDDI-E is a reliable and valid instrument to screen depression in PWE. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MUIC was measured in 544 mothers, 400 mother-neonate dyads with neonatal TSH levels >5 mIU/L (cases) and 144 mother-neonate newborn mother dyads with neonatal TSH <5 mIU/L (controls).ResultsThe percentage of mothers with iodine insufficiency (9.8% vs 5.6%) as well as iodine excess (54.3% vs 41.7%) were significant higher in cases than controls. Mean TSH was also higher (P=0.0002) in both the iodine deficient and iodine excess group. There was no correlation between neonatal TSH values and MUIC.ConclusionsLack of correlation between neonatal TSH and MUIC is due to iodine excess together with iodine deficiency.

AB  - Integrating interventional radiology (IR) into clinical practice faces challenges in emerging countries in Asia and Africa. Overcoming them requires innovative solutions customized to local needs. After an in-depth gap analysis of these challenges, we began an organized skill development initiative in late 2015 offering radiologists and their supporting staff fully paid scholarships for IR training. Its concept, structure, and progress are reported here. This initiative covered 8 countries, IR specialists (n = 51), senior residents (n = 24), and 15 educational events (training institute [n = 3]; participating countries [n = 12]). This initiative is intended to develop a global network of trained personnel who can support IR programs in challenging locations of emerging countries.

AB  - Once thought to be uncommon, celiac disease has now become a common disease globally. While avoidance of the gluten-containing diet is the only effective treatment so far, many new targets are being explored for the development of new drugs for its treatment. The endpoints of therapy include not only reversal of symptoms, normalization of immunological abnormalities and healing of mucosa, but also maintenance of remission of the disease by strict adherence of the gluten-free diet (GFD). There is no single gold standard test for the diagnosis of celiac disease and the diagnosis is based on the presence of a combination of characteristics including the presence of a celiac-specific antibody (anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody, anti-endomysial antibody or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibody) and demonstration of villous abnormalities. While the demonstration of enteropathy is an important criterion for a definite diagnosis of celiac disease, it requires endoscopic examination which is perceived as an invasive procedure. The capability of prediction of enteropathy by the presence of the high titer of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody led to an option of making a diagnosis even without obtaining mucosal biopsies. While present day diagnostic tests are great, they, however, have certain limitations. Therefore, there is a need for biomarkers for screening of patients, prediction of enteropathy, and monitoring of patients for adherence of the gluten-free diet. Efforts are now being made to explore various biomarkers which reflect different changes that occur in the intestinal mucosa using modern day tools including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. In the present review, we have discussed comprehensively the pros and cons of available biomarkers and also summarized the current status of emerging biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of celiac disease.

AB  - Post stroke recanalization has been associated with increased risk of oxidative stress. Stimulating endogenous antioxidant pathway by activation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) plays a key role in neuronal defense against inflammation and oxidative stress in penumbra. Here, we explored whether mono methyl fumarate (MMF) could produce neuro-protection after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury via Nrf2/HO1 activation. In male SD rats, middle cerebral artery was occluded for 90 min and confirmed using Laser Doppler flowmeter. MMF (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) was administered in two divided doses at 30 min post ischemia and 5-10 min after reperfusion. After 24 h, effect on neurobehavioral parameters, infarct damage by TTC staining and MRI, oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were assessed. Expression studies of nuclear Nrf2 and cytoplasmic HO1 were performed in peri-infarct cortex and striatum; followed by dual immunofluorescence study to check the specific cell type. I/R induced neurobehavioral deficits and infarct damage were significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated by MMF (20 and 40 mg/kg). MMF, 20 mg/kg, significantly normalized I/R induced altered redox status and increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta in the ipsilateral cortex. MRI data showed significantly reduced infarct in cortex but not in striatum after MMF treatment. Expression of nuclear Nrf2 and cytoplasmic HO1 were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in peri-infarct cortex after treatment with MMF. Additionally, dual immunofluorescence showed increased Nrf2 expression in neurons and HOl expression in neurons as well as astrocytes in peri-infarct cortex after MMF treatment. Our results show the neuro-protective potential of MMF probably by restricting the progression of damage from striatum to cortex through activation of Nrf2/HO1 pathway in peri-infarct cortex.

AB  - Inflammation in uveal melanoma (UM) is linked to a bad prognosis. It is rare type of cancer, of which the metastases are usually fatal within a year. Infiltration with an inflammatory infiltrate increases with disease progression but does not seem to inhibit metastasis. The Canonical NF kappa B (C-NF kappa B) pathway is known to play a crucial role in tumor inflammation. We therefore, studied the expression of canonical NF kappa B proteins and their prognostic relevance in UM. Our study evaluated the expression of C-NF kappa B proteins (p65, p50, and c-Rel) by using immunohistochemistry on sections from 75 formalin-fixed UM. Activation of the NF kappa B subunit was determined on fresh tumor specimens by measuring the DNA-binding activity in nuclei using an NF kappa B ELISA assay. Real-time PCR was performed on frozen material on 58 tumors. The presence of native C-NF kappa B heterodimers (p65/p50 and c-Rel/p50) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. We observed a high nuclear immunoreactivity of p65, p50, and c-Rel proteins in 54, 60 and 41% UM cases, respectively. Expression of C-NF kappa B proteins significantly correlated with parameters which are related to the inflammatory environment of UM. Nuclear immunoreactivity of p65 and p50 was associated with lower patient survival (p=0.041; p=0.048) while c-Rel was not. Our finding reveals that C-NF kappa B proteins expressed are more often in UM with inflammation than those without inflammation. Activation of the canonical NF kappa B pathway is more frequent in high risk UM patients. These observations might help to understand the behaviour of high risk tumors, with upregulation of C-NF kappa B proteins contributing to tumor aggressiveness.

AB  - Background & objectives: In acute pancreatitis (AP) gut barrier dysfunction is considered as an important predisposing factor leading to increased intestinal permeability (IP). In this study a pooled analysis of data published in our previous four studies on various aspects of gut permeability and endotoxaemia in patients with AP was attempted to find an association between increased IP and severity of disease and associated complications.
   Methods: This study was a pooled analysis of data of four previously published prospective studies on AP. Gut permeability, assessed by lactulose/mannitol excretion in urine and endotoxin core antibodies type IgG and IgM (EndoCab IgG and IgM) were measured on days zero and seven (D0 and D7) of admission. All patients received standard treatment of AP. We studied whether IgG and IgM anti-endotoxin titres and lactulose-mannitol ratio (LMR) at admission and D7 were associated with organ failure, infection and mortality.
   Results: The titres of anti-endotoxin IgG and IgM were lower in all patients of AP (n=204), both in mild AP (n=24) and severe AP (n=180) in the first week, compared to controls (n=15). There was no significant difference in serum IgG and IgM anti-endotoxin levels and LAIR at baseline and at D7 among patients with organ failure, infection and mortality.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed that serum IgG and IgM anti-endotosin titres and LMR at admission and at day 7 were not associated with organ failure, infection, and death of patients with AP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advancements in microscopy and more recently in neuroendoscopy have revolutionized the field of neurosurgery. Handheld neurosurgical instruments are integral components of these procedures. However, these instruments have many limitations, such as poor ergonomics, constrained maneuverability, and limited degrees of freedom. A need for developing better instruments is commonly felt by neurosurgeons. Also, the focus of modern neurosurgical training is shifting toward simulation models. The baseline data of surgical instruments play a vital role in the development of virtual and physical simulators. A primary factor impeding development of novel instruments and simulators is lack of a comprehensive surgical instrument database. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a virtual repository of microscopic and neuroendoscopic instruments.
   METHODS: Standard neurosurgical instrument sets were scanned, reverse engineered, and stored in various file formats at the file transfer protocol server. The developed database was validated by 4 groups of experts by creating different neurosurgery applications.
   RESULTS: Four groups of experts used the repository content to create novel ergonomic instrument designs, e-learning material, computer visionebased surgical skills evaluation and virtual reality and validated the contents. The validation results showed that quality of content (75%), usefulness of content (85.6%), and time saving using content (88.1%) received high scores, and the effectiveness of the virtual repository contents was appreciated.
   CONCLUSIONS: The virtual database is an efficient starting aid to foster research collaborations related to neurosurgical instruments and surgical simulation platforms.

AB  - Objectives: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) remains a debilitating cause of death among HIV-infected patients. The combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) is the most effective anti-Pneumocystis treatment and prophylaxis. However, long-term use of this combination has raised alarms about the emergence of resistant organisms. This study was performed to investigate mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene and their clinical consequences in HIV-infected patients with PCP.
   Methods: A total of 76 clinically suspected cases of PCP among HIV-seropositive adult patients from March 2014 to March 2017 were included. Clinical samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum) were investigated for the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii using both microscopy and nested PCR. DHPS genotyping and mutational analyses were performed and the data were correlated with clinical characteristics.
   Results: Among the 76 enrolled HIV-positive patients, only 17 (22.4%) were positive for P. jirovecii. DHPS gene sequencing showed a novel nucleotide substitution at position 288 (Val96Ile) in three patients (3/12; 25.0%). Patients infected with the mutant P. jirovecii genotype had severe episodes of PCP, did not respond to SXT and had a fatal outcome (P = 0.005). All three patients had a CD4(+) T-cell count <100 cells/mu L, and two also had co-infections.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that the emergence of a mutant P. jirovecii genotype is probably associated with drug resistance and mortality. The data also suggest that DHPS mutational analyses should be performed in HIV-seropositive patients to avoid treatment failure and death due to PCP. However, the role of underlying disease severity and co-morbidities should not be underestimated. (C) 2019 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The association of postoperative complications and obesity after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been well described. However, the effect of an increased body-mass index (BMI) on postoperative complications after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is controversial. Therefore, our aim was to assess the influence of BMI on 30-day postoperative complications after UKA when analyzed as both a categorical and continuous variable.
   Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was used to identify a total of 8029 patients who underwent UKA from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016. The database was queried for over 30 unique complications occurring within 30 days. The impact of BMI on short-term outcomes was assessed as a categorical variable using univariate and multivariate regression. Additionally, BMI was assessed as a continuous variable using spline regressions.
   Results: Univariate regression analysis revealed that compared to normal weight patients, overweight patients had a lower risk of major complication (odds ratio [OR], 0.506; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.279-0.918; p = 0.025), and any complication ([OR] 0.632; 95% CI, 0.423-0.944; p = 0.025) Multivariate regression analysis found no statistically significant relationship between categorical BMI and complications or outcomes, except for morbidly obese patients who had a greater risk of superficial SSI (p = 0.026). Spline regression found no statistically significant non-linear relationships between BMI and any complication (p = 0.4687), major complications (p = 0.1567), or minor complications (p = 0.4071).
   Conclusion: Overweight and obese individuals who undergo UKA may not have an increased risk of 30-day postoperative complications compared to normal weight individuals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - PurposeTo study microscopic and ultrastructural changes of levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscle in congenital ptosis.MethodsIn this prospective observational study, LPS muscle was studied in 77 eyelids with congenital ptosis; 35simple congenital ptosis (SCP), 12Marcus Gunn jaw winking phenomenon (MGJWP), and 30blepharophimosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). Light microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were performed, and results were analyzed.ResultsMuscle fibers were detected in 83.33% of MGJWP, 22.86% of SCP and 16.67% of BPES eyelids. Fibers were detected significantly more in individuals with moderate ptosis, LPS action>4mm, present eyelid crease and eyelid fold. Severe endomysial and perimysial fibrosis was seen significantly more in individuals with MGJWP. Fat infiltration and nuclei internalization were seen in all three groups. The absence of degenerating or regenerating fibers and inflammatory cells, normal staining pattern on immunohistochemistry and absence of accumulation of any abnormal substance were found in all three groups. Abnormal mitochondrial staining pattern was seen occasionally in three groups. On electron microscopy, muscle was detected in 1 SCP eyelid and 8 MGJWP eyelids out of which 4 had myofibrillary disruption. All other eyelids where muscle fibers were not detected had only fibrocollagenous tissue.ConclusionFibrocollagenous tissue predominated in all the cases, and muscle fibers detected correlated inversely with the severity of ptosis. The absence of degenerating, regenerating fibers and inflammatory cells supported the theory of dysgenesis of muscle. However, internalization of nucleus seen in all the subtypes is a feature favoring dystrophy.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the utility of RetCam ultra-wide-field fundus fluorescein angiography in pediatric retinal vascular diseases. Methods: A retrospective chart review was carried out in 43 eyes of 22 pediatric patients who were diagnosed or suspected to have a retinal vascular disease. Fluorescein angiography was carried out using the 130 degree lens of RetCam 3. Fluorescein angiography guided treatment (laser/cryotherapy) was carried out wherever required. Results: Diseases studied included - coats disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, congenital retinal folds, double optic nerve head, persistent fetal vasculature and incontinentia pigmenti. RetCam assisted fluorescein angiography was helpful in establishing a diagnosis in 4 patients (18%), in decision making regarding treatment in 18 patients (82%), in deciding need for retreatment in 5 patients (23%), helped in staging of disease in 5 patients (23%) and in detecting clinically subtle findings in 6 patients (27%). Conclusion: RetCam assisted FFA is extremely useful to document peripheral retinal vascular pathologies in pediatric patients and helps to take crucial therapeutic and retreatment decisions.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of conventional laser photocoagulation versus additional posterior barrage laser in advanced stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Methods: A total of 20 infants with bilateral symmetric zone 2 stage 3 advancing ROP were treated with conventional laser treatment followed by randomization of one eye to receive additional posterior retinal laser treatment. Disc-fovea and inter-arcade distance was measured. The patients were followed up prospectively for 3 months. Structural and functional outcomes and safety profile were analyzed. Results: 18/20 (90%) eyes in the study group and 19/20 (95%) eyes in the control group achieved regression of disease. Faster and complete regression was observed at 4 weeks after posterior laser compared to the control group (P = 0.024). Disc-fovea and inter-arcade distance was comparable in both groups. Conclusion: Additional posterior barrage laser is a safe technique that led to faster and more complete regression in eyes with advancing ROP. Final regression profile was comparable in both treatment modalities.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate stereopsis and visual quality after bilateral implantation of extended range of vision intraocular lenses (ERV IOLs).
   Setting: R.P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.
   Design: Prospective interventional study.
   Methods: Patients underwent phacoemulsification with bilateral implantation of ERV IOLs. The primary outcome measures were stereopsis (distance and near Randot) and visual quality (ray tracing aberrometry). The secondary outcome measures were visual acuity and patient satisfaction. Follow-up was performed on day 1 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.
   Results: The study comprised 50 patients (100 eyes). The mean age of the patients was 58.9 years +/- 8.9 (SD). At 1 year, the mean distance stereopsis was 103.6 +/- 49.1 seconds of arc (arcsec) and near stereopsis was 21.1 +/- 2.3 arcsec. Perfect near stereopsis of 20 arcsec was present in 80% of cases, and 82% had good distance stereopsis of 100 arcsec or better. Stereopsis correlated well with the patient satisfaction score (P < .001) and average internal modulation transfer function (MTF) (P < .015). The mean Strehl ratio was 0.029 +/- 0.021, MTF was 0.24 +/- 0.08, total higher-order aberrations were 0.62 +/- 0.41 pm, and coma was 0.25 +/- 0.18 pm. The mean binocular uncorrected decimal visual acuities were 0.98 +/- 0.07 (distance), 0.82 +/- 0.09 (intermediate) and 0.64 +/- 0.08 (near). The mean patient satisfaction score was 9.08 +/- 1.1, and no case required IOL explantation because of visually disturbing phenomena or patient dissatisfaction.
   Conclusion: Excellent stereoacuity was observed after bilateral implantation of ERV IOLs, which correlated well with patient satisfaction and quality of vision. (C) 2019 ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - MPNSTs (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors) are a highly malignant group of soft tissue sarcomas and carry a very poor prognosis. Metastasis to bilateral adrenal glands is very rare in such group of neoplasms. We discuss a case of 85-year-old man who was diagnosed with MPNST from prevertebral mass with metastases to bilateral adrenal glands and bone marrow from the beginning and role of serial F-18-FDG PET/CT scans in response assessment first to sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and then to liposomal doxorubicin.

AB  - Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in developing countries. Therefore, development of new chemotherapeutic agents is required. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells contain elevated copper levels which play an integral role in angiogenesis. Thus, targeting copper via copper-specific chelators in cancer cells can serve as effective anticancer strategy. In this work, a copper chelator pregnenolone acetate nucleus-based tetrazole derivative (ligand-L) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, ESI-MS,H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. DNA binding ability of ligand-L was studied using UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies reveal that quenching constant of ligand-L-DNA and ligand-L-Cu(II) were found to be 7.4 x 10(3) M-1 and 8.8 x 10(3) M-1, respectively. In vitro toxicity of ligand-L was studied on human cervical cancer C33A cancer cells. Results showed that ligand-L exhibit significant cytotoxic activity against cervical cancer C33A cells with IC50 value 5.0 +/- 1.8 mu M. Further, it was found that ligand-L cytotoxicity is due to redox cycling of copper to generate ROS which leads to DNA damage and apoptosis. In conclusion, this is the report where we synthesized pregnenolone acetate-based tetrazole derivative against C33A cells that targets cellular copper to induce pro-oxidant death in cancer cells. These findings will provide significant insights into the development of new chemical molecules with better copper chelating and pro-oxidant properties against cancer cells.

AB  - Background: Navigation is associated with improved accuracy in alignment. However, its influence on clinical outcome is inconclusive. The aim of this study was to compare the component alignment and functional outcome in patients undergoing navigation-assisted and conventional total knee replacement (TKR). Materials and method: A prospective randomized study consisting of two groups (group A and group B) was carried out. Group A consisted of patients undergoing TKR using conventional jig-based method, whereas group B consisted of patients undergoing TKR using computer navigation-assisted method. We measured and compared the coronal and sagittal plane alignment in X-ray and rotational alignment in computed tomography scan between both groups. Functional outcome was analysed using Knee Society Score (KSS) and Western Ontario and McMaster University scale (WOMAC) score. Results: A total of 50 patients were randomized into two groups A and B each with 25 patients. Navigation was associated with more accuracy in mechanical axis alignment (p = 0.011) and femoral component rotation (p = 0.033). The mean follow-up was 4.6 years (range 48-62 months). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to KSS and WOMAC score at the minimum follow-up of 4 years. Conclusion: We concluded that even though navigation-assisted system is associated with better accuracy, there was no difference in clinical outcome at an average follow-up of 4.6 years.

AB  - C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) serves as a co-receptor for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), enabling the virus to enter human CD4T cells and macrophages. In the absence of CCR5, HIV strains that require CCR5 (R5 or M-tropic HIV) fail to successfully initiate infection. Various natural mutations of the CCR5 gene have been reported to interfere with the HIV-CCR5 interaction, which influences the rate of AIDS progression. Genetic characterization of the CCR5 gene in individuals from the National Capital Regions (NCRs) of India revealed several natural point mutations in HIV seropositive/negative individuals. Furthermore, we identified novel frame-shifts mutations in the CCR5 gene in HIV seronegative individuals, as well as the well reported CCR5 Delta 32 mutation. Additionally, we observed a number of mutations present only in HIV seropositive individuals. This is the first report to describe the genetic variations of CCR5 in individuals from the NCRs of India and demonstrates the utility of investigating understudied populations to identify novel CCR5 polymorphisms.

AB  - BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is used globally by 194 WHO member nations. It is used for assigning clinical diagnoses, providing the framework for reporting public health data, and to inform the organization and reimbursement of health services. Guided by overarching principles of increasing clinical utility and global applicability, the 11th revision of the ICD proposes major changes that incorporate empirical advances since the previous revision in 1992. To test recommended changes in the Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders chapter, multiple vignette-based case-controlled field studies have been conducted which examine clinicians' ability to accurately and consistently use the new guidelines and assess their overall clinical utility. This manuscript reports on the results from the study of the proposed ICD-11 guidelines for feeding and eating disorders (FEDs).MethodParticipants were 2288 mental health professionals registered with WHO's Global Clinical Practice Network. The study was conducted in Chinese, English, French, Japanese, and Spanish. Clinicians were randomly assigned to apply either the ICD-11 or ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines for FEDs to a pair of case vignettes designed to test specific clinical questions. Clinicians selected the diagnosis they thought was correct for each vignette, evaluated the presence of each essential feature of the selected diagnosis, and the clinical utility of the diagnostic guidelines.ResultsThe proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines significantly improved accuracy for all FEDs tested relative to ICD-10 and attained higher clinical utility ratings; similar results were obtained across all five languages. The inclusion of binge eating disorder and avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder reduced the use of residual diagnoses. Areas needing further refinement were identified.ConclusionsThe proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines consistently outperformed ICD-10 in distinguishing cases of eating disorders and showed global applicability and appropriate clinical utility. These results suggest that the proposed ICD-11 guidelines for FEDs will help increase accuracy of public health data, improve clinical diagnosis, and enhance health service organization and provision. This is the first time in the revision of the ICD that data from large-scale, empirical research examining proposed guidelines is completed in time to inform the final diagnostic guidelines.

AB  - Gluten is known to be the main triggering factor for celiac disease (CeD), an immune-mediated disorder. CeD is therefore managed using a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), the only effective treatment available currently. However, the GFD is restrictive. Hence, efforts are being made to explore alternative therapies. Based on their mechanisms of action on various molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of CeD, these therapies may be classified into one of the following five broad approaches. The first approach focuses on decreasing the immunogenic content of gluten, using strategies like genetically modified wheat, intra-intestinal gluten digestion using glutenases, microwave thermal treatment of hydrated wheat kernels, and gluten pretreatment with either bacterial/ fungal derived endopeptidases or microbial transglutaminase. The second approach involves sequestering gluten in the gut lumen before it is digested into immunogenic peptides and absorbed, using binder drugs like polymer p(HEMA-co-SS), single chain fragment variable (scFv), and anti- gluten antibody AGY. The third approach aims to prevent uptake of digested gluten through intestinal epithelial tight junctions, using a zonulin antagonist. The fourth approach involves tissue transglutaminase (tTG) inhibitors to prevent the enhancement of immunogenicity of digested gluten by the intestinal tTG enzyme. The fifth approach seeks to prevent downstream immune activation after uptake of gluten immunogenic peptides through the intestinal mucosal epithelial layer. Examples include HLA-DQ2 blockers that prevent presentation of gluten derived- antigens by dendritic cells to T cells, immune- tolerizing therapies like the vaccine Nexvax2 and TIMP-Glia, cathepsin inhibitors, immunosuppressants like corticosteroids, azathioprine etc., and anti-cytokine agents targeting TNF-alpha and interleukin-15. Apart from these approaches, research is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics/prebiotics, helminth therapy using Necator americanus, low FODMAP diet, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation in CeD symptom control; however, the mechanisms by which they play a beneficial role in CeD are yet to be clearly established. Overall, although many therapies being explored are still in the pre-clinical phase, some like the zonulin antagonist, immune tolerizing therapies and glutenases have reached phase II/III clinical trials. While these potential options appear exciting, currently they may at best be used to supplement rather than supplant the GFD.

AB  - One hundred and fifty infertile polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women were classified into four phenotypes on the basis of Rotterdam criteria. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with a cutoff >= 2.5 was considered as a measure of insulin resistance (IR). Maximum number of patients, 57 (38%) in our cohort belonged to phenotype A or the classical phenotype with all 3 features of Rotterdam criteria. Mean body mass index (BMI) in all phenotypes was more than 25 kg/m(2) and the highest was seen in phenotype B. According to BMI categories in the four phenotypes, more number of women was in the obese category in phenotype A (24.5%) and B (56.5%) in comparison to phenotype C (18.2%) and D (10.8%) (p<.001). There was no difference in median HOMA-IR among different phenotype categories (p=.718). The median value of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) was highest in phenotype A (11.68 ng/ml [7.94-16.46]) and significantly more in comparison to B phenotype (Kruskal-Wallis, p=.018). Thus there is heterogeneity in AMH levels and BMI in different PCOS phenotypes with higher levels in the most severe phenotypes. There is, however, no correlation of IR among the different phenotype groups and further investigation is needed to characterize its role in phenotypic classification.

AB  - Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities(.)(1,2) This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity(3-6). Here we use 2,009 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017-and more than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions-was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing-and in some countries reversal-of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories.

AB  - Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) has been associated with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival, but we do not know if ALC is associated with minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction (EOI) and whether it can be used as surrogate marker in resource limited settings. Immunological differences between MRD-positive and MRD-negative B ALL patients at the EOI are not known at present. This prospective study evaluated the association of ALC and peripheral blood lymphocyte subset percentage at the EOI with MRD. ALC was done at baseline, day 8, and day 15 and at EOI. Assessment for MRD and peripheral blood lymphocyte subset was done at EOI. In 2-year study duration, 197 B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients were recruited out of which 150 were analyzed. Peripheral lymphocyte subset percentage was available for 58 patients. We found that ALC at baseline, day 8, day 15, and EOI was not associated with MRD. Day 8 ALC was significantly higher in poor steroid responders (day 8 blasts > 1 x 10(9) cells/l) (p < 0.0001). At the EOI, CD4(-)CD8(+) cell percentage in peripheral blood were significantly higher in MRD-positive patients than MRD-negative patients (p = 0.01). Our study suggests that ALC at any point is not a surrogate marker for MRD. Immunologically MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients differ in CD4(-)CD8(+) cells. The role of CD8(+)T and TCR alpha beta CD3(+)T cells in eliminating residual leukemic cells need to be studied further by functional assays.

AB  - There has been increased reporting of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in certain agricultural communities in the world. In India, an increased prevalence of CKDu has been observed in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Goa, and Maharashtra. Although no single causative factor has been proved, several have been proposed: water-borne agrochemicals, silica, chemical flavors in betel nuts, and pesticides. The renal biopsy findings have been similar to those seen in Sri Lanka and Mesoamerican nephropathy in that the predominant findings have been tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with little or no involvement of the glomerular and vascular compartments. Because most of the affected communities belong to the lower socioeconomic group including farmers, a multipronged approach is required for addressing this CKDu epidemic with an emphasis on awareness, prevention, screening, surveillance, provision of renal replacement therapy, increased government spending on health care, and systematic research.

AB  - Contents The present study identified few potential proteins in the spermatozoa of buffalo bulls that can be used as an aid in fertility determination through comparative proteomics. The sperm proteome of high-fertile buffalo bulls was compared with that of low-fertile buffalo bulls using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and the differentially expressed proteins were identified through mass spectrometric method. The protein interaction network and the functional bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed proteins were also carried out. In the spermatozoa of high-fertile bulls, 10 proteins were found overexpressed and 15 proteins were underexpressed at the level of twofold or more (p <= 0.05). The proteins overexpressed in high-fertile spermatozoa were PDZD8, GTF2F2, ZNF397, KIZ, LOH12CR1, ACRBP, PRSS37, CYP11B2, F13A1 and SPO11, whereas those overexpressed in low-fertile spermatozoa were MT1A, ATP5F1, CS, TCRB, PRODH2, HARS, IDH3A, SRPK3, Uncharacterized protein C9orf9 homolog isoform X4, TUBB2B, GPR4, PMP2, CTSL1, TPPP2 and EGFL6. The differential expression ranged from 2.0- to 6.1-fold between the two groups, where CYP11B2 was high abundant in high-fertile spermatozoa and MT1A was highly abundant in low-fertile spermatozoa. Most of the proteins overexpressed in low-fertile spermatozoa were related to energy metabolism and capacitation factors, pointing out the possible role of pre-mature capacitation and cryo-damages in reducing the fertility of cryopreserved buffalo spermatozoa.

AB  - There are different BCR-ABL1 fusion genes that are translated into proteins that are different from each other, yet all leukemogenic, causing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Their frequency has never been systematically investigated. In a series of 45503 newly diagnosed CML patients reported from 45 countries, it was found that the proportion of e13a2 (also known as b2a2) and of e14a2 (also known as b3a2), including the cases co-expressing e14a2 and el 3a2, was 37.9% and 62.1%, respectively. The proportion of these two transcripts was correlated with gender, e13a2 being more frequent in males (39.2%) than in females (36.2%), was correlated with age, decreasing from 39.6% in children and adolescents down to 31.6% in patients >= 80 years old, and was not constant worldwide. Other, rare transcripts were reported in 666/34561 patients (1.93%). The proportion of rare transcripts was associated with gender (2.27% in females and 1.69% in males) and with age (from 1.79% in children and adolescents up to 3.84% in patients >= 80 years old). These data show that the differences in proportion are not by chance. This is important, as the transcript type is a variable that is suspected to be of prognostic importance for response to treatment, outcome of treatment, and rate of treatment-free remission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial pseudoaneurysms of the neck are rarely reported in the pediatric population and no dedicated large series are available. Trauma and infection are the most common causes for these aneurysms, with congenital and collagen vascular disorders being the less common causes. These lesions can be life threatening, especially when they present with bleeding or airway compromise.
   METHODS: We searched our radiology information system for all cases of pediatric neck aneurysm presented between June 2015 and May 2018. These cases were analyzed for clinicoepidemiologic variables, clinical presentation, imaging findings, management, and follow-up.
   RESULTS: Six children were included in the study (male/female ratio, 5:1), with a mean age of 7.8 years (range, 2.5-15 years). Four presented acutely with either bleeding or rapidly enlarging neck swelling, whereas 2 presented with slowly increasing pulsatile swelling. One had a traumatic cause, 2 had infections, and 1 had infective cervical lymphadenitis complicated by iatrogenic injury whereas no definite causative mechanisms could be accounted for in 2 patients. Two of the children were managed by trapping of the aneurysm and 2 only by proximal parent vessel occlusion. The other 2 children were treated with stent graft deployment across the aneurysm neck to reconstruct the parent vessel. All the patients were doing well during the follow-up period (mean, 14.8 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular means of treatment for pediatric neck aneurysms is relatively simple and safe. Although parent vessel sacrifice is the gold-standard management, vessel-preserving strategies can be tried in select cases with favorable anatomy.

AB  - Hesperidin (HES), a flavanone glycoside, predominant in citrus fruits, has an agonistic activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). PPAR-gamma is an inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy (CH) signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated the cardioprotective effect of HES in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced CH through PPAR-gamma agonistic activity. For this, male albino Wistar rats were divided into six groups (n = 6), that is, normal, ISO-control, HES treatment group (200 mg kg(-1); p.o.), HES per se (200 mg kg(-1); p.o.), enalapril treatment group (30 mg kg(-1); p.o.), and combination group (HES 200 mg kg(-1); p.o.+enalapril 30 mg kg(-1); p.o.). ISO (3 mg kg(-1); s.c.) was administered to all groups except normal and per se to induce CH. HES or enalapril treatment of 28 days significantly attenuated pathological changes, improved cardiac hemodynamics, suppressed oxidative stress, and apoptosis along with an increased PPAR-gamma expression. The combination of enalapril with HES exhibited an effect similar to that of HES or enalapril alone on all the aforementioned parameters. Therefore, HES may be further evaluated as a promising molecule for the alleviation of CH.

AB  - Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is a pleiotropic cytokine and was primarily studied in the context of T helper 2 (T(H)2)-associated immuno-pathological conditions such as asthma and parasitic infections. There was a paradigm shift in the biology of IL-9 after the recent discovery of T(H)9 cells, a new subtype of T-H cells which secrete IL-9 in copious amounts. This has resulted in renewed interest in this cytokine, which was neglected since discovery because it was considered it to be just another T(H)2 cytokine. Recent studies have shown that it has multiple cellular sources and is critically involved in the immune-pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and in guarding immune tolerance. In this review, we will discuss its discovery, gene organization, cellular sources, and signaling pathways. Especially, we will give an update on the recent development regarding its relevance in the immune pathogenesis of human diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transient tumor attack is a rare but well-known phenomenon. Described by Ross in 1983, it demonstrated a transient ischemic attack-like picture in patients with intracranial mass lesions. Usually these attacks were recognized at sites anatomically away from the primary lesion that were not explained by primary mass effect of the lesion. The exact pathophysiology of such transient tumor attacks is postulated to be due to either a vascular steal phenomenon or compression of a vessel or localized prothrombotic state.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we describe a case who was being evaluated for a lacunar stroke involving the lateral geniculate body, and a surprising finding of left intraventricular meningioma was detected.
   CONCLUSIONS: We try to shed some light on the pathophysiology of this unusual phenomenon.

AB  - Bone marrow iron estimation remains the gold standard for diagnosing iron-deficiency anemia (IDA); serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity, and transferrin saturation are routinely used as surrogate markers of IDA. However, these tests are marred by problems like poor specificity and sensitivity. Recently, hepcidin, a protein hormone synthesized in the liver and excreted in urine, has been shown to be related to iron status. We estimated the serum and urinary hepcidin levels in healthy children 6 to 60 months of age with (n=30) and without IDA (n=30). The mean (SD) serum hepcidin levels in children with IDA were significantly lower than those in children without IDA (3.03 [1.06] vs. 4.78 [3.94] ng/mL; P=0.02). The mean (SD) urinary hepcidin levels were also significantly lower in children with IDA than those in children without IDA (2.29 [0.53] vs. 2.79 [0.75] ng/mL; P=0.004). Performance of urinary and serum hepcidin compared with serum ferritin (<12 mu g/L) for diagnosing IDA in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.704 (P=0.007) and 0.59 (P=0.22), respectively. Serum hepcidin is not useful for diagnosing IDA in under-5 children. In contrast, urinary hepcidin holds promise as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for IDA in under-5 children.

AB  - Background: The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristanus) is native to South Asia and is the national bird of India. Here we present a draft genome sequence of the male blue peacock using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT). Results: ONT sequencing gave similar to 2.3-fold sequencing coverage, whereas Illumina generated 150-base pair paired-end sequence data at 284.6-fold coverage from 5 libraries. Subsequently, we generated a 0.915-gigabase pair de novo assembly of the peacock genome with a scaffold N50 of 0.23 megabase pairs (Mb). We predict that the peacock genome contains 23,153 protein-coding genes and 75.3 Mb (7.33%) of repetitive sequences. Conclusions: We report a high-quality assembly of the peacock genome using a hybrid approach of sequences generated by both Illumina and ONT. The long-read chemistry generated by ONT was useful for addressing challenges related to de novo assembly, particularly at regions containing repetitive sequences spanning longer than the read length, and which could not be resolved with only short-read-based assembly. Contig assembly of Illumina short reads gave an N50 of 1,639 bases, whereas with ONT, the N50 increased by >9-fold to 14,749 bases. The initial contig assembly based on Illumina sequencing reads alone gave 685,241 contigs. Further scaffolding on assembled contigs using both Illumina and ONT sequencing reads resulted in a final assembly of 15,025 super-scaffolds, with an N50 of similar to 0.23 Mb. Ninety-five percent of proteins predicted by homology matched with those in a public repository, verifying the completeness of our assembly. Like other phylogenetic studies of avian conserved genes, we found P. cristatus to be most closely related to Gallus gallus, followed by Meleagris gallopavo and Anas platyrhynchos. Compared with the recently published peacock genome assembly, the current, superior, hybrid assembly has greater sequencing depth, fewer non-ATGC sequences, and fewer scaffolds.

AB  - Atherosclerotic cardiovascular events are one of the common causes of mortality in patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS). Atherogenic dyslipidemia is more common among South Asian Indians as compared to other ethnicities and is likely to worsen among patients with CS. This retrospective study was done over 5 years at a single institute to evaluate the pattern of lipid abnormalities in subjects with CS and the changes in lipid parameters after surgical control of hypercortisolemia. The study was done in two parts. In the first part, records of patients with CS diagnosed over 3 years were retrospectively reviewed. Hormonal and metabolic parameters including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post prandial plasma glucose (PPPG), HbA1c, serum lipids, serum cortisol and plasma ACTH were recorded. In the second part, lipid parameters were rechecked among patients who underwent surgery and a median follow up of 4 +/- 2 months after remission. Out of the 126 patients diagnosed with endogenous CS over 3 years, 100 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. At baseline, sixty five (65%) patients had dyslipidemia as defined by the NCEP-ATPIII criteria. 47 out of 63 (74.6%) subjects achieved remission after surgical management of CS. 32 (68.1%) of these patients had dyslipidemia prior to surgery. After excluding 1 death, 26 of 46 (56.5%) subjects had dyslipidemia after the follow up period. Lipid abnormalities are common among South Asian Indian subjects with endogenous CS and the pattern persists in most of them, 3 months after surgical correction of hypercortisolism.

AB  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder in adults which usually manifests with involvement of multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system. We describe an unusual case of biopsy-proven LCH presenting with frontotemporal-dominant cognitive impairment with hypothalamic involvement, along with multisystem disease. We propose that the dementia was probably an immune-mediated process triggered by LCH which responded dramatically to high-dose steroids.

KW  - NEUROLOGISTS
KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - Aim: To evaluate whether the residency training programs in India are meeting the expectations and aspirations of the present-day trainees.
   Introduction: Residents in training today are the neurosurgeons of tomorrow. Significant resources are dedicated to their training and education. Neurosurgical residency in India-when compared to the rest of the world-is relatively new. However, the structure of the Indian neurosurgical training programs has remained relatively unchanged since they were first introduced. In contrast, the treatment paradigms for neurosurgical conditions have changed rapidly in recent years, as new subspecialties have gained prominence.
   Methods: An online questionnaire based survey was prepared considering the common themes of neurosurgery residency. The links to the survey were mailed to residents in training all over the country. Results were evaluated after a minimum of 100 responses was collected. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and frank answers to the survey questions.
   Results: A total of 104 responses were received from all the major post-graduate training institutes of the country. The period of joining residency ranged from July 2010 to August 2018. Respondents generally agreed on the need for work hour regulations, the importance of history taking and clinical examination and the significance of imaging interpretation as major training goals. The residents were desirous of more hands-on opportunities during operative teaching. Deficiencies were recognized in the exposure to various upcoming subspecialties such as endovascular therapy, radiosurgery, epilepsy surgery, etc. The residents were generally satisfied with the pattern of examination system and showed a clear preference for electronic resources for reading and knowledge acquisition.
   Conclusion: The survey highlights the perception of the residents towards the training programs that they are enrolled into. Several lacunae and potential areas of improvement are brought to our attention, which have been necessitated by the recent advancements in technology affecting the neurosurgical treatment paradigms. The training programs need to keep pace with the aspirations and hopes of the residents so that the training experience is mutually fruitful for the trainees and educators. This is important to ensure that the present-day residents can step into their future roles with confidence and preparedness.

AB  - Acute pancreatitis may be associated with both local and systemic complications. Systemic injury manifests in the form of organ failure, which is seen in approximately 20% of all cases of acute pancreatitis and defines "severe acute pancreatitis." Organ failure typically develops early in the course of acute pancreatitis, but also may develop later due to infected pancreatic necrosis-induced sepsis. Organ failure is the most important determinant of outcome in acute pancreatitis. We review here the current understanding of the risk factors, pathophysiology, timing, impact on outcome, and therapy of organ failure in acute pancreatitis. As we discuss the pathophysiology of severe systemic injury, the distinctions between markers and mediators of severity are highlighted based on evidence supporting their causality in organ failure. Emphasis is placed on clinically relevant end points of organ failure and the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological perturbations, which offer insight into potential therapeutic targets to treat.

AB  - Maffucci syndrome is characterized by multiple benign vascular anomalies and enchondromas present on the distal extremities. Effective treatment options are currently not available for Maffucci syndrome-associated vascular lesions. Sirolimus is a mTOR pathway inhibitor, and has been tried successfully in the treatment of various vascular anomalies. We treated a 23-year-old female with Maffucci syndrome-associated spindle cell hemangiomas with oral sirolimus (2mg/day, 0.04mg/kg/day). There was improvement in pain, but no change in colour or size of the vascular nodules. In view of unsatisfactory response and treatment-related adverse effects (oral aphthae, mild transaminitis), sirolimus was stopped after 6 months.

AB  - The syndromic approach has been the cornerstone of management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in developing countries. This strategy has had a considerable impact in decreasing the burden of STI in society. It offers the advantages of treating the infection at the first visit itself, reducing the risk of complications, non-reliance on laboratory diagnostics, and easy integration into the primary healthcare system. Nonetheless, it is not without limitations, most often criticized for its inabilityto treatasymptomatic cases. Syndromic management has been found to be satisfactory for genital ulcer disease and urethral discharge in several settings. However, its performance is not as good in the treatment of vaginal discharge syndrome, as it does not allow a distinction between cervicitis and vaginitis. Diagnostic validation and a review of its performance should be done periodically to keep abreast of the changing aetiology of various syndromes and patterns of drug susceptibility. Supplementing the syndromic approach with point-of-care tests and simple laboratory tests where available can improve its results. Further, healthcare professionals should be imparted training for optimum patient care. This narrative review critically appraises the syndromic approach to STIs, discusses the challenges that it faces, and offers suggestions to improve its performance.

AB  - Purpose: The optimal treatment for adult mandibular condylar fractures (MCFs) has largely shifted in favor of open reduction and rigid internal fixation. However, a sizeable portion of these injuries are still being treated in a closed manner based on old literature, convenience, results deemed acceptable, and lesser associated morbidity. Most MCFs with multiple associated facial traumas are appropriately treated under general anesthesia (GA). However, some selected isolated MCFs or those with minimal associated mandibular or low midfacial fractures can be treated optimally with patients under local anesthesia following a protocol presented in this article, thus expediting and simplifying their management. The purpose of this study was to develop a safe, sound, effective protocol for routine surgical management of mandibular subcondylar fractures under local anesthesia.
   Patients and Methods: We carried out a prospective clinical study to assess the feasibility of operating on MCFs with patients under local anesthesia. Seven patients with MCFs and other associated facial fractures underwent surgery after careful case selection following our proposed protocol. The outcome variables were 1) duration of the procedure, 2) intraoperative pain assessed by a visual analog scale, 3) fracture reduction assessed by measuring the preoperative and postoperative average fracture gap, 4) presence of malocclusion preoperatively and postoperatively, 5) deviation on mouth opening, and 6) maximal mouth opening.
   Results: The mean duration of the procedure was 35.14 minutes, and the mean rating of intraoperative pain or discomfort was 0.57 as reported on the visual analog scale by the patients. Mean mouth opening improved from 17.1 to 40.5 mm, whereas deviation on opening improved from 4.4 to 0.28 mm. The average fracture gap was reduced from 6.32 to 0.97 mm.
   Conclusions: The presented protocol is a straightforward, efficient, safe, cost-effective tool for operating on MCFs, avoiding GA with its attendant risks and complications, that can be used routinely, as well as in patients for whom GA is deemed unsuitable.

AB  - With an escalating number of predictive biomarkers emerging in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), immunohistochemistry (IHC) is being used as a rapid and cost-effective tool for the screening and detection of many of these markers. In particular, robust IHC assays performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue are widely used as surrogate markers for ALK and ROS1 rearrangements and for detecting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in patients with advanced NSCLC; in addition, they have become essential for treatment decisions. Cytology samples represent the only source of tumor in a significant proportion of patients with inoperable NSCLC, and there is increasing demand for predictive biomarker testing on them. However, the wide variation in the types of cytology samples and their preparatory methods, the use of alcohol-based fixatives that interfere with immunochemistry results, the difficulty in procurement of cytology-specific controls, and the uncertainty regarding test validity have resulted in underutilization of cytology material for predictive immunocytochemistry (ICC), and most cytopathologists limit such testing to FFPE cell blocks (CBs). The purpose of this review is to: 1) analyze various preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical factors influencing ICC results; 2) discuss measures for validation of ICC protocols; and 3) summarize published data on predictive ICC for ALK, ROS1, EGFR gene alterations and PD-L1 expression on lung cancer cytology. Based on our experience and from a review of the literature, we conclude that cytology specimens are in principal suitable for predictive ICC, but proper optimization and rigorous quality control for high-quality staining are essential, particularly for non-CB preparations.

AB  - In this study, we examined the relative immune response of T-lymphocytes and its intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, in a mouse model system, after treatment with immunogen, mitogen, and carcinogen. We studied the T-lymphocyte percentage, their LDL-receptor expression, along with the levels of serum interleukins (IL-2, IFN gamma, IL-4, and IL-10) and intracellular cholesterol concentration (cytoplasmic and nuclear). The mitogen was found to be a better stimulator of T-cell marker expressions than the immunogen; though the immunogen was more effective on immunogenic response as was marked from interleukin levels. The chemical carcinogen benzo-alpha-pyrene at low concentration acted potentially like a mitogen but a reduced immune response was apparent at a carcinogenic dose. The findings in our study focus on the effect of carcinogenic dose of benzo-alpha-pyrene (BaP) on T-cell immunity. Benzo-alpha-pyrene causes immunosuppression through restriction of the T-cell population by targeting intracellular cholesterol.

AB  - Skeletal muscle atrophy/wasting is associated with impaired protein metabolism in diverse physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), disturbed redox status, and weakened antioxidant defense system are the major contributing factors toward atrophy. Regulation of protein metabolism by controlling ROS levels and its associated catabolic pathways may help in treating atrophy and related clinical conditions. Although cinnamaldehyde (CNA) enjoys the established status of antioxidant and its role in ROS management is reported, impact of CNA on skeletal muscle atrophy and related pathways is still unexplored. In the current study, the impact of CNA on C2C12 myotubes and the possible protection of cultured cells from H2O2-induced atrophy is examined. Myotubes were treated with H2O2 in the presence and absence of CNA and the changes in the antioxidative, proteolytic systems, and mitochondrial functions were scored. Morphological analysis showed significant protective effects of CNA on length, diameter, and nuclei fusion index of myotubes. The evaluation of biochemical markers of atrophy; creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase along with the study of muscle-specific structural protein (i.e., myosin heavy chain-fast [MHCf] type) showed significant protection of proteins by CNA. CNA pretreatment not only checked the activation of proteolytic systems (ubiquitin-proteasome E3-ligases [MuRF1/Atrogin1]), autophagy [Beclin1/LC3B], cathepsin L, calpain, caspase), but also prevented any alteration in the activities of antioxidative defense enzymes (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione-peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase). The results suggest that CNA protects myotubes from H2O2-induced atrophy by inhibiting/resisting the amendments in proteolytic systems and maintains cellular redox-balance.

AB  - Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-fusion, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies for detection of prostate cancer in an Asian population with a low incidence of prostate cancer.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 131 males with suspected prostate cancer were recruited to undergo fusion biopsy with the Artemis prostate fusion biopsy device (Eigen, Grass Valley, CA, USA). All patients underwent standard 12-core systematic biopsies in addition to biopsies targeted at the mpMRI-identified abnormal regions. Yield from the standard cores was compared with that from the targeted cores. Gleason scores of 4+3 or higher were considered significant.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 63.54 +/- 7.96 years and the mean prostate-specific antigen value was 9.75 +/- 5.35 ng/mL. A total of 36 patients had cancer, of which 3 (8.3%) were detected only on standard cores and 3 (8.3%) only on targeted cores. Of the clinically significant cancers (n=30), targeted biopsy detected a higher number (28/30, 93.3%) than standard biopsy (21/30, 70.0%). A total of 6 of 8 cancers (75.0%) that were insignificant on standard biopsy were upgraded to significant cancer on targeted cores.
   Conclusions: Eight percent of cancers were detected only on MRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsies, whereas the method upgraded more than two-thirds of insignificant cancers to significant cancers. Fusion biopsies thus provide incremental information over standard TRUS biopsies in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer in populations with a low incidence of prostate cancer.

KW  - MATURATION
AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence of cervical vertebral anomalies (CVA) in a group of patients presenting with cleft lip and palate (CLP) and to compare with a non-cleft population.
   Material and methods: The sample comprised of 150 lateral cephalograms of non-syndromic patients with CLP and 150 noncleft age-matched controls. The age range of both groups covered 6 to 20 years. An expert radiologist blinded to the cleft status evaluated the cephalograms for CVA and categorised them into normal, fusion, dehiscence and multiple cervical anomalies. The cleft group was subdivided according to the types of cleft (UCLP/ BCLP/ CPO) and gender (male/female). The CVA prevalence was compared between the cleft and non-cleft patients.
   Results: The prevalence of CVA was 37.7% and 20.7% in cleft and non-cleft patients, respectively. The difference was statistically significant with a p-value <0.01. Of the types of clefts, a left UCLP had the highest prevalence of CVA (47.2%), with fusion (35.8%) most commonly seen. On comparing CLP with CPO, no significant variation was observed between the types of anomalies.
   Conclusions: A high prevalence of CVA was observed in cleft patients compared with non-cleft subjects. The prevalence of CVA was similar between males and females. The practitioner should carefully evaluate the lateral cephalogram of CLP patients for CVA, which otherwise may remain undetected and lead to neurological symptoms later in life.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of active-fluidics based torsional phacoemulsification in diabetics and nondiabetics using a balanced tip. Methods: Two hundred and forty-eight patients undergoing senile cataract surgery using torsional phacoemulsification on an active-fluidics-based platform from December 2016 to August 2017 were included in this prospective, nonrandomized, interventional cohort study; of the 248 patients, 54 were controlled diabetics and 194 were nondiabetics. Intraoperative parameters such as cumulative dissipated energy (CDE), total ultrasound time, torsion usage time, torsion amplitude, aspiration time, and fluid usage were documented and compared. Endothelial cell loss (ECL) and central corneal thickness (CCT) were evaluated at 1 month postoperatively. Results: Diabetics and nondiabetics did not differ in CDE, total ultrasound time, torsion amplitude, aspiration time, fluid usage, endothelial cell count, and CCT. ECL on Day 1 (10.2 +/- 8.0%) and Day 30 (11.05 +/- 8.3%) were significantly higher in diabetics (P = 0.025 and P = 0.045, respectively). There was an increase in CCT on Day 1 (P = 0.018), which settled by Day 30. Grade 4 cataracts in diabetics had significantly higher CCT at Day 1 (P = 0.032) and Day 30 (P = 0.007). In the diabetic subgroup, Grades 3 and 4 cataracts required lower CDE (P < 0.001) and Grade 4 cataracts showed higher ECL than others till 1 month of follow-up (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Intraoperative and postoperative parameters after torsional phacoemulsification are comparable in diabetics and nondiabetics. Endothelial changes and pachymetry may be related to the grade of cataract in diabetics.

AB  - Objective: To know the effects of psychological preparation on perioperative stress, anxiety, and mood in children undergoing cardiac surgery and their parents.
   Design: Prospective randomized control nonblinded trial.
   Setting: Single-center tertiary teaching hospital.
   Participants: A total of 60 children aged 5 to 15 years undergoing cardiac surgery were included in the study. One of the parents, preferably the father, was selected from the respective children.
   Interventions: Subjects were randomized into 2 groups: noninterventional (group 1) and interventional (group 2). Intervention was in the form of toys and video games in children, and counseling and information in parents. Preoperative and postoperative anxiety in parents was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), stress using the Index of Clinical Stress (ICS) scale by Abell, and the Ottawa mood scale. In children, the STAI-C (child version of STAI), Ottawa mood and Ottawa stress scales, and Wong-Baker faces pain scale were applied and serum cortisol was measured.
   Measurements and Main Results: Group 2 children had significantly less (p < 0.001) stress, anxiety, and pain and improved mood. Group 2 parents had a significant reduction in state anxiety (42 +/- 4.4 v 54.5 +/- 7.8; p < 0.001) and ICS score (68.1 +/- 9.6 v 84.2 +/- 9.2; p < 0.001) and an improvement in mood (7.5 +/- 0.7 v 5.9 +/- 1; p < 0.001) compared with group 1. Postoperatively, cortisol levels in group 2 were lower than group 1 (571.3 nmol/L [123.3 - 1247.14] v 718.9 nmol/L [53-1642.0]).
   Conclusion: Providing video games and toys preoperatively reduced postoperative stress and anxiety and improved mood in children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery, Parents were relieved of anxiety and stress with proper counseling and information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives To describe the clinical and Scheimpflug imaging features in cases of anterior megalophthalmos (AM).
   Methods Retrospective record review was performed for patients with AM who presented between June 2017 and May 2018. Clinical history, slit lamp examination, Scheimpflug imaging indices (Pentacam-HR, Oculus, GmbH), dilated fundus examination and treatment records were reviewed.
   Results The study included eight eyes of four male patients (mean age 6.5 years, range 4-10 years). Corrected distance visual acuity ranged from finger counting to 20/80. The mean horizontal corneal diameter, central corneal thickness, steep keratometry, flat keratometry, anterior chamber (AC) angle, AC depth, maximum pupil diameter and axial length were 13.8 +/- 0.5 mm, 538.7 +/- 68.9 mu m, 42.8 +/- 1.6 D, 41.4 +/- 0.9D, 47.0 +/- 4.2 degree, 3.8 +/- 0.3 mm, 3.9 +/- 0.1 mm, and 24.9 +/- 0.9 mm, respectively. Posterior dislocation of crystalline lens, vitreous degeneration and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (consequent of retinal dialysis/atrophic hole/lattice with hole) were noted in seven, eight and five eyes, respectively. Pigment dispersion glaucoma was noted in both eyes of one patient, which was managed with topical anti-glaucoma medication. Vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade was successful in retinal reattachment in all three eyes that underwent surgery.
   Conclusion Scheimpflug imaging helps in demonstrating the corneal and anterior segment pathological changes in AM. The disease extends to involve the zonules, vitreous and retina as well. Ophthalmologists should be able to identify this disorder, recognise and manage the associations and complications.

TI  - <i>IKZF1</i> Deletions with COBL Breakpoints Are Not Driven RAG-Mediated Recombination Events in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - IKZF1 deletion (Delta IKZF1) is an important predictor of relapse in both childhood and adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Previously, we revealed that COBL is a hotspot for breakpoints in leukemia and could promote IKZF1 deletions. Through an international collaboration, we provide a detailed genetic and clinical picture of B-ALL with COBL rearrangements (COBL-r). Patients with B-ALL and IKZF1 deletion (n = 133) were included. IKZF1 1-8 were associated with large alterations within chromosome 7: monosomy 7 (18%), isochromosome 7q (10%), 7p loss (19%), and interstitial deletions (53%). The latter included COBL-r, which were found in 12% of the IKZF1 1-8 cohort. Patients with COBL-r are mostly classified as intermediate cytogenetic risk and frequently harbor ETV6, PAX5, CDKN2A/B deletions. Overall, 56% of breakpoints were located within COBL intron 5. Cryptic recombination signal sequence motifs were broadly distributed within the sequence of COBL, and no enrichment for the breakpoint cluster region was found. In summary, a diverse spectrum of alterations characterizes Delta IKZF1 and they also include deletion breakpoints within COBL. We confirmed that COBL is a hotspot associated with Delta IKZF1, but these rearrangements are not driven by RAG-mediated recombination.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:The ideal analgesic is not known for patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). Concerns have been raised about serious adverse effects of opioid analgesics increasing the severity of AP. We hypothesized that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might be better analgesics because of their anti-inflammatory effect. Our objective was to compare pentazocine, an opioid, and diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, for adequate analgesia in patients with AP.METHODS:In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, patients with AP were randomized to either intravenous diclofenac 75 mg or pentazocine 30 mg. Fentanyl was given as a rescue analgesic through a patient-controlled analgesia pump. Primary outcome was pain relief measured objectively by the dose of fentanyl required as the rescue analgesic, pain-free period, and numbers of effective and ineffective demands of fentanyl. Secondary outcome was adverse events.RESULTS:Fifty patients were randomized, 24 to the pentazocine group and 26 to the diclofenac group. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Pentazocine was found to be better than diclofenac in terms of significantly lower dose of the rescue analgesic (fentanyl) required (126 mu g (interquartile range (IQR) 65-218 mu g) vs 225.5 mu g (IQR 133-427 mu g); P = 0.028) and longer pain-free period (31.1 8.2 vs 27.9 +/- 6.6 hours, P = 0.047). The number of effective and ineffective demands was lower in the pentazocine group compared with the diclofenac group (11.5 (IQR 8-15) vs 16 (IQR 13-20), P = 0.098) although not statistically significant. Adverse events were similar between the groups.CONCLUSIONS:Pentazocine, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, was significantly better than diclofenac for pain relief in AP (Trial registration number: CTRI/2016/09/007326).

AB  - Background: Phenylephrine, although considered the vasopressor of choice, can cause reflex bradycardia and a fall in cardiac output. Norepinephrine, due to its direct positive chronotropic and reflex negative chronotropic actions, is expected to overcome this problem. However, limited information about its effective dose for management of post-spinal hypotension, and its potency compared to phenylephrine, is available.
   Methods: One hundred consecutive patients who developed post-spinal hypotension were treated with a predetermined dose of either phenylephrine or norepinephrine. Correction of hypotension after one minute was considered 'success'. The starting dose for the first patient and testing interval (the incremental or decremental dosing) were 100 mu g and 10 mu g in the phenylephrine group, and 6 mu g and 0.5 mu g in the norepinephrine group. Doses for subsequent patients were determined by the responses of previous patients according to the Narayana rule for up-down sequential allocation. ED95 and ED50 of phenylephrine and norepinephrine boluses and their potency ratio were calculated.
   Results: Using Probit analysis, ED95 and ED50 values were 43.1 mu g (95% CI 39.5 to 65.0 mu g) and 33.2 mu g (95% CI 5.1 to 37.0 mu g) for phenylephrine, and 3.7 mu g (95% CI 3.5 to 4.7 mu g) and 3.2 mu g (95% CI 1.8 to 3.4 mu g) for norepinephrine. The relative potency ratio of norepinephrine and phenylephrine was 11.3 (95% CI 8.1 to 16.9).
   Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, norepinephrine is about 11 times more potent than phenylephrine. When used as bolus doses for treatment of hypotension, 100 mu g phenylephrine should be approximately equivalent to 9 mu g norepinephrine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Determining the optimal dosages of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol in children is necessary to obtain therapeutic serum concentrations of these drugs. Revised dosages have improved the exposure of 1st line anti-tubercular drugs to some extent; there is still scope for modification of the dosages to achieve exposures which can lead to favourable outcome of the disease. High dose of rifampicin is being investigated in clinical trials in adults with some benefit; studies are required in children. Inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability and the effect of age, nutritional status, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, acetylator genotype may need to be accounted for in striving for the dosages best suited for an individual.

AB  - Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma and other neuroinflammatory diseases. The pX region of HTLV-1 genome encodes an accessory protein p30 that is required for viral persistence and spread in the host. p30 regulates viral gene expression at the transcription level by competing with Tax for p300 binding and at posttranscriptional level by nuclear retention of tax/rex messenger RNA (mRNA). In addition, p30 modulates the host cellular environment by binding to various host proteins such as ATM, REG gamma, and PRMT5. However, the low expression levels of p30 has been a major hurdle in studying its structure-function relationship in the context of HTLV-1 pathobiology, which is most likely due to its intrinsically disordered nature. To investigate the unstable nature of p30, flow cytometric analysis of p30-GFP fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli was conducted and bioinformatics analysis of p30 was performed. The bacterial cells were green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive, indicating that p30-GFP was in the soluble fraction. Induction, particularly at higher temperature, reduced the expression of p30-GFP. Moreover, p30-GFP was detected exclusively in insoluble fraction upon cell lysis, suggesting its unstable and disordered nature. The bioinformatics analysis of p30 protein sequence and amino acid content revealed that p30 has highly disordered regions from amino acids 75-155 and 197-241. Furthermore, p30 has regions for macromolecular interactions that could stabilize it and these regions coincide with the unstable regions. Collectively, the study indicates that HTLV-1 p30 is an intrinsically disordered protein.

AB  - Chest is the commonest site of involvement by tuberculosis (TB) in children; lungs being the most frequently affected region, followed by nodes, pleura and chest wall. It is difficult to diagnose TB in children due to lack of overt symptoms and difficulty in obtaining samples for microbiological confirmation. Hence various imaging modalities play an important role in diagnostic algorithm as well as in follow-up after treatment. Standardization of chest radiograph reporting in context of clinically suspected TB is the need of the hour so as to suggest a proper diagnosis and avoid over-diagnosis. This article aims to discuss the imaging features of chest tuberculosis according to the site of involvement on various imaging modalities in the pediatric population.

AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is widely recognized as the main cause of bacterial pneumonia among all age groups. Other important gram-positive, gram-negative and atypical bacteria causing pneumonia majorly infect children and infants. Despite abundant occurrence of bacterial pneumonia, there is no specific antibiotic therapy available. On the other hand non-specific therapies are less effective and may influence bacterial resistance. Therefore, search for novel drug targets for pathogen is highly necessary. The current study suggested novel potential drug targets through the subtractive and comparative genomics approach. Putative drug targets were identified from highly virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae using target identification (TiD) software and compared with other 12 pneumonia causing pathogens. The putative targets were prioritized through drugg-ability analysis, virulence analysis, metabolic pathway enrichment followed by functional annotations and interactome network. Prioritization of 74 drug targets revealed that 42 of them were enzymes which included 29 new targets and seven chokepoint enzymes. Twenty (out of 74) potential targets are proposed as hub genes through interactome analysis and explored their significance in survival of the pathogen. Comparative analysis of 20 hub genes represents that 15 are enzymes and five are non-enzymes. Functional annotation of two chokepoint hub enzymes namely, peptidoglycan bridge formation alanyltransferase MurN (fibB) and PTS mannitol transporter subunit IIA (mltF) were significantly enriched in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and phosphotransferase system (PTS) respectively. Therefore these enzymes would be of prior interest for rational design of targeted therapy against bacterial pneumonia.

AB  - Background: Tourette syndrome (TS) and other chronic tic disorders are clinically heterogenous and cause physical discomfort, social difficulties, and emotional distress. In addition to tics, TS patients have a variety of behavioral comorbidities, including obsessive-compulsive disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. TS treatment is multidisciplinary, involving behavioral therapy, oral medications, and botulinum toxin injections. Methods: Relevant studies on pharmacological and surgical treatment options for TS and other chronic tic disorders, their limitations and current recommendations were reviewed using the PubMed search till April 2, 2018. Besides, the reference lists of the retrieved publications were manually searched to explore other relevant studies. This review aims to discuss the progress in pharmacological and surgical treatment options for TS and other chronic tic disorders. Results and Conclusions: Both typical and atypical antipsychotic agents are mainstays of pharmacological treatment of TS and other chronic tic disorder patients; however, their use is limited by serious side effects considering their potential of dopamine blockade. Because of the phenotypic variability, no medication has proven effective for all persons with TS and other chronic tic disorders. Botulinum toxin has emerged as a good therapeutic option, especially for focal and dystonic tics. But, their uses are limited by lack of sufficient evidence and high cost. Surgical treatment is considered in medically refractory and severely disabled tics patients. Deep brain stimulation has replaced lesional surgeries; however, there is uncertainty regarding the selection of patients and target of stimulation.

AB  - Paediatric chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) has biological and clinical differences from adult CML. Management of paediatric CML presents unique challenges in growing children, and there are no specific guidelines for paediatric CML. This review focusses on the clinical characteristics, diagnostic issues and management of paediatric CML. Major studies that provide the basis of managing paediatric CML are summerized here. Studies conducted on adult CML patients were used to guide the management of places where studies were lacking in paediatric CML. Recently, dasatinib and nilotinib have been approved for treatment of paediatric CML, and their role has been discussed in the current management perspective. Allogeneic transplant, fertility and vaccination in paediatric CML, have also been discussed.

AB  - ObjectiveThe relation of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) with minimal residual disease (MRD) in T cell - acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is not known. The objective of the study was to correlate ALC with MRD, steroid-response and complete remission (CR).MethodsDe-novo T- ALL patients (age 1-18 y) recruited prospectively; 52 enrolled, 9 excluded, and 43 analyzed. 39 achieved CR and MRD was available for 28 patients; 23 were MRD negative.ResultsALC did not correlate with steroid response and CR. Median (range) ALC at the end of induction was significantly higher in patients who were MRD negative compared to MRD positive [1.24 (0.12, 6.69) vs 0.62 (0.15, 0.87); P=0.03], respectively. Patients having ALC 700x10(9) /L were significantly more likely to be MRD negative than those with lower values (P= 0.028)ConclusionOur study suggests that ALC is a favorable factor, and may act as surrogate marker for MRD.

AB  - Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common adverse event resulting in premature interruption of hemodialysis, and consequently, inadequate fluid and solute removal. IDH occurs in response to the reduction in blood volume during ultrafiltration and subsequent poor compensatory mechanisms due to abnormal cardiac function or autonomic or baroreceptor failure. Pediatric patients are inherently at risk for IDH due to the added difficulty of determining and attaining an accurate dry weight. While frequent blood pressure monitoring, dialysate sodium profiling, ultrafiltration-guided blood volume monitoring, dialysate cooling, hemodiafiltration, and intradialytic mannitol and midodrine have been used to prevent IDH, they have not been extensively studied in pediatric population. Lack of large-scale studies on IDH in children makes it difficult to develop evidence-based management guidelines. Here, we aim to review IDH preventative strategies in the pediatric population and outlay recommendations from the Pediatric Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (PCRRT) Workgroup. Without strong evidence in the literature, our recommendations from the expert panel reflect expert opinion and serve as a valuable guide.

AB  - Background & objectives: Limited data are available on the typing of Chlamydia trachomatis in India. Serovars D to K of C. trachomatis are chiefly responsible for urogenital infections. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the distribution of C. trachomatis serovars in patients with urogenital infections and to characterize ompA gene of the detected C. trachomatis isolates by sequence analysis. Presence of other co-infections was also evaluated.
   Methods: Endocervical swabs were collected from 324 women and urethral swabs/urine were collected from 193 men attending the sexually transmitted diseases outpatient clinic. The samples were screened for C. trachomatis by cryptic plasmid PCR and ompA gene PCR. Genotyping was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing of the ompA gene. Samples were screened for genital mycoplasmas, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
   Results: C. trachomatis was found in 15.0 per cent men and 10.8 per cent women. Serovar D was the most prevalent followed by serovars E, F, I and G. Twenty two C. trachomatis isolates were selected for ompA gene sequencing. No mixed infection was found. Variability in ompA sequences was seen in 31.8 per cent cases. Both PCR-RFLP and ompA gene sequencing showed concordant results. The presence of Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis was observed in 18.7 and 9.5 per cent patients, respectively. Co-infection of C. trachomatis was significantly associated with Ureaplasma urealyticum and HIV.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The high occurence of C. trachomatis infections warrants its screening in addition to other sexually transmitted infections namely U. urealyticum and HIV. Genotyping of the ompA gene may provide additional information for vaccine development.

AB  - Some previously described environmental associations for atopic eczema may be due to reverse causation. We explored the role of reverse causation by comparing individual-and school-level results for multiple atopic eczema risk factors. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (i.e, ISAAC) Phase Three surveyed children in schools (the sampling unit) regarding atopic eczema symptoms and potential risk factors. We assessed the effect of these risk factors on atopic eczema symptoms using mixed-effect logistic regression models, first with individual-level exposure data and second with school-level exposure prevalence. Overall, 546,348 children from 53 countries were included. At ages 6-7 years, the strongest individual-level associations were with current paracetamol use (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37-1.54), which persisted at school-level (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.10-2.21), early-life antibiotics (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.34-1.48), and early-life paracetamol use (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.21-1.36), with the former persisting at the school level, whereas the latter was no longer observed (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.00-1.82 and OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.69-1.28, respectively). At ages 13-14 years, the strongest associations at the individual level were with current paracetamol use (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.51-1.63) and open-fire cooking (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.33-1.62); both were stronger at the school level (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.84-3.59 and OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.52-3.73, respectively). Association with exposure to heavy traffic (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.27-1.36) also persisted at the school level (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.07-1.82). Most individual-and school-level effects were consistent, tending to exclude reverse causation.

TI  - Cataract surgery outcomes in eyes with chorioretinal coloboma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the outcomes of cataract surgery in patients with chorioretinal coloboma.
   Setting: Tertiary eyecare center, New Delhi, India.
   Design: Retrospective case series.
   Methods: Medical records of patients with chorioretinal coloboma having cataract surgery between January 2016 and May 2018 were reviewed. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), grade of cataract, type of chorioretinal coloboma, type of surgery, postoperative CDVA, and complications were recorded.
   Results: Thirty-eight patients with a mean age at surgery of 36.7 years were included. The mean CDVA at presentation was 1.83 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] +/- 0.31 (SD). Advanced nuclear sclerosis occurred in 61.4% of cases and lens subluxation in 10.2% of cases. Phacoemulsification (56.4%) was the most commonly performed cataract surgery followed by lens aspiration (12.8%) and extracapsular cataract surgery (12.8%). Uneventful cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in 69.2% of cases. Intraoperative complications included 7 cases of bag dialyses, 3 of posterior capsule ruptures, and 1 of capsulorhexis extension. The mean postoperative CDVA at 6 weeks and 1 year was 1.64 +/- 0.51 logMAR and 1.51 +/- 0.58 IogMAR, respectively. Postoperative complications included 11 cases each of raised intraocular pressure and corneal edema; 2 cases each of IOL decentration, capsule phimosis, and corneal edema; and 1 case of posterior capsule opacification. A second intervention was required in 4 cases (2 endothelial keratoplasties, 1 IOL explantation, 1 neodymium:YAG capsulotomy).
   Conclusions: Cataracts in patients with chorioretinal coloboma are usually advanced compared with age-matched patients with senile cataract. Delayed surgery results in suboptimum outcomes; thus, surgery should be scheduled as soon as possible after the cataract is documented. (C) 2019 ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Mycotic keratitis continues to be an important cause of corneal blindness, especially in tropical and subtropical countries. The prognosis is poor compared with many other forms of keratitis because of the lack of effective antifungal drugs. The currently available antifungal drugs suffer from multiple drawbacks such as poor ocular penetration, unpredictable bioavailability, and adverse effects associated with systemic medications. Over the last decade, several new drugs and drug-delivery systems have been introduced in an attempt to improve the treatment outcomes. Thorough knowledge of the currently available antifungal drugs, their spectrum of action, and associated adverse effects is essential to deal with cases of mycotic keratitis. We discuss the pharmacologic properties and clinical use of the currently available antifungal drugs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the association of severe vitamin D deficiency with clinically important outcomes in children with septic shock. Methods: We enrolled children <= 17 years with septic shock prospectively over a period of 6 months. We estimated 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] levels at admission and 72 hours. Severe deficiency was defined as serum 25 (OH) Results: Forty-three children were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency was 72% and 69% at admission and 72 hours, respectively. On univariate analysis, severe vitamin D deficiency at admission was associated with lower rates of shock reversal, 74% (23) versus 25% (3); relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]): 2.9 (1.09-8.08), at 24 hours and greater need for fluid boluses (75 vs 59 mL/kg). On multivariate analysis, nonresolution of shock at 24 hours was significantly associated with severe vitamin D deficiency after adjusting for other key baseline and clinical variables, adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): 12 (2.01-87.01); 0.01. Conclusion: The prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency is high in children with septic shock admitted to pediatric intensive care unit. Severe vitamin D deficiency at admission seems to be associated with lower rates of shock reversal at 24 hours of ICU stay. Our study provides preliminary data for planning interventional studies in children with septic shock and severe vitamin D deficiency.

AB  - Introduction: To analyse the fungal culture results of patients with fungal keratitis over sixteen years and look for variations in the trends over years and distribution across ages, gender and seasons.
   Materials and methods: Clinical and demographic records and microbiology reports of 18,898 patients of fungal keratitis from 2001 to 2016 were analysed.
   Results: Overall fungal culture positivity was 21.5%. 67.3% were males and 32.7% were females. Maximum numbers of samples (17.9%) were received from age group 41-50 years, and maximum fungal culture positivity was seen in age group 31-40 years (30.8%). Most common fungus was Aspergillus species (31.1%), followed byFusarium species (24.5%), Alternaria (10.5%), Curvularia (10.2%), Helminthosporium (5.7%), Bipolaris (5.4%), Penicillium (4.5%), Candida (4.4%), Acremonium (1.2%), Rhizopus (1.0%), Paecilomyces (0.8%), Rhodotorula (0.5%) and Mucor (0.2%). Fungal culture positivity and relative frequency of fungi remained almost stable over the study duration, except Rhodotorula spp, which showed a rise 2014 onwards. Highest numbers of culture proven fungal keratitis cases were seen in monsoon season.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest compilation of epidemiological and microbiological features of fungal keratitis, throwing light on important attributes relevant to management of mycotic keratitis patients.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of all cancer deaths worldwide, comprising 18.4% of all cancer deaths. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has shown mortality benefit in various trials and now a standard tool for lung cancer screening. Most researches have been carried out in developed countries where lung cancer incidence and mortality is very high. There is an increasing trend in lung cancer incidence in developing countries attributed to tobacco smoking and various environmental and occupational risk factors. Implementation of lung cancer screening is challenging, so organised lung cancer screening is practically non-existent. There arc numerous challenges in implementing such programs ranging from infrastructure, trained human resources, referral algorithm to cost and psychological trauma due to over-diagnosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis and other chest infections are important issues to be addressed while planning for lung cancer screening in developing countries. Burden of these diseases is very high and can lead to over-diagnosis in view of cut off of lung nodule size in various studies. Assessment of high risk cases for lung cancer is difficult as various forms of smoking make quantification non-uniform and difficult. Lung cancer screening targets only high risk population unlike screening programs for other cancers where entire population is targeted. There is a need of lung cancer screening for high risk cases as it saves life. Tobacco control and smoking cessation remain the most important long term intervention to decrease morbidity and mortality from lung cancer in developing countries. There is no sufficient evidence supporting the introduction of population-based screening for lung cancer in public health services.

AB  - Lung cancer has become a global problem, from a rare disease to an emerging public health issue. The current data of GLOBOCAN 2018, indicates that this disease has recorded highest mortality among all types of cancer. The etiological factors of lung cancer have become more multiplex because of increasing industrialization and environmental pollution around the world, especially in India. There is a rise in incidence of lung cancer among non-smokers and this can be attributed to environmental and occupational exposure to various kinds of hazardous substances. Target mutations are high in Lung cancer among nonsmokers when compared to smokers. Some developed countries have guidelines and policies for prevention and control of risk factors focusing on these issues. Intervention aiming for primary prevention can be an important and cost-effective tool in developing countries to deal with increasing incidence of lung cancer. There is a need to define high risk group among non-smokers after taking into account environmental and occupational determinants as important risk factors. Research on etiology of lung cancer and prevention provides evidence to work on global incidence and prevalence of lung cancer, and for designing cost effective lung cancer prevention strategies. Research in the area of lung cancer prevention should be considered to recognize the areas where action is required to prevent environment and occupation related lung cancer. The government and occupational health and safety organizations have taken many steps in the last few years that can help to protect workers from these exposures. But the dangers are still there, so there is a need to do more to limit these exposures around workplace. This whole situation guides us to advocate population-based intervention along with policy implementation.

AB  - Background: Surgery is challenging in patients with multiple or recurrent meningiomas. With the discovery of progesterone receptors (PR) on meningioma cells, there is an increased interest in the hormonal treatment using mifepristone, a PR blocker.
   Materials and Methods: A systematic review of clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and side effects of mifepristone in recurrent, unresectable, or multiple meningiomas was done. The primary outcome of this review was to study the efficacy in terms of tumor regression and clinical symptoms. Secondarily, we also reviewed the frequency and severity of different side effects reported by various studies.
   Results: A total of 7 studies, including one Phase III randomized controlled trial, were found relevant to the topic. Though a few studies showed some response in terms of clinical improvement and tumor size reduction, the response was either minimal or temporary. The only subset showing a good response was the "diffuse meningiomatosis" group. None of the studies evaluated the relation of the PR isoform with mifepristone responsiveness. However, long-term mifepristone administration was well tolerated in most of the patients.
   Conclusions: Use of mifepristone as a hormonal agent for meningiomas has produced mixed results. We propose that the possible mechanisms of action of mifepristone on meningioma cells must be studied in further detail by in-vitro studies. This may help in the identification of a mifepristone responsive subset of meningioma. This must be followed up with appropriately designed clinical studies with detailed baseline evaluation and standardized clinical and radiological follow-up.

AB  - The DevRS/DosT two-component system is essential for mycobacterial survival under hypoxia, a prevailing stress within granulomas. DevR (also known as DosR) is activated by an inducing stimulus, such as hypoxia, through conventional phosphorylation by its cognate sensor kinases, DevS (also known as DosS) and DosT. Here, we show that the DevR regulon is activated by acetyl phosphate under 'non-inducing' aerobic conditions when Mycobacterium tuberculosis devS and dosT double deletion strain is cultured on acetate. Overexpression of phosphotransacetylase caused a perturbation of the acetate kinase-phosphotransacetylase pathway, a decrease in the concentration of acetyl phosphate and dampened the aerobic induction response in acetate-grown bacteria. The operation of two pathways of DevR activation, one through sensor kinases and the other by acetyl phosphate, was established by an analysis of wild-type DevS and phosphorylation-defective DevSH395Q mutant strains under conditions partially mimicking a granulomatous-like environment of acetate and hypoxia. Our findings reveal that DevR can be phosphorylated in vivo by acetyl phosphate. Importantly, we demonstrate that acetyl phosphate-dependent phosphorylation can occur in the absence of DevR's cognate kinases. Based on our findings, we conclude that anti-mycobacterial therapy should be targeted to DevR itself and not to DevS/DosT kinases.

AB  - Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among women in low- and middle-income countries, and women living with HIV are at high risk for cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of cervical cancer and pre-cancer lesions and to examine cervical cancer knowledge among women living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. We conducted cytology-based screening and administered a standardized questionnaire among 598 HIV-infected women. We found 5 (0.8%), 39 (6.5%), 29 (4.9%), and 4 (0.7%) had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and squamous cervical carcinoma (SCC), respectively. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, ASCUS/LSIL was independently associated with age >16 years old at first sexual encounter and smokeless tobacco use. We found no factors associated with HSIL/SCC. In total, 101 women (16.9%) had heard of cervical cancer and 28 (27.7%) of them correctly identified HIV infection as a risk factor. In light of the high prevalence of pre-cancer lesions and low level of cervical cancer knowledge in our study population, focused interventions are needed to improve cervical cancer literacy and prevention among rural women living with HIV.

AB  - Objectives: The emergence of fluconazole resistance in Candida parapsilosis healthcare-associated infections has recently been increasingly reported. Antifungal susceptibility profiles and mechanisms of fluconazole resistance in C. parapsilosis (n = 199) from nine hospitals in India collected over a period of 3 years were studied. Further, clonal transmission of fluconazole-resistant isolates in different hospitals was investigated.
   Methods: Antifungal susceptibility testing of five azoles, amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine was performed by the CLSI microbroth dilution method. The azole target ERG11 gene was sequenced, and the significance of a novel ERG11 mutation in C. parapsilosis was determined using a gap-repair cloning approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, microsatellite analysis was performed to determine the clonal lineage of C. parapsilosis-resistant strains circulating among different hospitals.
   Results: A total of 64 (32%) C. parapsilosis isolates were non-susceptible to fluconazole, which included resistant (n = 55; MIC >4 mg/L) and susceptible dose-dependent (n = 9) isolates. Of these 64 non-susceptible isolates, a novel K143R amino acid substitution was noted in 92%, and the remaining five isolates had the Y132F substitution. Elevated azole MICs (>= 16-fold) were detected in S. cerevisiae upon expression of C. parapsilosis ERG11 alleles carrying Y132F or K143R substitutions. Two major clusters of non-susceptible isolates were circulating in seven Indian hospitals.
   Conclusions: We report a novel K143R amino acid substitution in ERG11p causing fluconazole resistance in C. parapsilosis. Fluconazole-non-susceptible C. parapsilosis isolates carrying the novel K143R amino acid substitution should be identified in clinical microbiology laboratories to prevent further clonal transmission.

AB  - Introduction: C4d, an early product in the classical/ lectin complement pathway has shown potential in the evaluation of C3 glomerulopathy where its absence would support an alternative pathway abnormality. As autoimmune/genetic complement testing is not readily available to most parts of the world, glomerular C4d staining may serve as a useful additional step toward the diagnosis.
   Methods: To test this hypothesis, C4d staining was performed on a large cohort of C3 glomerulopathy. Archival cases from 2011 to 2017 were reviewed and immunohistochemistry for C4d was performed, scored (scale of 0 to 3+), and correlated with the immunofluorescence and ultrastructural findings. Paraffin immunofluorescence was performed in cases of "discordant C4d" to unmask Igs.
   Results: Twenty-seven cases of dense deposit disease (DDD) and 14 cases of C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) were retrieved. C4d demonstrated a range of staining intensities with negative/traces in only 22% of DDD and 64% of C3GN. Lower-intensity C4d staining (1 to 2+) was mostly concordant with similar amounts of Igs/C1q. Discordant 3+ staining was noted in approximately 50% of cases of DDD and 20% of cases of C3GN. Among them, paraffin immunofluorescence unmasked polyclonal Igs in 2 of 5 cases of DDD and 1 of 3 cases of C3GN.
   Conclusion: This observational study suggests that the presence of glomerular C4d should not exclude a C3 glomerulopathy. In lower intensities, it appears to represent overlying classical/ lectin pathway activation with concordant Ig/C1q deposits. A subset of cases, however, displays intense and discordant C4d staining, which raises the possibility of an associated lectin pathway abnormality, a potential future area of study.

AB  - Vernal keratoconjunctivitis, a chronic bilateral seasonal allergic inflammatory disease of the eye, is an important cause of visual debilitation and impairment of quality of life in children and young adults in certain parts of the world such as the Mediterranean areas, Central and West Africa, the Middle East, Japan, the Indian subcontinent, and South America. It usually has a self-limiting course; however, in a few cases, the disease is recurrent and leads to long-term visual disabling complications such as keratoconus and limbal stem cell deficiency. The main pathogenic mechanism is immunoglobulin E mediated; however, there may be non-immunoglobulin E and certain nonspecific hypersensitivity mechanisms. The predominant cell types involved are CD4 T cells and eosinophils. The management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis is challenging. Although an acute episode can be well managed with the help of currently available topical agents, the major challenge lies in preventing recurrences and their consequences. Steroids are highly effective in controlling both an acute episode and chronic disease; however, the long-term complications of steroid use often prevent their continued use. Immunomodulators such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine may be used as steroid-sparing agents; however, the dosing and duration of use still need to be clearly defined. Surgery is required for the management of complications such as shield ulcer and corneal ectasia or opacity; however, the disease process and management are largely well defined, and genetic predisposition factors responsible for chronicity and an effective albeit safe treatment modality for the chronic form of the disease need further research.

AB  - Aim: Data are limited regarding the antibiotic susceptibility of Legionella pneumophila in India. The aim of this study was to determine the drug susceptibility of environmental L. pneumophila isolates in India for antibiotics commonly used in clinical practice for Legionnaires' disease treatment. Materials & methods: The activities of seven antibiotics against 46 environmental isolates of L. pneumophila were evaluated by using E-test on buffered charcoal yeast extract-alpha agar. Results: Among the L. pneumophila isolates tested, no tendency toward drug resistance was observed. Rifampicin was the most potent drug followed by levofloxacin, while doxycycline and tetracycline were found to be the less active agents. Conclusion: Susceptibility testing of Legionella environmental isolates could be beneficial to notify resistance to antibiotics in the environment before it becomes evident in clinical strains.

AB  - Background Total Cavopulmonary connection (Fontan) is the final palliation for patients with a functionally univentricular heart. This is commonly accomplished after a prior bidirectional Glenn on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with separate cannulation of the aorta, superior vena cava (SVC), and inferior vena cava. We describe an alternative technique of Fontan completion that eliminates the need for cannulation and dissection of the SVC, and pulmonary artery dissection. Methods Between January and October 2018, 17 patients underwent completion Fontan using an alternate technique at our institute. All operations were conducted on CPB at normothermia without cannulating the SVC Results Mean CPB time was 60 +/- 16.8 minutes (range, 39-102 minutes). There were no early deaths. Mean postoperative Fontan pressures were 15.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg with no gradient between the SVC and IVC pressures. Mean duration of hospital stay was 15.6 +/- 3.6 days (range, 10-22 days). No patient developed phrenic nerve paresis or palsy. Conclusions Completion without cannulating the SVC is simple, reproducible, and easy to teach. It avoids the disadvantages associated with routine techniques.

AB  - When Jagdish Chandra Bose, a renowned physicist, devoted himself entirely to research in the field of plant physiology post his superannuation at Presidency University, Kolkata, India (earlier known as Presidency College, Calcutta), it came as a surprise to many. The research on plant nervous system by JC Bose during this period was pioneering in nature, being recognized by recent plant biologists globally as the first in the field. His findings were so revolutionary at the time of their proclamation that these aroused disbelief and contradiction. Surprisingly, not many at that time took up such investigations and once accepted with reluctance, there was practically very little activity in the field for the next several decades. More than a hundred years later, recent advances in molecular biology, genomics, ecology and neurophysiology have led to renewed interest resulting in a flurry of activity, confirming most of Bose's observations. The present review describes this pioneering scientist's work and his immense contribution in the emergence of the discipline now designated as 'Plant Neurobiology'.

AB  - Background: Preemptive use of gabapentin might accelerate recovery by reducing acute post-inguinal herniorrhaphy pain and opioid requirement being an analgesic.
   Study Question: Assessing efficacy of three different doses of oral gabapentin premedication for postoperative pain management after inguinal herniorrhaphy under spinal anesthesia.
   Study Design: This prospective, randomized, placebo controlled study was performed on 120 male patients (ASA I/II) undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy under subarachnoid block. Patients were divided into 4 groups of 30 patients each to receive placebo (group A) or gabapentin 400 mg (B) or 800 mg (C) or 1200 mg (D), administered orally 2 hours before surgery. Assessment of postoperative pain was made on the basis of the visual analog score (VAS), where 0 cm "no pain" and 10 cm "worst pain imaginable." Patients received IV fentanyl 0.5 mg/kg bolus when VAS.3.
   Measures and Outcomes: VAS score at regular intervals, the first analgesic requirement and total opioid consumption within 24 hours after surgery along with side/adverse effect (s) of study drug in perioperative period.
   Results: The VAS of the study groups B, C, D were significantly lower than placebo group (A) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24-hour intervals after surgery (P = 0.05). The first analgesic need and total opioid consumption within 24 hours after surgery of study groups were significantly lower than placebo group (P = 0.005) while within study groups difference was not significant. Dizziness and somnolence were seen maximally in group D patients (P = 0.01). However, pruritus, nausea and vomiting though maximally reported among group (A) patients but statistically non-significant.
   Conclusion: Preemptive gabapentin is opioid sparing to control postoperative pain with anxiolysis and sedation. We found the optimal dose to be 400 mg for gabapentin. However, increasing dose from 400 to 1200 mg does not increase its efficacy as analgesic but with higher adverse effects.

AB  - To evade the possible toxicity associated with the formation of quinone-imine metabolite in amodiaquine (AQ), the para-hydroxyl group was replaced with a -F atom, and the resulting 4'-fluoro-amodiaquine (FAQ) was hybridized with substituted pyrimidines. The synthesized FAQ-pyrimidines displayed better in vitro potency than chloroquine (CQ) against the resistant P. falciparum strain (Dd2), exhibiting up to 47.3-fold better activity (IC50: 4.69 nM) than CQ (IC50: 222 nM) and 2.8-fold better potency than artesunate (IC50: 13.0 nM). Twelve compounds exhibited better antiplasmodial activity than CQ against the CQ-sensitive (NF54) strain. Two compounds were evaluated in vivo against a P. berghei-mouse malaria model. Mechanistic heme-binding studies, computational docking studies against Pf-DHFR and in vitro microsomal stability studies were performed for the representative molecules of the series to assess their antimalarial efficacy.

TI  - Iatrogenic Crystalline Lens Injury in Pediatric Eyes Following Intravitreal Injection for Retinopathy of Prematurity
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY & STRABISMUS
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: To report the occurrence of lens injury during intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection in infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
   Methods: ROP cases presenting to a tertiary care center with cataract following intravitreal injection were retrospectively studied from June 2017 to May 2018. The indication, setting, and method of injection were noted. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) details were recorded. The main measures were morphology of cataract, posterior capsular defect, and intraocular lens (IOL) placement.
   Results: Three children (mean age: 14 +/- 8.6 months, two male and one female) received injection elsewhere under topical anesthesia in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for type 1 ROP (stage 3 in zone I or II with significant plus disease) 9 to 18 months earlier. All cases developed cataract caused by intravitreal needle damaging the posterior capsule. In one case, a dense zonular cataract was present and peripheral dehiscence of the posterior capsule became evident only during lens aspiration. The second and third cases had a central posterior subcapsular cataract. Preexisting central dehiscence of the posterior capsule was noted on UBM and confirmed during surgery. A multi-piece IOL was securely placed in all cases. At last follow-up (median: 6 months; range: 3 to 6 months), the IOL was stable and centered in all cases with a clear visual axis.
   Conclusions: The increasing occurrence of cataract in treatment-requiring ROP following intravitreal anti-VEGF injections being given by practitioners in the NICU setting under topical anesthesia that hinders optimal visualization and technique is a significant concern.

TI  - Process evaluation protocol for a cluster randomised trial of a complex, nurse-led intervention to improve hypertension management in India
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction India has high prevalence of hypertension but low awareness, treatment and control rate. A cluster randomised trial entitled 'm-Power Heart Project' is being implemented to test the effectiveness of a nurse care coordinator (NCC) led complex intervention to address uncontrolled hypertension in the community health centres (CHCs). The trial's process evaluation will assess the fidelity and quality of implementation, clarify the causal mechanisms and identify the contextual factors associated with variation in the outcomes. The trial will use a theory-based mixed-methods process evaluation, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
   Methods and analysis The process evaluation will be conducted in the CHCs of Visakhapatnam (southern India). The key stakeholders involved in the intervention development and implementation will be included as participants. In-depth interviews will be conducted with intervention developers, doctors, NCCs and health department officials and focus groups with patients and their caregivers. NCC training will be evaluated using Kirkpatrick's model for training evaluation. Key process evaluation indicators (number of patients recruited and retained; concordance between the treatment plans generated by the electronic decision support system and treatment prescribed by the doctor and so on) will be assessed. Fidelity will be assessed using Borrelli et al's framework. Qualitative data will be analysed using the template analysis technique. Quantitative data will be summarised as medians (IQR), means (SD) and proportions as appropriate. Mixed-methods analysis will be conducted to assess if the variation in the mean reduction of systolic blood pressure between the intervention CHCs is influenced by patient satisfaction, training outcome, attitude of doctors, patients and NCCs about the intervention, process indicators etc.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the ethics committees at Public Health Foundation of India and Deakin University. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, national and international conference presentations.

AB  - BackgroundWhile patients with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) are initially treated with long-term alternate-day prednisolone, relapses and adverse effects are common. In an open-label randomized controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of therapy with low-dose daily to standard alternate-day prednisolone in reducing relapse rates over 12-month follow-up.MethodsConsecutive patients, aged 2-18years, with FRNS were included. Following therapy of relapse, prednisolone was tapered to 0.75mg/kg on alternate days. Stratifying for steroid dependence, patients were randomly assigned to prednisolone at 0.2-0.3mg/kg daily or 0.5-0.7mg/kg alternate day for 12months. Relapses were treated with daily prednisolone, followed by return to intervention. Primary outcome was the incidence of relapses. Proportion with therapy failure (2 relapses in any 6months or significant steroid toxicity) and sustained remission, cumulative prednisolone intake and adverse events were evaluated.ResultsPatients receiving daily prednisolone (n=30) showed significantly fewer relapses than those on alternate-day therapy (n=31) (0.55 relapses/person-year versus 1.94 relapses/person-year; incidence rate ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.15, 0.52). Daily therapy was associated with higher rates of sustained remission at 6months (73.3 versus 48.4%) and 1year (60 versus 31.6%; log rank p=0.013), lower rates of treatment failure at 6months (3.3 versus 32.8%) and 1year (6.7 versus 57.4%; p<0.0001), and lower prednisolone use (0.270.07 versus 0.39 +/- 0.19mg/kg/day; p=0.003). Three and two patients need to receive the study intervention to enable sustained remission and prevent treatment failure, respectively.Conclusions p id=Par4 In patients with FRNS, daily administration of low-dose prednisolone is more effective than standard-dose alternate day therapy in lowering relapse rates, sustaining remission, and enabling steroid sparing.

AB  - Background: Whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment can improve depression or anxiety symptoms in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients remains uncertain.
   Methods: Secondary analysis of the Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) trial, combined with a systematic review of randomised evidence. The SAVE secondary analyses involved 2410 patients with co-existing moderate-severe OSA and established cardiovascular disease randomly allocated to CPAP treatment plus usual care or usual care alone and followed up for 3.7 (SD 1.6) years. We evaluated the effect of CPAP treatment on depression and anxiety caseness (scores >= 8 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression and anxiety subscales [HADS-D and HADS-A]) for OSA patients.
   Findings: CPAP treatment was associated with reduced odds of depression caseness (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.98, P=0.031) compared to usual care in the SAVE trial and the treatment effect was greater in those with pre-existing depression symptoms. A systematic review of 20 randomised trials including 4255 participants confirmed a benefit of CPAP in reducing depression symptoms in OSA patients: the overall effect (standardised mean difference) was -0.18 (95% CI -0.24 to -0.12). No effect of CPAP treatment on anxiety caseness was found both in patients of the SAVE study (adjusted OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78-1.24, P = 0.89) and the systematic review.
   Interpretation: CPAP reduces depression symptoms in patients with co-existing OSA and CVD independently of improvements in sleepiness. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nanoemulsion formulation of vitamin D-3 have been shown to have better bioavailability than the coarse emulsion preparation in vitro and in vivo animal studies. In the absence of randomised trial in humans, comparing the efficacy of nanotechnology- based miscellised vitamin D3 over conventional vitamin D-3, we undertook this study. A total of 180 healthy adults were randomised to receive either micellised (DePura, group A) or conventional vitamin D-3 (Calcirol, group B) at a monthly dose of 60 000 IU (1500 mu g) for 6 months. The outcome parameters were serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and urinary Ca:creatinine ratio. A total of eighty-nine subjects in group A and seventy-seven in group B completed the trial. Subjects in both the groups had a significant increase in their serum 25(OH) D levels following supplementation (group A: 21.5 (SD 10.9) to 76.7 (SD 18.8) nmol/l (P < 0.001); group B: 22.8 (SD 10.4) to 57.8 (SD 16.0) nmol/l (P<0.001)). Participants in micellised group had an additional increase of 20.2 (95% CI 14.0, 26.4) nmol/l in serum 25(OH)D levels (P < 0.001). The difference between the groups was 17.5 (95% CI 11.8, 23.1) nmol/l, which remained statistically significant (P <0.001) even after adjustment for age and sex. Significant decline in mean serum PTH was observed in both the groups. No hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria was noted. Although supplementation with both the preparations resulted in a significant rise in serum 25(OH)D levels, micellised vitamin D-3 appeared to be more efficacious in achieving higher levels of serum 25(OH)D.

   To assess school policies, built environment and practices for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in schools of Delhi, India.
   Methods
   School built environments and policies were assessed using a structured observation checklist in 10 private and 9 government schools which were randomly selected from all 184 co-educational schools with primary to senior secondary level education in Delhi, India. A self-administered questionnaire was also completed by teachers from each school (n = 19) to capture information specific to school policies. Surveys were also conducted with parent of students in class II (aged 6-7 years; n = 574) and student in class XI (aged 15-16 years, n = 755) to understand school practices.
   Results
   The majority of government (88.9%; n = 8) and private (80%; n = 8) schools reported having comprehensive school health policy. In terms of specific health behaviours, policies related to diet and nutrition in government schools were mostly restricted to primary levels with provision of the mid-day meal programme. All schools had two physical education periods per week of about 45-50 minutes. Most schools were compliant with tobacco-free school guidelines (n = 15 out of 19) and had alcohol control policies (n = 13 out of 19). Parent and student reports of practices indicated that school policies were not consistently implemented.
   Conclusion
   Most schools in Delhi have policies that address health behaviours in students, but there was considerable variation in the types and number of policies and school environments. Government schools are more likely to have policies in place than private schools. Further work is needed to evaluate how these policies are implemented and to assess their impact on health outcomes.

AB  - Sinonasal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) without nodal involvement is extremely rare and the rarity of this tumor often leads to diagnostic dilemma. It has been predominantly reported in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients, mostly of Asian origin. A 21-year-old female patient presented with history of epistaxis for 1 year. On clinical and radiological examination, there was a 5 cm mass in the right nasal cavity, ethmoid, and frontal sinus. Biopsy at a local center had shown moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Rebiopsy at our center showed possibility of a hematolymphoid malignancy(pancytokeratin-, CD45+, CD3-, CD20-) and further immunohistochemistry studies(CD4+, CD43+, CD30+, ALK+) revealed ALK-positive ALCL. Rest of the lymphoma work-up was essentially normal and she had stage IE disease. She was treated with a combination of four cycles of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen followed by local radiotherapy (36 Gray/20 fractions/4 weeks) by three-dimensional conformal technique. She tolerated the treatment well without any severe toxicity and had complete clinical and radiological response. At last follow-up visit, 40 months from the initial diagnosis, she was alive and disease free. Sinonasal ALK-positive ALCL is a rare tumor, which can be effectively treated with a combination of multiagent CHOP/CHOP-like regimen and local conformal radiotherapy.

AB  - A homology model of ferrochelatase (HemH), the heme biosynthesis terminal step enzyme from Salmonella Typhi was generated to understand the mechanism of metal insertion into protoporphyrin IX for heme biosynthesis. The overall fold of membrane associated ferrochelatase (StFc) from S. Typhi is similar to human and Yeast ferrochelatase than Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus anthracis. An insertion of 16 amino add residues in helical switch having hydrophobic patch proposed to interact with membrane lipids and in opening and closing of heme binding cleft. The sequence analysis and the docking study revealed that the protoporphyrin binding site in StFc has a crucial replacement of Tyr/Met to Leu13 unique in comparison to other known structures, where Tyr13 observed in B. subtilis/B. anthracis while Met76 in human/yeast play important role in holding protoporphyrin in optimal orientation for metalation. A sitting-a-top (SAT) complex mechanism for metalation is proposed with His194 and Glu264 lie at the bottom and Leu13 on the top of the porphyrin ring. In addition, an entry and exit mechanism is also proposed for protoporphyrin binding into cavity by opening and closing of helical switch using molecular dynamics simulation studies of Apo and heme complexed model structure of S. Typhi HemH. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current study analyzed and optimized the concentration of NaOH for alkaline pretreatment of kitchen refuse for biogas production. Also, the benefits of microwave assistance in enhanced biogasification of kitchen refuse were evaluated. The TS, VS and structural changes were compared using standard experimental techniques. Molecular dynamics was investigated for the molecular level changes leading to higher biogasification in NaOHmicrowave combined pretreatment. The methane and biogas yields were calculated to validate the benefits of microwave assistance in efficient biogasification. The NaOH-microwave combined pretreatment showed higher VS production. Microwave treatment degraded and removed lignin more efficiently. Molecular dynamics studies revealed the induction of configurational instability in lignin and cellulose molecules with variable temperatures. The methane and biogas production increased with 6% NaOH concentration, and decreased at higher NaOH concentration till 10%. Microwave assistance declined the required NaOH concentration further to 4%. Thus, as compared to 6% NaOH concentration required for an efficient pretreatment, the kitchen refuse was efficiently pretreated with 4% NaOH concentration when combined with a 30 min duration microwaving. The experimental and computational data provided a detailed analysis proposing an optimized, novel and promising method to pretreat kitchen refuse for efficient and enhanced biogas production.

AB  - Purpose: Numerous studies across multiple specialties have evaluated the impact of trial registration on quality of study reports and found significant improvements over several domains. However, the impact of mandatory trial registration on the quality of clinical trial protocols remains hitherto unexplored. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study of clinical trial applications submitted to drug regulatory authority of India for initial review with the objective of comparing methodological characteristics of their protocols. Since trial registration was made mandatory in the country in June 2009, we selected two study periods as between January 2007 to May 2009 (Period I) and July 2009 to December 2011 (Period II). Seventy-five protocols were randomly selected using a computer-generated list for each study period, making a total of 150 protocols. Data on twelve key methodological characteristics were collected including clearly defined primary outcomes, randomization, blinding, use of control group, statistical methods, handling of withdrawals amongst others. Results: More than 3/4th of the trial applications in the two study periods were for new chemical entities and nearly 90% were pharmaceutical industry sponsored studies. Comparing the period before and after implementation of mandatory trial registration, description of clearly defined trial outcomes improved from nearly 42% to 80% (p<0.001), sample size justifications increased from 38% to 70% (p<0.001) and use of allocation concealment improved from 24% to 49% (p=0.001). Marked improvement was also noted for blinding, description of statistical methods and handling of withdrawals and dropouts. Remaining characteristics did not change significantly between the two study periods. The mean cumulative scores for the study protocols improved significantly from 7 +/- 0.296 in the first period to 8.93 +/- 0.346 (p<0.001) in the second period. Conclusions: Our study found a significant improvement in the methodological quality characteristics of the protocols particularly in elements related to minimization of bias and statistical methods, which could be attributed to mandatory trial registration. Overall, the significant improvement was limited to global clinical trials, and room for improvement was noted for two quality characteristics - proportion of randomized studies and trials adequately describing the generation of allocation sequence.

TI  - The role of context in implementation research for non-communicable diseases: Answering the 'how-to' dilemma
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - MIXED METHODS
KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction
   Understanding context and how this can be systematically assessed and incorporated is crucial to successful implementation. We describe how context has been assessed (including exploration or evaluation) in Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) implementation research projects focused on improving health in people with or at risk of chronic disease and how contextual lessons were incorporated into the intervention or the implementation process.
   Methods
   Using a web-based semi-structured questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data across GACD projects (n = 20) focusing on hypertension, diabetes and lung diseases. The use of context-specific data from project planning to evaluation was analyzed using mixed methods and a multi-layered context framework across five levels; 1) individual and family, 2) community, 3) healthcare setting, 4) local or district level, and 5) state or national level.
   Results
   Project teams used both qualitative and mixed methods to assess multiple levels of context (avg. = 4). Methodological approaches to assess context were identified as formal and informal assessments, engagement of stakeholders, use of locally adapted resources and materials, and use of diverse data sources. Contextual lessons were incorporated directly into the intervention by informing or adapting the intervention, improving intervention participation or improving communication with participants/stakeholders. Provision of services, equipment or information, continuous engagement with stakeholders, feedback for personnel to address gaps, and promoting institutionalization were themes identified to describe how contextual lessons are incorporated into the implementation process.
   Conclusions
   Context is regarded as critical and influenced the design and implementation of the GACD funded chronic disease interventions. There are different approaches to assess and incorporate context as demonstrated by this study and further research is required to systematically evaluate contextual approaches in terms of how they contribute to effectiveness or implementation outcomes.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate patterns of retinal vasculitis with ultra-wide field imaging (UWF) and ascertain the risk factors for retinal neovascularization. Methods: Consecutive patients of retinal vasculitis were included prospectively. Patients with retinal vasculitis secondary to uveitis were excluded. UWF was done for all the patients. Retinal involvement was classified into three zones and area of capillary non-perfusion was stratified into clock hours. Results: Two hundred patients were included, 85% (n = 170) were male. Mean age was 28.99 +/- 10.56 years. Clinical examination revealed 65% cases (n = 130) to be bilateral, while UWF angiography detected 72.5% (n = 145) to have bilateral involvement. Retinal neovascularization was present in 47% (n = 188).Presence of posterior disease had very high odds ratio for development of retinal neovascularization as compared to cases restricted to retinal periphery (OR = 45.03, CI = 6.10-332.30, p = < 0.001). Conclusion: UWF imaging is useful in detecting retinal vasculitis, which is otherwise obscure to clinical examination and assessing risk factors for retinal neovascularization.

AB  - Congenital FXIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder in which mutations are detected in F13A1 and F13B genes that express the two subunits of coagulation FXIII, the catalytic FXIII-A, and protective FXIII-B. Mutations in FXIII-B subunit are considerably rarer compared to FXIII-A. Three mutations in the F13B gene have been reported on its structural disulfide bonds. In the present study, we investigate the structural and functional importance of all 20 structural disulfide bonds in FXIII-B subunit. All disulfide bonds were ablated by individually mutating one of its contributory cysteine's, and these variants were transiently expressed in HEK293t cell lines. The expression products were studied for stability, secretion, the effect on oligomeric state, and on FXIII-A activation. The structural flexibility of these disulfide bonds was studied using classical MD simulation performed on a FXIII-B subunit monomer model. All 20 FXIII-B were found to be important for the secretion and stability of the protein since ablation of any of these led to a secretion deficit. However, the degree of effect that the disruption of disulfide bond had on the protein differed between individual disulfide bonds reflecting a functional hierarchy/diversity within these disulfide bonds.

AB  - Despite numerous studies on major depressive disorder (MDD) susceptibility, the precise underlying molecular mechanism has not been elucidated which restricts the development of etiology-based disease-modifying drug. Major depressive disorder treatment is still symptomatic and is the leading cause of (similar to 30%) failure of the current antidepressant therapy. Here we comprehended the probable genes and pathways commonly associated with antidepressant response and MDD. A systematic review was conducted, and candidate genes/pathways associated with antidepressant response and MDD were identified using an integrative genetics approach. Initially, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/genes found to be significantly associated with antidepressant response were systematically reviewed and retrieved from the candidate studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Also, significant variations concerning MDD susceptibility were extracted from GWAS only. We found 245 (Set A) and 800 (Set B) significantly associated genes with antidepressant response and MDD, respectively. Further, gene set enrichment analysis revealed the top five co-occurring molecular pathways (p 0.05) among the two sets of genes: Cushing syndrome, Axon guidance, cAMP signaling pathway, Insulin secretion, and Glutamatergic synapse, wherein all show a very close relation to synaptic plasticity. Integrative analyses of candidate gene and genome-wide association studies would enable us to investigate the putative targets for the development of disease etiology-based antidepressant that might be more promising than current ones.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of point-of-care thromboelastography (TEG) to predict acute trauma-induced coagulopathy (ATIC) in isolated severe TBI (iSTBI). We conducted an observational diagnostic cohort. Patients for whom TEG was performed before blood transfusion were stratified by conventional coagulation tests (CCTs) on admission and classified as ATIC (prothrombin time >= 16.70s; international normalized ratio >= 1.27; activated partial thromboplastin time >= 28.80s) (n=24) or no ATIC (n=34). Univariate analysis to compare groups, receiver operating characteristic analysis to establish cut-off and diagnostic validation was done. Fifty-eight patients were included [32(25-45) years; 97% male; GCS 6.3 +/- 1.5]. 41% developed ATIC. Compared to no-ATIC, ATIC group had significantly prolonged kappa-time (4.6 vs. 2.5min; p=0.01) and shortened alpha-angle (40.2 degrees vs. 56.3 degrees; p=0.03). A cut-off for kappa-time >= 3.7 (AUC 0.68 95% CI 0.54-0.82, specificity 70%, sensitivity 63%) and alpha angle <= 48.0 (AUC 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.81, specificity 67%, sensitivity 67%) was established. The diagnostic accuracy of this cut-off for identifying ATIC, was 55.6% with sensitivity (81.8%) and specificity (14.3%). TEG may be a clinically sensitive test for identifying the underlying coagulopathy following TBI. However confirmation with CCTs is recommended.

AB  - Background: Most people who inject drugs (PWID) start their drug use careers by using non-injecting opioid drugs. A variety of interconnected factors may influence the risk of transition from non-injecting to injecting drug use (IDU). However, such factors have not been studied well in India. As almost all non-injecting opioid users (NIOU) are at potential risk of switching to IDU in future, it is important to understand the phenomenon of transition.
   Method: In this multi-site, cross-sectional observational study, we compared injecting and non-injecting opioid users on the pattern of progression of drug use and their knowledge, attitude and belief about IDU/HIV. Data were collected from people who use drugs coming in contact with Non-Governmental Organizations providing drug treatment or HIV prevention services, in ten cities of six states located in North/North-West India. Following informed consent, a total of 1987 male participants (n = 1234 PWID and n = 753 NIOU) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Factors associated with risk of transition were analyzed using logistic regression analysis.
   Result: The age of onset of heroin and other opiates as well as other substances was not different between two groups. Among PWID, a majority (n = 713; 57.77%) reported using opioids through non-injecting route before switching to injecting route. The mean duration between first use of non-injecting opioid and first use of injecting opioid was 1.80 +/- 3.32 years (range 0-26 years). Awareness and exposure to the act of injecting were amongst factors associated with perceived risk of transition to injecting (p < 0.01). On a univariate logistic regression analysis, less education was associated with increased likelihood while being employed was associated with less likelihood of being offered injection (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Though, NIOU are almost indistinguishable from PWID in many respects, there may be certain factors putting them at risk of transition to injecting route. As the majority of PWID start their injecting career by non-injecting route, interventions targeted atrisk NIOU (as suggested by our study) could interrupt the HIV transmission.

AB  - To determine the comparability of anterior chamber biometric measurements in primary angle closure disease (PACD) patients using two commercially available anterior segment optical coherence tomography machines (ASOCT): Visante and Casia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study, which included clinically, diagnosed cases of PACD. Anterior segment biometric measurements were done using Casia and Visante ASOCT. Parameters studied were central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), nasal (N) and temporal (1) angle opening distance at 500 mu m (AOD500) and 750 mu m (AOD750), and N and T trabecular iris space area at 500 mu m (TISA500) and 750 mu m (TIM 750). Results. Total 36 PACD patients (72 eyes) with average age of 59.48 +/- 7.95 years were recruited, out of which 25 were females (69.44%) and 11 males (30.56%). The mean measurements of CCT, ACD, AOD500, and TISA on Casia and Visante machines were 522.5 +/- 34.75 mu m and 539.55 +/- 29.56 mu m (P = 0.00); ACD- 2.144 +/- 0.38 mu m and 2.133 +/- 0.39 mu m (P = 0.487); AOD500-0.27 +/- 0.16 mu m and 0.21 +/- 0.10 mu m (P = 0.04); and TISA500-0.100 +/- 0.07 mu m and 0.063 +/- 0.03 mu m (P = 0.00), respectively. A statistically significant difference was noted in CCT, N and T AOD, and TISA. A good corelation for ACD and CCT (ACD = 0.9816 and CCT = 0.772) only were noted between the two machines. The Bland-Altman plot analysis of different parameters between two machines has revealed good agreement of measurement of ACD and CCT but poor agreement for rest of the parameters. Conclusion: It is advisable not use the two machines interchangeably because of the wide limits of agreement and poor correlation of angle measurement values of Casia and Visante ASOCT.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) prevents invasion of tumour cells and possesses an intrinsic mechanism to down regulate signalling processes that promote cancer proliferation. Small Leucine Rich Proteoglycans (SLRPs) are ubiquitous ECM components involved in matrix structural organization and as such can potentially regulate cancer cell multiplication, angiogenesis and migration. Decorin, a class I SLRP that modulates collagen fibrillogenesis, also functions as a natural pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor to reduce tumour growth. In fact, decreased decorin expression has been associated with tumour aggressiveness and lower survival. In contrast, biglycan, another class I SLRP, was highly expressed in cancer and was associated with metastatic activity and lower survival. Tissue expression of lumican, a class II SLRP, was associated with clinical outcome and appears tumour specific. Recently, decorin, biglycan and lumican were found to be potential biomarkers in bladder cancer. This review updates our current understanding on the molecular interplay and significance of decorin, biglycan and lumican expression in cancer.

KW  - BIAS
AB  - Background The efficacy, safety, and clinical importance of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis (EDT) for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in medical patients remain unclear. We compared the efficacy and safety of EDT in patients hospitalized for medical illness.
   Methods and findings Electronic databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to March 21, 2019. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting use of EDT for prevention of VTE. We performed trial sequential and cumulative meta-analyses to evaluate EDT effects on the primary efficacy endpoint of symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major or fatal bleeding, and all-cause mortality. The pooled number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one symptomatic or fatal VTE event and the number needed to harm (NNH) to cause one major or fatal bleeding event were calculated. Across 5 RCTs with 40,247 patients (mean age: 67-77 years, proportion of women: 48%-54%, most common reason for admission: heart failure), the duration of EDT ranged from 24-47 days. EDT reduced symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death compared with standard of care (0.8% versus 1.2%; risk ratio [RR]: 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.83; p = 0.002). EDT increased risk of ISTH major or fatal bleeding (0.6% versus 0.3%; RR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.42-2.91; p < 0.001) in both meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses. Pooled NNT to prevent one symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death was 250 (95% CI: 167-500), whereas NNH to cause one major or fatal bleeding event was 333 (95% CI: 200-1,000). Limitations of the study include variation in enrollment criteria, individual therapies, duration of EDT, and VTE detection protocols across included trials.
   Conclusions In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials, we observed that use of a post-hospital discharge EDT strategy for a 4-to-6-week period reduced symptomatic or fatal VTE events at the expense of increased risk of major or fatal bleeding. Further investigations are still required to define the risks and benefits in discrete medically ill cohorts, evaluate cost-effectiveness, and develop pathways for targeted implementation of this postdischarge EDT strategy.

AB  - Homicide patterns are a useful indicator of social stress in a community, and they provide law-enforcement authorities with helpful information. This study was undertaken at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, in order to understand the regional pattern of homicide. Data from the last 20 years were analysed. There were a total of 1048 male and 323 female homicide cases. The male/female ratio was about 3:1, and the proportion of total autopsies was approximately 4% for both sexes. The most common age group was 11-40 years old. Female cases were more common during the monsoon season, but male cases did not show any such variation. Blunt-force head injury, stabbing, strangulation and shooting were the most common methods, and the head, neck and chest were the most commonly targeted areas. Defence injuries were seen in 7.9% cases, significantly more often amongst men, most of which were active and in the form of incised wounds. About 17% of cases survived in hospital for up to a month before succumbing to their injuries, with males being in their 50s and 60s and females in younger age groups. Most of these cases suffered a gunshot wound, followed by a head injury and a stab wound.

AB  - A homozygous 83-kb deletion encompassing the genes for complement factor-H-related proteins 1 and 3 (FHR 1, FHR3) is known as a risk factor for some immune inflammatory disorders. However, the functional relevance of this FHR1/3 deletion is relatively unexplored. Globally, healthy populations of all ethnic groups tested show an 8-10% prevalence of homozygosity for this deletion polymorphism. We have begun to compare the peripheral leucocyte phenotype and functionality between FHR1/3-/- and FHR1/3+/+ healthy adult individuals. We report that the two groups show significant differences in their peripheral blood innate leucocyte subset composition, although the adaptive immune subsets are similar between them. Specifically, FHR1/3-/- individuals show higher frequencies of patrolling monocytes and lower frequencies of classical monocytes than FHR1/3+/+ individuals. Similarly, FHR1/3-/- individuals show higher frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and lower frequencies of myeloid DCs (mDCs) than FHR1/3+/+ individuals. Notably, classical monocytes specifically showed cell-surface-associated factor H (FH), and cells from the FHR1/3-/- group had somewhat higher surface-associated FH levels than those from FHR1/3+/+ individuals. FHR1/3-/- monocytes also showed elevated secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-10 in response to TLR7/8 or TLR4 ligands. Similarly, FHR1/3-/- mDCs and pDCs showed modest but evident hyper-responsiveness to TLR ligands. Our findings, that the FHR1/3-/- genotype is associated with significant alterations of both the relative prominence and the functioning of monocyte and DC subsets, may be relevant in understanding the mechanism underlying the association of the genotype with immune inflammatory disorders.

AB  - Objective To revise FIGO staging of carcinoma of the cervix uteri, allowing incorporation of imaging and/or pathological findings, and clinical assessment of tumor size and disease extent. Methods Review of literature and consensus view of the FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee and related societies and organizations. Results In stage I, revision of the definition of microinvasion and lesion size as follows. Stage IA: lateral extension measurement is removed; stage IB has three subgroups-stage IB1: invasive carcinomas >= 5 mm and IB2: tumors 2-4 cm; stage IB3: tumors >= 4 cm. Imaging or pathology findings may be used to assess retroperitoneal lymph nodes; if metastatic, the case is assigned stage IIIC; if only pelvic lymph nodes, the case is assigned stage IIIC1; if para-aortic nodes are involved, the case is assigned stage IIIC2. Notations 'r' and 'p' will indicate the method used to derive the stage-i.e., imaging or pathology, respectively-and should be recorded. Routine investigations and other methods (e.g., examination under anesthesia, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, etc.) are not mandatory and are to be recommended based on clinical findings and standard of care. Conclusion The revised cervical cancer staging is applicable to all resource levels. Data collection and publication will inform future revisions.

AB  - Globally, preterm birth is a major public health problem. In India, 3.6 million of the 27 million infants born annually are preterm. Risk stratification of women based on multidimensional risk factors assessed during pregnancy is critical for prevention of preterm birth. A cohort study of pregnant women was initiated in May 2015 at the civil hospital in Gurugram, Haryana, India. Women are enrolled within 20 weeks of gestation and are followed until delivery and once postpartum. The objectives are to identify clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and microbial correlates; discover molecular-risk markers by using an integrative -omics approach; and generate a risk-prediction algorithm for preterm birth. We describe here the longitudinal study design, methodology of data collection, and the repositories of data, biospecimens, and ultrasound images being created. A total of 4,326 pregnant women, with documented evidence of recruitment before 20 weeks of gestation, have been enrolled through March 2018. We report baseline characteristics and outcomes of the first 2,000 enrolled participants. A high frequency of preterm births (14.9% among 1,662 live births) is noteworthy. The cohort database and the repositories will become global resources to answer critical questions on preterm birth and other birth outcomes.

AB  - The objective of the study is the functional characterization of a novel POU1F1 c.605delC mutation in combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) and to report the clinical and genetic details of 160 growth hormone deficiency patients. Screening of GH1, GHRHR, POU1F1, PROP1, and HESX1 genes by Sanger sequencing was carried out in 160 trios and 100 controls followed by characterization of the POU1F1 c.605delC mutation by expression studies including site directed mutagenesis, co-transfection, protein degradation, and luciferase assays to compare the wild type and mutant POU1F1. In vitro studies showed that the POU1F1 c.605delC mutation codes for a truncated protein with reduced transactivation capacity on its downstream effectors, viz., growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) causing severe CPHD. Experiments using different protease inhibitors reveal rescue of the protein upon blockage of the lysosomal pathway that might be useful in novel drug designing using targeted approach thereby maintaining the milieu and preventing/delaying the disease. The study provides an insight into the disease causing mechanism of POU1F1 c.605delC mutation identified in a CPHD child with severe short stature and failure to thrive. It also shows mutation effect on the expression, function and turnover of protein and highlights mechanistic details by which these potent regulators may operate.

AB  - Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and relapse are major issues for patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). T-regulatory (Treg) cells in the donor graft are negatively correlated with the incidence of aGVHD without any impact on relapse. In this study to determine the association of Treg cells with aGVHD in allo-HSCT patients. Thirty-two patients with hematological disorders, who underwent allo-HSCT. Twenty-nine patients who achieved engraftment were enrolled in the study. Treg cells were quantified in donor graft by flowcytometry and were assessed for their association with aGVHD and other clinical outcomes. Fifteen of 29 patients developed aGVHD. According to the occurrence and severity of aGVHD, patients were divided into two groups: 20 (68.9%) patients with grade 0-I aGVHD and 9 (31.1%) patients with grade II-IV aGVHD. Treg cells/CD4 ratio was significantly higher in the grade 0-I aGVHD group than in grade II-IV aGVHD group, (p=0.0002). We could not find the association of CD34 dose (p=0.55) or CD3 dose (p=0.57) with the severity of aGVHD. Higher Treg cells/CD4 ratio in donor graft was associated with less severe aGVHD. Though more studies are needed, Treg cells/CD4 ratio may be used as a predictive marker for severity of aGVHD in post allo-HSCT.

AB  - Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a standard treatment for secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in high income countries (HICs), but it is inaccessible to most patients in India due to high costs and skills required for multidisciplinary CR teams. We developed a low-cost and scalable CR program based on culturally-acceptable practice of yoga (Yoga-CaRe). In this paper, we report the rationale and design for evaluation of its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
   Methods: This is a multi-center, single-blind, two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial across 22 cardiac care hospitals in India. Four thousand patients aged 18-80 years with AMI will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to receive Yoga-CaRe program (13 sessions supervised by an instructor and encouragement to self-practice daily) or enhanced standard care (3 sessions of health education) delivered over a period of three months. Participants will be followed 3-monthly till the end of the trial. The co-primary outcomes are a) time to occurrence of first cardiovascular event (composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and emergency cardiovascular hospitalization), and b) quality of life (Euro-QoL-5L) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include need for revascularization procedures, return to pre-infarct activities, tobacco cessation, medication adherence, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
   Conclusion: This trial will alone contribute >20% participants to existing meta-analyses of randomized trials of CR worldwide. If Yoga-CaRe is found to be effective, it has the potential to save millions of lives and transform care of AMI patients in India and other low and middle income country settings.

AB  - Though the existence of cancer stem cells remained enigmatic initially, over the time their participation in tumorigenesis and tumor progression has become highly evident. Today, they are also appreciated as the causal element for tumor heterogeneity and drug-resistance. Cancer stem cells activate a set of molecular pathways some of which are triggered by the unique mechanical properties of the tumor tissue stroma. A relatively new field called mechanobiology has emerged, which aims to critically evaluate the mechanical properties associated with biological events like tissue morphogenesis, cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, cellular migration and also the development and progression of cancer. Development of more realistic model systems and biophysical instrumentation for observation and manipulation of cell-dynamics in real-time has invoked a hope for some novel therapeutic modalities against cancer in the future. This review discusses the fundamental concepts of cancer stem cells from an intriguing viewpoint of mechanobiology and some important breakthroughs to date.

AB  - Biopsy site changes in mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) attributable to prior endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) have not been studied in a systematic manner. Twenty-four contributors from 14 institutions in 5 countries collaborated via social media (Twitter) to retrospectively review consecutive cases of resected mediastinal LNs from patients with prior EBUS-TBNA. Resected LNs were reexamined by submitting pathologists for changes attributable to EBUS-TBNA. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Cases with suspected biopsy site changes underwent central review by 5 pathologists. A total of 297 mediastinal LN resection specimens from 297 patients (183 male/114 female, mean age: 65 y, range: 23 to 87) were reviewed. Biopsy site changes were most common in station 7 (10 cases) followed by 11R, 4R, and 10R, and were found in 34/297 (11.4%) cases, including displacement of tiny cartilage fragments into LN parenchyma in 26, intranodal or perinodal scars in 7, and hemosiderin in 1. Cartilage fragments ranged from 0.26 to 1.03 mm in length and 0.18 to 0.62 mm in width. The mean interval between EBUS-TBNA and LN resection was 38 days (range: 10 to 112) in cases with biopsy site changes. A control group of 40 cases without prior EBUS-TBNA, including 193 mediastinal LN stations, showed no evidence of biopsy site changes. Biopsy site changes are identified in a subset of resected mediastinal LNs previously sampled by EBUS-TBNA. The location of the abnormalities, temporal association with prior EBUS-TBNA, and the absence of such findings in cases without prior EBUS-TBNA support the contention that they are caused by EBUS-TBNA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE There is no consensus on the optimal timing and specific brain MRI sequences in the evaluation and management of severe pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI), and information on current practices is lacking. The authors performed a survey of MRI practices among sites participating in a multicenter study of severe pediatric TBI to provide information for designing future clinical trials using MRI to assess brain injury after severe pediatric TBI.
   METHODS Information on current imaging practices and resources was collected from 27 institutions participating in the Approaches and Decisions after Pediatric TBI Trial. Multiple-choice questions addressed the percentage of patients with TBI who have MRI studies, timing of MRI, MRI sequences used to investigate TBI, as well as the magnetic field strength of MR scanners used at the participating institutions and use of standardized MRI protocols for imaging after severe pediatric TBI.
   RESULTS Overall, the reported use of MRI in pediatric patients with severe TBI at participating sites was high, with 40% of sites indicating that they obtain MRI studies in > 95% of this patient population. Differences were observed in the frequency of MRI use between US and international sites, with the US sites obtaining MRI in a higher proportion of their pediatric patients with severe TBI (94% of US vs 44% of international sites reported MRI in at least 70% of patients with severe TBI). The reported timing and composition of MRI studies was highly variable across sites. Sixty percent of sites reported typically obtaining an MRI study within the first 7 days postinjury, with the remainder of responses distributed throughout the first 30-day postinjury period. Responses indicated that MRI sequences sensitive for diffuse axonal injury and ischemia are frequently obtained in patients with TBI, whereas perfusion imaging and spectroscopy techniques are less common.
   CONCLUSIONS Results from this survey suggest that despite the lack of consensus or guidelines, MRI is commonly obtained during the acute clinical setting after severe pediatric TBI. The variation in MRI practices highlights the need for additional studies to determine the utility, optimal timing, and composition of clinical MRI studies after TBI. The information in this survey describes current clinical MRI practices in children with severe TBI and identifies important challenges and objectives that should be considered when designing future studies.

AB  - We report the case of a 5-year-old male child presenting with seizures for 4 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cortical-based solid cystic lesion in the right parietal lobe. Histopathological examination showed a tumour comprised of spindled glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) positive neoplastic cells interspersed with bizarre pleomorphic cells showing nuclear pseudoinclusions and intermingled dysplastic ganglion cells variably immunopositive for synaptophysin, chromogranin, Neu-N and immunonegative for neuron filament protein (NFP). This report highlights the occurrence of the rare composite pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma-ganglioglioma and the vagaries of immunohistochemical analysis in highlighting neuronal differentiation in such a case setting. In addition, to the best of our knowledge this is the youngest patient till date to present with this entity.

AB  - Aim: Few studies have assessed the impact of infections after renal transplantation (RTX) in low and middle income countries. This single centre study aimed to delineate the profile and impact of infections requiring hospitalization (IRH) occurring in the first year after RTX in India.
   Method: Patients who underwent RTX between July 2012 and June 2015 were followed up for 12 months after transplantation.
   Results: 60.2% of the 387 patients studied had at least one IRH and total 492 infections were diagnosed. The most common were urinary tract (30.3%), gastrointestinal (17.1%) and pulmonary (11.2%) infections. Viral aetiology (33.3%) was most frequent, followed by bacterial (23.6%), parasitic (5.1%), tuberculosis (4.5%), and fungal infections (3.9%). 86.4% deaths were due to infections. One year patient and graft survival were inferior among recipients with IRH compared to those with no IRH: 91.8% vs. 98.1% (log rank = 0.010) and 90.1% vs. 97.4% (log rank = 0.006) respectively. Average monthly income per family member <5000 Rupees (75 USD), NODAT, and acute rejection were independent risk factors for IRH.
   Conclusion: The profile of IRH is unique involving opportunistic, community-acquired and endemic infections seen in this country. It is the predominant cause of mortality and graft loss in the first year after RTX. Poor economic status is an important determinant of IRH in our population.

AB  - Objective To study the clinical impact of respiratory viral infection in children with cystic fibrosis (CF).
   Design Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting Tertiary care referral centre for CF in India.
   Participants/patients Children with CF attending a pediatric chest clinic.
   Methods Case records of the children with CF who had a pulmonary exacerbation with documented acute respiratory viral infection between October 2013 and December 2014 (Group I) and an equal number of controls (Group II) with pulmonary exacerbation in absence of acute respiratory viral infection were reviewed.
   Outcome measures The two groups were compared for the following outcomes over a period of 12-18 months: bacterial colonization, antibiotics usage, pulmonary exacerbations, numbers of outpatient visits, hospitalization and oxygen therapy and spirometric parameters.
   Results In total, 46 children [23 each with viral infection (Group I) and without viral infection (Group II)] of age 7-264months were enrolled; baseline clinical status and pulmonary function tests were comparable. Mean (SD) follow-up duration in those who had viral infection and who had no viral infection was 15.7 (7.1) and 17.5 (5.4) months, respectively. On follow-up, children with viral infection (Group I) had adverse outcome in form of greater worsening of Shwachman clinical scores, number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic usage [4 (2.1%)] and [2.8 (1.7%)], need for intravenous antibiotics 30.4% vs. 8.7%, hospitalization rates 31.8% vs. 4.3% and mortality 30.4% vs. 4.7%, respectively.
   Conclusion Acute viral infection in children with CF affected course of illness on follow-up, including frequent and severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, decline in CF scores and increased mortality over next 12-18months.

AB  - Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by hypopigmentation, silver colored hair, and associated immunological deficiency, which proves fatal in the absence of timely intervention. Our patients diagnosed with Griscelli syndrome-2 presented with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and deranged hematological and biochemical parameters. Both cases underwent detailed investigations comprising of hair mount microscopic examination, degranulation assay, and mutational studies. Our cases showed defective degranulation activity by NK cells and gene mutation analysis revealed RAB27A mutation that causes defect of cytotoxic granule exocytosis from natural killer (NK) and T-cells, manifesting clinically as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in one of the patients resulted in stable chimerism; however, the second case relapsed within a month after SCT. Stem cell transplantation is the only curative therapeutic option for GS2; thus, improvement in posttransplantation management may reduce mortality and posttransplant complications. Hence, any child who presents with partial albinism and clinical features suggestive of HLH, a peripheral blood, hair shaft mount examination along with basic immunological NK and T-cell cytotoxicity assay by flow cytometry will help clinch the diagnosis early. It can subsequently be confirmed by molecular study. Timely therapeutic intervention can prevent relapses and severe infection and improve outcome in these cases.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Provision of subsidized spectacles to schoolchildren with refractive error in Delhi was associated with increased spectacle coverage.
   PURPOSE Studies involving free spectacle distribution and self-purchase of spectacles often report poor compliance. We assessed 1-year spectacle coverage among schoolchildren with refractive error who were provided subsidized spectacles. METHODS This was a study of a prospective cohort of 10,114 students from 20 randomly selected schools of Delhi. Children were presumed to have refractive error when unaided visual acuity was worse than or equal to 6/12 in either eye and a best-corrected visual acuity better than or equal to 6/9.5 in both eyes (n = 1503). Children with unmet need of spectacles (presenting with a visual acuity worse than 6/9.5 in the worse eye) were provided subsidized spectacles (n = 1191). Coverage was established by direct observation at baseline and after 1 year through unannounced visits. RESULTS Mean age of cohort was 12.0 +/- 2.0 years, and 566 (37.7%) were girls. Baseline spectacle coverage was 29.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.1 to 31.7%), which improved to 65.9% (95% CI, 56.0 to 61.6%) among all children (n = 1470) and 58.8% (95% CI, 56.0 to 61.6%) among children with unmet need (n = 1163) at 1 year. Uptake of the subsidized spectacles was 98.6%. On multivariate regression, the odds of spectacle use were greatest when unaided vision was poor: 55.5% when visual acuity was better than or equal to 6/9.5, 74.8% when visual acuity was 6/19 to 6/60 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.5), and 91.5% when visual acuity was worse than 6/60 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 9.5). Sex (boys, 66.3%; girls, 65.3%) and socioeconomic status (lower, 58.6%; middle, 61.8%; upper middle, 70.7%) were not associated with coverage. Increasing maternal education and baseline spectacle use were associated with coverage. However, 38.0% were wearing spectacles prescribed by the project, and 61.9% of the spectacles being used at 1 year were purchased in the open market. CONCLUSIONS Spectacle coverage after 1 year increased through a subsidized spectacle scheme, particularly for children with poor uncorrected vision.

AB  - The present report describes current concepts about the mechanism of liver cell injury caused by host immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human beings. This report is based on the observations from experimental studies and follow-up actions on human liver diseases. The results from different investigations suggest that liver injury depends on the presentation of viral antigen and the level of host immune response raised against HCV-related peptides. Both innate and adaptive immunity are triggered to counter the viral onset. During development of host immunity, the cell-mediated immune response involving CD4(+) Th1 cells and CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) cells were found to play a major role in causing liver damage. The hepatic Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) subsets are involved in the immune regulation of different liver diseases: viral hepatitis, mechanical liver injury, and fibrosis. Humoral immunity and natural killer (NK) cell action also contributed in liver cell injury by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In fact, immunopathogenesis of HCV infection is a complex phenomenon where regulation of immune response at several steps decides the possibility of viral elimination or persistence. Regulation of immune response was noted starting from viral-host interaction to immune reaction cascade engaged in cell damage. The activation or suppression of interferon-stimulated genes, NK cell action, CTL inducement by regulatory T cells (Treg), B cell proliferation, and so on was demonstrated during HCV infection. Involvement of HLA in antigen presentation, as well as types of viral genotypes, also influenced host immune response against HCV peptides. The combined effect of all these effector mechanisms ultimately decides the progression of viral onset to acute or chronic infection. In conclusion, immunopathogenesis of liver injury after HCV infection may be ascribed mainly to host immune response. Second, it is cell-mediated immunity that plays a predominant role in liver cell damage.

AB  - Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Unfortunately, most patients of LC present at the advanced stage of the disease with a poor prognosis and 1-year survival of less than 20%. At the advanced stage of the disease, surgical resection cannot be possible, hence small biopsy or cytology specimens remain a choice for their correct diagnosis. The recognition of molecular drivers has revolutionized the treatment paradigm of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations were identified, first, to be targeted in NSCLC followed by activating fusions in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and rearrangements in c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) genes. In addition, the encouraging progress of immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC has been associated with predictive biomarker testing in the form of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry assay. To test for these alterations, accurate biomarker testing is needed from biopsy or cytology specimens. In this brief review, testing of biomarkers is discussed using cytology specimens.

AB  - Purpose: To study the varied presentations and the outcomes in children with Type 2 Abernethy malformation following shunt ligation.
   Material and methods: Children with Type 2 Abernethy who had had been operated between 2013 and 2017 were included in the study. The diagnosis had been confirmed on ultrasonography, CECT or angiography. All patients underwent laparotomy. The shunt was identified, clamped and the bowel congestion was noted. The shunt was ligated if the bowel congestion was not significant or had improved. Relevant follow-up investigations were done to document the resolution or amelioration of symptoms and the patency of the shunt.
   Results: Five patients were included in the study with a median age of 6 years. Hepatopulmonary syndrome was the presentation in 4 patients while one patient presented with liver tumor. Ultrasonography and CECT were able to diagnose Type 2 malformation in 4 patients whereas in 1 patient the distal portal vein was not seen. The postoperative period was complicated in 3 patients. At the median follow up at 14 months, good intrahepatic portal flow in all patients. All patients demonstrated improvement/resolution of symptoms.
   Conclusion: Abernethy is rare malformation which can have a varied presentation. Additional investigations may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of Type 2 variety. Most patients have gradual improvement of symptoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To address the relationship between novel mutations in polynucleotide 5'-kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), DNA strand break repair, and neurologic disease. Methods We have employed whole-exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and molecular/cellular biology. Results We describe here a patient with microcephaly with early onset seizures (MCSZ) from the Indian sub-continent harboring 2 novel mutations in PNKP, including a pathogenic mutation in the fork-head associated domain. In addition, we confirm that MCSZ is associated with hyperactivation of the single-strand break sensor protein protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) following the induction of abortive topoisomerase I activity, a source of DNA strand breakage associated previously with neurologic disease. Conclusions These data expand the spectrum of PNKP mutations associated with MCSZ and show that PARP1 hyperactivation at unrepaired topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks is a molecular feature of this disease.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate immune tolerance induction with transient low-dose methotrexate (TLD-MTX) initiated with recombinant human acid a-glucosidase (rhGAA), in treatment-naive cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-positive infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) patients.
   Methods: Newly diagnosed IOPD patients received subcutaneous or oral 0.4 mg/kg TLD-MTX for 3 cycles (3 doses/cycle) with the first 3 rhGAA infusions. Anti-rhGAA IgG titers, classified as high-sustained (HSAT; >= 51,200, >= 2 times after 6 months), sustained intermediate (SIT; >= 12,800 and <51,200 within 12 months), or low (LT; <= 6400 within 12 months), were compared with those of 37 CRIM-positive IOPD historic comparators receiving rhGAA alone.
   Results: Fourteen IOPD TLD-MTX recipients at the median age of 3.8 months (range, 0.7-13.5 months) had a median last titer of 150 (range, 0-51,200) at median rhGAA duration similar to 83 weeks (range, 36-122 weeks). One IOPD patient (7.1%) developed titers in the SIT range and one patient (7.1%) developed titers in the HSAT range. Twelve of the 14 patients (85.7%) that received TLD-MTX remained LT, versus 5/37 HSAT (peak 51,200-409,600), 7/37 SIT (12,800-51,000), and 23/37 LT (200-12,800) among comparators.
   Conclusion: Results of TLD-MTX coinitiated with rhGAA are encouraging and merit a larger longitudinal study.

AB  - The asthma candidate gene inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type I A (INPP4A) is a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway. Destabilizing genetic variants of INPP4A increase the risk of asthma, and lung-specific INPP4A knockdown induces asthma-like features. INPP4A is known to localize intracellularly, and its extracellular presence has not been reported yet. Here we show for the first time that INPP4A is secreted by airway epithelial cells and that extracellular INPP4A critically inhibits airway inflammation and remodeling. INPP4A was present in blood and BAL fluid, and this extracellular INPP4A was reduced in patients with asthma and mice with allergic airway inflammation. In both naive mice and mice with allergic airway inflammation, antibody-mediated neutralization of extracellular INPP4A potentiated PI3K/Akt signaling and induced airway hyperresponsiveness, with prominent airway remodeling, subepithelial fibroblast proliferation, and collagen deposition. The link between extracellular INPP4A and fibroblasts was investigated in vitro. Cultured airway epithelial cells secreted enzymatically active INPP4A in extracellular vesicles and in a free form. Extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of labeled INPP4A, from epithelial cells to fibroblasts, was observed. Inhibition of such transfer by anti-INPP4A antibody increased fibroblast proliferation. We propose that secretory INPP4A is a novel "paracrine" layer of the intricate regulation of lung homeostasis, by which airway epithelium dampens PI3K/Akt signaling in inflammatory cells or local fibroblasts, thereby limiting inflammation and remodeling.

AB  - Aim To evaluate refractive outcomes of cataract surgery with intraocular lens (TOL) implantation in operated eyes of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG).
   Design A retrospective case-control study.
   Methods Patients of PCG who developed cataract following trabeculectomy with trabeculotomy were recruited. Preoperative biometry was recorded and refractive outcomes of the patients in terms of spherical equivalent (SE) and prediction error were noted at 3 and at 12 months following surgery. The refractive outcomes were compared with non-glaucomatous eyes of children in similar age group who underwent lens aspiration with IOL implantation (controls).
   Results The median age of the children with PCG (n = 31) at the time of cataract surgery was 60 months, similar to controls (n = 29); 48 months (p = 0.3). The SE in PCG eyes at 12 months was comparable to controls (p = 0.18). The prediction error (postoperative SE - predicted SE) at 3 months (p = 0.018) and at 12 months (p = 0.03) among PCG eyes was higher and more myopic compared with controls. The range of prediction error at 12 months in PCG eyes was - 8.6 to + 5.8 D (median - 2.0 D), whereas in controls it was - 4.2 to + 6.3 D (median + 0.5 D). For each mmHg intraocular pressure (TOP) increase there was 0.42 mm increase in axial length among PCG eyes and a 0.24 mm increase among controls (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions After IOL implantation there was a greater prediction error and a greater myopic shift among PCG eyes. Eyes of children with PCG are more prone to refractive surprises as their axial length changes are more sensitive to IOP fluctuation.

AB  - Auto Immune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA) is one of the most common types of acquired haemolytic anaemias. Its main cause is auto-antibody mediated rapid destruction of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). Demonstration of a positive Direct Antiglobulin Test also known as Coomb's test, against these autoantibodies is the crucial serological assay in the diagnosis of AIHA. This routinely used test has the disadvantage of low sensitivity and does not detect low levels of red cell auto antibodies leading to false negative results sometimes. Flow cytometry can effectively diagnose such patients with low levels of autoantibodies. This study was carried out in a tertiary care center, where patients with suspected AIHA were studied during 2years period. Blood samples of suspected patients of AIHA were tested by both Gel Card Test and by Flow-cytometry for detection of RBC bound IgG. A total of 50 patients with suspected diagnosis of AIHA were studied by flow-cytometry as well as by Gel card test for detection of RBC bound IgG. Out of these 50 cases, 41 cases have turned out to be positive and 9 were negative by flow-cytometry. By Gel card test, out of 50 cases, 34 were positive and 16 were negative. Therefore, there were 7 cases which were negative for RBC bound IgG by Gel card test and these were positive by flow-cytometry. Flow-cytometry is a reliable and more sensitive method and can be used as a new routine diagnostic technique for AIHA.

AB  - Background Genetic variability in LRRK2 has been unequivocally established as a major risk factor for familial and sporadic forms of PD in ethnically diverse populations. Objectives To resolve the role of LRRK2 in the Indian population. Methods We performed targeted resequencing of the LRRK2 locus in 288 cases and 298 controls and resolved the haplotypic structure of LRRK2 in a combined cohort of 800 cases and 402 controls in the Indian population. We assessed the frequency of novel missense variants in the white and East Asian population by leveraging exome sequencing and densely genotype data, respectively. We did computational modeling and biochemical approach to infer the potential role of novel variants impacting the LRRK2 protein function. Finally, we assessed the phosphorylation activity of identified novel coding variants in the LRRK2 gene. Results We identified four novel missense variants with frequency ranging from 0.0008% to 0.002% specific for the Indian population, encompassing armadillo and kinase domains of the LRRK2 protein. A common genetic variability within LRRK2 may contribute to increased risk, but it was nonsignificant after correcting for multiple testing, because of small cohort size. The computational modeling showed destabilizing effect on the LRRK2 function. In comparison to the wild-type, the kinase domain variant showed 4-fold increase in the kinase activity. Conclusions Our study, for the first time, identified novel missense variants for LRRK2, specific for the Indian population, and showed that a novel missense variant in the kinase domain modifies kinase activity in vitro.

T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CANCER
KW  - Metastasis

KW  - breast cancer
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females. The common site for metastases is bone, lungs, liver, and regional lymph nodes. Larynx as a metastatic site from breast cancer is extremely rare. The authors report a 63-year-old female treated for carcinoma of right breast 5 years back who presented with hoarseness of voice. Clinicoradiological examination revealed a soft tissue lesion in larynx. Pathological evaluation of the laryngeal lesion revealed metastases secondary to breast cancer. The patient received systemic chemotherapy and local radiotherapy. Patients with a history of breast cancer presenting with hoarseness and shortness of breath should not only be evaluated for laryngeal primary but also for metastases. This case is reported in view of rarity of the case with laryngeal metastases from breast cancer masquerading as primary laryngeal disease. To the best of our knowledge, less than 20 cases of laryngeal metastases from breast cancer had been reported in literature till date. Patients with a history of breast cancer presenting with hoarseness and shortness of breath should not only be evaluated for laryngeal primary but also for metastases. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the treatment of laryngeal metastases is multidisciplinary. Recognizing metastatic disease and prompt early treatment are very important to improve the quality of life. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the correlation between the morphologic features and serology in eyes with macular colobomata (MC).
   DESIGN: Retrospective comparative case series.
   METHODS: Setting: Institutional. Study Population: Patients presenting with MC to the retina clinic over a period of 2 years (January 2016 to December 2017). Interventional/Observational Procedure: Color fundus and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) features were reviewed and assessed in 3 groups based on the serum IgG results: positive for Toxo-plasma, positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and serology negative. Main Outcome Measure: Morphologic features on clinical and OCT-based examination.
   RESULTS: A total of 49 eyes of 27 patients were recruited. The mean age was 24.8 +/- 14.9 years (range 7-60 years). While the lesion size, the presence of satellite lesions, choroidal excavation, and choroidal lacunae (large choroidal vessels) on SSOCT differed significantly among the groups, pigmentation, retinal fibrosis, shape, retinal vessel pattern, and choroidal vessel visibility did not vary significantly. The lesions in CMV serology-positive cases were mostly solitary (n = 8/8), large (n = 5/8) and deeply excavated (n = 8/8). The lesions in Toxoplasma serology-positive cases were mostly flat to shallow (n = 18/26), medium-sized (n = 19/26), and either a solitary lesion (n = 17/26) or multiple satellite lesions (n = 9/26). The lesions in serology-negative cases were mostly small to medium (n = 13/15), solitary (n = 15/15), deeply excavated lesions (n = 11/15) with choroidal lacunae (n = 8/15).
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and SSOCT features such as the lesion size, the presence of satellite lesions, choroidal excavation, and choroidal lacunae can provide a clue toward the etiology of macular colobomata. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To evaluate the current diagnostic criteria in reporting nuclear features of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), nine Asian pathologists with expertise in thyroid reviewed virtual slides of 30 noninvasive follicular patterned thyroid lesions according to the nuclear scoring system originally proposed by an international expert and a more detailed scoring system proposed by the Asian Working Group. The interobserver agreement for nuclear grading score was generally moderate (kappa value = 0.452). The best consistency fell on the chromatin features (kappa value = 0.658-1.000). A fair to moderate interobserver agreement was demonstrated in the evaluation of nuclear elongation, nuclear overlapping, membrane irregularities and distribution of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) type nuclear features. A slight agreement was rendered for the evaluation of the nuclear enlargement. Intraobserver agreement was substantial to perfect when comparing results of both scoring systems. However, both scoring systems were not able to reliably separate NIFTP from an encapsulated follicular variant PTC with minimal lymph node metastasis or BRAF(V600E) mutation. Although the three-point nuclear scoring system for the diagnosis of NIFTP is widely used in Asian practice, interobserver variation was considerable. Ancillary immunohistochemical or molecular testing might be helpful in differentiating NIFTP from true PTC.

AB  - Despite the fact that emergency care can impact health of populations, the global epidemiology of emergencies in children and adults is unknown and substantial variation exists in emergency infrastructure among different nations, especially among the low and middle income countries. Various research networks which are etiology specific or subspecialty specific, including emergency care based networks have positively impacted the health of populations. However, emergency departments (ED) in low and middle income counties are underrepresented in most international networks. Creation of a global ED based research network will help generate generalizable evidence that can then be translated into locally relevant evidence-based guidelines, nurture future researchers in emergency medicine, standardize training/education and improve patient outcomes by reducing variation in clinical care.

AB  - Osteoporosis and fragility fractures have become a major healthcare challenge globally in the recent years. However, this problem has only recently been accorded its due importance in developing countries such as India. India is a model case study for the management of osteoporosis and fragility fractures in a resource-limited setting, as it harbors a large geriatric population and has the highest prevalence of osteopenia globally. It is imperative to identify the myriad factors contributing to poor bone health and understand the many hurdles encountered to tackle this healthcare problem in a developing country. Innovative methods for managing fragility fractures are commonly seen. Collaborative multidisciplinary care and structured, evidence-based management has finally found its place in India with the establishment of a regional fragility fracture network. This chapter outlines the current status of management of fragility fractures in India by focusing on the disease burden, hurdles, innovative treatment methods, and the challenges lying ahead.

AB  - Metachromatic leukodystrophy due to Arylsulfatase A enzyme deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic variations in ARSA gene. Till date 186 variations have been reported in ARSA gene worldwide, but the variation spectrum in India is not known. The aim of this study was to identify the variation profile in Indian patients presenting with features of Arylsulfatase A deficient metachromatic leukodystrophy. We sequenced the ARSA gene in 51 unrelated families and identified 36 variants out of which 16 were novel. The variations included 23 missense, 3 nonsense, and 6 frameshift variants (3 single-base deletions and 3 single-base duplications), 1 indel, one 3 bp deletion, and 2 splice site variations. The pathogenicity of the novel variations was inferred with the help of mutation prediction softwares like MutationTaster, SIFT, Polyphen-2, PROVEAN, and HANSA. The effects of the identified sequence variants on the protein structure were studied using in silico methods. The most common variation was c.931 C > T(p.Arg311*), found in 11.4% (14 out of 122 alleles) of the tested individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in India with respect to the size of the cohort and the molecular diagnostic method used and one of the largest cohorts of metachromatic leukodystrophy studied till date.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the feeding performance of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) on paladai.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was performed in a level III neonatal unit in North India from March through August 2012. Nineteen infants (27-32 wk of gestation) were enrolled; 9 in BPD group (oxygen requirement for at least 28 d) and 10 in No BPD' group. Paladai feeding (PF) sessions were video recorded for 3 d serially, at first successful (FSF) at postnatal age of 28 d and follow up feeding (FUF) at 402 wk. Successful feeding was defined as 80% intake of volume prescribed. One hundred and four videos were analysed (58 in BPD group and 46 in No BPD' group). The outcome variables were: (1) postmenstrual age (PMA) at FSF (2) feeding performance, as assessed by proficiency (mL/min, volume of feed intake during only active feeding), efficiency (mL/min, volume of feed intake during total duration of feeding) and overall feed transfer (OT, % of prescribed feed volume taken), and (3) change in heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) on PF.ResultsPMA (Weeks, 34.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 33.6 +/- 1.2, p=0.13), performance on FSF [Median (range), Proficiency: ml/min, 4.2 (1.1, 21.7) vs. 3.4 (1.1, 12.4), efficiency: ml/min, 2.7 (0.4, 6.2) vs. 2.5 (0.9, 10.9)] and OT (%, mean +/- SD: 84.9 +/- 22.5 vs. 89.1 +/- 9.6), and on FUF were comparable between the groups. Changes in SpO(2) and HR were not significantly different.Conclusions p id=Par4 Infants with BPD perform comparably well on PF. PF can safely be attempted in them to facilitate transition to oral feeding.

AB  - The 17th International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshop (IHIW) organizers conducted a Pilot Study (PS) in which 13 laboratories (15 groups) participated to assess the performance of the various sequencing library preparation protocols, NGS platforms and software in use prior to the workshop. The organizers sent 50 cell lines to each of the 15 groups, scored the 15 independently generated sets of NGS HLA genotyping data, and generated "consensus" HLA genotypes for each of the 50 cell lines. Proficiency Testing (PT) was subsequently organized using four sets of 24 cell lines, selected from 48 of 50 PS cell lines, to validate the quality of NGS HLA typing data from the 34 participating IHIW laboratories. Completion of the PT program with a minimum score of 95% concordance at the HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 loci satisfied the requirements to submit NGS HLA typing data for the 17th IHIW projects. Together, these PS and PT efforts constituted the 17th IHIW Quality Control project. Overall PT concordance rates for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB3, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5 were 98.1%, 97.0% and 98.1%, 99.0%, 98.6%, 98.8%, 97.6%, 96.0%, 99.1%, 90.0% and 91.7%, respectively. Across all loci, the majority of the discordance was due to allele dropout. The high cost of NGS HLA genotyping per experiment likely prevented the retyping of initially failed HLA loci. Despite the high HLA genotype concordance rates of the software, there remains room for improvement in the assembly of more accurate consensus DNA sequences by NGS HLA genotyping software.

AB  - Under limited micronutrients condition, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) has to struggle for acquisition of the limited micronutrients available in the host. One such crucial micronutrient that MTB requires for the growth and sustenance is iron. The present study aimed to sequester the iron supply of MTB to control drug resistance in MTB. We found that iron restriction renders hypersensitivity to multidrug-resistant MTB strains against first-line anti-TB drugs. To decipher the effect of iron restriction on possible mechanisms of chemosensitization and altered cellular circuitry governing drug resistance and virulence of MTB, we explored MTB cellular architecture. We could identify non-intact cell envelope, tampered MTB morphology and diminished mycolic acid under iron restricted MDR-MTB cells. Deeper exploration unraveled altered lipidome profile observed through conventional TLC and advanced mass spectrometry-based LC-ESI-MS techniques. Lipidome analysis not only depicted profound alterations of various lipid classes which are crucial for pathogenecity but also exposed leads such as indispensability of iron to sustain metabolic, genotoxic and oxidative stresses. Furthermore, iron deprivation led to inhibited biofilm formation and capacity of MTB to adhere buccal epithelial cells. Lastly, we demonstrated enhanced survival of Mycobacterium-infected Caenorhabditis elegans model under iron limitation. The present study offers evidence and proposes alteration of lipidome profile and affected virulence traits upon iron chelation. Taken together, iron deprivation could be a potential strategy to rescue MDR and enhance the effectiveness of existing anti-TB drugs.

AB  - Objective An iodine-131 (I-131) image visually appears to be contaminated with impulse noise. The two-dimensional median filter removes noise without sacrificing the edge information. Its performance depends on the shape and size of the mask. In this study, we have compared the performance of a plus-shape and a square-shape median filter for I-131 whole-body images and found the filter with optimum parameter that improves I-131 image quality acceptable to nuclear medicine physicians. Materials and methods A total of 150 whole-body I-131 images were exported in DICOM format. These images were converted into PNG format and processed with a plus-shape and a square-shape median filter, with each shape mask having sizes of 3, 5, 7, and 9 pixels. The quality of the processed images was assessed by visual assessment by two nuclear medicine physicians and also quantitatively by evaluating metrics: mutual information, mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and difference entropy. Nuclear medicine physicians assigned a score to each image on the scale 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) for image quality on the basis of the noise removal, smoothness, and edge information available in the image. Student's t-test was carried out to find the significant difference in the image quality (alpha=0.05) between the processed images with square-shape and cross-shape mask with the same pixel size. All experiments including statistical analysis were conducted using R installed on a personal computer. Results Both median filters improved the image quality of I-131 images. The plus-shape median filter was found to show better performance in comparison with the square-shape median filter (P<0.001). The plus-shape median filter with a mask size of 7 pixels was found to be optimum for the processing of whole-body I-131 images. Conclusion The plus-shape median filter with a mask size of 7 pixels can be used to process whole-body I-131 scintigraphic images without loss of clinical information.

AB  - Butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has several therapeutic applications, including cancer. However, the effect of butyrate in HBV replication is not known so far. It was hypothesized that butyrate might inhibit HBV replication and host cell proliferation via SIRT-1. It was found that the increased expression of SIRT-1 in Hep G2.2.15 cells (HBV expressing cells) than Hep G2 cells. Next the expression of SIRT-1 and Acetylated p53 (Ac-p53) were measured in the liver biopsy samples of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with high viral load and compared to CHB patients with low viral load and found that there was a high SIRT-1 expression and a low Ac-p53 levels in CHB patients with high viral load compared to CHB patients with low viral load. Incubation of butyrate inhibited SIRT-1 expression and cell proliferation. Inhibition of SIRT-1 by butyrate or SIRT-1 siRNA increased the levels of Ac-p53. The elevated Ac-p53 decreased p-akt, cyclin D1, and thereby inhibited cell proliferation. Incubation of butyrate with Hep G2.2.15 cells also inhibited HBx protein expression, HBV-DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Taken together, the data showed that butyrate inhibited HBV replication and cell proliferation by inhibiting SIRT-1 expression in hepatoma cells.

AB  - Background Noncultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES) is an effective surgical modality for stable vitiligo which involves transplantation of the basal layer of epidermal cells onto the dermabraded vitiliginous patch. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has growth factors which may stimulate melanocyte migration and proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The objective of this study was to compare the extent of repigmentation achieved by transplantation of NCES suspended in PRP with that of NCES suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Methods Twenty-one patients of stable vitiligo with at least two lesions of comparable size were included. The two vitiligo patches were randomized to receive NCES suspended in PRP or PBS. Postoperatively after 1 week, patients were given heliotherapy for 15 minutes daily. Results At 6 months follow-up, mean repigmentation by area method in PRP arm was 75.6 +/- 30% SD and in non-PRP arm was 65 +/- 34% SD (P = 0.0036). Patient satisfaction by visual analogue scale at 6 months also showed better results in PRP arm (P = 0.001). Assessment by three independent observers showed better repigmentation in PRP side both at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions Suspending NCES in PRP can result in significantly greater mean repigmentation and patient satisfaction than suspending in PBS.

AB  - There is an exponential growth in the field of biomedical literature over the years. Although numerous articles are published every year, few of them present important conceptual advances in that particular field and are found to be influential in the evolution of the field. The number of citations a publication receives can be used as a proxy marker of its impact on the field. Hence we aimed to analyze the top cited articles (n = 100) on obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as of July 2018. Google scholar database was searched using a freely available software, Publish or Perish. Information related to number of citations, publication file, publication year, name of the journal, country of origin, author details, institution of origin, article type, and article design. The original research articles were further classified into descriptive/epidemiology, mechanism, management, scale/measurement, imaging and medical psychiatry. The citation classics suggest that clinical trials/management, epidemiology and neuroimaging were the most researched areas in the OCD research. These citation classics provide an important insight into the historical developments, like the role of serotonin and caudate in OCD. This approach of citation analysis provides an opportunity to retrieve the classic articles on OCD, and describes the trends in OCD research.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by trinucleotide (GAA) repeat expansion in frataxin (fxn) gene which results in decreased levels of frataxin protein. Insufficient frataxin levels leads to iron and copper deposits in the brain and cardiac cells. A total of hundred and twenty patients, suspected of FRDA were screened for the (GAA) repeats in the fxn gene and only confirmed patients (n=25) were recruited in the study. The total Iron and total copper concentrations were measured in blood plasma using Nitro PAPS and Dibrom PAESA method, respectively both in patients and age, sex matched healthy controls. The iron levels mean +/- SD (6.2 +/- 3.8) in plasma of FRDA patients were found to be significantly decreased as compared to healthy controls mean +/- SD (15.2 +/- 4.2). A similar trend was observed in case of plasma copper levels in FRDA patient (8.15 +/- 4.6) as compared to controls (17.5 +/- 3.40). Present results clearly prove abnormal distribution of extra-cellular iron in FRDA patients, which is in accordance with the well established fact of intracellular iron overload, which is the key feature of the pathogenesis of this disease. This can be of importance in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease in association with frataxin/iron. It appears that intracellular sequestration of trace metals in FRDA patients (due to low frataxin) results in their sub-optimal levels in blood plasma (extra-cellular) an observation that can find prognostic application in clinical trials.

AB  - The advance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has generated countless new challenges in modern healthcare, which in turn has incited an improved attention towards the discovery of the new engineered antimicrobial techniques. This antibiotic resistance is also a major challenge in bone tissue engineering and the ideal means to overcome it is to promote tissue integration prior to bacterial adhesion, thus preventing colonization of certain bacterial species on the implant. The silk fibroin is a favorable biomaterial for bone tissue engineering, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) show antimicrobial activity against a large number of bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, thus combined, these materials are good candidates for development of antibacterial scaffolds. While, silver nanoparticles have been extensively used as an antibacterial, its effect on stem cell differentiation is still not clear. We report here, a silk fibroin based bone tissue engineered scaffold with AgNPs having advanced antimicrobial properties, without compromising its cytocompatibility and stem cell differentiation potential. For this purpose, AgNPs were in situ synthesized using silk fibroin as reducing as well as stabilizing agent. The antimicrobial activity of silk fibroin films with AgNPs was evaluated against gram negative bacteria as well as antibiotic resistant bacteria and it was found to be effective against both. The cytocompatibility of these scaffolds was examined with fibroblast and osteoblast cells. Also, the effect of AgNPs present in films, on osteogenic differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells was studied and it was observed that the presence of AgNPs at lower concentrations did not have any detrimental effect.

AB  - A multidisciplinary team of experts took stock of the current state of affairs about many aspects of aphasia in India, including community burden, diagnostic assessment, therapy, rehabilitation, research, education, and advocacy. The broad spectrum of aphasiology was matched by the types of participants ranging from neurologists, speech-language pathologists, clinical psychologists, linguists, to experts in neuroimaging and computer sciences. Threadbare discussion in 16 sessions over 3 days leads to the identification of pressing problems and possible solutions. Many action plans have been envisaged and recommendations made. A few examples with high priority are community-based and hospital-based study incidence and prevalence of aphasia, development of test batteries for the assessment of many components of speech and communication in Indian languages which are validated on rigorous psychometric, and linguistic criteria, national registry for aphasia, educational modules about aphasia for different target groups, resources for advocacy and its training, a bank of research questions and outlines of research protocols for young professionals to pursue. The expert group will continue to oversee execution of some of the actionable plans in short and long term.

AB  - Emotions affect many aspects of cognition (attention, decision-making, problem solving, conflict resolution, task switching, social cognition, etc.), but the cortical areas or networks through which these effects areachieved are still debatable. In the present study, the effect of emotion on cognition was studied in healthy young individuals (n = 56). Emotions were induced using high-arousing negative, positive, and low-arousing neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Sternberg's verbal working memory task was administered at baseline and after each emotion exposure, while high-density EEG was recorded. Cortical sources were calculated using sLORETA in the 500-ms window (for every 100 ms bin) before the response and were compared with baseline. Though the number of correct responses were comparable, reaction times after emotion exposure reduced significantly. Source analysis revealed significant deactivation of default mode network (DMN) areas as well as early deactivation of decision-making areas during Sternberg's task performed after both the negative and positive emotions. This early deactivation,much before the response was made, when compared with baseline suggests that tasks performed under high-arousing emotional states may help in making decisions earlier or faster. We conclude that the exposure to high-arousing emotional stimuli improves verbal working memory by helping in directing the attentional resources toward the task, thus decreasing the decision-making time and further suppressing the DMN areas.

AB  - Introduction: A large proportion of the population suffers from disturbed sleep and a majority of these present to clinicians with the complaint of insomnia. Many of these people possibly suffer from other primary sleep disorders such as sleep apnea; however, insomnia disorder also remains an extremely common condition directly impacting the quality of life and work efficiency of affected people. While a number of approaches are used for treatment by many clinicians, a much smaller percentage can seek help from specialty sleep clinics. Since very little data are available regarding the effectiveness of treatment offered, this retrospective study aims at examining the outcome of chronic insomnia patients attending to a quaternary care specialty sleep center. Methods: Consecutive patients with the presenting complaint of and diagnosis of insomnia, during a study period of 2 years between 2013 and 2015, were identified and analyzed. Patients were classified based on the comorbidity and types of treatment received. Life stressors were also identified and analyzed. Outcomes were reviewed for those who had follow-up data available. Results: Based on the defined inclusion criteria, 102 patients could be analyzed. Among these, at least 3-month follow-up was available for 48 patients. It was observed that among patients for whom at least 3-month follow-up was available, 91.4% (43/48) showed a good response to treatment with physician-administered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia along with treatment for comorbid conditions. Conclusion: With correct diagnostic classification, as well as appropriate and easily available treatment strategies, excellent treatment outcomes are observed at specialty sleep clinics.

AB  - Purpose: To compare long-term treatment outcomes in epilepsy patients from a single-visit outreach clinic on the Lifeline Express (LLE) with a conventional hospital (AIIMS) based epilepsy clinic in India.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional observational study design, consecutive epilepsy patients from fifteen LLE clinics conducted from 2009 to 2014 were compared to epilepsy patients registered in the same duration at the AIIMS epilepsy clinic. The primary outcome was to determine if patients were still taking AEDs. To determine current AED status, patients from the LLE clinic were contacted telephonically. For the AIIMS patients, hospital records were reviewed and phone calls made to those patients who had not followed-up for more than a year.
   Results: In the 5 years under review, 1923 and 1257 patients had consulted at the LLE and AIIMS clinics respectively. Long-term outcomes were available for analysis in 688 AIIMS and 531 LLE clinic patients. Of the AIIMS patients, 581(87%) were continuing AEDs, 49(7%) had discontinued AEDs after being seizure-free for at least 5 years, 39(6%) had discontinued AEDs without medical advice and 19(2.8%) were dead. Outcomes in 531 LLE patients revealed that 351(72%) continued to be on AEDs, 34(7%) had discontinued AEDs on advice, 106 (22%) had discontinued AEDs without any medical advice and 40 (7.5%) were dead. The treatment gap in the LLE patients was reduced from 49% at first contact to 22% at follow-up 2-8 years later.
   Conclusions: Even single-visit epilepsy clinics may be an effective option for reducing treatment gap in limited-resource regions of the world.

KW  - superficial retinal plexus density
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the superficial retinal vascular plexus density using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in cases of strabismic amblyopia. Methods: Ten eyes of 10 patients with purely strabismic amblyopia underwent detailed ocular evaluation followed by the assessment of the superficial retinal plexus vascular density using OCTA (Topcon DRI OCT Triton, Swept Source OCT, Topcon, Japan). Ten contralateral normal eyes of the same patients were considered as control. All these 20 eyes underwent a 4.5 x 4.5 mm cube scan OCTA centered at the fovea. Using the Topcon propriety software all 20 eyes were assessed for the capillary plexus density of the superficial retinal vascular plexus along the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants centered at the fovea. The numerical values were statistically assessed using a paired t-test with respect to each quadrant between the normal and the pathological eyes. Results: The average age of patients was 16 years and eight patients were males. The mean superficial retinal vascular plexus density along the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants in normal and pathological eyes were 49.25 +/- 30.34 and 48.93 +/- 2.85, 47.22 +/- 4.11 and 47.37 +/- 4.8, 45.54 +/- 1.55 and 43.81 +/- 4.21, and 46.26 +/- 4.63 and 46.38 +/- 5,40, respectively. Similarly, the capillary densities along the central were 17.84 +/- 3.49 and 17.24 +/- 2.44 in normal and pathological eyes. The differences among all these four quadrants and central area were not statistically significant (P-values > 0.05 for all four quadrants and central area) as compared with the normal eyes. Conclusion: The superficial retinal vascular plexus density of a 4.5 x 4.5 mm cube centered at the fovea of eyes of cases of strabismic amblyopia is similar to that of normal eyes.

AB  - Surgical skill enhancement for the residents under training can be performed through various efforts. Here in this report, the authors describe a technique of corneoscleral perforation repair on goat's eye, as the tissue resemblance and the reality of experience while performing crucial steps are similar to human eyes. Beginning from tissue handling, optimal suture placement was taught with an intention to impart quality techniques of traumatic globe injury repair. Therefore, rather than training on expensive artificial eye model, training budding surgeons on goat's eye gives much more realistic tissue handling experiences in the presence of constant challenges almost similar to human eyes.

Several mechanisms and ideas have been put forward to derive a logical conclusion, however, each factor independently does not appear to explain the mechanism in a logical way, therefore, here we elaborate the probable chain of events responsible for this complication. During isolated blunt trauma to the orbital framework, the globe continues to move anteriorly without any active resistance, in contrast to the globe, the optic nerve with more delicate bony and soft tissue relations, likely to remain relatively static. Thus the junction between the optic nerve and ocular coat suffers the maximum distractive injury due to anteroposterior tractional forces. In addition to this, physiological Bell's phenomenon may induce torsional tension at this junction leading to further worsening of distractive forces and violent separation of optic nerve from the globe.

AB  - Background Hemi masticatory spasm (HMS) is a rare movement disorder affecting muscles of mastication attributed to dysfunction of motor branch of trigeminal nerve and is characterized by painful spasm of masticatory muscles. Microvascular compression leading to focal demyelination of motor branch of trigeminal nerve is the most speculated on mechanism of HMS. Treatment options range from medical to surgical approaches, but botulinm toxin (BTX) has now become the preferred treatment. Cases We report a retrospective review of 7 cases of HMS, supported by electrophysiological and clinical findings. All the cases had excellent response to BTX therapy. Discussion and Conclusion In this article, we highlight the delay in diagnosis of HMS attributed to rarity, long course of illness, association with hemiatrophy, "Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus," and scleroderma/morphea. Considering the favorable outcome to BTXs, surgical treatment can be avoided or delayed in majority except secondary cases.

AB  - Organophosphorus (OP) compound poisoning with suicidal intent is common. It is one of the frequent cause for admission to hospital Emergencies and intensive care units in our region. We describe here a case of 19-year old girl who presented to the Emergency Department with atypical features of OP poisoning. She had perioral, tongue and lower limbfasciculations along with generalized muscle weakness with no or minimal muscarinic effects. OP poisoning with isolated nicotinic receptor mediated effect is often reported in children but in adult it is extremely rare. Based on history and clinical suspicion of nicotinic receptor mediated effect of OP, she was given intravenous atropine along with other supportive treatment. Patient got completely recovered from fasciculations and her motor weakness improved after 6 h of atropine therapy. Emergency physician should keep a high index of suspicion of isolated nicotinic and ganglionic mediated effect of OP and a trial of atropine should be given to the patient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Small round cell lesions of the bone encompass a heterogeneous group of tumors and tumor-like lesions, including Ewing sarcoma, small cell osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), "Ewing-like" undifferentiated round cell sarcomas, metastasizing small cell carcinoma, along with plasma cell dyscrasia and Langerhan's cell histiocytosis. At the same time, there are tumor mimics, for example, chronic osteomyelitis, which has overlapping radiologic features with Ewing sarcoma and a primary intraosseous NHL. An exact diagnosis necessitates integration of clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and ancillary test results, including immunohistochemical and molecular results. Currently, there are several immunohistochemical markers and specific molecular signatures, driving most of these tumors, available, for an exact diagnosis. This review focuses on a pragmatic approach towards uncovering specific small round cell lesions of the bone, emphasizing upon integration of traditional morphology with ancillary techniques, including immunohistochemical markers and molecular techniques, the latter, especially in cases of Ewing sarcoma, Ewing-like undifferentiated round cell sarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and neuroblastoma. Subsequent to the diagnostic approach, including an impact on treatment, individual intraosseous round cell lesions have been described in detail. The references include updated articles from PUBMED.

AB  - Context: Patients with hypoparathyroidism are treated with vitamin D and calcium. PTH is an emerging option because of its physiological action. It is important to assess the efficacy and shortcomings of conventional therapy.
   Objective: We assessed the efficacy and safety of alfacalcidol in a large cohort of patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH) and identified a subset who could be treated without oral calcium.
   Design and Setting: Observational study at tertiary care center.
   Subjects and Methods We assessed 92 patients with IH who were receiving alfacalcidol and oral calcium to maintain an optimal serum total calcium level of 8.0 to 8.5 mg/dL during routine follow-up. Patients with suboptimal control were provided free medicines and followed up frequently. Oral calcium and alfacalcidol doses were titrated sequentially to determine the minimum doses for optimal calcium control. Serum phosphate level, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEPh), and hypercalciuria (urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, >0.2) were assessed at each step of titration.
   Results: Only 38% of patients had optimal calcium control during routine follow-up. With good compliance, all achieved optimal serum calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and 43% of patients could stop taking oral calcium. Hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and low FEPh persisted at all stages of therapy. Serum phosphorus levels normalized when the serum calcium level increased to 9.9 mg/dL, but this level of serum total calcium was associated with hypercalciuria in 90% of patients.
   Conclusion: Alfacalcidol is effective in achieving calcemic control in IH. Calcemic control without oral calcium was achieved in 43% of patients receiving alfacalcidol. However, optimal calcium control was associated with hyperphosphatemia and hypercalciuria in most patients.

AB  - Introduction: p38 MAPK signaling molecules plays a dual role in cancer, both progression and suppression. Elevated expression of p38 alpha was reported in lung cancer tissue in rat model. Our objective was to explore the concentration of all 4 isoforms of p38MAPK in serum of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
   Material and methods: The blood samples were collected from 77 NSCLC patients, 52 ethically matched healthy controls and 18 follow up patients were collected as some patients expired and some discontinued the treatment. The concentration of all isoforms of p38 (p38 alpha, p38 beta, p38 gamma, and p38 delta) were evaluated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology.
   Result: The levels of all isoforms of serum p38 were significantly elevated at pre-therapy compare to control. Only p38 alpha expression was significantly associated with tumor stage and its expression reduced after treatment which is then validated by western blot. However, no changes were observed in other isoforms after therapy.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed that, p38 alpha is more efficient among all the isoform to predict the disease accurately and it can be concluded that p38 MAPK may be used as diagnostic as well as prognostic marker of NSCLC disease.
