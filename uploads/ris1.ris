AB  - Stainless steels are considered to be corrosion resistant; however, the performance of the material is affected under long-term or extreme conditions. The development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has opened avenues to enhance a useful life even under extreme environmental conditions. However, the fabrication of HEAs involves multiple-stage (milling, compaction, sintering, and inert environment) manufacturing processes. The present study explores the single-stage process development of a TiNbMoMnFe high-entropy alloy (HEA) coating on 304L stainless steel substrate using a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spray technique. Prior to HVOF coating, the feedstock powders were milled for 5, 10, and 15 h, respectively. The coated surfaces were analyzed for morphology, wettability, microstructure, corrosion resistance, presence of different phases and their distribution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microhardness tester, 3D optical profilometry, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to get different metallurgical and mechanical characteristics. The results indicated that 15-h milled powder-coated substrate exhibited higher corrosion resistance than the other coatings as well as the 304L stainless steel substrate. Chemically stable BCC phase was observed in 15-h milled powder-coated substrates. Moreover, the microhardness, surface roughness, and hydrophobicity of the coated surface were also improved with an increased milling rate. Thus, corrosion resistance of HEA coating can be optimized by a good selection of milling time of powder feedstock.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) considerably increases the risk of short-term mortality in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) but predicting AKI is not possible with existing tools. Our study aimed at de novo discovery of AKI biomarkers in ACLF.
METHODS: This observational study had two phases- (A) Discovery phase in which quantitative proteomics was carried-out with day-of-admission plasma from ACLF patients who initially had no-AKI but either progressed to AKI (n=10) or did not (n=9) within 7 days of admission and, (B) Validation phase in which selected biomarkers from the discovery phase were validated by ELISA in a larger set of ACLF plasma samples (n=93) followed by sub-group analyses.
RESULTS: Plasma proteomics revealed 56 differentially expressed proteins in ACLF patients who progressed to AKI vs those who did not. The metallothionein protein-family was upregulated in patients who progressed to AKI and was validated by ELISA as significantly elevated in both- (i) ACLF-AKI vs no-AKI (p-value ≤ 0.0001) and (ii) progression to AKI vs no-progression to AKI (p-value ≤ 0.001). AUROC for AKI vs no-AKI was 0.786 (p-value ≤0.001) and for progression to AKI vs no-progression to AKI was 0.7888 (p-value ≤0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ACLF patients with plasma MT concentration >5.83 ng/mL had a high probability of developing AKI by day 7 (p-value ≤0.0001). High expression of metallothionein genes was found in post-mortem liver biopsies of ACLF patients.
CONCLUSION: Day-of-admission measurements of plasma metallothionein can act as predictive biomarkers of AKI in ACLF.

AB  - Prostatic malakoplakia (MP) is rare, with only case reports and small series (< five patients) available in the literature. In this study we analysed an international multi-institutional series of 49 patients with prostatic MP to more clearly define its clinicopathological features. The median age was 67 years and the median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.5 ng/ml. MP was clinically manifest in most cases (28 of 45 patients with data available, 62%). Of 43 patients with detailed clinical history available, 21 (49%) had concurrent or metachronous malignancies (including prostate cancer). Diabetes or insulin resistance was present in 11 patients (26%). Additionally, three patients had a history of solid organ transplantation and one had HIV. Of note, six of 34 patients (18%) without concurrent prostate cancer had an abnormal digital rectal examination and/or lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with prostate imaging reporting and data system (PIRADS) scores 4-5. The initial diagnosis was made on core biopsies (25 of 49, 51%), transurethal resection specimens (12 of 49, 24%), radical prostatectomies (10 of 49, 20%), Holmium-laser enucleation (one of 49, 2%) and cystoprostatectomy (one of 49, 2%). Tissue involvement was more commonly diffuse or multifocal (40 of 49, 82%). Von Kossa and periodic acid-Schiff stains were positive in 35 of 38 (92%) and 26 of 27 lesions (96%), respectively. Of note, two cases were received in consultation by the authors with a preliminary diagnosis of mesenchymal tumour/tumour of the specialised prostatic stroma. The present study suggests that prostatic MP is often associated with clinical findings that may mimic those of prostate cancer in a subset of patients. Moreover, MP may be found incidentally in patients with concurrent prostate cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether changes in acute severe colitis (ASC) management have translated to improved outcomes and to develop a simple model predicting steroid non-response on admission.
DESIGN: Outcomes of 131 adult ASC admissions (117 patients) in Oxford, UK between 2015 and 2019 were compared with data from 1992 to 1993. All patients received standard treatment with intravenous corticosteroids and endoscopic disease activity scoring (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)). Steroid non-response was defined as receiving medical rescue therapy or surgery. A predictive model developed in the Oxford cohort was validated in Australia and India (Gold Coast University Hospital 2015-2020, n=110; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 2018-2020, n=62).
RESULTS: In the 2015-2019 Oxford cohort, 15% required colectomy during admission vs 29% in 1992-1993 (p=0.033), while 71 (54%) patients received medical rescue therapy (27% ciclosporin, 27% anti-tumour necrosis factor, compared with 27% ciclosporin in 1992-1993 (p=0.0015). Admission C reactive protein (CRP) (false discovery rate, p=0.00066), albumin (0.0066) and UCEIS scores (0.015) predicted steroid non-response. A four-point model was developed involving CRP of ≥100 mg/L (one point), albumin of ≤25 g/L (one point), and UCEIS score of ≥4 (1 point) or ≥7 (2 points). Patients scoring 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the validation cohorts had steroid response rates of 100, 75.0%, 54.9%, 18.2% and 0%, respectively. Scoring of ≥3 was 84% (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98) predictive of steroid failure (OR 11.9, 95% CI 10.8 to 13.0). Colectomy rates in the validation cohorts were were 8%-11%.
CONCLUSIONS: Emergency colectomy rates for ASC have halved in 25 years to 8%-15% worldwide. Patients who will not respond to corticosteroids are readily identified on admission and may be prioritised for early intensification of therapy.

AB  - Endocrine neoplasms and malignancies are a diverse group of tumors with varied clinical, histopathologic, and functional features. These tumors vary from sporadic to hereditary, isolated entities to multiple neoplastic syndromes, functioning and non functioning tumors, unifocal locally invasive, and advanced to multifocal tumors with disseminated distant metastases. The presence of various specific biomarkers and specific receptor targets serves as valuable tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and management. PET-CT with FDG and a multitude of novel and specific radiotracers towards specific therapeutic targets mandates personalization of their use, so as to ensure maximum clinical benefit in the management of these neoplasms.

AB  - Arsenic has widespread use in agriculture, in alternative medicine and in treatment of certain malignancies, therefore it is vital to timely recognize and treat arsenic toxicity in a suspected patient. Hemodialysis conventionally is thought to play only a supportive role in managing arsenic toxicity but it can be life-saving when chelation is not possible or available. A middle-aged female with a history of non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) was brought to the emergency with altered sensorium. On presentation, she was hemodynamically stable with pallor and exfoliating lesions on palms, hyperkeratotic lesions on soles and hyperpigmented macules on the trunk. Investigations revealed pancytopenia and deranged kidney function tests. In view of skin lesions, the toxicological analysis was sent which revealed high levels of Arsenic (594 and 2,553 mcg/L in blood and urine respectively). Thus, a diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy with the underlying cause being uremic or/and arsenic intoxication was made. Considering renal failure, she was managed with thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Chelation was not possible due to unavailability of agents during lockdown in Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Following dialysis, there was a significant improvement in sensorium, skin lesions, and pancytopenia depicting the utility of hemodialysis in such cases. Thus, hemodialysis is an effective and perhaps underutilized modality in the treatment of arsenic intoxication with impaired renal function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacopa monnieri (BM), a commonly used herb, has shown neuroprotective effects in animal and in vitro studies; but human studies on patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have been inconclusive. Further high-quality trials are required to conclusively state the utility of BM in AD and other neurodegenerative dementias.
METHODS: In the present study, we did a narrative review of the current challenges in designing clinical trials of BM in dementia and their evidence-based recommendations.
RESULTS: Many facets of the BM trials need improvement, especially effect size and sample size estimation. Current assessment and outcomes measures need a more holistic approach and newer scales for diagnosing and monitoring prodromal AD. The stringent guidelines in CONSORT and STROBE are often considered difficult to implement for clinical trials in ayurvedic medications like BM. However, adherence to these guidelines will undoubtedly improve the quality of evidence and go a long way in assessing whether BM is efficacious in treating AD/prodromal AD patients and other neurodegenerative dementias.
CONCLUSION: Future studies on BM should implement more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate sample size of accurately diagnosed AD/prodromal AD patients, administering a recommended dosage of BM and for a pre-specified time calculated to achieve adequate power for the study. Researchers should also develop and validate more sensitive cognitive scales, especially for prodromal AD. BM should be evaluated in accordance with the same rigorous standards as conventional drugs to generate the best quality evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis (HSP) are a group of genetically inherited disorders, clinically and genetically heterogenous and characterized by degeneration of corticospinal tracts, manifesting with progressive spasticity and lower limbs weakness. Most HSPs have an autosomal dominant inheritance. "Ear of the Lynx" sign describes the characteristic abnormality in the forceps minor region of the corpus callosum (CC) on MRI brain. These bear a striking resemblance to the ears of a lynx. This finding has previously been described with hereditary spastic paraparesis 11 and 15, both of which are autosomal recessive HSPs.
CASES: We describe this finding in two siblings with novel mutations causing HSP76, an extremely rare autosomal recessive HSP (less than 50 cases described worldwide), which has not been reported previously.
CONCLUSION: This sign suggests the presence of pathogenic genetic mutations and is likely indicative of autosomal recessive HSPs.

T2  - Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a group of complex and heterogeneous hereditary neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cerebellar ataxia, with ophthalmoplegia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal features, peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron disease, pigmentary retinopathy, epilepsy, and dementia in varying proportions. Cognitive impairment is not frequent in SCAs but is rarely noticed since it gets camouflaged behind the exorbitant ataxic manifestations of the disease. The exact incidence and extent of cognitive impairment in these rare disorders are not known due to the heterogeneity between different SCA types and different modalities of testing employed in different studies. Through our review, we have summarized the cognitive aspects of SCA and can safely conclude that cognitive dysfunction is common in some SCA types when compared to others. Not only is it important to appreciate its presence as a symptom complex in SCA but also is the need to actively search and treat it to improve the patients' quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of getting infected with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and suboptimal preventive practices have been identified as an important risk factor in this regard. This study was done to evaluate the preventive practices being followed by health care workers and identify reasons for suboptimal compliance.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was done in HCWs belonging to various occupational roles and socio-cultural backgrounds across India through online platforms and telephonic interviews from July 30, 2020 to August 30, 2020. A scientifically designed and pre-validated questionnaire with good validity (CVR = 0.87, S-CVI/Av = 0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.85) was used.
RESULTS: The responses of 956 participants were analysed. Various suboptimal practices like touching outer surface of masks, lack of social distancing in cafeteria and duty rooms, inability to wash hands for adequate duration and properly follow steps of hand hygiene, inability to don and doff PPE properly, carrying PPE to duty rooms before completely doffing, use of personal mobile phones during duty and improper sleep were identified. Lack of knowledge, long duty hours, shortage of PPE, high patient workload, and casual attitude regarding own safety were identified as important barriers. Resident doctors and paramedical staff in the age group 18-30 years reported lower adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal compliance in preventive practices like handling PPE, distancing in cafeteria/duty rooms and hand hygiene is not uncommon in HCWs. Certain barriers are identified which should be addressed to ensure adequate safety of HCWs against COVID-19.

AB  - Primary CNS Vasculitis (PCNSV) is a rare inflammatory disorder affecting the blood vessels of the central nervous system. Patients present with a combination of headaches, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. There is usually a diagnostic delay. Treatment is based on observational studies and expert opinion. Our objective was to identify clinical, laboratory, neuroimaging, pathologic or management-related associations with 2 year outcome in patients with primary CNS vasculitis. We conducted a cohort study at a single tertiary care referral centre of prospectively (2018-2019) and retrospectively (2010-2018) identified individuals with primary CNS vasculitis (diagnosis was proven by either brain biopsy or cerebral digital subtraction angiography). Clinical, imaging and histopathologic findings, treatment, and functional outcomes were recorded. Univariate and stepwise multiple logistic regression were applied. P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The main outcome measures were documentation of clinical improvement or worsening (defined by mRS scores) and identification of independent predictors of good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) at 2 years. We enrolled eighty-two biopsy and/or angiographically proven PCNSV cases. The median age at presentation was 34 years with a male predilection and a median diagnostic delay of 23 months. Most patients presented with seizures (70.7%). All patients had haemorrhages on MRI. Histologically lymphocytic subtype was the commonest. Corticosteroids with cyclophosphamide was the commonest medication used. The median mRS at follow-up of 2 years was 2 (0-3), and 65.2% of patients achieved a good functional outcome. Myelitis and longer duration of illness before diagnosis were associated with poorer outcomes. The presence of hemorrhages on SWI sequence of MRI might be a sensitive imaging marker. Treatment with steroids and another immunosuppressant probably reduced relapse rates in our cohort. We have described the third largest PCNSV cohort and multi-centre randomised controlled trials are required to study the relative efficacy of various immunosuppressants.Study registration: CTRI/2018/03/012721.

AU  - Agarwal, Ayush

AU  - Vishnu, Venugopalan Y.
T2  - Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bruns-Garland syndrome (BGS) continues to be a contentious topic even 100 years after its discovery. Its lifelong incidence is 1% amongst diabetic individuals and affects middle aged-elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (usually not poorly controlled).
METHODS: The data presented in this review was collated from studies published on PubMed, MEDLINE and Google Scholar in October 2021. The search words included: "Bruns-Garland syndrome", "diabetic amyotrophy" and "diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy" and "proximal diabetic neuropathy".
RESULTS: The exact pathophysiology is debatable but an ischemic pathology (non-systemic microvasculitis) is most plausible. Its cardinal symptoms include acute onset of severe proximal lower extremity pain followed by weakness and wasting, some sensory loss, weight loss and autonomic symptoms.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis is good as most patients improve to near- normal strength with pain cessation within 18 months of onset.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Two pharmacological possibilities exist for an acute ischemic stroke (AIS): recanalization of the occluded artery and neuroprotection from ischaemic injury, the latter's efficacy being debatable. We sought to determine whether administration of Citicoline immediately after recanalization therapy for AIS would improve clinical and radiological outcome at three months compared to standard treatment alone.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: CAISR was a single centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with blinded endpoint assessment. It was approved by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Institutional ethics committee and registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2018/011900). We recruited participants with AIS undergoing recanalization therapy and randomly assigned them to receive either Citicoline or placebo in 1:1 ratio. Citicoline arm patients received Citicoline 1gm BD intravenously for three days, followed by oral citicoline 1gm BD for 39 days. Placebo arm patients received 100ml intravenous normal saline for three days, followed by multivitamin tablet BD for 39 days. All patients received standard of care.
OUTCOME: Blinded assessors did the follow-up assessment at six weeks (MRI Brain-stroke volume) and three months (NIHSS 0-2, mRS 0-2 and Barthel index> = 95).
RESULTS: The infarct volume decreased from week 1 to week 6 by 2.6 cm3 on placebo versus 4.2 cm3 on Citicoline (p-0.483). The OR for achieving NIHSS 0-2, mRS 0-2 and Barthel index> = 95 with Citicoline was found to be 0.96(95%CI 0.39-2.40), 0.92(95%CI 0.40-2.05) and 0.87(95%CI 0.22-2.98) respectively.
CONCLUSION: CAISR was the first to evaluate the role of Citicoline, when used immediately after recanalization therapy, when the penumbral tissue is the most susceptible either to be protected from injury or become ischemic. We did not find any significant difference between the Citicoline or placebo arms with respect to either our primary or secondary outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Topical fluoride is used for prevention of dental caries. However, its effectiveness and more specifically its formulation and frequency of application in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy are still debatable. The aim of this systematic review was to pool the evidence of effectiveness of various topical fluorides in preventing radiation caries or change in bacterial growth in adult patients of head and neck cancer.
METHODS: Three databases (PubMed and Google Scholar and Cochrane) were searched for randomized controlled or uncontrolled trials or quasi randomised trials published till February 2021. Two independent reviewers screened 346 abstracts finally 14 articles were included in the current systematic review. Primary outcome evaluated was the prevention of radiation caries or change in bacterial growth in saliva. Meta-analysis was performed for the sub groups formed on the basis of fluoride formulations and adjuncts used with it.
RESULTS: Studies included were highly heterogeneous. Majority of studies found different fluoride formulations to be effective in controlling radiation caries to a variable extent up to 70% depending upon the intervention, patient compliance, rate of attrition and follow up period. Sodium fluoride was the most commonly used caries preventive agent. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between sodium fluoride formulations and other fluoride agents. Fluoride treatment when incorporated with re-mineralising agent had no significant effect on caries prevention CONCLUSION: Fluoride prevents radiation caries. However, to delineate its exact formulation, dosage or frequency, there is need for more well conducted randomised controlled trials.

AU  - Ravi, Priyanka
AU  - Purohit, Bharathi
AU  - Priya, Harsh
T2  - Nutrition Reviews
AB  - CONTEXT: Consumption of high-energy food has increased globally, thereby leading to an increase in many diseases. One strategy for addressing this is to make people aware of their energy intake through energy and fat labels. However, the effectiveness of this remains debatable.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to pool the mixed outcomes of recent studies assessing the effect of energy and fat content labeling on food consumption pattern.
DATA SOURCES: Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Randomized controlled and quasi-experimental controlled trials published from 2014 to 2019 were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers screened 413 abstracts independently. Qualitative and quantitative data was extracted from 10 articles; meta-analysis was carried out on 6 of those studies.
RESULTS: The majority of the included papers were conducted in the regions of America, the Western Pacific, and Europe. Overall, the 6 studies claimed that labeling did not reduce the consumption of energy or fat. However, meta-analysis showed that fat and energy content labeling of food had a statistically significant effect on consumption. Subgroup analysis showed no difference with respect to types of labels, ie, context labeling vs traffic-light labeling, but energy content labels seemed to be more effective than fat content labels in influencing healthy food choices.
CONCLUSION: Energy and fat content labeling were shown to reduce the consumption of each significantly. However, the outcome was influenced by the study setting and the population concerned. There is a need for research in other regions in order to assess the global effectiveness of nutrition labels on food consumption.

AB  - Mesenchymal tumors are the most common benign neoplasms of the esophagus. Owing to the rarity of these neoplasms, there is a dearth of literature regarding their diagnosis and management. Our 2-decade-long experience in managing these neoplasms surgically is presented. Relevant clinical data of all patients with esophageal mesenchymal neoplasms (EMNs) managed between January 2000 and May 2020 were retrospectively collected from a prospectively maintained esophageal diseases database in the Department of GI Surgery, AIIMS, New Delhi (India). Special emphasis was given to data pertaining to diagnostic evaluation of patients, type of surgery done (enucleation vs. resection), postoperative outcomes, histopathology and long-term follow-up. Nineteen patients (12 females; age 15-66 years) underwent surgery for EMN (mean tumor size 7.6 cm; enucleation 10; resection 9). On histopathological examination, 17 cases were noted to be benign esophageal leiomyomas and 2 were identified as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. There was no perioperative mortality. All cases were followed up for a median duration of 6 years (range 1-19 years) with no evidence of recurrence in any case. Though EMNs are uncommon, they are mostly benign, and the long-term outcomes after surgical excision are gratifying.

AB  - Petrous endostosis or prominent suprameatal tubercle is a rare entity which may prevent adequate microscopic exposure of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone during microvascular decompression (MVD) for trigeminal neuralgia. We present a rare case of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with petrous endostosis, which was managed adequately by partial removal of the prominent suprameatal tubercle to improve the obscured site of neurovascular conflict and enabled complete MVD. Through this manuscript, we additionally discuss the nuances involved in this extension of the standard retrosigmoid approach in light of the published literature. Petrous endostosis encountered during MVD for TN can impose an operative challenge. Suprameatal extension of the standard retrosigmoid approach improves exposure at the site of neurovascular conflict but requires utmost care and attention to avoid complications. We emphasize recognizing this anatomical variation in the preoperative period to predict an operative difficulty, ensure appropriate patient counselling, and avoiding surgical complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective clinical trial was conducted to assess serum bile acids (BA) levels in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) compared to both pregnant and non-pregnant controls; and evaluate perinatal outcome in relation to bile acid levels. A scoring is proposed based on biochemical markers to optimize management in ICP cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum bile-acids(BA) were assessed in 71 intrahepatic-cholestasis of pregnancy(ICP) cases (group-I), versus 50 pregnant (group-II) and 35 non-pregnant (group-III) controls. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was administered in ICP group. Baseline bilirubin (SB), aminotransferases (AT), alkaline-phosphatase were sent in groups I & II. Investigations were repeated in group-I after 4 weeks. Perinatal complications were noted.
RESULTS: Mean BA in group-I was 75.92 ± 39.9 µmol/L which reduced to 41.3 ± 15.4 µmol/L(45.6%, p < 0.001) with UDCA. Mean BA was 29.2 ± 5.7 and 5.9 ± 1.8 µmol/L in group-II and group-III. UDCA significantly reduced itching-score. Rate of fetal distress linearly increased with the increasing baseline levels of serum BA, AT and SB: from 2.5 to 100% at BA < 40 and ≥ 200 µmol/L, (p = 0.008); from 16.1 to 100% at AT < 100 and ≥ 500 IU/mL(p = 0.016); and from 6.8 to 100% at SB < 0.8 and > 5 mg/dL (p = 0.001); respectively. Their baseline levels were divided into 5 groups in correlation to fetal distress. Serum BA < 40, 40-80, 80-120, 120-200, ≥ 200 µmol/L; AT < 100,100-200,200-500, ≥ 500 IU/mL; and SB < 0.8, 0.8-1.0, 1.1-2, 2.1-5 and > 5 mg/dL. Nutan ICP scoring was proposed with a score 0 to 4 given to each parameter and score-based management protocol was suggested for fetal surveillance and delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: SBA are higher in Asian Indian pregnant women. Levels > 30 µmol/L can be taken as a cut off for diagnosing ICP in Asian-Indian women. Adopting higher cut-offs for this geographic part will avoid over-diagnosing ICP and iatrogenic early termination of pregnancy. Suggested scoring will help clinicians in optimizing the time of delivery on an individualized basis.

AB  - Purpose.Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS) is clinically challenging because of surrounding critical structures. We generated and compared the forward plan (FP), inverse plan (IP), and hybrid plan (HP) for the optimal planning strategy in Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS) for vestibular schwannoma tumors (VS).Methods and materials. In this study, 51 planning scenarios of 17 patients with VS were planned for GKSRS using FP, IP, and HP in Leksell Gamma plan (LGP10.1) using the TMR10 algorithm. The planning images were obtained using the following MRI (GE, USA) scan parameters: T1W images-MPRAGE sequence, FOV-256 mm × 256 mm, matrix size-512 mm × 512 mm, and the slice thickness 1 mm. The total dose was prescribed12Gy and normalized at 50% isodose level.Results and discussion. The plan parameters were compared dosimetrically by maintaining FP as a base plan. The statistical analysis, including one-factor, repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni correction tests, were performed. The p-value for planning parameters such as brainstem dose, beam ON time, and gradient index significantly favored HP.Conclusion. Overall results show that HP is an efficient method for GKSRS of VS The p-value was less than 0.001 and statistically significant for various plan indices.

AB  - PURPOSE: To correlate histopathological changes of trabecular meshwork (TM) with clinical features in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG).
METHODS: This was a prospective interventional study including 66 eyes of 39 PCG children aged ≤12 months at diagnosis. Corneal clarity, corneal diameter (CD), intraocular pressure (IOP) and cup disc ratio (C:D ratio) were assessed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. The trabecular meshwork (TM) specimens obtained during primary combined trabeculectomy and trabeculotomy augmented with Mitomycin-C were evaluated on light microscopy to look for eosinophilic membrane (EM), status of trabecular beams and trabecular endothelial cells (TEC), presence of intervening spaces, TM thickness and TEC count which were then correlated with clinical features.
RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, IOP reduced from 27.96±10.2 to 11.88±5.63 mm Hg, p<0.001, C:D ratio decreased from 0.65±0.34 to 0.49±0.06, p=0.036, and the bleb had a significant tendency to change from well formed (59-46) to flat type (3-6) or thin, cystic type (4-14) (p=0.014). Presence of EM on the cameral surface was associated with a lower baseline IOP. Fused trabecular beams were associated with higher baseline IOP. The TM was significantly thicker in eyes with IOP >20 mm Hg at presentation (1.86±0.7 mm vs 1.3±0.47 mm, p=0.0356). Eyes with IOP ≤14 mm Hg at final follow-up had lower TEC count than eyes with IOP >14 mm Hg (0.92±0.45 cells/mm2 vs 1.00±0.74 cells/mm2, p=0.0028).
CONCLUSION: A light microscopic analysis of surgical specimens may guide prognosis of PCG. However, larger studies are required to validate these results.

T2  - Indian Journal of Ophthalmology
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (i-OCT) in donor grading, selection, and preparation during different types of keratoplasty.
METHODS: Seventy-one consecutive donor corneas collected over 6 months, after clinical grading, were observed by an experienced corneal surgeon under an i-OCT equipped microscope. The donor preparation (manual/automated) for different types of keratoplasty procedures was also undertaken under i-OCT.
RESULTS: The mean central corneal thickness of optical and nonoptical grade tissues was 533 ± 19 and 662 ± 52 μm, respectively. The i-OCT-based grading matched with clinical grading in 98.5% cases. Irregular thickness, anterior stromal hyperreflectivity, and previous scars were appreciated in 1.4, 1.4, and 7.04% donors, respectively. During Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty, i-OCT facilitated selection of appropriate microkeratome head for automated donor preparation in all cases, besides allowing manual dissection of partially dissected lenticule, identification of site of inadvertent perforation, and eccentric trephination in one case each. During Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty, i-OCT-based assessment of preexisting scar (five cases) guided careful tissue selection (2/5) and preparation. During predescemetic endothelial keratoplasty, precise needle advancement allowed successful type-1 bubble formation in all cases. All manually punched donors demonstrated an extra endothelial ledge, while those with automated preparation showed tapering donor margins.
CONCLUSION: i-OCT might serve as a useful imaging tool for objective assessment of donor characteristics. The modality may complement clinical evaluation for donor grading, selection, and preparation.

TI  - The impact of surgical delay on resectability of colorectal cancer: An international prospective cohort study
AU  - COVIDSurg Collaborative
T2  - Colorectal Disease: The Official Journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland
AB  - AIM: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to explore the impact of surgical delays on cancer resectability. This study aimed to compare resectability for colorectal cancer patients undergoing delayed versus non-delayed surgery.
METHODS: This was an international prospective cohort study of consecutive colorectal cancer patients with a decision for curative surgery (January-April 2020). Surgical delay was defined as an operation taking place more than 4 weeks after treatment decision, in a patient who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy. A subgroup analysis explored the effects of delay in elective patients only. The impact of longer delays was explored in a sensitivity analysis. The primary outcome was complete resection, defined as curative resection with an R0 margin.
RESULTS: Overall, 5453 patients from 304 hospitals in 47 countries were included, of whom 6.6% (358/5453) did not receive their planned operation. Of the 4304 operated patients without neoadjuvant therapy, 40.5% (1744/4304) were delayed beyond 4 weeks. Delayed patients were more likely to be older, men, more comorbid, have higher body mass index and have rectal cancer and early stage disease. Delayed patients had higher unadjusted rates of complete resection (93.7% vs. 91.9%, P = 0.032) and lower rates of emergency surgery (4.5% vs. 22.5%, P < 0.001). After adjustment, delay was not associated with a lower rate of complete resection (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.90-1.55, P = 0.224), which was consistent in elective patients only (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69-1.27, P = 0.672). Longer delays were not associated with poorer outcomes.
CONCLUSION: One in 15 colorectal cancer patients did not receive their planned operation during the first wave of COVID-19. Surgical delay did not appear to compromise resectability, raising the hypothesis that any reduction in long-term survival attributable to delays is likely to be due to micro-metastatic disease.

AB  - Introduction: Major bile duct injury in laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in morbidity and needs further management, which adds to the increased cost of treatment. However, some studies have shown that by defining critical view of safety and seeing the relationship of Rouviere's sulcus with other structures, and minimal use of diathermy in Calot's triangle, we can bring down complications further close to zero percent. We wanted to see that such a low bile duct injury rate is achievable at every center by routinely following these steps. We retrospectively reviewed the database of patients who had undergone elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in three years and evaluated the rate of bile duct injury and other complications.Methods: We reviewed our database for patients and did a retrospective analysis on patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic cholelithiasis or chronic cholecystitis, and have undergone LC in our centre from January 2017 to December 2019. Patients less than 15 years of age, acute cholecystitis, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy combined with common bile duct exploration were excluded. We calculated the incidence of biliary injury. The secondary outcomes looked at were Veress needle or pneumoperitoneum-related complications, port site bleeding, intra-abdominal bleeding, bowel injury, liver injury, wound infection, and early port site hernia.Results: LC was performed in 642 patients. In this study, there was no bile duct injury. Two patients (0.31%) had minor bile leak which resolved without any intervention within a week. Three (0.46%) patients developed port site infection, which responded to regular dressing and oral antibiotic therapy.Conclusion: The effectiveness of these steps should make their use mandatory in every center to reduce bile duct injury.

AB  - An accidentally retained sponge inside the body of a patient (gossypiboma) is a rare and serious adverse event after a surgical procedure with serious medicolegal implications and complications. It is commonly associated with abdominal surgeries with cholecystectomy most commonly implicated. Whorl-like appearance or mottled translucencies and radiopaque marker on imaging is diagnostic. Transmural migration into a hollow viscous has been infrequently reported. The preferred approach for the removal of gossypiboma is surgery. However, in cases of complete transmural migration, endoscopic removal remains a viable option.

AB  - PE and GDM are two major metabolic diseases affecting pregnancy. Individuals suffering from GDM are at an increased risk of developing PE in later gestational stages. Current study was done to evaluate first trimester serum and urine metabolome using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify metabolites and pathways differentially regulated in both diseases. Serum metabolomics analysis revealed deregulation in larger group of metabolites and pathways as compared to urine between PE/GDM and NT groups. Few metabolites showed altered expression in both aliments. Perturbed metabolites have association with energy metabolism, protein metabolism, insulin sensitivity, gut microbiome and maintenance of redox balance. Deregulation in these metabolic pathways contributes to the pathology of GDM/PE. Our study revealed that serum metabolomic profile of PE and GDM shows overlap in 1st trimester of gestation. It also explored the potential of NMR metabolomics in identification of common biomolecules that could be developed into a clinical tool for early detection of both PE /GDM. .

AB  - Multiphasic multidetector computed tomography (CT) forms the mainstay for the characterization of renal masses whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acts as a problem-solving tool in some cases. However, a few of the renal masses remain indeterminate even after evaluation by conventional imaging methods. To overcome the deficiency in current imaging techniques, advanced imaging methods have been devised and are being tested. This review will cover the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, shear wave elastography, dual-energy CT, perfusion CT, MR perfusion, diffusion-weighted MRI, blood oxygen level-dependent MRI, MR spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET)/prostate-specific membrane antigen-PET in the characterization of renal masses.

AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an extension and an enhanced form of ultrasound that allows real-time evaluation of the various structures in different vascular phases. The last decade has witnessed a widespread expansion of CEUS applications beyond the liver. It has shown fair potential in kidneys and its diagnostic  efficacy is comparable to CT and MRI. Ultrasound is the well-accepted screening modality for renal pathologies, however, it underperforms in the characterization of the renal masses. CEUS can be beneficial in such cases as it can help in the characterization of such incidental masses in the same sitting. It has an excellent safety profile with no risk of radiation or contract-related nephropathy. It can aid in the correct categorization of renal cysts into one of the Bosniak classes and has proven its worth especially in complex cysts or indeterminate renal masses (especially Bosniak Category IIF and III). Few studies also describe its potential role in solid masses and in differentiating benign from malignant masses. Other areas of interest include infections, infarctions, trauma, follow-up of local ablative procedures, and VUR. Through this review, the readers shall get an insight into the various applications of CEUS in kidneys, with imaging examples.

AB  - This retrospective study was aimed to understand the clinical, laboratory, radiological parameters and the outcome of COVID-19 patients with underlying haematological disease. All patients with known haematological disease admitted with COVID-19-positive status from April to August 2020 in the COVID-19 facility of a tertiary care centre in north India, were included. Their medical records were analyzed for outcome and mortality risk factors. Fifty four patients, 37 males, were included in the study. Of these, 36 patients had haematological malignancy and 18 had benign disorder. Fever (95.5%), cough (59.2%) and dyspnoea (31.4%) were the most common symptoms. Nine patients had severe disease at diagnosis, mostly malignant disorders. Overall mortality rate was 37.0 per cent, with high mortality seen in patients with aplastic anaemia (50.0%), acute myeloid (46.7%) and lymphoblastic leukaemia (40.0%). On univariate analysis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2 [odd ratio (OR) 11.6], COVID-19 severity (OR 8.2), dyspnoea (OR 5.7) and blood product transfusion (OR 6.4) were the predictors of mortality. However, the presence of moderate or severe COVID-19 (OR 16.6, confidence interval 3.8-72.8) was found significant on multivariate analysis. The results showed that patients with haematological malignancies and aplastic anaemia might be at increased risk of getting severe COVID-19 infection and mortality as compared to the general population.

AB  - The study was designed to review the demographic, clinical, and pathologic characteristics of follicular helper T cells (TFH)-derived nodal PTCL in India including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with follicular helper T cell phenotype (P-TFH), and follicular T-cell lymphoma with additional immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RHOAG17V mutational analysis, as well as their impact on survival. This retrospective study included 88 cases of PTCL that were reclassified using IHC for TFH markers (PD1, ICOS, BCL6, and CD10) and dendritic-meshwork markers (CD21, CD23). Cases of TFH cell origin were evaluated for RHOAG17V mutation using Sanger sequencing and amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (validated using cloning and quantitative PCR) with detailed clinicopathologic correlation. Extensive re-evaluation with added IHC panel resulted in a total of 19 cases being reclassified, and the final subtypes were AITL (37 cases, 42%), PTCL-not otherwise specified (44, 50%), P-TFH (6, 7%), and follicular T-cell lymphoma (1, 1%). The presence of at least 2 TFH markers (>20% immunopositivity) determined the TFH origin. AITL patients tended to be male and showed increased presence of B-symptoms and hepatosplenomegaly. Histomorphology revealed that 92% of AITL cases had pattern 3 involvement. Sanger sequencing with conventional PCR did not yield any mutation, while RHOAG17V was detected by amplification-refractory mutation system-PCR in AITL (51%, P =0.027) and P-TFH (17%), which was validated with cloning followed by sequencing. Cases of RHOAG17V-mutant AITL had a worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status initially but fared better in terms of overall outcome ( P =0.029). Although not specific for AITL, RHOAG17V mutation shows an association with diagnosis and requires sensitive methods for detection due to low-tumor burden. The mutant status of AITL could have prognostic implications and translational relevance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cancer-associated thrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in malignancy patients. Prophylactic anticoagulation is under-utilized and the cost of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and direct oral anticoagulants is a major barrier in developing countries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of all cancer-associated thrombosis patients attending the thrombosis clinic at a tertiary-level referral hospital based in North India between 2011 and 2015. Patient demographics and disease-related parameters were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 771 patients attended the thrombosis clinic during study period, of which 64 cases were malignancy-associated. Of these, 56% of the patients were female and 20% were bedridden. The median age was 48.5 years, adenocarcinoma (48%) being the most common histological subtype. Gynecological malignancies (30%) were the most common malignancies, followed by genitourinary (11%) malignancies. Most of the cases occurred during first year of diagnosis (51%), and only 14% occurred after 3 years. Most of the patients were on combined treatment. Almost 40% of the patients developed thrombosis within 30 days of surgical treatment. Lower limb thrombosis was the most commonly seen type (56%), while abdominal and pulmonary thrombosis were both seen in 5%. Patients were managed with LMWH and vitamin K antagonists (84.3%) and only 6.25% with LMWH alone. Direct oral anticoagulants were not commonly used during the study period.
DISCUSSION: At the hospital studied, most of the cases occurred early in the disease course. Postoperative prophylaxis could have contributed towards reducing thrombosis in the peri-operative period. Early suspicion and prompt treatment can improve quality of life in such patients.

AB  - Introduction: 
          South Asia has noted an increasing prevalence of obesity and employment of bariatric surgery (BS) procedures. Prior studies have shown improvement in memory, executive function and attention, after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) operation in the Western population. However, there is a scarcity of data on cognitive improvement following BS in a non-Western population.
          Objective: 
          The objective of the study is to evaluate changes in cognitive functions of patients with severe obesity, after BS.
          Study Setting: 
          Tertiary-care Academic Center, India.
          Methodology: 
          A prospective study of patients undergoing BS was conducted. Specific neurocognitive tests (Mini-mental Status Examination, Standard progressive matrices, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, and Post Graduate Institute Memory Scale test) were used to assess cognitive status at baseline (preoperatively), and at 3, 6, and 12 months.
          Results: 
          Fifty-three patients were enrolled in the study, out of which 50 had completed 1 year of follow-up at the time of analysis (n = 50). Thirty-six patients (72%) were females. The median age was 42 years, and the mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 45.5 ± 6.3 kg/m2. 40 patients underwent SG, while 10 underwent RYGB procedure. At baseline, the study cohort had impairment of abstract reasoning, attention, and verbal retention, as compared to normative data. At 1 year after surgery, the mean BMI was 29.1 ± 2.6 kg/m2. There was a significant (P < 0.05) improvement in most cognitive domains (global cognitive functioning, abstract reasoning, attention/concentration, and memory function). However, improvement in language function was not found to be significant across the follow-up duration of 12 months (P = 0.35).
          Conclusions: 
          Individuals with severe obesity experience baseline impairment in cognitive functions. Similar to results from the Western population, BS (RYGB and SG) results in a significant improvement in multiple cognitive domains even in a non-Western population.

AB  - Man and environment have a strong connection with each other for their functioning. Environmental toxins which can be natural or manmade result in the loss of this balance by causing systemic inflammatory response within the human body, with the brain being the most affected target end-organ. These problems are more prominent in Third World countries, where environmental regulations laws are either relaxed or non-existent. These neurotoxins play a very important aetiological role in the manifestation of various neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric disorders. Environmental neurotoxicity results from inhibition of mitochondrial activity, excess oxidative stress leading to neuroinflammation, and promoting apoptosis and neuronal cell death. Having the know-how of these neurotoxins will provide insight into the process of neurodegeneration and will result in further designing of studies to delve into processes and mechanisms of neuronal regeneration and axonal sprouting. This review highlights the various central nervous system disorders associated with exposure to environmental neurotoxins and discusses the way forward to prevent or halt the process of neurodegeneration.

AB  - From the context of organ donation, COVID-19 vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is important as there is an ethical dilemma in utilizing versus discarding organs from potential donors succumbing to VITT. This consensus statement is an attempt by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) apex technical committees India to formulate the guidelines for deceased organ donation and transplantation in relation to VITT to help in appropriate decision making. VITT is a rare entity, but a meticulous approach should be taken by the Organ Procurement Organization's (OPO) team in screening such cases. All such cases must be strictly notified to the national authorities like NOTTO, as a resource for data collection and ensuring compliance withprotocols in the management of adverse events following immunization. Organs from any patient who developed thrombotic events up to 4 weeks after adenoviral vector-based vaccination should be linked to VITT and investigated appropriately. The viability of the organs must be thoroughly checked by the OPO, and the final decision in relation to organ use should be decided by the expert committee of the OPO team consisting of a virologist, a hematologist, and atreating team. Considering the organ shortage, in case of suspected/confirmed VITT, both clinicians and patients should consider the risk-benefit equationbased on available experience, and an appropriate written informed consent of potential recipients and family members should be obtained before transplantation of organs from suspected or proven VITT donors.

AB  - Purpose/aim of the study: Purpose/aim of the study:Central nervous system (CNS), skull, and vertebral metastases from anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are an exceedingly rare entity. We report the first case of multiple vertebral metastases from a primary anal SCC with the aim of define a target therapeutic strategy.Case presentation: We present the case of a 68-year-old male admitted to our hospital for acute exacerbation chronic low back pain and left L2 radiculopathy. His medical history included the diagnosis of a human papilloma virus related, moderately differentiated anal SCC (cT3N0M0-stage IIB), treated with standard chemoradiotherapy regimen two years earlier. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed an isolated solid lesion of the L2 vertebral body. After the surgical removal, histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of moderately differentiated SCC. At 1-month radiological follow-up, two new lesions at the level of T7 to T11 were identified. Additional chemotherapy and radiotherapy for metastatic localization of L2, T7, and T11 were administered. Two-year follow-up demonstrated a radiologically and clinically well-controlled disease. To supplement our case, a systematic literature review on the CNS, skull, and vertebral metastases and their treatments has been performed.Conclusion: Despite several proposed guidelines for the management of vertebral metastases, at present, a universally accepted treatment strategy for vertebral metastases from anal SCC has not been defined. Based on our clinical experience and literature review, in case of vertebral metastases from anal SCC, a prompt and aggressive, local and systemic, and multimodal treatment of the vertebral lesions may be paramount to improve the patient outcomes.

AB  - Nearly 2.4 billion people globally (one-third of the world's population) use solid biomass fuels as their primary energy source for cooking which is a major cause of household air pollution. According to sustainable development goal 7, women primarily responsible for household cooking bear a significant health burden by using solid biomass-based stoves that often does not meet emission targets. As an imperative source of total suspended particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds, biomass fumes exposure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Long-term use of solid fuel in household cooking may lead to epigenetic reprogramming, including changes in the expression patterns of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) intimately linked to increased breast cancer (BC) risk. Currently, no specific non-invasive epigenetic markers are available to diagnose BC at an early stage. Cell-free circulating epigenomic signatures such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs regulate intrinsic molecular signaling pathways in breast cancer. Therefore, it is indispensable to assess the feasibility of establishing miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs as combinatorial triad biomarkers for the early risk assessment and effective management of breast cancer in vulnerable populations. Here, we critically examined various facets entailed in miRNAs-lncRNAs-mRNAs deregulation that might enhance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer risk associated with biomass fumes exposure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with perinatal hypoxia (PH) and drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) often have bilateral parieto-occipital gliosis. Surgical management of such patients is a dilemma.
OBJECTIVE: To identify preoperative determinants for unilateral disconnection vs callosotomy, and analyze the surgical outcome in such patients.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with DRE and history of PH, with MRI abnormalities restricted to bilateral posterior quadrants. Preoperative semiology, epilepsy duration and seizure frequency were recorded. Based on the concordance between the results of non-invasive tests, patients underwent either posterior quadrant disconnection (PQD) or corpus callosotomy (CC). Preoperative variables were analyzed and corelated to the postoperative seizure freedom.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients were identified, 6 underwent PQD and 8 underwent CC. At follow up of 39.17 ± 23.75 months, 66.66% of patients (4/6) in the PQD subgroup had an ILAE Class I outcome. While none in the CC group attained seizure freedom, 87.5% (7/8) had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency (follow up: 42 ± 27.31 months). Patients with a poor outcome had significantly greater seizure frequency (P = 0.05) and history of drop attacks (P = 0.04) in both the groups. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) accurately localized the epileptogenic zone in all of the patients with good outcome (P = 0.015). Concordance with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was also a predictor of favorable outcome (P = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: A history of drop attacks with high seizure frequency is associated with poor postoperative seizure outcome. Unilateral PQD is feasible and leads to superior seizure-free outcomes, even in cases with widespread and bilateral imaging and electrical abnormalities, provided the other preoperative investigations are concordant in localizing the epileptogenic zone.

AB  - There is a plethora of papers on the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in various benign and malignant intracranial tumors, and it is possible to overlook the most important and landmark studies. Thus, the necessity of citation analysis arises, which reviews the most cited articles and recognizes the impact made by these articles. Utilizing the 100 most cited articles describing the use of SRS for intracranial and spinal pathologies, this article aims to provide meaningful information regarding the historical trends and recent directions in which this field is headed. We performed a search of the Web of Science database using the keywords "stereotactic radiosurgery," "gamma knife," "GKRS," "gamma knife radiosurgery," "LINAC," and "Cyberknife" on May 14, 2022. Our search retrieved a total of 30,652 articles published between the years 1968 and 2017. The top 100 cited articles were arranged in descending order based on citation count (CC) and citation per year (CY). The journal with the largest number of publications as well as citation count was the International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics (n = 33), followed by Journal of Neurosurgery (n = 25). The most cited article was authored by Andrews, which was published in 2004 in The Lancet (1699 CC, 89.42 CY). Flickinger, with 25 papers and 7635 total citations, was the author with the highest impact. Lunsford, with 25 publications and total citations of 7615, was a close second. The USA was the leading country with the maximum number of total citations (n = 23,054). Ninety-two articles described the use of SRS for intracranial pathologies (metastases, n = 38; AVM, n = 16; vestibular schwannoma, n = 9; meningioma, n = 8; trigeminal neuralgia, n = 6; sellar lesion, n = 2; glioma, n = 2; functional, n = 1; and procedure related, n = 10). Eight studies describing spinal radiosurgery were included, out of which four were on spinal metastases. Citation analyses of the top 100 articles revealed that the focus of research in the field of SRS started with functional neurosurgery and progressed to benign intracranial tumors and AVMs. More recently, central nervous system (CNS) metastases have received the maximum attention with 38 articles, including 14 randomized controlled trials finding a place in the top 100 cited articles. Presently, the use of SRS is concentrated in developed countries. Efforts need to be made for more widespread use in developing nations to bring the maximum possible benefits of this focused noninvasive treatment to a wider population.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several supraglottic airway devices (SGD) are available nowadays. But none has been found to be better than Proseal laryngeal mask (PLMA) in terms of oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP). We aimed to compare OLP of newly introduced Baska® Mask with PLMA in patients undergoing elective surgical procedures under general anesthesia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Totally, 80 consecutive adult patients of either sex requiring general anesthesia were randomized into two groups Group B (Baska mask, n = 40) or Group P (PLMA. n = 40). After standardized induction with propofol 2 - 2.5 mg/kg-1 and fentanyl 2 mgkg-1, and muscle relaxation with vecuronium 0.1 mgkg-1 one of the two devices was placed. OLP (primary outcome) was measured 5 minutes and 30 minutes post induction. The time needed to achieve effective airway, anatomical alignment of the device, number of attempts, leak fraction, and postoperative laryngopharyngeal morbidity were noted.
RESULTS: Both the devices could be inserted in first attempt in all the patients, but the time needed to achieve effective airway was significantly less in Group B (12.58 ± 1.81 sec vs 17.92 ± 2.45 sec, P < 0.001). The mean OLP was better in Group B at 5 min (37.6 ± 2.43 cm H2O vs 30.82 ± 3.96 cm H2O) and at 30 min (38.83 ± 1.72 cm H2O vs 30.82 ± 3.96 cm H2O; P < 0.001). Anatomical alignment of SGD with glottis (FOB grade 3 or 4 view) was significantly better in group B (34/40) as compared to group P (25/40) (p = 0.009). There was no difference in laryngopharyngeal morbidity in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Baska mask provided higher OLP, better alignment to the glottis and faster placement time as compared to PLMA.

AB  - Neuroendocrine neoplasms are derived from the epithelial lineages mainly of respiratory tract, with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation. There are only a handful of documented cases of paranasal small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SNEC) with primary orbital involvement. Here, the authors describe a 33-year-old male patient with rapidly progressive swelling of the right lower lid with proptosis since 4 weeks. On contrast-MRI orbit, an ill-defined multilobulated mass measuring 3.6 × 3.1 cm with intense homogenous enhancement was seen in the right retrobulbar space involving the right ethmoid sinus. On incisional biopsy, a poorly differentiated mass containing numerous small round blue cells and scanty intervening stroma with prominent necrosis and apoptosis was seen. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for synaptophysin. He was diagnosed as a case of SNEC and received chemotherapy, with good response till date of 9 months of follow up. The authors present a literature review and describe challenges in management of a primary orbital SNEC.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder triggered by abnormal CAG repeat expansion at locus 5q32. MRI recognises dissimilarities in affected areas of SCA12 patients and healthy subjects. But manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to subjective errors. This has motivated us in developing a systematic and authentic decision model for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of SCA12. Four different feature extraction techniques are examined in this research work, such as First Order Statistics, GLRLM, GLCM, and GLGCM, to obtain distinguishable characteristics for differentiating SCA12 patients from healthy subjects. The model's performance is measured using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F1-score with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Our experimental results show that features based on the GLRLM can distinguish SCA12 from healthy subjects with a maximum classification accuracy of 85% among all the different function extraction techniques used.

AB  - Fungal infections of the orbit are infrequent. They typically affect immunocompromised individuals but, in some instances, can also affect an immunocompetent person. They mimic much orbital pathology clinically. Ours is a series of three patients eventually diagnosed with orbital aspergillosis but who, initially, were thought to have some other pathology.

AB  - Objectives There is a need to develop reference interval of NO in health and disease. Methods Subjects aged between 25 and 55 years were drawn from a random sample of the north Indian population, based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Measurement of NO was done based on principle of greiss reaction. Results Reference interval of NO in healthy individual of age group 25–55 years was 21 ± 13.3 μM/L (n=350), Premenopausal women of age group 25–35 years was 12.7 ± 4.9 μM/L (n=180), Postmenopausal women of age group 40–55 years was 10.3 ± 3.84 μM/L (n=100) and healthy pregnant females of age group 25–35 years was 70.9 ± 15.95 μM/L (n=330). In pathological state group, reference interval of NO in metabolic syndrome cases of age group 25–55 years was 19.4 ± 15.3 μM/L (n=100), coronary artery disease patient of age group more than 35 years was 17.6 ± 10.8 μM/L (n=160), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) of age group 25–30 years was 45.7 ± 7.2 μM/L (n=330), pre-eclampsia patient of age group 25–35 years was 39.8 ± 14.7 μM/L (n=200) and diabetic individuals of age group of more than 30 years was 15.5 ± 1.4 μM/L (n=50). Conclusions The reference intervals presented may be used for various research purposes. Based upon our study, reference interval for NO levels of various disease states like MetS, CAD, diabetes, PIH showed lower levels of NO compared to their respective healthy group due to shared etiopathologies with decreased NO levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is the ability to recognize mental disorders, along with knowledge of professional help available, effective self-help strategies, skills to give support to others, and knowledge of how to prevent mental disorders. Adequate MHL is linked to better health-seeking behavior and management of mental illness.
AIM: To assess the MHL related to depression and anxiety among adolescents of age 15 to 19 years residing in Delhi.
METHODS: A survey was conducted among adolescents in southeast Delhi. MHL was assessed using sex-matched vignettes of Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) like depression and anxiety. MHL was assessed under domains of identifications of disorders, help-seeking behavior, knowledge about prevention, and stigmatizing attitude toward the respective illness. Statistical analysis was done in STATA and percentage of participants with adequate MHL in various domains was calculated, and difference between various groups was examined using chi-square test.
RESULTS: A total of 491 adolescents participated (response rate of 87.2%) of whom a 50.3% were girls and 57.8% were 15 to 17 years of age. Only 50 (10.2%) participants identified depression vignette as that of depression and 51 (10.4%) identified vignette of anxiety disorder as the same. No statistically significant gender differential in MHL was seen (p value = .8). The stigmatizing attitude, assessed by asking a series of questions suggesting stigma toward the particular illness, was observed among almost all participants (depression -99.4%, and anxiety disorders -96.1%). 18.3% and 18.7% of participants reported correct knowledge about the prevention of depression and anxiety respectively. Four hundred and twenty-two (86%) identified the need to seek help for symptoms reported in vignettes. Of these, 234 (55%) preferred parents, and 62 (14.7%) look after friends for any help.
CONCLUSION: Adolescents residing in Delhi reported poor MHL for Common Mental Disorders. High stigma and poor help-seeking behavior was also observed among the participants toward CMDs.

AB  - Human Kinesin Family Member 5A (KIF5A) gene mutations have been identified as a putative genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Disease modelling using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) is the next-generation approach to studying numerous human diseases. For the current investigation, we report the generation of patient-specific KIF5A iPSC lines with a mutation at the splice site mutation (c.3020 + 3 A > T) in the intronic region. The resulting line displayed markers for pluripotency, a healthy karyotype, the ability to differentiate into three germ layers in vitro, vector clearance, the KIF5A mutation, STR-based genomic identity, and contamination-free culture.

The paper attempts to identify the bottlenecks of the IFA supply chain in key areas of supply chain i.e., forecasting, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, transportation, distribution, logistic information system and suggests a plan of action aimed at ensuring uninterrupted supplies to the end beneficiaries.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The data source for the present paper is the nationwide IFA Supply Chain Assessment (2018-19) conducted across 29 Indian states with a total of 58 districts, 116 blocks, 232 Sub-Centres, 232 Anganwadi centres and 232 schools covered under the assessment as a multi-partner collaborative initiative. Field insights from supply chain strengthening interventions under different public health programs in India and other developing countries were taken to arrive at corrective actions and recommendations. Findings were disseminated to government and an action plan was suggested for connecting service delivery points through an app-based system, developing a micro plan for ensuring fixed distribution schedule, followed by continuous monitoring and review meetings identified for follow up.
FINDINGS: The average lead time across states was 35 weeks with top three performing states being Goa, Sikkim, and Telangana. The average per unit cost of procurement was Rs 0.35 for IFA Red, Rs 0.25 for IFA Blue, Rs 0.31 for IFA Pink and Rs 7.30 for IFA syrup. Out of the 704 districts in India, only 213 has IFA Red, only 140 had IFA Blue, 152 had IFA Pink and 163 had IFA Syrup available in four quarters of 2018-19. The key issues identified in the assessment were-a lack of standardized forecasting process, absence of inventory management techniques, no fixed distribution schedule, inadequate availability of transport vehicles and an absence of an integrated MIS.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The identification of bottlenecks in the IFA supply chain and its impact on the performance of the supply chain would provide policy guidelines for the government as well as development partner agencies to design an effective and efficient supply chain. It would also enable the policy planners to understand the challenges associated with managing different components of a supply chain, their interrelation and impact on the overall performance of the supply chain. The suggested recommendations would equip program managers with the tool to devise and implement field level solutions.

AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug-resistant, opportunistic, nosocomial pathogen for which a new line of treatments is desperately needed. We have targeted the enzyme of the first step of the histidine biosynthesis pathway, viz., ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase (ATP-PRT). The three-dimensional structure of ATP-PRT was predicted on the template of the known three-dimensional structure of ATP-PRT from Psychrobacter arcticus (PaATPPRT) using a homology modeling approach. High-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) of the antibacterial library of Life Chemicals Inc., Ontario, Canada was carried out followed by molecular dynamics simulations of the top hit compounds. In silico results were then biochemically validated using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. We found that two compounds, namely, F0843-0019 and F0608-0626, were binding with micromolar affinities to the ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase from Acinetobacter baumannii (AbATPPRT). Both of these compounds were binding in the same way as AMP in PaATPPRT, and the important residues of the active site, viz., Val4, Ser72, Thr76, Tyr77, Glu95, Lys134, Val136, and Tyr156, were also interacting via hydrogen bonds. The calculated binding energies of these compounds were -10.5 kcal/mol and -11.1 kcal/mol, respectively. These two compounds can be used as the potential lead molecules for designing antibacterial compounds in the future, and this information will help in drug discovery programs against Acinetobacter worldwide.

AB  - Genital ulcer disease (GUD) continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is an important risk factor for the acquisition of HIV. GUD is mainly caused by five sexually transmitted infections. Three pathogens most frequently associated with GUD are herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), Treponema pallidum, and Haemophilus ducreyi. Although their prevalence varies among different geographical regions, HSV-2 is the leading cause of this syndrome globally. In recent years, there has been an epidemiological transition of HSV-1 with a growing role of this virus as a causative agent of GUD. GUD may present with unique features depending on the etiological agent that can help clinicians identify the etiology and start treatment. However, owing to atypical presentations and co-infections, an accurate clinical diagnosis is often a challenge without confirmatory laboratory tests. Standard methods used to detect the causative pathogens of GUD have limitations. Molecular methods can provide a more sensitive and rapid microbiological diagnosis, with detection of the pathogen from the clinical sample directly. In situations where no laboratory support is available, the syndromic approach for management should be followed. The current scenario, clinical presentation (typical and atypical), laboratory diagnosis, and management of GUD will be discussed in this review. We searched PubMed literature and Google search engine using the terms "genital ulcer disease," "epidemiology of genital ulcer disease," and "clinical features of genital ulcer disease and atypical presentations" and relevant literature was selected to provide current perspectives of GUD.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was planned to determine the trends and susceptibility pattern of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in severely ill chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients admitted in pulmonary ward and ICU of our tertiary care centre.
METHODS: Fifty COPD patients suspected of IPA from pulmonary ward and ICU from April 2017 to September 2018 were investigated. Samples were processed by standard methods, culture positive isolates were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by microbroth dilution method.
RESULTS: Twenty-two critically ill COPD patients were microbiologically positive for IA infection, of which 13 were classified as putative invasive aspergillosis. The most common comorbid illness associated was diabetes. A. flavus and A. fumigatus were the commonest species isolated. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the antifungals was low. Morbidity due to IPA in COPD patients was very high.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of IPA in the pulmonary ward and ICU was found to be 9.6%. MALDI-TOF seems to be a promising tool for aiding rapid identification especially for slow growing and non-sporulating fungi. Heightened awareness and suspicion for pulmonary mould infections along with early diagnosis can substantially alter the patient prognosis.

AB  - (1) Introduction: Adult-onset pilocytic astrocytoma (APA) accounts for only 1.5% of all brain tumors, and studies regarding APA are limited. This review is focused on the history, clinical course, cytogenetics, neuroimaging features, management, and outcome of APAs. (2) Methods: Using a systematic search protocol in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct databases, the authors extracted cases of APA predilecting the temporal lobe from inception to December 2020. Articles lacking necessary data were excluded from this study. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 23 statistical package software. (3) Results: A total of 32 patients, 14 (43.8%) males and 18 (56.2%) females, with a male/female ratio of 0.77/1, were grouped. The mean age of the patients was 34.22 ± 15.17 years, ranging from 19 to 75. The tumors were predominantly located in the left side. We have also discussed the clinical presentation, and headache was the most common complaint, followed by visual disturbance. Preoperative neuroimaging features demonstrated cystic lesions in 16 patients, with mural nodule in 5 patients; intracerebral hemorrhage was present in 1 patient, and solid enhancing mass was observed in 3 patients. Only our reported case presented as a solid calcified mass. Most of the patients (78.1%) underwent a gross total resection (GTR), only 5 (21.9%) underwent subtotal resection (STR). The outcome and prognosis history were excellent, and no recurrence was observed. (4) Conclusion: Most of the APAs of the temporal lobe follow benign clinical courses, but some patients exhibit aggressive clinical behavior. There was no history of recurrence after treatment at up to 27 years of follow-up.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the pattern of bacterial pathogens causing infective keratitis and their resistance to the recommended antibiotics over six years.
METHODS: It was a retrospective study of 9,357 cases of bacterial keratitis from January 2015 to December 2020, at a tertiary care ophthalmic center. A total of 9,547 corneal specimens were obtained from the study subjects. Demographic details of the patients, pathogenic bacteria isolated, and their antimicrobial susceptibility were noted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were identified in 23.52% of the specimens. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (60.75%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.23%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.92%), gram negative bacilli of the family Enterobacterales (8.64%), Streptococcus spp. (1.72%), Acinetobacter spp. (0.13%), and other non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (0.57%). In Staphylococci, 55-80% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, and 40-70% to fluoroquinolones, while no resistance was observed against vancomycin. 40-60% of isolates of P. aeruginosa were resistant to cephalosporins, 40-55% to fluoroquinolones, and 30-60% to aminoglycosides. Also, 40-80% of isolates of Enterobacterales were resistant to cephalosporins, and 50-60% to fluoroquinolones. Most gram-negative isolates were susceptible to carbapenems and polymyxin B.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest compilation of microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis from North India. It highlights the current trend of the bacterial pathogens that cause infectious keratitis. Staphylococci and Pseudomonas were found to be the most common pathogens. Increased resistance was seen against some of the commonly prescribed empirical antibiotics. Such evidence is useful for restructuring the empirical prescription practices from time to time.

AB  - The free-living amebae of genus Acanthamoeba are an important cause of microbial keratitis. The clinical appearance of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) usually mimics viral or fungal keratitis. Thus, microbiological workup plays a significant role in the diagnosis and timely treatment of such cases. We report a retrospective case series of seven culture-confirmed AK cases from a tertiary eye care center in North India. Various risk factors and triggers of infection, clinical presentations, microbiological findings, and management of AK are elucidated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several interfascial interfacial plane blocks have been described in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy. We conducted this study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block and erector spinae plane block in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy.
METHODS: Totally, 80 female patients (18-70 years) undergoing modified radical mastectomy were randomised into 2 groups of 40 each and were given ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block or erector spinae plane block with 0.4 mL kg-1 of 0.375% ropivacaine in this prospective double-blind control trial. The groups were compared for the time to request of first dose of rescue analgesic, requirement of rescue analgesics, and patient satisfaction score.
RESULTS: The time to request of the first rescue analgesia was comparable in both groups (P =.056). Postoperative pain scores at rest at 0 minute were significantly lower in serratus anterior plane group as compared to erector spinae plane group (P =.03). The intraoperative fentanyl requirement and postoperative diclofenac and tramadol requirements were comparable between the 2 groups. The number of patients requiring rescue doses of fentanyl intraoperatively and rescue analgesics postoperatively was similar in both groups. The mean patient satisfaction score was also comparable in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block and erector spinae plane block have comparable postoperative analgesic efficacy after modified radical mastectomy.

AB  - AIM: To assess the prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) with CD4 ≤100/mm3.
DESIGN: This observational study was performed on PLHA with laboratory-confirmed CD4 ≤100/mm3. All PLHA were recruited irrespective of their duration of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve, or ART failure.
METHODS: The prevalence of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) was assessed in 102 PLHA, with CD4 ≤100/mm3, using a latex agglutination test on serum samples. All the subjects were followed up for 3 months.
RESULTS: Amongst 102 PLHA, 62 (60.8%) and 40 (39.2%) patients were ART-naïve and ART failures, respectively, with 2.9% (n = 3) having clinical features of meningitis and 6.8% (n = 7) patients being asymptomatic CrAg-positive. At the 3 month follow-up, total mortality was 10.8%, of which 33.3% and 8.8% were among CrAg-positive and negative patients (p = 0.05). Mortality in asymptomatic and meningitis symptomatic CrAg-positive patients was 1.03% (n = 1) and 2.06% (n = 2), respectively. Of note, five patients were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Cryptococcal antigenemia is common among patients with CD4 ≤100/mm3 who were either ART naïve or had treatment failure. Asymptomatic patients who underwent pre-emptive therapy demonstrated good clinical outcomes.

AB  - Precision medicine involves stratification of patients based on clinical, lifestyle, genetic, and biomarker information to decide further treatment and prognosticate, moving beyond classical “signs-and-symptoms” approach. This evolving concept is gaining ground in the management of various dermatological diseases like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria and pemphigus; however it is relatively in its infancy with respect to its application in vitiligo. This review aims to highlight the role of precision medicine in vitiligo, with a focus on genetic makeup, immunological factors, clinical subtypes, disease biomarkers, and dermoscopic signs in predicting therapeutic response to medical or surgical modalities, including light therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abandonment of treatment, a major cause of treatment failure in low- and middle-income countries like India, is particularly high during the diagnostic and initial phase of treatment. Tracking of patients during this risk period may reduce treatment abandonment rates and increase quality of care.
AIM: The primary aim was to pilot the use and check the acceptability of a tool for tracking children with cancer in New Delhi during the initial part of their treatment. Secondary aim was to estimate abandonment rates among these patients.
METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in two centers of North India in New Delhi and enrolled children less than 18 years diagnosed with cancer at these centers and who had registered with Cankids for social support. Parent support group (PSG) workers maintained contact with the child's family at least once a week for the first 12 weeks. Details of each contact and subsequent action were recorded in a customized book (called "You are not alone" or YANA Book). Descriptive analysis of these contacts was done in Microsoft Excel and presented in frequencies and percentages. The five-point Likert scale was used to check the acceptability of the tool among the PSG workers.
RESULTS: Seven PSG workers enrolled and tracked 81 patients (73% male with a median age of 6 years). During the 12-week study period, 986 contacts were attempted and three (3.7%) patients had abandoned their treatment. All PSG workers strongly agreed that the YANA book was simple to understand and use, decreased their workload, and helped provide better assistance to patients.
CONCLUSION: The tool for patient tracking was well accepted by the PSG workers and considered easy to use. We now plan to implement our model as a routine service at all the partnering hospitals in India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The information on the risk of thromboembolism (TE) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its predictors are lacking, especially from developing countries. The present study evaluated the prevalence, predictors, and prognosis of TE in IBD.
METHODS: This case-control study included 35 patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis [UC, n = 25]; Crohn's disease [CD], n = 10) and history of TE, from a cohort of 3597 patients (UC n = 2752, CD n = 845) under follow-up from 2005 to 2018. Details on demographics, extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), patient status, type and outcomes of TE, treatment details, and disease course were compared with IBD patients without TE (age, gender, and duration of follow-up matched) in the ratio of 1:4.
RESULTS: Prevalence of TE in IBD was 0.9% (UC-0.89%, CD-1.2%). Among TE patients (mean age: 34.9 ± 13.1 years, 48.6% males), median duration from diagnosis to TE was 12 (inter-quartile range [IQR]: 3-36) months, 37% had other EIMs, 94.1% had moderate/severe disease at time of TE, 62.8% had steroid-dependent/refractory disease, and 5 patients (14.2%) died because of disease-related complications. Lower limb was the commonest site (57.1%), 14.3% had pulmonary TE, and 31.4% had involvement of multiple sites. Phenotypically, more patients with TE (among UC) had steroid-dependent disease (60% vs. 25%, p = 0.001), pancolitis (76% vs. 36%, p = 0.002), chronic continuous disease course (44% vs. 19%, p = 0.009), and acute severe colitis (48% vs. 18%, p = 0.002), of which the latter three were also independent predictors of TE.
CONCLUSION: Approximately 1% of patients with IBD develop thromboembolism relatively early during their disease course, and TE is associated with severe disease and higher disease-related complications including mortality.

AB  - An early adolescent boy with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis was referred to the surgical clinic for the creation of an arteriovenous fistula. He was undergoing treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The patient was haemodynamically stable during the procedure, but he developed rapidly progressing dyspnoea, tachycardia and tachypnoea about 10 min after the vessels were declamped. His blood pressure rapidly rose above 220/120 mm Hg and saturation dropped below 90%. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) constituted of surgeons, nephrologists and intensivists was quickly activated. The patient was put on a mechanical ventilator and resuscitated with parenteral antihypertensives, diuretics, amiodarone and haemodialysis. The patient improved clinically and was discharged on the third postoperative day. Thus, a rapidly activated MDT approach was key in breaking the vicious cycle caused by hypertensive crisis, myocardial dysfunction and impending ventilatory failurethat occurred following access surgery.

AB  - Background: 
          Delirium is a complex, reversible neuropsychiatric disorder that frequently occurs in the geriatric age group in acute care settings with multifactorial etiology and numerous knowledge gaps in the pathogenesis.
          Objective: 
          This study aimed to establish an association between leptin levels and delirium in patients aged 60 years and above admitted under the geriatric medicine department of a tertiary care hospital.
          Materials and Methods: 
          A prospective observational study was conducted in consecutively admitted patients to the geriatric ward. Patients were assessed for delirium within 24 h of admission and daily thereafter until they were discharged from the hospital or died using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or CAM-intensive care unit with subsequent division into delirium and nondelirium groups. Serum leptin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
          Results: 
          Two hundred patients were recruited in the study. The mean age of participants was found to be 73.1 ± 8.8 years. Prevalence rates of delirium at the time of admission and incidence rates during hospital stay were found to be 20% and 5%, respectively. The occurrence of delirium was also found to be significantly associated with mortality (32.5% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.001). Serum leptin levels were found to be significantly lower in patients with delirium (2.58 ± 1.01 ng/mL vs. 10.72 ± 1.46 ng/mL, P = 0.03). Multivariable regression analysis revealed delirium to significantly correlate positively with age (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.63 (1.07–2.47), P = 0.021) and negatively with leptin levels (OR: 0.94 (0.90–0.99), P = 0.018).
          Conclusion: 
          Delirium is a frequently occurring condition in hospitalized older adults with high mortality rates. Leptin might serve as a potential predictor of delirium owing to its probable role in the pathophysiological processes of delirium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is one of the strongest outcome predictors, the current classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe' based on this fails to capture enormous heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment response. We hypothesized that data-driven characterization of TBI could identify distinct endotypes and give mechanistic insights.
METHODS: We developed an unsupervised statistical clustering model based on a mixture of probabilistic graphs for presentation (< 24 h) demographic, clinical, physiological, laboratory and imaging data to identify subgroups of TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit in the CENTER-TBI dataset (N = 1,728). A cluster similarity index was used for robust determination of optimal cluster number. Mutual information was used to quantify feature importance and for cluster interpretation.
RESULTS: Six stable endotypes were identified with distinct GCS and composite systemic metabolic stress profiles, distinguished by GCS, blood lactate, oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, glucose, base excess, pH, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and body temperature. Notably, a cluster with 'moderate' TBI (by traditional classification) and deranged metabolic profile, had a worse outcome than a cluster with 'severe' GCS and a normal metabolic profile. Addition of cluster labels significantly improved the prognostic precision of the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical trials in TBI) extended model, for prediction of both unfavourable outcome and mortality (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Six stable and clinically distinct TBI endotypes were identified by probabilistic unsupervised clustering. In addition to presenting neurology, a profile of biochemical derangement was found to be an important distinguishing feature that was both biologically plausible and associated with outcome. Our work motivates refining current TBI classifications with factors describing metabolic stress. Such data-driven clusters suggest TBI endotypes that merit investigation to identify bespoke treatment strategies to improve care. Trial registration The core study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02210221 , registered on August 06, 2014, with Resource Identification Portal (RRID: SCR_015582).

AB  - Acanthamoeba is a rare cause of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) associated with high mortality. There have been few case reports of Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis worldwide. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe hyperinflammatory condition caused by abnormally active macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes; its secondary form is due to infections or malignancies. However, HLH is rather an unknown complication of GAE. We describe an unusual and previously unreported case of Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis in a young immunocompetent female culminating in secondary HLH.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There have been 214 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with a total death tally of 4.4 million. The current study aims to determine the predictive value of various scores in the assessment of progression of mild COVID-19 infection at a tertiary care hospital in North India.
METHODS: The study population consisted of adults (age more than 18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. Patients with only mild illness were enrolled. After the patients were admitted to the isolation ward, the presenting history, comorbidity status, vital signs and laboratory parameters were recorded. The 3 and 6 minutes walk test was performed daily from admission till discharge or progression of the severity of COVID- 19, and it was used to calculate Borg Dyspnoea Score (BDS) and National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) scores.
RESULTS: Our study consisted of 50 patients with 34 (68%) males, and the mean (SD) age of the patient population was 28.1 (6.4) years. The most common symptoms were fever, sore throat, and cough. All laboratory parameters were within normal ranges for all the patients. 96% recovered without progression, while only 4% of them progressed to moderate illness. Results of the 3 and 6 minutes walk tests, BDS and NEWS2 scores showed improvement over the course of the hospital stay.
CONCLUSION: Although the walk tests and the scores improved over time, they failed to predict the disease progression.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present the socio demographic profile and mental health status of the males during COVID-19 in three tribal districts of Jharkhand. The survey was undertaken between June 2021 and December 2022. It was largely representative of the population as 74,318 persons were screened in 3 the districts of Khunti, Simdega and Dumka. The survey population was aged 15 to 65 years. 74,318 people were screened for anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts (if scores severe on screening). Conditions which they were facing were explored by a semi structured script accompanied with PHQ4 as a screening tool. This paper presents findings for the pattern and sociodemographic profile of the persons screened. Inferences and conclusion: Female contributed higher proportions of mental health issues. Unmarried, divorced, separated and widowed people reported to face higher proportions of moderate and severe mental issues. Unemployed people and students reported higher proportions of moderate and severe mental issues.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an objective look at the presence and severity of mental health issues in Indian women, across the selected intervention districts in Delhi, Gujarat and Jharkhand in the COVID-19 era. The survey was undertaken between June 2021 and October 2022. It was largely representative of the population, as 577,239 people were taken from households of 26 districts of Delhi, Jharkhand and Gujarat. The survey population aged 15 to 65 years. 473,970 people were screened for anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts (if scores severe on screening). Conditions which they were facing were explored by a semi structured script accompanied with PHQ4 as a screening tool. They were further provided with psychological intervention(s) in the cases where mental health challenges were reported. The overall response rate was 87.79%. This paper presents selected findings for the pattern with respect to socio-demographic differences in the female population who reported mental health problems N=19778. Our data showed us that females exhibited a prevalence rate of 8.4% versus males who exhibited a prevalence rate of 5.8% and thus we decided to have a look at whether we could observe trends in the female population. It was found that, females in the <18 group were more likely to experience severe and moderate MH issues as whole than females in other age groups. Unmarried females or females who were divorced, separated or widowed were more likely to experience severe MH issues. Females in active employment are more likely experience severe and moderate MH issues as a whole than other occupational groups.

AB  - Preoperative ultrasound assessment of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and the collapsi-bility index might identify patients with intravascular volume depletion. The purpose of this review was to gather the existing evidence to find out whether preoperative IVC ultrasound (IVCUS) derived parameters can reliably predict hypotension after spinal or general anaesthesia. PubMed was searched to identify research articles that addressed the role of IVC ultrasound in predicting hypotension after spinal and general anaesthesia in adult patients. We included 4 randomized control trials and 17 observational studies in our final review. Among these, 15 studies involved spinal anaesthesia and 6 studies involved general anaesthesia. Heterogeneity with respect to the patient populations under evaluation, definitions used for hypotension after anaesthesia, IVCUS assessment methods, and cut-off values for IVCUS-derived parameters to predict hypotension precluded pooled meta-analysis. The maximum and minimum reported sensitivity of the IVC collapsibility index (IVCCI) for predicting post-spinal hypotension was 84.6% and 58.8% respectively, while the maximum and minimum specificities were 93.1% and 23.5% respectively. For the prediction of hypotension after general anaesthesia induction, the reported ranges of sensitivity and specificity of IVCCI were 86.67% to 45.5% and 94.29% to 77.27%, respectively. Current literature on the predictive role of IVCUS for hypotension after anaesthesia is heterogeneous both in methodology and in results. Standardization of the definition of hypotension under anaesthesia, method of IVCUS assessment, and the cut-offs for IVC diameter and the collapsibility index for prediction of hypotension after anaesthesia are necessary for drawing clinically relevant conclusions.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the long-term outcomes of biventricular, univentricular, and so-called one-and-one-half ventricular repairs in patients with left and right isomerism. Methods: Surgical correction was undertaken, between 2000 and 2021, in 198 patients with right, and 233 with left isomerism. Results: The median age at operation was 24 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 18-45) and 60 days (IQR: 29-360) for those with right and left isomerism, respectively. Multidetector computed-tomographic angiocardiography demonstrated more than half of those with right isomerism had superior caval venous abnormalities, and one-third had a functionally univentricular heart. Almost four-fifths of those with left isomerism had an interrupted inferior caval vein, and one-third had complete atrioventricular septal defect. Biventricular repair was achieved in two-thirds of those with left isomerism, but under one-quarter with right isomerism (P < .001). Hazard regression for mortality revealed odds for prematurity at 5.5, pulmonary atresia at 2.81, atrioventricular septal defect with a common valvar orifice at 2.28, parachute mitral valve at 3.73, interrupted inferior caval vein at 0.53, and functionally univentricular heart with a totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection at 3.77. At a median follow-up of 124 months, the probability of survival was 87% for those with left, and 77% for those with right isomerism (P = .006). Conclusions: Multimodality imaging characterizes and delineates the relevant anatomical details, facilitating surgical management of individuals with isomeric atrial appendages. Continuing higher mortality despite surgical intervention in those with right isomerism points to the need for the reassessment of strategies for management.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To review the anatomical details, diagnostic challenges, associated cardiovascular anomalies, and techniques and outcomes of management, including re-interventions, for the rare instances of transposition physiology with concordant ventriculo-arterial connections.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical and necropsy studies on diagnosis and surgical treatment of individuals with transposition physiology and concordant ventriculo-arterial connections, analyzing also individuals with comparable flow patterns in the setting of isomerism.
RESULTS: Among reported cases, just over two-thirds were diagnosed during surgery, after initial palliation, or after necropsy. Of the patients, four-fifths presented in infancy with either cyanosis or congestive cardiac failure, with complex associated cardiac malformations. Nearly half had ventricular septal defects, and one-fifth had abnormalities of the tricuspid valve, including hypoplasia of the morphologically right ventricle. A small minority had common atrioventricular junctions We included cases reported with isomerism when the flow patterns were comparable, although the atrioventricular connections are mixed in this setting. Management mostly involved construction of intraatrial baffles, along with correction of coexisting anomalies, either together or multistaged. Overall mortality was 25%, with one-fifth of patients requiring pacemakers for surgically-induced heart block. The majority of survivors were in good functional state.
CONCLUSIONS: The flow patterns produced by discordant atrioventricular and concordant ventriculo-arterial connections remain an important, albeit rare, indication for atrial redirection or hemi-Mustard's procedure with bidirectional Glenn. The procedure recruits the morphologically left ventricle in the systemic circuit, producing good long-term functional results. The approach can also be used for those with isomeric atrial appendages and comparable hemodynamic circuits.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We showed in our anatomical review, ventricular septal defects existing as multiple entities can be considered in terms of three major subsets. We address here the diagnostic challenges, associated anomalies, the role and techniques of surgical instead of interventional closure, and the outcomes, including reinterventions, for each subset.
METHODS: We reviewed 80 published investigations, noting radiographic findings, and the results of clinical imaging elucidating the location, number, size of septal defects, associated anomalies, and the effect of severe pulmonary hypertension.
RESULTS: Overall, perioperative mortality for treatment of residual multiple defects has been cited to be between 0% and 14.2%, with morbidity estimated between 6% and 13%. Perioperative mortality is twice as high for perimembranous compared to muscular defects, with the need for reoperation being over four times higher. Perventricular hybrid approaches are useful for the closure of high anterior or apical defects. Overall, the results have been unsatisfactory. Pooled data reveals incidences between 2.8% and 45% for device-related adverse events. Currently, however, outcomes cannot be assessed on the basis of the different anatomical subsets.
CONCLUSIONS: We have addressed the approaches, and the results, of therapeutic treatment in terms of coexisting discrete defects, the Swiss-cheese septum, and the arrangement in which a solitary apical muscular defect gives the impression of multiple defects when viewed from the right ventricular aspect. Treatment should vary according to the specific combination of defects.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We assessed the anatomical variations in coronary arterial patterns relative to the techniques of reimplantation in the setting of the arterial switch operation, relating the variations to influences on outcomes.
METHODS: We reviewed pertinent published investigations, assessing events reported following varied surgical techniques for reimplantation of the coronary arteries in the setting of the arterial switch procedure.
RESULTS: The prevalence of reported adverse events, subsequent to reimplantation, varied from 2% to 11%, with a bimodal presentation of high early and low late incidence. The intramural pattern continues to contribute to mortality, with some reports of 28% fatality. The presence of abnormal course relative to the arterial pedicles in the setting of single sinus origin was associated with a three-fold increase in mortality. Abnormal looping with bisinusal origin of arteries was not associated with increased risk.
CONCLUSION: The techniques of transfer of the coronary arteries can be individually adapted to cater for the anatomical variations. Cardiac surgeons, therefore, need to be familiar with the myriad creative options available to achieve successful repair when there is challenging anatomy. Long-term follow-up will be required to affirm the superiority of any specific individual technique. Detailed multiplanar computed-tomographic scanning can now reveal all the variants, and elucidate the mechanisms of late complications. Coronary angioplasty or surgical revascularization may be considered in selected cases subsequent to the switch procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: On the basis of previously published accounts, coupled with our own experience, we have assessed the surgical approaches to patients with isomeric atrial appendages.
METHODS: We reviewed pertinent published studies on surgical treatment of individuals with isomeric atrial appendages, with the pertinent surgical details provided by most of the manuscripts.
RESULTS: Half of patients with right isomerism, and two-thirds of those with left isomerism have bilateral superior caval veins. Azygos extension of the inferior caval vein is reported in three-quarters of those with left isomerism. The coronary sinus is universally absent in right isomerism, along with totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and is absent in two-fifths of those with left isomerism. Univentricular atrioventricular connections are expected in up to three-quarters of those with right isomerism. Atrioventricular septal defect is reported in up to four-fifths, more frequently in right isomerism, with such patients typically having discordant ventriculoatrial connections or double outlet right ventricle. Reported mortalities extend to 85% for those with right, and 50% for those with left isomerism. In right isomerism, mortality is up to 54% for systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunting, up to 75% for univentricular repair, and up to 95% for repair of totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection itself. No more than one-quarter had undergone Fontan completion, with reported mortalities of 21%.
CONCLUSION: Early surgical results are satisfactory in patients with left isomerism, but disappointing for those with right. Recent advances in cardiac and liver transplantation may offer improved survival.

AB  - To assess the effects of 12 weeks Yoga based Cardiac Rehabilitation program on Blood Pressure Variability and Baroreflex Sensitivity in Eighty patients post myocardial infarction. Randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. A tertiary care institution in India. The Yoga group received 13 hospital-based structured yoga sessions in adjunct to the standard care. Control Group participants received enhanced standard care involving three brief educational sessions on importance of diet and physical activity. Beat to beat arterial pressure variability and baroreflex sensitivity was determined non-invasively. Baseline measurement was done at 3 weeks post Myocardial Infarction. The measurements were repeated at 13th week and at 26th week post MI. There was no significant difference between the groups in time domain indices of SBP variability. At 26th week post MI, after normalization the Low Frequency power increased in the yoga group as compared to the decrease in the standard care group (p = 0.02). Though the High Frequency power increased in both the groups, the magnitude of increase was higher in the standard care group (p = 0.005). However, the total power increased significantly in yoga group with a concurrent decrease in standard care group (p =  < 0.001). The SBP All BRS was significantly different between the groups with an increase in the yoga group and a decline in standard care group (p = 0.003) at 13th week. A short-term Yoga based cardiac rehabilitation has additive effects in improving baroreflex sensitivity and dampening blood pressure variability post myocardial infarction in patients under optimal medication.The main trial is registered in Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) (Ref. No: CTRI/2012/02/002408). In addition, CTRI has also been registered for the sub-study. (Ref. No: CTRI/2017/09/009925).

TI  - Top 10 Clear Cell Head and Neck Lesions to Contemplate
AU  - Cipriani, Nicole A.
AU  - Kakkar, Aanchal
T2  - Head and Neck Pathology
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optically clear cytoplasm may occur in neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, either as a characteristic feature of a disease entity or as a morphologic rarity, potentially creating diagnostic dilemmas in various organ systems. In the head and neck, clear cell change can occur in lesions of salivary, odontogenic, thyroid, parathyroid, or sinonasal/skull base origin, as well as in metastases to these regions.
METHODS: This review elaborates the top ten clear cell lesions in the head and neck, emphasizing their distinguishing histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular attributes, and presents a rational approach to arriving at an accurate classification.
RESULTS: Cytoplasmic pallor or clearing may be caused by accumulations of glycogen, lipid, mucin, mucopolysaccharides, water, foreign material, hydropic organelles, or immature zymogen granules. Overlapping morphologic features may present a diagnostic challenge to the surgical pathologist. Similarity in immunohistochemical profiles, often due to common cell type, as well as rare non-neoplastic mimics, furthers the diagnostic conundrum.
CONCLUSIONS: The top ten lesions reviewed in this article are as follows: (1) clear cell carcinoma (salivary and odontogenic), (2) mucoepidermoid carcinoma, (3) myoepithelial and epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, (4) oncocytic salivary gland lesions, (5) squamous cell carcinoma, (6) parathyroid water clear cell adenoma, (7) metastatic renal cell carcinoma (especially in comparison to clear cell thyroid neoplasms), (8) sinonasal renal cell-like adenocarcinoma, (9) chordoma, and (10) rhinoscleroma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognised as being responsible for a substantial proportion of the global burden of disease. Neurosurgical interventions are an important aspect of care for patients with TBI, but there is little epidemiological data available on this patient population. We aimed to characterise differences in casemix, management, and mortality of patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI across different levels of human development.
METHODS: We did a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients with TBI undergoing emergency neurosurgery, in a convenience sample of hospitals identified by open invitation, through international and regional scientific societies and meetings, individual contacts, and social media. Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI in each hospital's 30-day study period were all eligible for inclusion, with the exception of patients undergoing insertion of an intracranial pressure monitor only, ventriculostomy placement only, or a procedure for drainage of a chronic subdural haematoma. The primary outcome was mortality at 14 days postoperatively (or last point of observation if the patient was discharged before this time point). Countries were stratified according to their Human Development Index (HDI)-a composite of life expectancy, education, and income measures-into very high HDI, high HDI, medium HDI, and low HDI tiers. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to examine the effect of HDI on mortality while accounting for and quantifying between-hospital and between-country variation.
FINDINGS: Our study included 1635 records from 159 hospitals in 57 countries, collected between Nov 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. 328 (20%) records were from countries in the very high HDI tier, 539 (33%) from countries in the high HDI tier, 614 (38%) from countries in the medium HDI tier, and 154 (9%) from countries in the low HDI tier. The median age was 35 years (IQR 24-51), with the oldest patients in the very high HDI tier (median 54 years, IQR 34-69) and the youngest in the low HDI tier (median 28 years, IQR 20-38). The most common procedures were elevation of a depressed skull fracture in the low HDI tier (69 [45%]), evacuation of a supratentorial extradural haematoma in the medium HDI tier (189 [31%]) and high HDI tier (173 [32%]), and evacuation of a supratentorial acute subdural haematoma in the very high HDI tier (155 [47%]). Median time from injury to surgery was 13 h (IQR 6-32). Overall mortality was 18% (299 of 1635). After adjustment for casemix, the odds of mortality were greater in the medium HDI tier (odds ratio [OR] 2·84, 95% CI 1·55-5·2) and high HDI tier (2·26, 1·23-4·15), but not the low HDI tier (1·66, 0·61-4·46), relative to the very high HDI tier. There was significant between-hospital variation in mortality (median OR 2·04, 95% CI 1·17-2·49).
INTERPRETATION: Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI differed considerably in their admission characteristics and management across human development settings. Level of human development was associated with mortality. Substantial opportunities to improve care globally were identified, including reducing delays to surgery. Between-hospital variation in mortality suggests changes at an institutional level could influence outcome and comparative effectiveness research could identify best practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data of neurocognitive deficits in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is scarce from low middle-income countries (LMICs), and is influenced by biological and cultural variations. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and spectrum of neurocognitive deficits in a cohort of survivors from India.
PROCEDURE: Seventy survivors of childhood ALL were evaluated for neurocognitive deficits by the Indian adaptation of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IVINDIA ). The prevalence of neurocognitive deficits was calculated based on the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), and scores in discrete domains like verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed were calculated and compared to demographics, treatment, and sociocultural factors.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) current age and time since diagnosis was 10.5 (±3.2) years and 5 (±2.8) years, respectively. The mean FSIQ was 86.1 ± 20.5, with significant neurocognitive deficit (FSIQ <90) being prevalent in 50% (95% CI: 38%-62%) of the cohort. The proportion of survivors with deficits in individual domains of verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed were 49%, 50%, 47%, and 44%, respectively. The odds of having neurocognitive deficits were higher when a child belonged to lower socioeconomic strata (OR 5.7, p = .004), parents with lower education attainment (OR 4.3, p = .041), and whose birth order was higher (OR 20.1, p = .005). Age at diagnosis/assessment, chemotherapy received, or dose of radiotherapy did not have a direct impact on neurocognition.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rates of neurocognitive deficits are higher in survivors in LMICs, with socioeconomic variables contributing more than the direct neurotoxic effects of treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing in young people worldwide and more children in resource limited settings are living into adulthood. There is a need for rigorous testing and reporting of evidence-based and stakeholder-informed strategies that transition individuals with T1D from pediatric to adult care. We present the development of and design of the first structured transition program in Delhi, India, to inform similar efforts in India and resource limited settings.
METHODS: The intervention development team included clinicians and researchers with expertise in T1D and the implementation context. To select intervention outcomes, establish intervention targets, and design session modules, we drew upon formative research conducted at prospective intervention implementation sites, consensus guidelines, and previous care transition and behavior change research conducted in developed settings. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication and GUIDance for the rEporting of intervention Development checklists to report the intervention and development process.
RESULTS: The 15-month program ("PATHWAY") includes five quarterly ~30 minute sessions delivered predominantly by diabetes educators at pediatric and adult clinics, which coincide with routine care visits. Primary program components include educational and behavioral sessions that address psychosocial drivers of clinic attendance and self-management, diabetes educators as transition coordinators and counselors, and a one-year "overlap period" of alternating visits between pediatric and adult providers.
CONCLUSIONS: We followed a systematic and transparent process to develop PATHWAY, which facilitated rich description of intervention context, guiding principles, targets, and components. Dependence on previously published program examples to design PATHWAY may have introduced challenges for program feasibility and effectiveness, underscoring the importance of input gathering from prospective intervention actors at multiple points in the development process. This detailed report in combination with future evaluations of PATHWAY support efforts to increase rigorous development and testing of strategies to improve outcomes among emerging adults with T1D.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied ankle arthrodesis with a transfibular approach using sagitally spilitted fibula as a biological plate (onlay grafting) as well as other half of fibula as morcellised local interpositional graft (inlay grafting) to achieve bony union.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective clinico-radiological evaluation of 36 operated cases was done at 3, 6, 12 and 30 months follow-ups. Clinically union was considered once ankle became pain free on full weight bearing. Pain assessment was done by using VAS (visual analogue scale) score and functional evaluation was done by AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) hind foot score preoperatively and at different follow ups. Radiologically, sagittal plane ankle alignment and fusion status was determined at each follow up.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 40.36 ± 10.56 years (range 18-55), who were evaluated for mean duration of 33.32 ± 11.25 months (range 24-65). Thirty-three (91.7%) ankles were fused adequately and mean duration to achieve bony union was 5.09 ± 1.3 months (range 4-9 months). Mean post-operative AOFAS score at final follow up was 76.65 ± 4.87 in comparison to 45.76 ± 3.38, preoperatively. VAS score improved significantly from 7.8 (pre-operative) to 2.3 (final follow-up). Non-union in three patients (8.3%) and ankle malalignment in one patient was observed.
CONCLUSION: Transfibular ankle arthrodesis achieves excellent bony unions and functional outcomes in severe ankle arthritis. Biologically incompetent fibula that to be judged individually by the operating surgeon to use it as a graft. Patients having inflammatory arthritis have more dissatisfaction than other aetiologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease. Information on comparative assessment of quality of life (QoL) among SCAs, particularly SCA 12, is scarce. We aimed to compare health-related QoL in SCA 1, 2 and 12.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among individuals with genetically-confirmed SCAs. Ataxia severity was assessed using Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS), independence in activities of daily living (ADL) using Katz index (Katz ADL) and depression using Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). QoL was assessed via Short Form Health Survey version 2.0 (SF-36).
RESULTS: We enrolled 89 individuals (SCA1 = 17, SCA2 = 43, SCA12 = 29; 56% males). Mean age at onset (41.0 ± 11.6 for SCA12 versus 24.9 + 7.0 for SCA1 and 28.8 ± 9.8 years for SCA2) was significantly higher among SCA12. SCA12 had lower BARS (mean score 4.1 ± 4.5 versus 10.6 ± 4.6 for SCA1 and 12.5 ± 4.5 for SCA2). SCA12 scored better on all SF-36 subdomains including Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. PCS score amongst SCA12 was 44.4 ± 9.0 versus 30.4 ± 9.1 for SCA1 and 33.3 ± 8.9 for SCA2. MCS score for SCA12 was 51.4 ± 11.4 versus 41.8 ± 11.5 for SCA1 and 41.8 ± 11.2 for SCA2. SCA12 had lower mean BDI scores (5.0 ± 6.0) versus SCA1 (9.5 ± 11.6) and SCA2 (10.9 ± 10.3). BARS and BDI emerged as significant predictors of most SF-36 subdomains.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that despite older age and comparable disease duration, SCA12 patients experience better QoL, less severe depression and ataxia versus SCA1 and SCA2. Severity of ataxia and depression are significant predictors of QoL among the three SCA types.

AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the utility of operating on the temporal trabecular meshwork with in vivo - aqueous angiography demonstrating new aqueous outflow channels.
METHOD: In a patient with primary open angle glaucoma, nuclear sclerosis, and medically uncontrolled intraocular pressure, Indocyanine green aqueous angiography (0.5%) was performed to visualize baseline functional aqueous outflow channels. This was followed by 30 degrees bent needle ab-interno goniectomy in the temporal quadrant, where no aqueous outflow channels were initially visualized. Aqueous angiography was repeated using 2% fluorescein to visualize aqueous outflow channels after bent needle ab-interno goniectomy.
RESULTS: Prebent needle ab-interno goniectomy, aqueous angiography revealed functional outflow channels in the nasal quadrant although none were visible in the temporal quadrant. Postbent needle ab-interno goniectomy in temporal quadrant aqueous angiography demonstrated 2 new aqueous outflow channels.
CONCLUSION: In a patient with open angle glaucoma, following temporal quadrant ab-interno goniectomy, the recruitment of aqueous outflow channels was demonstrated using aqueous angiography.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT).
DESIGN: Parallel arm, single masked, randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Sixty patients with ocular hypertension and IOP > 21 and < 30 mmHg were recruited at a tertiary eye care centre in India. Thirty patients (group 1) underwent six weeks of one hour daily MBSR sessions, while the other 30 patients (group 2) were waitlisted and kept on follow-up. The primary outcome was change in IOP (ΔIOP) after six weeks of MBSR. Secondary outcomes were effect on serum cortisol level, diurnal variation of IOP, vessel perfusion and vessel density on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and quality of life (QOL).
RESULTS: At six weeks, a significant decrease in IOP was noted in group 1 (23.05 ± 1.17 to 19.15 ± 1.45 mmHg; P = .001) compared with group 2 (22.55 ± 0.98 mmHg to 22.37 ± 1.07 mmHg; P = .107). The ΔIOP was significantly greater in group 1 (3.93 ± 1.47) than group 2 (0.17 ± 0.58; P = .001). The diurnal fluctuation of IOP decreased in group 1 (4.87 ± 1.13 mmHg to 2.73 ± 0.98 mmHg; P = .001) as compared with group 2 (4.50 ± 0.86 mmHg to 4.30 ± 0.83 mmHg; P = .227). Significant improvement in vessel perfusion, vessel density, and flux index was noted on OCTA in group 1 compared with group 2. Group 1 showed a significant decrease (P ≤ .001) in serum cortisol level and an improved QOL (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based stress reduction was associated with a significant decrease in IOP and serum cortisol, along with an improvement in optic nerve head perfusion and QOL. Mindfulness-based stress reduction can be considered as a potential treatment option in the management of OHT.

T2  - Journal of Ophthalmic & Vision Research
AB  - Trabeculectomy remains the most commonly performed surgery for medically uncontrolled glaucoma. Its success in primary open angle glaucoma is approximately 82% in the initial year after surgery and 64% at the end of five years. Lower success rates have been found in secondary glaucomas like neovascular glucoma, uvietic glaucoma, post-traumatic glaucoma, and for repeat surgeries. To illustrate improvement of the efficacy of trabeculectomy, enhancement with cyclodialysis has been introduced. This involves the creation of a cyclodialysis cleft in a controlled manner to allow additional suprachoroidal drainage of the aqueous. Cyclodialysis is the result of the separation of the longitudinal ciliary muscle fibers from the scleral spur, which creates an additional pathway for aqueous humor drainage. However, such a cleft often closes on its own due to associated inflammation caused by the filtration surgery. Deep sclerectomy is a non-penetrating surgery that involves dissection of a scleral patch and excision of a block of scleral tissue, retaining a thin membrane for aqueous drainage. In this study, we introduce a novel surgical technique of combining trabeculectomy with a limited deep sclerectomy and a cyclodialysis in two pseudophakic patients who developed secondary glaucoma after vitreo-retinal surgery with silicone oil insertion. In this technique the excised scleral tissue obtained after deep sclerectomy was utilized as a spacer to maintain the patency of the cyclodialysis cleft.

AB  - Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the world. Although numerous factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, the main focus of management still remains lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) by medical or surgical therapy. However, a major challenge is that many glaucoma patients continue to progress despite good control of IOP. In this regard, the importance of other coexisting factors that may contribute to disease progression needs to be explored. Ophthalmologists need to be aware of ocular risk factors and the impact of systemic diseases and their medications, along with lifestyle modifications on the course of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and adopt a holistic approach in treating the eye as well as the patient to alleviate the suffering from glaucoma in a comprehensive manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women with infertility, elucidate the psycho-social factors affecting infertile women, identify the commonly employed coping strategies, and evaluate their self-esteem and quality of life.
METHODS: A total of 150 women with infertility, from a tertiary care hospital, participated in this study. Cross-sectional assessment was performed by using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, WHO-Quality of life-BREF, and Brief-COPE Inventory.
RESULTS: Overall, 58% (87/150) of women reported depression on HDRS, 24% (36/150) reported anxiety on HAM-A, and 24% (36/150) had both depression and anxiety on HDRS and HAM-A. Comparative analysis of women reporting depression and anxiety indicated that they were subjected to significant discrimination, received lower social acceptance, had financial problems, higher depression and anxiety, poorer quality of life, and employed maladaptive coping. Living in a joint family, and using maladaptive coping were significant risk factors for anxiety and depression. Conversely, the family's ability to provide support, share problems, and assist with decision-making, along with receiving support from their spouses, were chief protective factors.
CONCLUSION: Women with infertility experience depression, anxiety, poor quality of life, and employ maladaptive coping. Supportive relationships with one's family and spouse are chief protective factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) and anxiety (PPA) is rising in India and efforts at generating local evidence for psychological intervention are scanty. We conducted a single-arm pilot study in an Indian rural community to test the impact of multicomponent psychoeducational intervention (MCPI) on women with PPD and PPA.
METHODS: Forty-three women with PPD/PPA/both received MCPI, which comprised three phases with in-person sessions held once weekly for a minimum of six and a maximum of ten weeks. Primary outcome variables were scores on depression and anxiety, assessed using the Edinburg postnatal depression scale and the state and trait anxiety inventory, along with evaluating the compliance rate to the intervention. The Mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) neuropsychiatric interview was used to confirm the diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Secondary outcome variables assessed were social support, functionality, parental stress, interpersonal violence, and marital satisfaction. We used Cohen's d effect size method for assessing the mean differences.
RESULTS: MCPI resulted in the improvement of 72% women (95% CI = 56.3%-84.7%). The overall compliance rate to the intervention was 85.63%, which was higher for responders than nonresponders (92.9% vs. 69.8%; P < 0.001). MCPI resulted in statistically significant improvement in the mean score of depression (P = 0.001, d = 0.95) and anxiety (P = 0.001, d = 1.30). On secondary outcome variables, significant improvement was obtained in the overall present social support (P = 0.001; d = 4.65), present social support from partner (P = 0.027; d = 0.45) and parents (P = 0.001; d = 0.74), future social support from parents (P = 0.001; d = 0.81), the performance of household responsibility (P = 0.001; d = 0.97), lifestyle in the last two weeks (P = 0.001; d = 3.57), parental stress (P = 0.001; d = 1.04), and marital satisfaction (P = 0.014; d = 0.52).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that MCPI has a promising role in relieving depression and anxiety. It also improved the perception of social support from partner and parents, functionality, marital satisfaction, and reduced parental stress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the perinatal outcomes in women with complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies undergoing selective fetal reduction using radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 44 patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies, between 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, who underwent RFA for selective fetal reduction. Perinatal and maternal outcomes and procedure-related complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in all 44 cases. Indications for selective fetal reduction included twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (52.3%), twin reversed arterial perfusion (20.5%), twins discordant for anomaly (15.9%), and selective fetal growth restriction (11.4%). Median gestational age at procedure was 222/7  weeks (range 14-266/7 ). Live birth rate was 77.3% with three neonatal deaths; so overall survival was 70.5%. Median procedure-to-delivery interval was 123/7  weeks (range 24/7 -23). There were eight losses before 24 weeks of pregnancy, which included two co-twin deaths. Median gestational age at delivery was 35 weeks (interquartile range 321/7 -37 weeks). The preterm delivery rate was 66.7% (24/36) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) occurred in 22.7% (10/44) of patients.
CONCLUSION: Selective fetal reduction using RFA is safe and effective in complicated monochorionic pregnancies. However, the rates of PPROM and preterm delivery remain high.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Most cases of bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) regress. Prenatal intervention is needed in cases of fetal hydrothorax or hydrops. Laser is commonly used to ablate the feeding artery.
CASE PRESENTATION: In a fetus with BPS, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was used to ablate the feeding artery arising from descending aorta at 29 weeks gestation. There was an extralobar BPS and significant pleural effusion causing mediastinal shift and collapse of lung. The effusion and tumor started decreasing from day 3 after procedure, and by the time patient delivered at 36 weeks gestation, the lesion had almost resolved.
CONCLUSION: With proper technique, RFA can be safely used to ablate feeding artery in BPS.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the surgical efficacy of reinforced plication of the medial rectus muscle to resection as an effective muscle strengthening procedure in exotropia.
METHODS: This is a prospective randomized trial in patients with exotropia who underwent complete orthoptic evaluation followed by random assignment into two groups by using a computer-drawn random number table. Group 1 patients underwent standard resection with recession procedure, and group 2 patients underwent reinforced plication with recession procedure. Follow-up was performed at day 1, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months to assess the surgical efficacy.
RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were included in the study of which 39 were in group 1 and 41 in group 2. The mean age in group 1 was 23.48 ± 11.94 years and 23.29 ± 10.02 years in group 2. The mean preoperative deviation in group 1 for distance was 50.13 ± 11.95 PD and 50.12 ± 9.79 PD in group 2 (P = 0.499). In group 1 with a mean surgical dose of 5.27 mm medial rectus resection and 8.04 mm lateral rectus recession, a 7.11 ± 3.95 PD deviation was noted at the end of 6 months. Similarly, in group 2 with a mean surgical dose of 5.16 mm medial rectus plication and 8.16 mm lateral rectus recession, a 6.00 ± 2.46 PD deviation was noted at the end of 6 months. Between groups, ocular surface changes, inter-surgeon comparison, and exotropia subtypes did not reveal any significant differences.
CONCLUSION: In our observation, the reinforced medial rectus muscle plication showed clinically comparable results as compared to the standard resection procedure at the end of 6 months. Therefore, this innovative modification can be considered as an alternative to standard resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) may improve the outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation. However, the timing of performing tracheostomy may be controversial, and it is an aerosol-generating procedure with a potential risk of viral exposure to healthcare workers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An operational protocol for performing PDT was made and subsequently followed in a designated COVID-19 ICU. Critically ill adult patients on mechanical ventilators who underwent PDT were included in this retrospective cohort study. Case files were retrospectively reviewed and patient characteristics, clinical outcome, and procedure-related details were noted.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 49 (39-67) years, and 41.5% of patients were females. The median duration of mechanical ventilation before tracheostomy was 10 (8-16) days, and the median (IQR) PaO2/FiO2 ratio on the day of PDT was 155 (125-180) mm Hg. Further, 48.8% of patients had transient desaturation to SpO2 <90%, and 41.5% survived to ICU discharge. None of the health care providers involved in PDT developed any symptoms of COVID 19.
CONCLUSION: This descriptive study demonstrates the feasibility, implementation, and apparent safety of the PDT protocol developed at our institution.

AB  - Histological interpretation of the rare pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) has been the holy grail for treatment options. However, no stand-alone clinical interventions have been developed owing to the lack of gene expression profiling data in PXA/APXA patients. We first time report the comprehensive analyses of the coding as well as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signatures of PXA/APXA patients. Several genes such as IGFBP2, NF1, FOS, ERBB2, and lncRNAs such as NEAT1, HOTAIRM1, and GAS5 known to play crucial roles in glioma patients were also deregulated in PXA patients suggesting the commonality in the molecular signatures. PPI network, co-expression, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction studies unraveled hub genes (such as ERBB2, FOS, RPA1) and networks that may play a critical role in PXA biology. The most enriched pathways based on gene profiles were related to TLR, chemokine, MAPK, Rb, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. The lncRNA targets were enriched in glucuronidation, adipogenesis, TGF-beta signaling, EGF/EGFR signaling, and cell cycle pathways. Interestingly, several mRNAs like PARVG, and ABI2 were found to be targeted by multiple lncRNAs suggesting a tight control of their levels. Some of the most prominent lncRNA-mRNA pairs were LOC728730: MRPL9, XLOC_l2_011987: ASIC2, lnc-C1QTNF5-1: RNF26. Notably, several lncRNAs such as lnc-CETP-1, lnc-XRCC3-1, lnc-RPL31-1, lnc-USP13-1, and MAPKAPK5-AS1, and genes such as RPA1, NTRK3, and CNRP1 showed strong correlation to the progression-free survival of PXA patients suggesting their potential as novel biomarkers. Overall, the findings of this study may facilitate the development of a new realm of RNA biology in PXA that may have clinical significance in the future.

AB  - JUSTIFICATION: In India, there is a lack of uniformity of treatment strategies for aplastic anemia (AA), and many children are managed only with supportive care due to non-availability of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
PROCESS: Eminent national faculty members were invited to participate in the process of forming a consensus statement in Hyderabad in July, 2016. Draft guidelines were circulated to all members, and comments received in a online meeting in October, 2020 were incorporated into the final draft. These were approved by all experts.
OBJECTIVE: To facilitate appropriate management of children with acquired aplastic anemia.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Key recommendations are: i) A bone marrow biopsy is must to make a diagnosis of AA; ii) Rule out inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS), connective tissue disorders, viral infections, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), drug or heavy metal induced marrow suppression in all cases of AA; iii) Conservative approach to transfusions should be followed, with a target to keep hemoglobin >6 g/dL in children with no co-morbidities; iv) HLA-matched sibling donor HSCT is the preferred choice of treatment for newly diagnosed very severe/ severe AA; v) In absence of HLA-matched family donor, a matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant or immunosuppressive therapy (IST) should be considered as alternate choice based on physician expertise; vi) Fludarabine, cyclophos-phamide and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) based conditioning with cyclosporine and methotrexate as graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis is the preferred regimen; vii) Horse ATG and cyclosporine are the recommended drugs for IST. One should wait for 3-6 months for the response assessment and consideration of next line therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: We report findings from a survey on the mental health impact of COVID-19 factoring environmental adversities among older adolescents (15-19 years) living in urban slums in India.
METHODS: We report survey results of 3490 older adolescents. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression, slum adversity questionnaire for slum conditions, and for COVID-19 infection we recorded self-reported positivity status. Sociodemographic details were also collected. Additional sub-group analyses of sample who had depression and tested positive for COVID-19 infection was conducted. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify factors and COVID-19 infection that were associated with depression.
RESULTS: Adolescents with adversities were three times more likely to report depression. Adolescents who reported COVID-19 infection were about two times more likely to have depression. Sub-group analyses showed that adolescents having experienced adversities and girls were more likely to report depression following COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for an intersectional research framework that incorporates stress arising out of a pandemic, social disadvantage, and systemic inequities. Such a framework will help to assess mental health issues of developmentally vulnerable groups residing in disadvantageous conditions.

AB  - There is a lack of national-level estimates on the magnitude of asthma among children in India. Hence, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of asthma among children in India. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, and included cross-sectional studies reporting data on the prevalence of asthma among children in India. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of asthma. In the 33 selected studies (pooled sample of 167,626 children), the estimated prevalence of asthma was 7.9% (95% confidence interval: 6.3-9.6%), I2 = 99.1% (P < 0.001). The prevalence was higher among boys and in urban areas. Appropriate training and resources should be made available at the primary healthcare level for early detection and management of asthma in children. A nationwide population-based survey is indicated to provide reliable estimates of the burden of asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and determinants of hypertension among adolescents in a rural area in North India.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among community-dwelling adolescents (10-19 y) and defined blood pressure as per the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2017 criteria. A pretested, semistructured questionnaire was used to elicit sociodemographic details and risk factors of hypertension. Association of factors with hypertension, z scores of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were assessed by logistic and linear regression. In multivariable regression model, for both logistic and linear regression, variables with p value < 0.2 were included, excluding collinear variables.
RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-four adolescents participated with mean (SD) age, BMI of 14.0 ± 2.6 y, 18.3 ± 3.5 kg/m2. Hypertension prevalence was 22.5% (95% CI: 19.7, 25.5) as per AAP and 15.2% (95% CI: 12.9, 17.8) as per NHBPEP criteria. Being hypertensive as per the AAP was associated with family history of noncommunicable disease (NCD) (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.86) and BMI (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.14), and as per the NHBPEP, was only associated with BMI (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.17). SBP z score was significantly associated with male sex (adjusted beta coefficient AC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.90), and weight z scores (AC = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 3.28); DBP z score was significantly associated with z scores of height (AC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.96) and waist (AC = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.30).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension among adolescents was high and was associated with BMI and family history of NCD.

T2  - Journal of Primary Care Specialties
AB  - Background: 
          Diabetes is a major contributor to hospital admissions, out-of-pocket expenditure, and premature mortality in India. Proper treatment and adequate control rates are needed to reduce the complications and deaths due to diabetes. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of community-based studies to estimate the treatment and control rate of diabetes among adults in India.
          Methods: 
          A systematic electronic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar to retrieve community-based studies which reported the prevalence of treatment and control of diabetes among adults in India, without any date or language restriction. To estimate the pooled prevalence and heterogeneity, the random-effects model and I2 statistic methods were employed. We did subgroup analyses based on study setting and type of blood test.
          Results: 
          We included seven studies in this meta-analysis, which comprised a total of 9,033 participants. The pooled prevalence of treatment and control of diabetes among adults in India was 75.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63.8%–86.2%) and 56.4% (95% CI: 44.7%–67.9%), respectively. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P < 0.001). The subgroup analysis based on the study setting revealed a decrease in heterogeneity among the urban studies for the control of diabetes.
          Conclusions: 
          Three-fourths of the diagnosed (self-reported) diabetic patients were on treatment. Of these, half of the patients had adequate glycemic control. Targeted actions need to focus on the determinants of adherence to medication and follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: 
          Traumatic neck injuries (TNIs) constitute 5%–10% of all trauma cases. These injuries can be caused by either penetrating or blunt trauma. Patients can have a varied presentation like cut injury over the neck, bleeding, neck swelling, breathing difficulty, dysphagia, etc.
          Methods: 
          This was a retrospective observational study conducted at a level I trauma center in India from January 2016 to March 2020. One hundred thirty patients who required admission and intervention due to TNIs were included in this study.
          Results: 
          One hundred thirty patients with neck injuries were included in this study. Males were predominant (91.5%) with the age ranging from 10 to 70 years. The most common mechanism of injury was physical assault (40.7%), followed by road traffic injury (23.8%) and self-inflicted injuries (18.4%). Penetrating trauma was predominant. Open neck wound with bleeding was the most common presenting symptom. Zone II injuries were more common (83.8%) followed by zone I (12.3%) and zone III (3.8%). Soft tissue injury including skin, platysma breach, and strap muscle injury was present in 46.9% of patients. Laryngopharyngeal injury was present in 13.8%, tracheal injury in 28.5%, vascular injury in 13.8%, and esophageal injury in 4.6% of patients.
          Conclusion: 
          Penetrating neck trauma is more common than blunt in developing countries like India. Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol guides the initial management. The definitive management depends on the type and mechanism of injury, anatomical level, severity, and the organ injured.

AB  - There is a lot of ambiguity in the usage of correct terminology in the description of vascular malformations and tumors. Hemangioma and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are the most commonly used terms and are the mostly incorrectly used as well! The aim of this review article was to lay out the correct nomenclature and describe the correct usage for the physicians and radiologists involved in diagnosing and managing these lesions. We describe the various classification systems which have been devised to define the multiple entities included under vascular anomalies. The latest classification system that should be adhered to is per the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies, approved at the 20th ISSVA Workshop held in Melbourne in April 2014, last revised in May 2018. The main features of the latest revision have been highlighted. This classification, however, does not list the diagnostic clinico-radiological features for each entity. In addition, guidelines regarding the appropriate use of available imaging modalities are lacking in the literature. We, hereby, aim to address these pertinent issues in this review article.

AB  - A 54-year-old man, with history of undergoing deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) 20 months ago, presented with mature senile cataract in the same eye. While undergoing phacoemulsification, a large, central Descemet membrane detachment (DMD) was noted, separating the donor cornea from the host predescemetic layer. No DM tears were noted. Stromal puncture was done at the graft host junction to reduce the extent of DMD. This was followed by a large intracameral air bubble insertion, which resulted in complete resolution of DMD on the first postoperative day. DMD during hydration of wound is a unique complication to be anticipated while doing cataract surgery in an operated DALK eye.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of DTI in differentiation of renal allograft rejection from well-functioning stable allograft, using fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values.
METHODS: In this prospective study, 22 transplant recipients with well-functioning stable allograft (group A) and 20 patients with renal allograft rejection (group B + C) were recruited over a period of 19 months from January 2018 to July 2019. DTI-MRI was performed in all the patients, and FA and ADC values were measured in cortical and medullary regions of the transplanted kidney. On biopsy, graft rejection was classified as acute (group B) (n = 7) and chronic graft rejection (group C) (n = 13) based on the BANNF scoring system. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA v.14.0.
RESULTS: Statistically significant difference between group A and group B + C was noted for cortical (p < 0.001), and medullary (p = 0.003) FA values, and cortical (p = 0.020), and medullary (p = 0.046) ADC values. Cortical(p < 0.001) and Medullary(p = 0.020) FA values showed statistically significant difference between group A and group C, and cortical FA value(p = 0.012) also showed statistically significant difference between group B and group C. AUC (to differentiate between renal allograft rejection and well-functioning stable allograft) for cortical, and medullary FA values and cortical and medullary ADC values were 0.853(p < 0.001), 0.757(p = 0.004), 0.709(p = 0.021) and 0.736(p = 0.009), respectively.
CONCLUSION AND ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: DTI is a promising functional MRI technique for the non-invasive assessment of renal allograft function. Diffusion parameters, such as FA and ADC values, can be useful in the differentiation of renal allograft rejection from well-functioning stable allograft.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Primary spinal glioblastoma (GBM) are very rare tumors of the spinal cord, with dismal prognosis and their exact management is controversial. We attempt to formulate treatment guidelines for these extremely rare tumors based on our institutional experience and a comprehensive review of the literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study from 2008 to 2020, all the patients diagnosed with primary spinal GBM who underwent surgery at our institution were included. Clinical data were retrieved from case files, outpatient records and telephonic follow-up. Data on postoperative chemoradiation was noted in all the patients. The final diagnosis of spinal GBM was confirmed as per the histopathology reports. Patients who could not be followed up and those with prior history of cranial GBM were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: Nine patients were followed up and a median survival of 11 months was noted. Chemotherapy with TMZ and radiotherapy to the whole craniospinal axis significantly improved survival in these patients. The extent of surgical resection was not shown to be significant. Intracranial metastasis was the leading cause of mortality in such patients. Three patients developed documented intracranial metastasis during the course of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Low threshold must be kept in mind in diagnosing patients with high-grade spinal cord intramedullary tumors in view of the rapidly progressing nature of the disease. In case of positive histopathological diagnosis of spinal GBM, the whole craniospinal axis should be imaged and any cranial metastasis which was originally missed during initial workup could be given appropriate radiotherapy.

The survey was undertaken between June 2021 and October 2022. It was largely representative of the population as 577,239 people were from households of 26 districts of Delhi, Jharkhand and Gujarat. The survey population aged 15 to 65 years. 473,970 people were screened for anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts (if scores severe on screening). Conditions which they were facing were explored by a semi structured script accompanied with PHQ4 as a screening tool. The overall response rate was 87.79%. This paper presents selected findings for the pattern and sociodemographic profile of the people screened. Inferences and conclusion: People who identify as LGBTQIA2S+ reported higher proportions of moderate and severe mental health issues. Respondents <18 contributed higher proportions of moderate and severe mental issues. Unmarried, divorced, separated and widowed people reported to face higher proportions of moderate and severe mental issues. Unemployed people and students reported higher proportions of moderate and severe mental issues.</p>

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Management of "failing" and "failed" Fontan circulation, particularly the indications, timing, and type of re-intervention, currently remains nebulous. Factors contributing to pathogenesis and mortality following Fontan procedure differ between children and adults.
METHODS: Since organ systems in individual patients are affected differently, we searched the extant literature for a "failing" and "failed" Fontan reviewing the clinical phenotypes, diagnostic modalities, pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical techniques employed, and their outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 410 investigations were synthesised. Although proper candidate selection, thoughtful technical modifications, timely deployment of mechanical support devices, tissue-engineered conduits, and Fontan takedown have decreased the peri-operative mortality from 9 to 15% and 1 to 3% per cent in recent series, pernicious changes in organ function are causing long-term patient attrition. In the setting of a failed Fontan circulation, literature documents three surgical options: Fontan revision, Fontan conversion, or cardiac transplantation. The reported morbidity of 25% and mortality of 8-10% among Fontan conversion continue to improve in select institutions. While operative mortality following cardiac transplantation for Fontan failure is 30% higher than for other CHDs, there is no difference in long-term survival with actuarial 10-year survival of around 54%. Mechanical circulatory assistance, stem cells, and tissue-engineered Fontan conduit for destination therapy or as a bridge to transplantation are in infancy for failing Fontan circulation.
CONCLUSIONS: An individualised management strategy according to clinical phenotypes may delay the organ damage in patients with a failing Fontan circulation. At present, cardiac transplantation remains the last stage of palliation with gradually improving outcomes.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) incidence is increasing in India, and we need well-trained breast surgeons to deliver quality care to patients. However, BC surgery training in India is highly variable, evolving slowly and needs to be structured urgently. This article summarises the challenges and way forward for BC surgery training in India.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The phenotypic features and morphogenesis of the 'sinus venosus defect' remain controversial. The phenotypic features are anomalous systemic connections of 1 or more pulmonary veins that retain their left atrial connection, usually associated with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein. Cases with these features, however, have not always been described as sinus venosus defects.
METHODS: We reviewed the findings documented in the literature from 11 patients with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein, most reported following an autopsy examination. We compared these findings with the anatomical details of 50 patients undergoing surgical correction in our centre, paying particular attention to the override of the superior caval vein.
RESULTS: In only two-thirds of those undergoing surgery did the superior caval vein override the rims of the oval fossa, with the degree of override >50% in only 2 individuals. It is only these latter 2 cases that are directly comparable to the reported cases of biatrial connection of the superior caval vein.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comparisons provide new insights into the developmental background and phenotypic features of the superior sinus venosus defect. The defects exist because of the anomalous systemic connection of the pulmonary veins that retain their left atrial connections but not always in association with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein. In extreme cases, nonetheless, they can underscore the connection of the caval vein to the morphologically left atrium, frequently described previously as a 'biatrial connection'. The sinus venosus defect is better considered a venovenous malformation than a septal defect.
