AB  - The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led the world to a standstill, causing a medical and economic crisis worldwide. This crisis has triggered an urgent need to discover a possible treatment strategy against this novel virus using already-approved drugs. The main protease (Mpro) of this virus plays a critical role in cleaving the translated polypeptides that makes it a potential drug target against COVID-19. Taking advantage of the recently discovered three-dimensional structure of Mpro, we screened approved drugs from the Drug Bank to find a possible inhibitor against Mpro using computational methods and further validating them with biochemical studies. The docking and molecular dynamics study revealed that DB04983 (denufosol) showed the best glide docking score, -11.884 kcal/mol, and MM-PBSA binding free energy, -10.96 kcal/mol. Cobicistat, cangrelor (previous computational studies in our lab), and denufosol (current study) were tested for the in vitro inhibitory effects on Mpro. The IC50 values of these drugs were similar to 6.7 mu M, 0.9 mM, and 1.3 mM, respectively, while the values of dissociation constants calculated using surface plasmon resonance were similar to 2.1 0.7 mu M, and 1.4 mM, respectively. We found that cobicistat is the most efficient inhibitor of Mpro both in silico and in vitro. In conclusion, cobicistat, which is already an FDA-approved drug being used against HIV, may serve as a good inhibitor against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that, in turn, can help in combating COVID-19, and these results can also form the basis for the rational structure-based drug design against COVID-19.

AB  - In context of the ongoing multi-centric HPV vaccine study in India, unvaccinated married women (N = 1484) aged 18-23 years were recruited in 2012-2015 as age-matched controls to the vaccinated women and followed up yearly. We assess type-specific prevalence, natural history and potential determinants of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in these unvaccinated women. Cervical samples were collected yearly for at least four consecutive years. A Multiplex Type-Specific E7-Based polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect 21 HPV types.
   HPV prevalence was 36.4% during 6 years. Most common HPV types were 16 (6.5%) and 31 (6.1%). Highest persistence were observed for HPV 35 (62.5%) and 52 (25%). New HPV acquisition rate was 5.6/1000 person-months of observation (PMO), highest for HPV 16 (1.1/1000 PMO). Type-specific clearance rates ranged between 2.9-5.5/100 PMO. HPV 16 and/or 18 infections were 41% (95% CI 4-63%) lower among women with 2-<3 years between marriage and first cervical sample collection compared to those with <2 years. HPV prevalence and acquisition rates in young Indian women were lower than their Western counterparts. HPV 16 infections being most common shows the importance and potential impact of HPV vaccination in India. Women with 2-3 years exposure had reduced risk possibly due to higher infections clearance.

AB  - The gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is labor-intensive, expensive, and not widely available in resource-poor settings. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel, accurate, affordable, and easily accessible assays/sensors to diagnose and isolate COVID-19 cases. To address this unmet need, we utilized the catalytic potential of peroxidase-like DNAzyme and developed a simple visual detection assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using a conventional thermal cycler by the PCR-induced generation of DNAzyme sensor. The performance of RT-PCR DNAzyme-based sensor was comparable to that of real-time PCR. The pilot scale validation of RT-PCR DNAzyme-based sensor has shown similar to 100% sensitivity and specificity in clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swab, n = 34), with a good correlation (Spearman r = 0.799) with the Ct-value of fluorescence probe-based real-time PCR. These findings clearly indicate the potential of this inexpensive, sensitive, and specific molecular diagnostic test to extend our testing capabilities for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail COVID-19 transmission.

AB  - Melanoma associated antigen (MAGE) is an extensively studied family of tumor-associated genes that share a common MAGE homology domain (MHD). Based upon their expression pattern, MAGE genes have been broadly classified into type 1 MAGEs (T1Ms) and type 2 MAGEs (T2Ms) categories. Interestingly, several T2Ms are highly expressed in the brain and involved in the regulation of neuronal development, differentiation, and survival. Available literature suggests possible tumor suppressor functions of a few T2Ms, while information available about their expression, regulation, and clinical significance in glioma is scanty. This prompted us to perform a comprehensive analysis of T2M expression in glioma. Gene expression data from glioma datasets: Oncomine, TCGA, and REMBRANDT study, were used to assess the mRNA expression of T2M genes (MAGED1, MAGED2, MAGED3, MAGED4, MAGED4B, MAGEE1, MAGEE2, MAGEF1, MAGEH1, MAGEL2, NSMCE3, and NDN), and their association with clinical characteristics and composition of the tumor microenvironment. Further, mutation, copy number alteration, and DNA methylation data from TCGA were assessed for determining potential mechanisms of T2Ms expression in glioma. Expression analysis revealed overexpression of MAGED subfamily genes in glioma, while other genes of this family exhibited reduced expression in advanced grades of this malignancy. Further, the expression of T2Ms exhibited varying extent of positive correlations with each other. Amongst downregulated T2Ms, MAGEH1 expression exhibited negative correlations with DNA methylation. Additionally, genes associated with MAGEH1 were enriched in Myc and Hedgehog signaling. Furthermore, T2Ms downregulation was associated with immune infiltration in glioma tissues and poor overall survival of glioma patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, MAGEH1 emerged as an independent prognosticator in lower grade glioma. Conclusively, these results suggest that expression of T2Ms is associated with important clinical and molecular features in glioma. Mechanistic studies may further provide novel insights into their role in glioma progression.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability. This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden, including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
   Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285 million) in 1990 to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95% UI: 133 to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95% UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in 2019.
   Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries. There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.

AB  - Hydroxychloroquine has gained much attention as one of the candidate drugs that can be repurposed as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high transmissibility and presence of asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic transmission, there is need for a chemoprophylactic agent to protect the high-risk population. In this review, we dissect the currently available evidence on hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis from a clinical and pharmacological point of view. In vitro studies on Vero cells show that hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by affecting viral entry and viral transport via endolysosomes. However, this efficacy has failed to replicate in in vivo animal models as well as in most clinical observational studies and clinical trials assessing pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis in healthcare workers. An analysis of the pharmacology of HCQ in COVID-19 reveals certain possible reasons for this failure-a pharmacokinetic failure due to failure to achieve adequate drug concentration at the target site and attenuation of its inhibitory effect due to the presence of TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells. Currently, many clinical trials on HCQ prophylaxis in HCW are ongoing; these factors should be taken into account. Using higher doses of HCQ for prophylaxis is likely to be associated with increased safety concerns; thus, it may be worthwhile to focus on other possible interventions.

AB  - Background Chordoma is a rare, slow growing and locally aggressive mesenchymal neoplasm with uncommon distant metastases. It is a chemo-resistant disease with surgery and radiotherapy being the mainstay in treatment of localized disease. In advanced disease imatinib has a role. We report a case of metastatic sacral chordoma with symptomatic and radiological response to erlotinib post-progression on imatinib. Case presentation A 48-year-old male with a sacral chordoma underwent partial sacrectomy followed by post-operative radiotherapy. Upon recurrence he received palliative radiotherapy to hemipelvis and was offered therapy with imatinib. However, the disease was refractory to imatinib and he was started on treatment with erlotinib-showing a partial response on imaging at two months. He is currently doing well at 13 months since start of erlotinib. Conclusions As seen in previously reported cases, erlotinib is a therapeutic option in advanced chordoma, even in imatinib refractory cases and thus warrants exploration of its therapeutic role in prospective clinical trials.

AB  - The clonal evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an oligoclonal hematological malignancy, is driven by a plethora of cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations, abnormal epigenetic patterns, and aberrant gene expressions. These alterations in the leukemic blasts promote clinically diverse manifestations with common characteristics of high relapse and drug resistance. Defining and real-time monitoring of a personalized panel of these predictive genetic biomarkers is rapidly being adapted in clinical setting for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision-making in AML. A major challenge remains the frequency of invasive biopsy procedures that can be routinely performed for monitoring of AML disease progression. Moreover, a single-site biopsy is not representative of the tumor heterogeneity as it is spatially and temporally constrained and necessitates the understanding of longitudinal and spatial subclonal dynamics in AML. Hematopoietic cells are a major contributor to plasma cell-free DNA, which also contain leukemia-specific aberrations as the circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) fraction. Plasma cell-free DNA analysis holds immense potential as a minimally invasive tool for genomic profiling at diagnosis as well as clonal evolution during AML disease progression. With the technological advances and increasing sensitivity for detection of ctDNA, both genetic and epigenetic aberrations can be qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. However, challenges remain in validating the utility of liquid biopsy tools in clinics, and universal recommendations are still awaited towards reliable diagnostics and prognostics. Here, we provide an overview on the scope of ctDNA analyses for prognosis, assessment of response to treatment and measurable residual disease, prediction of disease relapse, development of acquired resistance and beyond in AML.

AB  - Immunotherapy is an efficient way to cure cancer by modulating the patient's immune response. However, the immunotherapy response is heterogeneous and varies between individual patients and cancer subtypes, reinforcing the need for early benefit predictors. Evaluating the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor and changes in cell-intrinsic tumor characteristics provide potential response markers to treatment. However, this approach requires invasive sampling and may not be suitable for real-time monitoring of treatment response. The recent emergence of quantitative imaging biomarkers provides promising opportunities. In vivo imaging technologies that interrogate T cell responses, metabolic activities, and immune microenvironment could offer a powerful tool to monitor the cancer response to immunotherapy. Advances in imaging techniques to identify tumors' immunological characteristics can help stratify patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapy. This review discusses the metabolic events that occur during T cell activation and differentiation, anti-cancer immunotherapy-induced T cell responses, focusing on non-invasive imaging techniques to monitor T cell metabolism in the search for novel biomarkers of response to cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: In traditional medicine, Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as liquorice, is known to possess promising pharmacological properties including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, gastro, hepato and nephro-protective activities.
   Aim: The present study investigated the protective effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra rhizome extract (GGE) on MTX-induced hepato-renal damage in Wistar albino rats.
   Materials and methods: Rats were pre-treated with GGE (100, 200 or 400 mg/kg) from day 1 to 15 and administered MTX (20 mg/kg) on day 4. Methotrexate-induced hepato-renal damage was assessed by serum toxicity biomarkers (AST, ALT, BUN and creatinine), oxidative stress estimation (MDA, GSH, SOD, CAT, peroxidase and glutathione reductase), interleukins profiling (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-12), tissue histopathology and immunohistochemical (caspase-3 and NFkB) examination.
   Results: MTX induced hepato-renal damage resulted in elevated serum levels of AST, ALT, BUN and creatinine, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines concentration and accumulation of MDA and reduced levels of GSH, SOD, CAT, peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Conversely, co-treatment with GGE dose-dependently ameliorated oxidative stress, serum interleukins, hepato-renal toxicity biomarkers (p < 0.001), preserved tissue architecture and downregulated both caspase-3 and NFkB expression in hepato-renal tissue.
   Conclusion: The above results suggested that GGE can alleviate MTX-induced hepato-renal damage by decreasing oxidative stress and suppressing the ensuing activation of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory pathways.

AB  - Biallelic mutations in the genes encoding CD27 or its ligand CD70 underlie inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) characterized predominantly by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated immune dysregulation, such as chronic viremia, severe infectious mononucleosis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), lymphoproliferation, and malignancy. A comprehensive understanding of the natural history, immune characteristics, and transplant outcomes has remained elusive. Here, in a multi-institutional global collaboration, we collected the clinical information of 49 patients from 29 families (CD27, n = 33; CD70, n = 16), including 24 previously unreported individuals and identified a total of 16 distinct mutations in CD27, and 8 in CD70, respectively. The majority of patients (90%) were EBV1 at diagnosis, but only similar to 30% presented with infectious mononucleosis. Lymphoproliferation and lymphoma were the main clinical manifestations (70% and 43%, respectively), and 9 of the CD27-deficient patients developed HLH. Twenty-one patients (43%) developed autoinflammatory features including uveitis, arthritis, and periodic fever. Detailed immunological characterization revealed aberrant generation of memory B and T cells, including a paucity of EBV-specific T cells, and impaired effector function of CD81 T cells, thereby providing mechanistic insight into cellular defects underpinning the clinical features of disrupted CD27/CD70 signaling. Nineteen patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) prior to adulthood predominantly because of lymphoma, with 95% survival without disease recurrence. Our data highlight the marked predisposition to lymphoma of both CD27- and CD70-deficient patients. The excellent outcome after HSCT supports the timely implementation of this treatment modality particularly in patients presenting with malignant transformation to lymphoma.

AB  - Posttraumatic aphakia is a serious deterrent to visual rehabilitation that usually follows sensory exotropia, thereby mandating urgent surgical intervention. In addition, abnormal iris configuration and iris defects postocular trauma can lead to amblyopia and glare and require surgical correction. However, in individuals where such multiple posttraumatic extraocular and intraocular abnormalities coexist, confusion remains about whether to perform sequential or concomitant surgeries. In these situations, an unusual triple technique consisting of strabismus correction, glued scleral fixation of intraocular lens, and single-pass 4 throw pupilloplasty is a useful cost-effective method of single stage visual and cosmetic rehabilitation. However, it requires collaboration of experienced surgeons form multiple ophthalmic subspecialties. Copyright (c) 2020 Published by Wolters Kluwer on behalf of ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Infrared thermal screening, via the use of handheld non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) and thermal scanners, has been widely implemented all over the world. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate its diagnostic accuracy for the detection of fever. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, COVID-19 research database, Epistemonikos, EPPI-Centre, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Scopus and Web of Science databases for studies where a non-contact infrared device was used to detect fever against a reference standard of conventional thermometers. Forest plots and Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves were used to describe the pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. From a total of 1063 results, 30 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, of which 19 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.808 (95%CI 0.656-0.903) and 0.920 (95%CI 0.769-0.975), respectively, for the NCITs (using forehead as the site of measurement), and 0.818 (95%CI 0.758-0.866) and 0.923 (95%CI 0.823-0.969), respectively, for thermal scanners. The sensitivity of NCITs increased on use of rectal temperature as the reference. The sensitivity of thermal scanners decreased in a disease outbreak/pandemic setting. Changes approaching statistical significance were also observed on the exclusion of neonates from the analysis. Thermal screening had a low positive predictive value, especially at the initial stage of an outbreak, whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) continued to be high even at later stages. Thermal screening has reasonable diagnostic accuracy in the detection of fever, although it may vary with changes in subject characteristics, setting, index test and the reference standard used. Thermal screening has a good NPV even during a pandemic. The policymakers must take into consideration the factors surrounding the screening strategy while forming ad-hoc guidelines.

KW  - Case report
AB  - Introduction: The SCARE Guidelines were first published in 2016 and were last updated in 2018. They provide a structure for reporting surgical case reports and are used and endorsed by authors, journal editors and reviewers, in order to increase robustness and transparency in reporting surgical cases. They must be kept up to date in order to drive forwards reporting quality. As such, we have updated these guidelines via a DELPHI consensus exercise.
   Methods: The updated guidelines were produced via a DELPHI consensus exercise. Members were invited from the previous DELPHI group, as well as editorial board members and peer reviewers of the International Journal of Surgery Case Reports. The expert group completed an online survey to indicate their agreement with proposed changes to the checklist items.
   Results: A total of 54 surgical experts agreed to participate and 53 (98%) completed the survey. The responses and suggested modifications were incorporated into the new 2020 guideline. There was a high degree of agreement amongst the SCARE Group, with all modified SCARE items receiving over 70% scores 7-9.
   Conclusion: A DELPHI consensus exercise was completed and an updated and improved SCARE Checklist is now presented.

AB  - Objectives:
   Intracranial pressure monitoring plays a critical role in the management of severe traumatic brain injury. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of optic nerve sheath diameter as a noninvasive screening test for the detection of elevated intracranial pressure and prediction of intracranial pressure treatment intensity.
   Design:
   Prospective, blinded study of diagnostic accuracy.
   Setting:
   Neurotrauma ICU.
   Subjects:
   Consecutive patients with severe traumatic brain injury.
   Interventions:
   Optic nerve ultrasound was performed daily and optic nerve ultrasound measured at the point-of-care as well as remotely by an expert blinded to all patient details. Optic disc elevation was also measured. The index test was the highest remote-expert optic nerve ultrasound for the admission. The reference standard was the concurrent invasive intracranial pressure, with test-positivity set at intracranial pressure greater than 22 mm Hg. A priori the minimally acceptable sensitivity threshold was 90% with corresponding specificity 60%. We also evaluated the ability of optic nerve ultrasound to predict a therapeutic intensity level greater than 10.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   One hundred twenty patients were enrolled. The intraclass correlation coefficient between point of care and expert optic nerve sheath diameter after enrollment of 50 subjects was poor at 0.16 (-0.08 to 0.41) but improved to 0.87 (0.81-0.92) for the remaining subjects after remedial training. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of the highest expert-measured optic nerve sheath diameter to detect intracranial pressure greater than 22 mm Hg was 0.81 (0.73-0.87); area under the curve for prediction of therapeutic intensity level greater than 10 was 0.51 (0.42-0.60). Optic nerve sheath diameter greater than 0.72 demonstrated sensitivity 82% (48-98%) and specificity 79% (70-86%) for intracranial pressure greater than 22 mm Hg. The area under the curve of highest measured optic disc elevation to detect intracranial pressure greater than 22 mm Hg was 0.84 (0.76-0.90). Optic disc elevation greater than 0.04 cm attained sensitivity 90% (56-100%) and specificity 71% (61-79%).
   Conclusions:
   While optic nerve sheath diameter demonstrated a modest, statistically significant correlation with intracranial pressure, a predetermined level of diagnostic accuracy to justify routine clinical use as a screening test was not achieved. Measurement of optic disc elevation appears promising for the detection of elevated intracranial pressure, however, verification from larger studies is necessary.

KW  - HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY
KW  - BODY-MASS INDEX
KW  - STIFFNESS
AB  - Background & objectives: Slow breathing increases parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in healthy individuals, also similarly observed in yoga practitioners. Pranayama which is an important component of yoga when practiced at a slow pace was at a respiratory frequency of around 0.1 Hz (6 breaths/min). Therefore, it was hypothesized that yoga practitioners might have adapted to slow breathing. This study was aimed to decipher the role of yoga on cardiovascular variability during slow breathing (0.1 Hz) in yoga practitioners. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in naive-to-yoga individuals (n=40) and yoga practitioners (n=40) with an average age of 31.08 +/- 7.31 and 29.93 +/- 7.57 yr, respectively. The analysis of heart rate variability, blood pressure variability (BPV) and BRS during spontaneous and slow breathing was compared between the two groups. Results: During slow breathing, the heart rate (P<0.01) was lower, respiratory rate interval (P<0.05) and pNN50 per cent (P=0.01) were higher, mean systolic BP (SBP) (P<0.05) and SDSD (Standard deviation of successive beat to beat systolic blood pressure differences) (P<0.01) of SBP variability were lower with sequence BRS (P<0.001) and alpha low frequency (P<0.01) and alpha high frequency (P<0.001) of spectral BRS were higher in yoga practitioners. Interpretation & conclusions: The present study indicated higher parasympathetic activity and BRS with lower SBP variability at rest and during slow breathing in yoga practitioners compared to naive group. Findings indicate that the short-term practice of slow breathing complements the augmented parasympathetic activity and BRS in the yoga group.

AB  - We report the synthesis of multifunctional plasmonic magnetic nanocomposites of iron oxide and gold. Sodium alginate is thiolated and grafted with hydrophobic amine-terminated poly butyl methacrylate (PBMA-NH2). The nanocomposites are conjugated with PBMA-NH2 grafted thiolated sodium alginate (TSA) for dispersion stability and enhancing the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of anti-cancer drugs. The nanocomposites are physico-chemically characterized and their contrast properties for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in phantom agarose gel are evaluated. The nanocomposites exhibit a reduction in transverse relaxation time (T-2) from 94 milliseconds to 5.8 milliseconds on increasing the concentration of the nanocomposites (corresponding to 0.5 mu g/mL to 50 mu g/mL of iron). Paclitaxel (PTX) is encapsulated in the nanocomposites coated with hydrophobically modified TSA and an increment of 9% in EE is achieved as compared to the nanocomposites coated with TSA alone. PTX loaded nanocomposites offer higher efficacy (similar to 10 %) as compared to PTX on PLC/PRF/5 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

AB  - The procedure of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) was introduced in 2011, and since then there has been an increase in the number of cases undergoing this procedure worldwide. The surgery has a learning curve and may be associated with problems in the intraoperative and postoperative periods. The intraoperative problems during SMILE surgery include the loss of suction, the occurrence of altered or irregular opaque bubble layer and black spots, difficulty in lenticular dissection and extraction, cap perforation, incision-related problems, and decentered ablation. Most of the postoperative problems are similar as in other laser refractive procedures, but with decreased incidence. The identification of risk factors, clinical features, and management of complications of SMILE help to obtain optimum refractive outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Primary closure of common bile duct (CBD) after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is now becoming the preferred technique for closure of choledochotomy. Primary CBD closure not only circumvents the disadvantages of an external biliary drainage but also adds to the advantage of LCBDE. Here, we describe our experience of primary CBD closure following 355 cases of LCBDE in a single surgical unit at a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: All patients undergoing LCBDE in a single surgical unit were included in the study. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters including the technique of CBD closure were recorded prospectively. The postoperative recovery, complications, hospital stay, antibiotic usage, and postoperative intervention, if any, were also recorded. Results: Three hundred fifty-five LCBDEs were performed from April 2007 to December 2018, and 143 were post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography failures. The overall success rate was 91.8%. The mean operative time was 98 +/- 26.8 minutes (range, 70 to 250 min). Transient bile leak was seen in 10% of patients and retained stones in 3 patients. Two patients required re-exploration and 2 patients died in the postoperative period. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 10 years, with a median follow-up of 72 months. No long-term complications such as CBD stricture or recurrent stones were noted. Conclusions: Primary closure of CBD after LCBDE is safe and associated with minimal complications and no long-term problems. The routine use of primary CBD closure after LCBDE is recommended based on our experience.

AB  - This study aimed to develop and validate a brief psychometric scale for gaming disorder and hazardous gaming based on the WHO framework as defined in the ICD-11. The study was carried out among college students using face to face interview. A panel of mental health experts examined the face validity of the new Gaming Disorder and Hazardous Gaming Scale (GDHGS). An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using the principle component analysis (PCA) method with direct oblimin rotation on the five items of GDHGS was used for assessment of construct validity. The results of Kaiser Meyer Olkin (KMO) measure used for sampling adequacy and Bartlett's test (BT) of sphericity used to show the appropriateness of using factor analysis, confirmed the appropriateness of EFA for the present study sample. The factor analysis extracted single component with an eigenvalue of greater than one, which was further supported by the examination of scree plot. To examine the criterion related validity of the GDHGS, correlation between GDHGS and IGDS-SF scores was assessed. Spearman correlational analysis showed strong positive correlation of GDGHS score with IGDS-SF score (rs = 0.878, p < 0.01). Further, the sum of first four item score of GDHGS among participants diagnosed with GD (median: 15.00; IQR: 15.00-15.75) was significantly greater than those without GD (median: 4.00; IQR: 3.00-6.50) according to the diagnostic interview based on the ICD-11 criteria (U = 0.000, p < 0.001). The internal consistency of GDHGS as measured by the Cronbach's alpha was 0.914. Further, the GDHGS did not have its reliability increased by removal of any of the five items included in the scale. Also, the threshold for significant floor and ceiling effect was not reached. In conclusion, GDHGS is a valid measurement scale for disorders involving gaming behaviour based on the ICD-11 construct.

AB  - y Chronic exposure to hypoxia results in cerebral white matter hyperintensities, increased P300 latency, delayed response and impairment in working memory. Despite burgeoning evidence on role of myelination in nerve conduction, the effect of chronic hypoxia on myelination of hippocampal neurons has been less studied. The present study provides novel evidence on alterations in myelination of hippocampal CA3 neurons following chronic hypoxic exposure. Sprague Dawley rats exposed to global hypobaric hypoxia simulating altitude of 25,000 ft showed progressive demyelination in CA3 hippocampal neurons on 14 days followed by remyelination on 21 and 28 days. The demyelination of CA3 neurons was associated with increased apoptosis of both oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes (OLs), peroxidation of myelin lipids, and nitration induced reduced expression of Carbonic Anhydrase II (CAII). Prolonged hypoxic exposure of 21 and 28 days on the other hand resulted in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) induced upregulation of Carbonic Anhydrase IV (CAIV) expression in mature oligodendrocytes through iNOS mediated mechanisms along with reduction in lipid peroxidation and remyelination. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity on the other hand prevented remyelination of CA3 neurons. Based on these findings we propose a novel iNOS mediated mechanism for regulation of myelination in hypoxic hippocampal neurons through class switching of carbonic anhydrases.

AB  - Introduction: The results of clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are generalized to real-world patients. This study determines the proportion of real-world patients who would be eligible for clinical trials and compares outcomes in eligible versus ineligible patients.
   Methods: Patients diagnosed with MBC from 2004 to 2015 in a large Canadian province were included. Patients with one of the following criteria were considered ineligible: the presence of comorbid conditions (anemia, uncontrolled diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, and kidney disease) or a history of immunosuppression or prior malignancy. The likelihood of receiving cancer therapy was analysed using logistic regression models and factors affecting overall survival (OS) were assessed by Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: A total of 1585 patients with MBC were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years. Of these, 512 (32.3%) patients were deemed ineligible in whom the two most common reasons for ineligibility were renal dysfunction (17.2%), and previous immunosuppression (7.8%). In the real world, ineligible patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy (29.5% vs 45.8%; P < 0.001) but not radiation treatment (7.6% vs 9.6%; P = 0.196) or hormonal therapy (57.6% vs 60.6%; P = 0.261). The 5-year OS of ineligible patients who received systemic therapy in the real-world was significantly better than those who did not.
   Conclusions: Despite being ineligible for clinical trials based on common eligibility criteria, many real-world patients receive systemic treatment and derive possible benefit. Broadening of inclusion criteria in clinical trials will enhance the representation of real-world patients and increase the generalizability of results. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Active learning promotes the capacity of problem solving and decision making among learners. Teachers who apply instructional processes toward active participation of learners help their students develop higher order thinking skills. Due to the recent paradigm shift toward adopting competency-based curricula in the education of healthcare professionals in India, there is an emergent need for physiology instructors to be trained in active-learning methodologies and to acquire abilities to promote these curriculum changes. To address these issues, a series of International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) workshops on physiology education techniques in four apex centers in India was organized in November 2018 and November 2019. The "hands-on" workshops presented the methodologies of case-based learning, problem-based learning, and flipped classroom; the participants were teachers of basic sciences and human and veterinary medicine. The workshop series facilitated capacity building and creation of a national network of physiology instructors interested in promoting active-learning techniques. The workshops were followed by a brainstorming meeting held to assess the outcomes. The aim of this report is to provide a model for implementing a coordinated series of workshops to support national curriculum change and to identify the organizational elements essential for conducting an effective Physiology Education workshop. The essential elements include a highly motivated core organizing team, constant dialogue between core organizing and local organizing committees, a sufficient time frame for planning and execution of the event, and opportunities to engage students at host institutions in workshop activities.

AB  - Objective: Developmental bony craniovertebral junction (CVJ) anomalies seem to have a genetic basis and also abnormal joint morphology causing atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) and basilar invagination (BI).
   Methods: DNA extracted polymerase chain reaction single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) performed for mutation screening of FBN1 gene (n = 50 cases+ 50 age/sex-matched normal; total: 100). Samples with a deviated pattern of bands in SSCP were sequenced to detect the type of variation. Computed tomography (CT) scans of 100 patients (15-45 years old) compared with an equal number of age/sex-matched controls (21.9 +/- 8.2 years). Joint parameters studied: sagittal joint inclination (SI), craniocervical tilt (CO), coronal joint inclination (CI).
   Results: Thirty-nine samples (78%) showed sequence variants. Exon 25, 26, 27, and 28 showed variable patterns of DNA bands in SSCP, which on sequencing gives various types of DNA sequence variations in intronic region of the FBN1 gene in 14%, 14%, 6%, and 44% respectively. CT radiology: SI and CCT correlated with both BI and AAD (p < 0.01). The mean SI value in controls: 83.35 degrees +/- 8.65 degrees, and in patients with BI and AAD:129 degrees +/- 24.05 degrees. Mean CCT in controls: 60.2 degrees +/- 9.2 degrees, and in patients with BI and AAD: 86.0 degrees +/- 18.1 degrees. Mean CI in controls:110.3 degrees +/- 4.23 degrees, and in cases: 125.15 degrees +/- 16.4 degrees.
   Conclusion: The study showed mutations in FBN1 gene (reported in Marfan syndrome). There is also an alteration of joint morphology, correlating with AAD and 131 severity. Hence, we propose a double-hit hypothesis: the presence of weak ligaments (due to FB1 gene alterations) and abnormal joint morphology may contribute to AAD and BI.

AB  - Background:
   Drug-related hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare acute hypersensitivity reaction to therapeutic agents. Reports of antitubercular drugs causing hypersensitivity myocarditis are not described in literature.
   Methods:
   Retrospective chart review of children admitted between January 1, 2016, and March 31, 2019, was conducted to identify children receiving antitubercular drugs who were diagnosed with hypersensitivity myocarditis.
   Results:
   Three children (2 girls), who had hypersensitivity myocarditis due to antitubercular therapy, were identified. Cases 1 and 2 developed hypersensitivity myocarditis due to rifampicin, and isoniazid-rifampicin combination, respectively, on reintroduction of drugs, while case 3 developed hypersensitivity to streptomycin on first exposure. All children developed symptoms within minutes to hours of starting the offending drugs. Severe myocardial dysfunction leading to shock and pulmonary edema was seen in cases 1 and 3, while case 2 presented with wide QRS complex ventricular rhythm with bradycardia and hypotensive shock. Cases 1 and 2 were treated with steroids. Cases 1 and 3 received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. First 2 children survived while third died of refractory shock. Total serum IgE levels were elevated in all children (range: 161-3053 kU/L).
   Conclusion:
   Hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare but life-threatening adverse effect of antitubercular drugs. Prompt diagnosis of hypersensitivity myocarditis and timely steroid therapy can be lifesaving.

AB  - Purpose: To compare epilepsy-related injuries in untreated or inadequately treated patients and patients on adequate treatment.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional case-control study, seizure-related injuries in patients who were either on no treatment or inadequate treatment were compared with another group of patients receiving appropriate evidence-based epilepsy treatment. The inadequately treated patients or 'cases' were drawn from an outreach epilepsy clinic while the adequately treated patients or 'controls' were recruited from a tertiary care facility providing comprehensive epilepsy management.
   Results: The odds of injury were eight times higher in inadequately treated patients or cases compared to the adequately treated patients or controls. After adjusting for gender, epilepsy duration, seizure frequency, current medication, and number of AEDs, the odds of injury were 15. 8 times higher in the cases. Major injuries such as burns, fractures, and tooth injuries were also higher in the cases.
   Conclusion: Untreated or inadequately treated epilepsy patients have a significantly higher risk of injuries. With adequate treatment, some of the risks of injury can be mitigated.

AB  - Electric and electronic waste materials (e-waste) serve as a reservoir of highly persistent and extremely toxic inorganic and organic hazardous materials, including per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) compounds. Besides the electric and electronic industry, PFAS remain an important industrial chemical class because PFAS coating on consumer goods increases their mechanical and thermochemical resistance as well as to tune their liquid repellence properties to oil and water. The release of PFAS from e-waste processing sites and storage landfills into wastewaters was reviewed. It appears that e-waste materials in landfills serve as important nodes for PFAS diffusion to water, soil, hence exerting ecotoxicity on exposed human populations. Evidence from crosssectional, case-control, and longitudinal studies show that co-occurrence of PFAS and other e-waste toxicants in body fluids and organs of humans act synergistically in causing several health disorders. Based on holistic analyses, the review highlights that PFAS compounds significantly contribute to e-waste pollution, which needs immediate attention from policymakers.

AB  - Background: Childhood epilepsy forms a significant burden on the health-care delivery system. Only a few pediatric neurologists available in most of the developing countries and caregivers face a lot of financial and logistic hardships, apart from a long waiting period for initial and follow up visits. Telemedicine is a proposed effective alternative in overcoming this burden.
   Methods: Telephonic consultation by a pediatric neurology fellow was compared with that of a specialty nurse; both against face-to-face consultation (gold standard). Care-givers of children 4 months-18 years with epilepsy were telephonically consulted 24-48 hours before their scheduled hospital appointment by one specialty nurse and one pediatric neurology fellow at least 24 h apart in a random sequence. During the hospital visit, another pediatric neurology fellow blinded to the telephonic consultation, documented the same after Face-to-Face interview.
   Results: In 141 children with epilepsy, 504 critical clinical events were identified. Telephonic consultation by pediatric neurology fellow had a sensitivity of 99 %, 97 %, and 100 % and specificity of 100 % each in detecting whether the child had any breakthrough seizure, any adverse event and whether the drug compliance was adequate or poor respectively, as compared to face-to-face consultation. Telephonic consultation by specialty nurse had a sensitivity of 91 %, 84 %, and 98 % and specificity of 97 %, 99 %, and 81 % in detecting whether the child had any breakthrough seizure, adverse event and whether the drug compliance was adequate or poor respectively. But the specialty nurses fared poorly in identifying atypical seizure semiologies like atonic and myoclonic seizures and documenting an exact number of breakthrough seizures, as well as few subjective adverse effects like behavioral abnormality and scholastic worsening, which was performed excellently by the pediatric neurology fellow.
   Conclusions: Telephonic consultation in childhood epilepsy by pediatric neurology fellow has excellent sensitivity and specificity. A specialty nurse has also acceptable sensitivity and specificity in comparison with a face-to-face consultation.

AB  - Introduction: Despite reports of a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the coastal Uddanam region of Andhra Pradesh, India, there are no accurate data on the distribution of kidney function abnormalities and CKD risk factors in this region.
   Methods: A total of 2419 participants were recruited through multistage cluster random sampling from 67 villages. Serum creatinine and urine protein creatinine ratio were measured using validated methodologies. All abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine protein creatinine ratio values were reconfirmed after 3 months. A range of sociodemographic factors were evaluated for their association with CKD using Poisson regression.
   Results: Of 2402 eligible subjects (mean 1 SD age, 45.67 +/- 13.29 years; 51% female), 506 (21.07%) had CKD (mean 1 SD age, 51.79 +/- 13.12 years; 41.3% female). A total of 246 (10.24%) had eGFR 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), whereas 371 (15.45%) had an elevated urine protein creatinine ratio (0.15 or 0.15, except a lower frequency of males in the former.
   Conclusion: We confirmed the high prevalence of CKD in the adult population of Uddanam. The cause was not apparent in a majority. Subjects with a low eGFR with or without elevated proteinuria were phenotypically distinct from those with proteinuria and preserved eGFR. Our data suggest the need to apply a population-based approach to screening and prevention and studies to understand the causes of CKD in this region.

AB  - Background: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is the vascular and locally aggressive tumor of the posterior nares and nasopharynx. Endoscopic excision is the preferred surgical modality in early Radkowski stages. The prime challenge is intraoperative bleeding. Literature is in favor of the use of plasma ablation to overcome surgical challenges.
   Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of plasma ablation technique in the surgical management of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Materials and methods: The current study recruited 36 patients of clinico-radiologically diagnosed cases of primary JNA of stage I and II (Modified Radkowski). In prospective arm, 18 consecutive patients were recruited, who underwent plasma ablation assisted endoscopic excision. In retrospective arm, 18 consecutive patients who underwent excision by traditional endoscopic instruments in the past two years, were recruited. Both the groups were compared for baseline characteristics, intraoperative blood loss, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, and recurrence rates.
   Results: The use of plasma ablation decreased overall blood loss by 338 ml (mean difference) which was not statistically significant (p = 0.26). On subgroup analysis, the use of plasma ablation significantly decreased mean blood loss (648 ml, p = 0.046) and duration of surgery (83 min, p < 0.001) in patients who underwent embolization. No statistically significant difference was noted between two groups in length of hospital stay (p = 0.36) and recurrence rates (p = 0.64).
   Conclusion: Plasma ablation is an effective technique available to decrease blood loss and duration of surgery during endoscopic excision of post embolized stage I and II patients of JNA.

AB  - Background: Cytokines play a crucial role in the growth, survival and dissemination of malignant plasma cells in patients of multiple myeloma (MM). We estimated concentrations of five key cytokines: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-.B ligand (RANKL) in newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM).
   Methods: The study groups include 68 newly diagnosed and 21 relapsed/refractory (RR) MM patients. 32 out of 68 newly diagnosed MM patients were evaluated for serum cytokine concentrations after their treatment. For survival analysis, the various parameters were studied in relation to both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
   Results: The median serum levels of VEGF, IL-6, BAFF and RANKL were higher in RRMM compared with newly diagnosed patients. However, the difference was significant for BAFF levels (p = 0.04). The median serum levels of VEGF, IL-6, TNF-alpha, BAFF and RANKL were significantly higher in newly diagnosed and RRMM patients, compared to controls. We also observed lower plasma levels of VEGF (p =< 0.0001) and BAFF (p =< 0.0001) in BM compartment compared to the levels in serum from peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients. Significant reduction in the median levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, BAFF and RANKL was seen after 4-6 cycles of induction treatment in responders but not in non-responders. On survival analysis, RRMM patients had inferior median OS and PFS compared to that in newly diagnosed MM patients and found to be significantly associated with low haemoglobin representing the more aggressive disease biology in recurrent myeloma. The mean levels of IL-6 were significantly different in patients who died as compared to patients who were alive.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that the serum levels of VEGF, IL-6, TNF, BAFF and RANKL are significantly elevated and decrease significantly after treatment. The concentrations of circulating cytokines will reflect those of the bone marrow and could be used for subsequent analyses.

AB  - Purpose: To describe and correlate the clinical, radiological and EEG findings in children with lissencephaly.
   Method: Retrospective record analysis of children with lissencephaly presenting to tertiary health centre in Northern India was performed. Radiological classification and severity scoring were done. EEG findings were categorized into three patterns and its association with clinical severity was studied.
   Results: Twenty-eight children (males = 17) with lissencephaly were enrolled. Median age at diagnosis was 6.5months (range 3days-3years). Global developmental delay (median social quotient (SQ) = 25 (range15-68) was seen in all; motor deficits in 23 (82 %); epilepsy in 21 (75 %); behavioural problems in 18 (64 %); ophthalmic problems in 17 (61 %); microcephaly in 13 (46 %); feeding difficulty in 12 (43 %). Radiologically, classical Type I lissencephaly was seen in 18(64 %), cobblestone variant (Type II) in 5 (18 %) and micro-lissencephaly in 5 (18 %). Grade 4 (diffuse pachygyria) radiologic severity was most common (severity grade 1-6); no cases with severity score 5 or 6 were seen. The clinical profile did not correspond with radiological severity grading. EEG pattern recognition revealed pattern I in 14 (50 %); pattern II in 6 (21 %); pattern III in 8 (29 %). Children with pattern III EEG had drug resistant epilepsy and severe developmental delay. No relationship between EEG patterns and radiological severity grading was evident.
   Conclusion: EEG is better predictor of clinical status and outcome rather than radiological severity grading. EEG pattern III is associated with severe developmental delay and drug resistant epilepsy.

AB  - The world is experiencing an unprecedented health crisis as a result of the highly infectious novel coronavirus. Even economically powerful countries with the best healthcare and technology infrastructure are struggling to contain COVID-19. Conventional medicine is racing against time to produce vaccine and repurpose drugs used in other viral diseases. India has been using its resources maximally to fight COVID-19. However, it is yet to make full use of one of its major resource, namely AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unaani, Siddha and Homeopathy) systems. Ayurveda, which occupies a prime position in the AYUSH systems, has a huge knowledge base and infrastructure accessible in terms of registered practitioners, dispensaries, colleges, hospitals, pharmacies, research centres, etc. It is hence only logical that in a crisis like COVID-19, ayurveda is utilised for the public. Considering the vast clinical knowledge and experience available with ayurveda, this sector should definitely be an advantage for India. This article will discuss why and how the knowledge base and support system of ayurveda sector should be leveraged in trying times as the present one.

AB  - Purpose of review Cannabis products have been used for various ailments since ancient times. But their use diminished in the medical community due to the legal and social concerns of substance abuse. With evolving evidence of their use in alleviating various symptoms, resurgence of interest in their medicinal use is seen in the past decade. Recent findings Clinical evidence for cannabis products in treating various ailments has been far from robust. Their use is based on anecdotal and low-quality evidence. This review attempts to revisit the recent medical literature available on the merits and demerits of cannabinoid use in palliative medicine. A few symptoms in palliative care setting can be difficult to treat in a few patients with the available treatment measures. Anecdotal reports and early clinical data have proved cannabinoids to be a promising pharmacological option in managing this subset of patients. However, absence of robust clinical data in proving that cannabinoids have definitely favorable risk-benefit ratio, precludes the inclusion of cannabinoids in the routine recommendation for palliative symptom management. Before cannabinoids enter the broader market with patient-driven and industry-driven hype, high-quality clinical evidence is emergently needed.

AB  - Journal club (JC) is an integral part of postgraduate medical education. Although several innovations have been attempted to improve its effectiveness, the influence of the number of sessions remains unexplored. The current study investigated the effect of the number of sessions (one vs. four) of conduction of journal club on critical appraisal skills of postgraduate students at two institutions. A quasi-experimental study was conducted comparing the effectiveness of JC in a one- versus four-session JC format using two objective tests: Critical Appraisal Skills Test (CAST) and Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) score. The degree of changes (pre-JC vs. post-JC session) after each format exposure, association of prescores to postscores, and correlation between the CAST and PICO scores were discerned. CAST score was higher in the four-session format (P = 0.03), whereas PICO score increased in the single-session format of JC (P = 0.03). Also, the change in CAST score was higher in the four-session versus single-session JC format (P = 0.04). We conclude that a four-session format of JC is more effective in augmenting critical appraisal skills of postgraduate students, whereas a single session is sufficient for improving factual knowledge.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
KW  - Computer assisted decision making
KW  - Treatment outcome
KW  - Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
KW  - Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
KW  - Osteosarcoma
AB  - Purpose: Accuracy and consistency in RECIST (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) measurements are crucial for treatment planning. Manual RECIST measurement is tedious, prone-to-error and operator-subjective. Objective was to develop a fully automated system for tumor segmentation and RECIST score estimation with reasonable accuracy, consistency and speed.
   Methods: Diffusion weight images (DWI) of forty patients (N = 40; Male:Female = 30:10; Age = 17.7 +/- 5.9 years) with Osteosarcoma was acquired using 1.5 T MRI scanner before (baseline) and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (follow-up). 3D tumor volume was segmented applying Simple-linear-iterative-clustering Superpixels (SLIC-S) and Fuzzy-c-means-clustering (FCM) separately. Connected-component-analysis was performed to identify image-slice with maximum tumor-burden (Max-burden-sliceno) and measure tumor-sizes (Tumor-diameter(cm) & Tumor-volume(cc)). Relative-percentage-changes in tumor-sizes across time-points were scored using RECIST1.1 and Volumetric-response criterion. Segmentation accuracy was estimated by Dice-coefficient (DC), Jaccard-Index (JI), Precision (P) and Recall (R). Evaluated Apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC), Tumor diameter, Max-burden-sliceno and Tumor-volume in segmented tumor-mask and ground-truth tumor-mask were compared using paired-t-test (p<0.05), Pearson-correlation-coefficient(PCC) and Bland-Altman plots. Misclassification-error-rate (MER) was evaluated for automated RECIST1.1 and Volumetric-response scoring methods.
   Results: Automated SLIC-S and FCM produced satisfactory tumor segmentation (DC:similar to 70-83%;JI: similar to 55-72%;P: similar to 64-85%;R: similar to 73-83%) and showed excellent correlation with ground-truth measurements in estimating ADC (p > 0.05; PCC=0.84-0.89), Tumor-diameters (p > 0.05; PCC=0.90-0.95; bias=0.3- 2.41), Max-burden-sliceno (p > 0.05; PCC=0.87-0.96) and Tumor-volumes (p > 0.05; PCC=0.89-0.94; bias=15.19-131.81) at baseline and follow-up. MER for SLIC-S and FCM were comparable for RECIST1.1 (15-18 %) and Volumetric-response (18-20 %) scores and assessment times were 2-3s and 4-6s per patient respectively.
   Conclusions: Proposed method produced promising segmentation and RECIST score measurements in current bone tumor dataset and might be useful as decision-support-tool for response evaluation in other tumors.

TI  - Management of Untreated Classical Bladder Exstrophy in Adults: A Single-Institutional Experience
T2  - UROLOGY
KW  - PRESERVATION
AB  - OBJECTIVES To report our single center experience in the management of untreated adult classical bladder exstrophy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of 25 adults aged >= 18 years who underwent repair of the classical bladder exstrophy from April 2000 to February 2020 was performed. Patients with prior repair and neoplastic changes in the exposed bladder mucosa were excluded. The patients and primary caretakers were actively involved in the decision-making of the surgical procedures best suited them. Workup included upper tract evaluation and random bladder mucosal biopsy.
   RESULTS The mean age of presentation was 25 years. Primary schooling was completed by only 32% patients. The majority (72%) of the patients opted continent catheterizable pouch. Penn pouch was the most common pouch performed. In 3 patients, a complete primary repair was done in a single setting. In 4 patients with lack of education and difficult access to nearby health care settings, ileal conduit was performed. In all except 3 (13.1%), abdominal wall closed primarily. None of the patients required osteotomy. At a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, all patients with continent pouches were continent. One patient required revision of left ureteroneocystostomy at 20 months follow-up. All except one patient, who had complete primary repair were continent at a mean follow-up of 6 years.
   CONCLUSION Management of adult classical bladder exstrophy is challenging. The various pouches extend the surgical options. Heal conduit may be a simple alternative to complex reconstructions in unmotivated patients with poor access to the hospital. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Targeted delivery of drug to the site of inflammation may be useful in better management of the rheumatoid arthritis. Macrophages are available in elevated numbers in the inflamed synovial joint during rheumatoid arthritis and their response to therapy leads to success in anti-rheumatic treatment. To target the macrophages in the inflammatory synovium, we fabricated a methotrexate (MTX) encapsulated, cholesterol grafted chitosan nanocarrier tagged with anti-folate receptor-beta antibody (Ab-CCM-NP). Folate receptor-beta among other subtypes, alpha and gamma, is highly expressed in inflammatory cells. The nanoparticles exhibited a size of 181 +/- 30 nm with a loading efficiency of 63.7 +/- 11.1%. The nanoparticle demonstrated extended release capability and a 2.5 fold increase in half life in comparison to the free MTX following intravenous (i.v.) administration with better localization at the inflamed joints achieved due to active targeting. When compared with MTX, i.v. administration of Ab-CCM-NP was successful in significant reduction of paw volume and serum cytokine expression (IL-6 and TNF-alpha). Histological examination of the joints showed significant reduction of inflammation and edema by Ab-CCM-NP. Our study demonstrates efficacy in active targeting of inflamed joints as a useful modality in rheumatoid arthritis management.

AB  - Background Following data access and storage concerns, Government of India transferred the management of its Sample Registration System (SRS) based mortality surveillance (formerly known as the Million Death Study) to an Indian agency. This paper introduces the new system, challenges it faced and its vision for future.
   Methods The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, the new nodal agency, established the "Mortality in India Established through Verbal Autopsy" (MINErVA) platform with state level partners across India in November 2017. The network in its first three years has undertaken capacity building of supervisors conducting verbal autopsy under the SRS, established a panel of trained physician reviewers and developed three IT-based platforms for training, quality control and coding. Coding of VA forms started from January 2015 onwards, and the cause specific mortality fractions (CSMF) of the first 14 185 adult verbal autopsy (VA) records for 2015 were compared with earlier published data for 2010-2013 to check for continuity of system performance.
   Results The network consists of 25 institutions and a panel of 676 trained physician reviewers. 916 supervisors have been trained in conducting verbal autopsies. More than 75 000 VA forms have been coded to date. The median time taken for finalizing cause of death on the coding platform is 37 days. The level of physician agreement (67%) and proportion of VA forms requiring adjudication (12%) are consistent with published literature. Preliminary CSMF estimates for 2015 were comparable with those for 2010-2013 and identified same top ten causes of death. in addition to the delay, two major challenges identified for coding were language proficiency of physician reviewers vis-a-vis language of narratives and quality of verbal autopsies. While an initial strategic decision was made to consolidate the system to ensure continuity, future vision of the network is to move towards technology-based solutions including electronic data capture of VAs and its analysis and improving the use of mortality data in decision making.
   Conclusion MINErVA network is now fully functional and is moving towards achieving global standards. It provides valuable lessons for other developing countries to establish their own mortality surveillance systems.

AB  - A 37-year-old man, treated case of left temporal glioblastoma presented with headache, seizures, and progressive right-sided weakness with MRI evidence of recurrence. Exploratory Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT demonstrated PSMA expression in the recurrent lesion; it was decided to treat this patient with Lu-177-PSMA-617. After 3 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617, Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT showed significant reduction in PSMA uptake and regression in size of lesion on MRI with improvement in patient's symptoms and performance status. Lu-177-/Ga-68-PSMA theranostics has potential in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme when other therapeutic options are not feasible.

AB  - Fibroblast injury and autophagy dysfunction have been shown to contribute to the persistence of oral wounds. Recently, microRNAs have emerged as vital regulators and fine tuners of various pathophysiological cellular processes that influence the wound healing process. This study explored the biological function and regulatory mechanism of miRNA-21 (miR-21) in the healing of oral wounds by interfering with autophagy. Healthy gingival cells derived from wild-type (WT) and from miR-21KO mice were characterized by immunocytofluorescence, and changes in wound healing were subsequently assessed using an in vitro scratch wound healing assay. The roles of critical proteins required for autophagy, autophagy related 5 (ATG5) and Bcl-2 interacting coiled-coil protein 1 (Beclin1) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were transfected with a miR-21 mimic and a miR-negative control, and the relative expression of miR-21, ATG5, Beclin1 and LC3-I/II was characterized by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Pathological changes were observed in a palatal wound healing model using WT and miR-21 KO mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and autophagy markers. Cell migration was delayed in gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) from miR-21KO mice compared with WT mice. The expression of ATG5 and Beclin1 was significantly up-regulated in miR-21KO gingiva. Transfection of a miR-21 mimic into HGFs inhibited autophagy and up-regulated miR-21 expression. Knockdown of miR-21 suppressed the expression of fibronectin and CTGF, enhanced the autophagy effect of fibroblasts, suggesting that autophagy is involved in miR-21 regulated palatal wound healing. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-21 promotes oral wound healing by increasing ECM production through the inhibition of autophagy and facilitates clinical management of wound healing.

AB  - Objective To compare the effect of intact umbilical cord milking (MUC) and delayed cord clamping (DCC) on venous hematocrit at 48 (+/- 6) hours in late preterm and term neonates (35(0/7)-42(6/7) wk). Study Design Randomized trial. Setting and participants All late preterm and term neonates (35(0/7)-42(6/7) wk) neonates born in the labor room and maternity operation theatre of tertiary care unit were included. Intervention We randomly allocated enrolled neonates to MUC group (cord milked four times towards the baby while being attached to the placenta; n=72) or DCC group (cord clamped after 60 seconds; n=72). Outcome Primary outcome was venous hematocrit at 48 (+/- 6) hours of life. Additional outcomes were venous hematocrit at 48 (+/- 6) hours in newborns delivered through lower segment caesarean section (LSCS), incidence of polycythemia requiring partial exchange transfusion, incidence of hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy, and venous hematocrit and serum ferritin levels at 6 (+/- 1) weeks of age. Results The mean (SD) hematocrit at 48 (+/- 6) hours in the MUC group was higher than in DCC group [57.7 (4.3) vs. 55.9 (4.4); P=0.002]. Venous hematocrit at 6 (+/- 1) weeks was higher in MUC than in DCC group [mean (SD), 37.7 (4.3) vs. 36 (3.4); mean difference 1.75 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.9); P=0.005]. Other parameters were similar in the two groups. Conclusion MUC leads to a higher venous hematocrit at 48 (+/- 6) hours in late preterm and term neonates when compared with DCC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CT (PCT) and dual-energy CT (DECT) in differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 51 patients with 52 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (36 ccRCCs and 16 non-ccRCCs) who underwent both PCT and DECT before surgery or biopsy between January 2014 and December 2018. Three independent readers measured blood flow, blood volume (BV), and permeability using PCT and iodine concentration (IC) and iodine ratio using DECT. Interreader agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess PCT and DECT models. Size-specific dose estimates of the two methods were compared.
   RESULTS. BV (ICC, 0.93) and iodine ratio (ICC, 0.85) were the most reproducible parameters. Both PCT and DECT were significant models (p < 0.05, all readers) for differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between PCT and DECT. (p > 0.05). BV and iodine ratio were independent predictors of non-ccRCC (p < 0.05). However, the mean size-specific dose estimate was 16 times lower with DECT than with PCT (p < 0.001). The AUC of iodine ratio was 0.95, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy with an iodine ratio cutoff of 63.72% was 0.90, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively.
   CONCLUSION. PCT and DECT had comparable and high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating RCC subtypes; however, because of the significantly lower radiation dose of DECT, iodine ratio may be used as the best independent predictor.

AB  - Cognitive impairment, associated with ageing, stress, hypertension and various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, is a major health issue. The present review focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD), since it is the most important cause of cognitive impairment. It is characterized by progressive memory loss, language deficits, depression, agitation, mood disturbances and psychosis. Although the hallmarks of AD are cholinergic dysfunction, beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle formation, it is also associated with derangement of other neurotransmitters, elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, genetic and environmental factors. On one hand, this complex etiopathology makes a response to commonly used drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine less predictable and often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it supports the use of herbal medicines due to their nonspecific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and specific cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The popularity of herbal medicines is also increasing due to their perceived effectiveness, safety and affordability. In the present article, the experimental and clinical evidence have been reviewed for various Indian herbal medicines such as Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, Clitoria ternatea, Withania somnifera, Celastrus paniculatus, Evolvulus alsinoides, Desmodium gangeticum, Eclipta alba, Moringa oleifera and Convolvulus pluricaulis, which have shown potential in cognitive impairment. Some commonly available herbal formulations for memory impairment in India have also been reviewed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of Lead (Pb) and Cadmium (Cd) exposure at the molecular level on the reproductive status of tea garden workers in North-East India. Using semen samples, we experimentally determined sperm analysis as well as oxidative stress parameters in all samples and evaluated the expression levels of apoptotic and cell survival proteins [p53, phospho-Akt, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B, p50 subunit) and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)]. Our data revealed significant differences in the average heavy metal concentrations and various semen analysis profile between the infertile and normal groups. Increasing Pb and Cd concentrations in semen samples of patients showed positive associations with increasing number of multiple defects in sperm and the level of seminal oxidative stress markers in the high Pb and Cd concentration groups. These groups also exhibited positive correlations between high metal concentrations and the average p53 expression levels, but negative correlations with the mean p-Akt cascade protein levels in sperm cells. In the low Pb and Cd concentrations groups, we also observed reverse mean range and correlation patterns. Therefore, our findings may suggest that graded levels of metal exposure significantly influence the relative fluctuation in the levels of p53 and Akt cascade proteins in the sperm cells of infertile subjects. Furthermore, this may be a regulating factor of sperm cell fate, in turn, determining the fertility outcome of the men working in the tea gardens.

AB  - In this work urethane substituted diacetylene compound was synthesized to prepare its radiochromic films which can be sensitive to therapeutic radiation doses. The developed radiochromic films showed significant color change from white to blue in 0-16 Gy dose range. The colorimetric spectral response of the developed films was studied and a maximum absorption at 624 nm was observed which increased with the radiation doses. The change in the morphology of the films pre and post irradiation was analyzed by acquiring their SEM images. The radiation induced color changes were studied quantitatively in terms of optical density by using high resolution Epson scanner along with MATLAB software. The dose response of the developed films was compared with the commercially available Gafchromic EBT3 films. Both the films showed similar dose response with an uncertainty of less than 2%. The post irradiation stability and environmental stability of the films were also analyzed. The films were found to be highly stable under normal environmental conditions with only 1.67% and 1.19% variation in optical density due to the change in temperature and light intensity, respectively. The developed radiochromic films were tissue equivalent and possessed promising characteristics for a potential film dosimeter for medical applications.

TI  - Does Repositioning of Temporomandibular Joint Disc With Bone Anchors Provide Better Clinical Outcomes Than Conventional Disc Plication Procedures for Anterior Disc Displacements Without Reduction in Patients Refractory to Nonsurgical Treatments?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
KW  - SURGERY
KW  - DISORDERS
AB  - Purpose: Although open temporomandibular joint arthroplasty with discopexy is a common treatment for patients with anterior disc displacements without reduction (ADDWo) unresponsive to medical management, there are no studies comparing disc repositioning with bone anchors and conventional discopexy procedure. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy between disc repositioning with bone anchors and the conventional discopexy procedure for ADDWo of temporomandibular joint refractory to medical management.
   Patients and Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with ADDWo. The primary objective was to compare the improvement in mouth opening (primary outcome variable) between the 2 treatment (primary predictor variable) groups-disc repositioning with bone anchors versus conventional disc plication. Secondary outcome variables were pain measured by visual analog scale, lateral excursions, and position of the disc evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Other variables of interest were age, gender, and duration of symptoms. The parameters were evaluated at preoperative, postoperative day 1, and 1-, 6-, and 12-month postoperative period. Categorical variables were compared with c2 test and continuous variables with analysis of variance and adjusted for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni test.
   Results: The study sample comprised 14 patients (7 in each group) with MRI-proven ADDWo. Statistically significant differences were found in the improvement of mouth opening between the 2 groups, showing better improvement with bone anchors (14.42 +/- 5.96 vs 7.57 +/- 7.25 mm; P < .05). The reduction in visual analog scale also showed statistically significant difference with better pain reduction achieved with bone anchor (4.57 +/- 1.61 vs 3.28 +/- 0.75; P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference in lateral excursions and postoperative position of the disc evaluated by MRI between the groups at the 12month follow-up period.
   Conclusions: Disc repositioning with bone anchors provides better clinical outcomes in terms of maximal mouth opening and pain scores compared with conventional disc plication. (C) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted healthcare systems globally. The need of the hour is the development of effective strategies for protecting the lives of healthcare providers (HCPs) and judicious triage for optimal utilization of human and hospital resources. During this pandemic, neurosurgery, like other specialties, must transform, innovate, and adopt new guidelines and safety protocols for reducing the risk of cross-infection of HCPs without compromising patient care. In this article, the authors discuss the current neurosurgical practice guidelines at a high-volume tertiary care referral hospital in India and compare them with international guidelines and global consensus for neurosurgery practice in the COVID-19 era. Additionally, the authors highlight some of the modifications incorporated into their clinical practice, including those for stratification of neurosurgical cases, patient triaging based on COVID-19 testing, optimal manpower management, infrastructure reorganization, evolving modules for resident training, and innovations in operating guidelines. The authors recommend the use of their blueprint for stratification of neurosurgical cases, including their protocol for algorithmic patient triage and management and their template for manpower allocation to COVID-19 duty, as a replicable model for efficient healthcare delivery. https:// thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.9.FOCUS20564

AB  - The aging at cellular level manifests itself in the form of uncontrolled formation of ROS, chronic inflammation, and increased susceptibility to cellular stress. Aging is often regarded as a risk factor for several diseases due to several age-associated pathological changes in cells. Sestrin (Sesn) is an important molecule for controlling normal cellular physiology and play a significant role in the progression of certain age-associated cellular pathologies. This review deals with the structure, function, regulation, signaling network, and the potential role of Sesn in age-associated cellular pathophysiology. The cellular response mediated by Sesn under stressful conditions and rescue mechanism is discussed. It would be interesting to find out the precise physiological role of Sesn in the regulation of cellular aging. The anti-aging activity of Sesn may benefit to prevent various age-associated diseases and have clinical utility in diagnostic and therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Mutations in the BIGH3 gene encoding for keratoepithelin protein have been described in different corneal dystrophies viz. granular corneal dystrophy, lattice corneal dystrophy, and their different clinical subtypes. Even though linked to the BIGH3 gene, the role of BIGH3 gene in the pathogenesis of corneal lattice dystrophy and corneal granular dystrophy remains to be elucidated. We describe the probable functions of a mutated BIGH3 gene in disease pathogenesis, postulate the existence of other phenotype modifier mutations in these dystrophies, and how the coinheritance of these mutations in different combinations along with a normal/mutated BIGH3 gene can lead to the different morphologic patterns seen in these corneal dystrophies and their subtypes.

AB  - Objectives: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is frequently seen in patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. However, the sequential association between GER and adenotonsillar hypertrophy is unknown. This leads to unpredictable outcomes while treating patients of adenotonsillar hypertrophy with GER. The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of GER and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in paediatric patients with obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy (OATH), and to assess the effect of adenotonsillectomy (AT) on GER as well as GERD.
   Methods: In this prospective cohort study, consecutive pediatric patients with grade III/IV hypertrophy of adenoid or/and tonsillar tissue who were planned for AT were recruited after excluding comorbidities predisposing to GER. Symptoms of GERD using Gastro Esophageal Reflux Questionnaire for Young Children (GERQ-YC) and Reflux Indices (RI) obtained from 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring were evaluated in all patients pre-operatively and 12 weeks following AT.
   Results: A total of 49 patients with OATH with average age of 6 years were included in this study. With a RI of >4.3% as the threshold for making the diagnosis of GER on esophageal pH monitoring, the prevalence of GER was 20.4%. The average RI preoperatively was 15.7% which reduced to 1.7% following AT (p = 0.004). Among the 10 patients with preoperative GER, 80% of the patients had no evidence of GER after surgery. New incidences of GER was not observed post operatively in this cohort. As per the GER symptom scoring system, 31% of the parents reported GERD pre-operatively which resolved completely in all patients following surgery.
   Conclusions: - In this study, the prevalence of GER proven by 24 h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring is 20% in pediatric patients with OATH. Following AT, GER resolved in 80% of cases and was reduced substantially in the remaining cases in the subset of patients with pre-operative GER. The symptoms of GERD based on parents' recall of child's previous symptoms may not accurately represent presence of GER. Our results suggest that OATH can result in GER due to increased negative intra-thoracic pressure as a result of breathing against an obstructed upper airway and hence, GER subsides following surgical removal of the obstructive pathology. To establish this concatenational association of OATH and GER, larger studies are mandated.

AB  - Ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecological cancer, is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women. A cost-effective and non-invasive early screening method for ovarian cancer is required to reduce the high mortality rate. Saliva is a clinically informative unique fluid, which is useful for novel approaches to prognosis, clinical diagnosis, and monitoring for non-invasive detection of disease. Multimerin1 (MMRN1) is a di-sulfide linked homo-polymeric glycoprotein from EMILIN family. Altered expression of MMRN1 has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer. But, its role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is not clear and well documented. In this study, expression of Multimerin 1 was validated in saliva and tissues of EOC patients and age-matched controls by western blotting, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Significant over expression of MMRN1 was observed by western blot and ELISA in saliva samples of EOC patients. The average concentration of MMRN1 in the saliva of healthy controls was 28.7 pg/ml (SE +/- 1.76), 42.53 pg/ml (SE +/- 4.06) in low grade and 52.91 pg/ml (SE +/- 4.24) with p < 0.01 in high-grade EOC. Upregulated cytoplasmic expression of MMRN1 was observed in EOC tissue by immunohistochemistry. Our results suggest that MMRN1 expression is associated with EOC progression and MMRN1 may be potential biomarker candidates for early-stage EOC detection however further experiments are required in a large cohort to establish this proposition. Also, saliva can be explored as a novel medium for ovarian cancer diagnosis.

AB  - To evaluate Gene Xpert for diagnosis of Female Genital Tuberculosis (FGTB) as compared to conventional methods.
   Study Design: It was a prospective study conducted over 167 cases of infertile female genital tuberculosis (FGTB) diagnosed on composite reference standard (CRS) (smear for AFB, histopathological evidence of epithelioid granuloma or definite or possible findings of tuberculosis on laparoscopy). All women underwent endometrial biopsy for AFB microscopy, culture, gene Xpert, PCR and histopathology) and laparoscopy and hysteroscopy for diagnosis and prognostication of disease. The results of Gene Xpert were compared with conventional methods in detection of FGTB. All patients were treated with 6 months course of rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) (RHZE for 2 months, RHE for 4 months) using directly observed treatment short course strategy.
   Results: Mean age, parity, body mass index and history of contact was 28.3 years, 0.28, 22.9 Kg/m(2) and 38.92% respectively. Primary infertility was seen in 87.42% cases with mean duration of 2.42 years. Menstrual dysfunctions, abdominal or pelvic pain and lump were seen in 38.92%, 14.37% and 10.77% cases. Abnormal vaginal discharge and adnexal mass were seen in 28.14% and 13.17 % cases. On diagnostic laparoscopy, definite findings of tuberculosis (beaded tubes, tuebrcles and caseous nodules) were seen in 96 (57.48%) women while probable findings of tuberculosis (pelvic or abdominal adhesions, hydrosaplinx, tubo-ovarian mass, pyosalpinx) were seen in 81 (48.50%) women.
   On laboratory investigations, positive AFB on microscopy or culture was seen in 2.99% casess, PCR was positive in 47.90% gene Xpert was positive in 18.56% cases while epitheloid granuloma was seen on histopathology in 16 (9.58%) cases. Gene Xpert had sensitivity of 35.63%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 58.82% and diagnostic accuracy of 66.47% in the present study.
   Conclusion: Gene Xpert is a very useful test to rule in tuberculosis whereas when it is negative it is not a good test to rule out tuberculosis. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1 has been shown to have an association with obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment response. One polymorphism (rs3056) in SLC1A1 has been associated with altered brain volumes in OCD. We investigated the association of this polymorphism with OCD and its relationship with various clinical parameters, including age of onset, disease severity, insight, factor analyzed symptom dimensions of OCD, and SRI treatment response. Three hundred seventy seven OCD patients (DSM-IV) aged between 18 to 60 years were recruited from a specialty OCD clinic. To study the association with SRI treatment response, we analyzed full responders (>= 35% reduction in the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [YBOCS] and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement [CGI-I] score of 1 or 2) to any SRI (n = 187) and nonresponders (<25% reduction in the YBOCS and the CGI-I score >4) to adequate trials of at least two SRIs for a duration of 12 weeks (n 91). Healthy controls (n = 333) were recruited and evaluated using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus (MINI-Plus). All subjects were from southern India, and were genotyped for the SLC1A1 polymorphism ( rs3056). Genotype frequencies did not deviate significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Case-control association analysis revealed that the "GG" genotype was significantly more frequent in OCD cases than the controls (p = .04). No association was found with the age of onset, symptom severity, insight, and symptom dimensions. No significant association was found between genotype/allele frequencies with treatment response. To conclude, although there was a significant association between the SLC1A1 rs3056 polymorphism and OCD, there were no significant associations with other clinical parameters or treatment response.

AB  - Microbiological diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) has been one of the most difficult aspects of tuberculosis (TB) management. Availability of better imaging and diagnostic modalities has led to an increase in the number of diagnosed cases. The current upsurge in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis warrants routine testing of EPTB samples for resistance at baseline with shorter turn-around time.
   A total of 369 EPTB specimens were subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, liquid culture (LC) with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing, MTBDRplus V.2 and MTBDRsl V.2. The molecular categorisation of resistant specimens was further reconfirmed with sequencing.
   The sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRplus V.2 to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) when compared to ZN stain was 97.9% and 89.2%, respectively while it was 73.4% and 83.8%, respectively when compared to LC. Similarly, for MTBDRsl V.2, the sensitivity and specificity for detection of MTB when compared with ZN was 95.6% and 91.9%, respectively and 75% and 89.2%, respectively when compared to LC. In smear-positive specimens, 94% (141/150) and 86% (129/150) valid results were observed in MTBDRplus V.2 and MTBDRsl V.2, respectively.
   The utilisation of both MTBDRplus V.2 and MTBDRsl V.2 for the diagnosis of smear-positive EPTB specimens would be useful in programmatic management of TB in high-burden settings.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect hundred thousands of people every day worldwide. Since it is a novel virus, research continues to update the possible therapeutic targets when new evidence regarding COVID-19 are gathered. This article presents an evidence-based hypothesis that activating the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is a potential target for COVID-19. Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against SARS-CoV-2. Induction of HO-1 and increase in the heme catabolism end-product confer antiviral activity. IFN activation results in inhibition of viral replication in various viral infections. COVID-19 induced inflammation as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulopathies are now known major causes of mortality. A protective role of HO-1 induction in inflammation, inflammation-induced coagulation, and ARDS has been reported. Based on an association of HO-1 promoter polymorphisms and disease severity, we propose an evaluation of the status of these polymorphisms in COVID-19 patients who become severely ill. If an association is established, it might be helpful in identifying patients at high risk. Hence, we hypothesize that HO-1 pathway activation could be a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 and associated complications.

AB  - Background: Abnormalities in brain development and plasticity have been associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in schizophrenia is the recent area of interest because it regulates neurogenesis. The current study aimed to assess and compare serum BDNF levels between first-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, and evaluate its correlation with the sociodemographic and clinical variables.
   Methodology: It was a cross-sectional comparative study for the assessment of serum BDNF levels between patients with first-episode schizophrenia (N=50) and healthy controls (N=50) conducted in the Department of Psychiatry at a tertiary care public hospital attached to a medical school in North India. Participants were assessed for the socio-demographic parameters, nicotine dependence, and clinical details using structured scales. Serum BDNF level estimated using the sandwich ELISA technique. The comparison between the groups was done by using a Student t-test or chi-square test. Spearman correlation was performed between mean BDNF scores and demographic or illness variables in both first-episode schizophrenia and healthy control groups.
   Results: There was a significantly lower mean score of total serum BDNF levels in first-episode schizophrenia patients as compared to controls (8.44 +/- 1.54 vs 10.44 +/- 2.04; t = 5.52, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.28-2.71). The total FTND scores for smokeless tobacco use were negatively correlated to BDNF levels among healthy controls (r=-0.30, p=0.03) as well as in the first-episode schizophrenia group (r=-0.32, p=0.04). None of the other illness-related variables were correlated to serum BDNF values in the first episode schizophrenia group.
   Conclusion: Individuals with first-episode schizophrenia have lower serum BDNF levels than healthy controls. The illness-related factors such as duration of untreated psychosis or psychopathology were not correlated with BDNF levels. Thus abnormal signaling of BDNF can lead to abnormal brain functioning which can make an individual more susceptible to schizophrenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vertebral hemangiomas are benign, highly vascular lesions of the vertebra, rarely seen in the pediatric age group.
   OBJECTIVE: To analyze the long-term (>3 yr) outcome of patients of pediatric vertebral hemangioma presenting with myelopathy and to describe our surgical strategy to treat such cases.
   METHODS: All patients up to 18 yr of age with a symptomatic vertebral hemangioma treated at our hospital from May 2003 to August 2016, with at least 3-yr follow-up were included. Functional clinical outcomes were measured using American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score.
   RESULTS: There were 7 male and 7 female patients. All hemangiomas were located in the thoracic spine with single-level involvement. Upper thoracic spine involvement was more common (12 cases: 85.71%) than lower thoracic spine involvement (2 cases: 14.29%). All patients had features of myelopathy. The mean age was 14.57 yr, ranging from 10 to 18 yr. The mean follow-up was 62.21 mo, ranging from 36 to 90 mo. All patients had improvement in motor strength of both lower limbs postoperatively. Local pain, which was present in 1 patient, resolved, and the bladder symptoms present in 5 patients also resolved.
   CONCLUSION: Our experience in treating symptomatic pediatric vertebral hemangiomas, along with the long-term follow-up data, suggests that good postoperative results can be achieved with minimal complications in carefully selected patients.

AB  - Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor crystals in the nanodimension having unique optical and electronic properties that differ from bulk material due to quantum mechanics. The QDs have a narrow emission peak, size-dependent emission wavelength, and broad excitation range which can be utilized for diverse biomedical applications such as molecular imaging, biosensing, and diagnostic systems. This article reviews the current developments of biomedical applications of QDs with special reference to point-of-care testing.

AB  - Objective To describe the clinical profile and pattern of pediatric psychiatric emergency referrals at a tertiary-care center in India. Methods Retrospective chart review of emergency psychiatry records over a 13-month period (January, 2015-January, 2016). Results Pediatric psychiatric emergencies (n=65) (mean (SD) age, 14.2 (2.39) y) constituted 10% of all-age psychiatric emergencies. Risk of harm to self and/or others was seen in a third of patients (aggression, 18.5%; self-harm, 16.9%). Common psychiatric diagnoses were dissociative disorder (27.7%), mood disorders (9.3%) and psychotic disorders (7.7%). Compared to adult emergencies attended during same time period, pediatric group had more females (63.1% vs 47.4%; P=0.02), more patients with dissociative disorders (28.7% vs 8.2%; P<0.01) and absence of psychotropic medication prescriptions (36.9% vs 20.6%; P=0.003), while frequency of self-harm and aggression as a reason for presentation was similar to adults. Conclusion The report helps to understand the service needs of younger age group presenting with psychiatric emergencies.

AB  - Background & objectives: Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is a chemosensitive malignancy with an excellent cure rate. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the predictors of chemoresistance and disease relapse, and the secondary objective was to appraise the WHO/FIGO risk scoring and course of disease in women with GTN. Methods: In this retrospective study, case records of women treated for GTN from January 2011 to June 2019 were reviewed. For the purpose of comparison, sub-stratification of FIGO/WHO low risk group (<= 6) into low (0-4) and intermediate (5-6) risk was done. Similarly, WHO high risk (>= 7) group was sub-stratified into high (7-12) and ultra-high risk (>= 13) groups. Results: Case records of 116 patients were included: 51.7 per cent (60/116) were of low risk disease and 48.2 per cent (56/116) were of high risk disease. Chemoresistance developed in 28.4 per cent (33/116) and relapse in 10.3 per cent (12/116) cases. Risk of chemoresistance was higher in low risk (0-6) while risk of relapse was more in high risk (>= 7) group. On sub-stratification, chemoresistance was more with intermediate [0-4: 28.5% (10/35), 5-6: 44% (11/25), 7-12: 22.5% (9/40), >= 13: 18.7% (3/16)] and relapse with ultra-high risk score [0-4: 5.7% (2/35), 5-6: 4% (1/25), 7-12:10% (4/40), >= 13: 31.2% (5/16)]. Age, myometrial invasion, serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and tumour size were not related to chemoresistance or relapse. Interpretation & conclusions: WHO risk score and presence of metastatic disease predict the probability of developing chemotherapy resistance and disease relapse. Risk of chemotherapy resistance was higher in women with intermediate-risk score (5-6), and risk of relapse was more in those with ultra-high risk score (>= 13).

AB  - The limited evidence on neonatal Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rare, and most neonates seem to acquire the infection postnatally through respiratory droplets and contact. Testing of neonates with perinatal or postnatal exposure to COVID-19 infection plays a vital role in the early diagnosis, management and institution of infection prevention measures thereby cutting off the chain of epidemic transmission. A recently concluded online neonatal COVID-19 conference conducted by the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) of India and a nationwide online survey pointed to substantial variation in neonatal testing strategies. We, herein, summarize the relevant literature about the incidence and outcomes of neonatal COVID-19 and call for a universal and uniform testing strategy for exposed neonates. We anticipate that the testing strategy put forth in this article will facilitate better management and safe infection prevention measures among all units offering neonatal care in the country.

AB  - Protein C, a member of the zymogen family of serine proteases in plasma, is one of the several vitamin K dependent glycoproteins known to induce anti-apoptotic activity. However, the target molecule involved in the mechanism needs to be investigated. We sought to investigate the pathways involved in the anti-apoptotic role of activated protein C (APC) on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced ischemic conditions in in-vitro SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to OGD in an airtight chamber containing 95% N-2 and 5% CO2 and media deprived of glucose for 4 h following 24 h of reoxygenation. The cell toxicity, viability, expression of receptors such as endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR), protease-activated receptor (PAR)1, PAR3, and apoptosis-related proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), BCL-2-like protein 4 (Bax), Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase-1 (PARP-1) were assessed. Administration of APC decreased the cellular injury when compared to the OGD exposed group in a dose-dependent manner and displayed increased expression of PAR-1, PAR-3, and EPCR. The APC treatment leads to a reduction in PARP-1 expression and cleavage and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) expression. The reduction of caspase-3 activity and PARP-1 and AIF expression following APC administration results in restoring mitochondrial function with decreased cellular injury and apoptosis. Our results suggested that APC has potent protective effects against in-vitro ischemia in SH-SY5Y cells by modulating mitochondrial function.

AB  - Purpose/Background
   The specific identification of residual/recurrent juvenile nasal angiofibroma (JNA) following surgical treatment remains difficult. Contrast MRI and CT may not enable the differentiation of tumor from postsurgical reparative tissue. Functional imaging with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT targeting tumor-associated neovasculature has recently demonstrated universal positive uptake in primary JNA and offers promise of greater accuracy in the detection or exclusion of recurrent/residual JNA. Methods
   In this prospective study, 18 postsurgical JNA patients with high suspicion for residual disease evinced by follow-up MR scan, or nasal endoscopy, or recent epistaxis during September 2018-November 2019 were included. All patients underwent head and neck spot PSMA PET/CT imaging. Postcontrast enhancement of a definite lesion was considered as a criterion for residual/recurrent tumor in contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI). In PSMA PET/CT, any abnormal uptake apart from physiological sites in the head and neck was considered as residual lesions. Radiological results were categorized as negative, suspicious, and residual/recurrent tumors. Any discrepancy between CEMRI and PSMA was resolved by surgical biopsies. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were separately calculated for CEMRI and PSMA PET/CT for diagnosing residual lesions. The interrater agreement kappa value was also calculated. Results
   On CEMRI evaluation, 14 of 18 patients had residual tumors, 2 had suspicious residual lesions, and 2 had normal postoperative scans. On PSMA PET/CT, 12 of 18 patients had residual tumors, and 6 had normal negative scans. Surgical biopsy in all 4 discordant cases was negative for tumors and revealed only fibrosis. In 1 patient with residual tumor on both scans, discrepancy was noted with regard to tumor extent demonstrated by the 2 scans, and further surgical excision confirmed the imaging findings of PSMA PET/CT as accurate. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of CEMRI were 100%, 33.33%, and 75% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PSMA PET/CT were 100% for all parameters. The interrater agreement between the 2 tests (kappa) is 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.81). Conclusions
   The Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT is noted as more specific than the current standard of CEMRI in the identification of residual/recurrent JNA. It is the first radionuclide imaging scan that has found application in postoperative assessment of JNA.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global catastrophe. The virus requires main protease for processing the viral polyproteins PP1A and PP1AB translated from the viral RNA. In search of a quick, safe and successful therapeutic agent; we screened various clinically approved drugs for the in-vitro inhibitory effect on 3CL(Pro) which may be able to halt virus replication. The methods used includes protease activity assay, fluorescence quenching, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), Thermofluor (R) Assay, Size exclusion chromatography and in-silico docking studies. We found that Teicoplanin as most effective drug with IC50 similar to 1.5 mu M. Additionally, through fluorescence quenching Stern-Volmer quenching constant (K-SV) for Teicoplanin was estimated as 2.5 x 10(5) L.mol(-1), which suggests a relatively high affinity between Teicoplanin and 3CLPro protease. The SPR shows good interaction between Teicoplanin and 3CLPro with K-D similar to 1.6 mu M. Our results provide critical insights into the mechanism of action of Teicoplanin as a potential therapeutic against COVID-19. We found that Teicoplanin is about 10-20 fold more potent in inhibiting protease activity than other drugs in use, such as lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, atazanavir etc. Therefore, Teicoplanin emerged as the best inhibitor among all drug molecules we screened against 3CLPro of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract. It is asymptomatic in its early stages, and often, characterized by a poor prognosis and worse treatment response. Distribution of GBC shows both geographical as well as ethnic variations. Several studies have elucidated the differential gene expression profile between the normal gallbladder and GBCs, with varied but inconsistent results. Thus, a deep understanding of the expression profile of GBC might aid in the identification of potential biomarkers, which would further help in better disease management and appropriate therapy selection. This review summarizes studies on the transcriptomic profile of GBC with emphasis on studies pertaining to coding (mRNA) and noncoding (micro and long noncoding) RNA along with aberrant promoter methylation studies, ranging from a single gene to global gene to high throughput RNA sequencing approaches, published between 200 0 to May, 2019. In addition, data mining of GBC from the available public functional genomics data repository at Gene Expression Omnibus has been done to rule out potentially important dysregulated genes in this malignancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to shed light on the RNA based gene regulatory network(s) along with bioinformatic analysis. Moreover, this review represents major research challenges and ambiguity, knowledge of which is a must for establishing molecular/ clinical biomarkers for early GBC diagnosis, management, and treatment protocols.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate corneal biomechanical changes and their correlation with the percentage of tissue altered (PTA) in myopic femtosecond (FS)-flap LASIK. Methods: Prospective longitudinal observational study of 80 eyes of FS LASIK. Demographic details, LASIK parameters, preoperative and postoperative (day 1, month 1, 3, and 6), UCVA, BCVA, refraction, corneal topography, corneal hysteresis (CH), and a corneal resistance factor (CRF) were noted. Change in CH and CRF and its correlation with PTA were analyzed. Data were analyzed in three subgroups [subgroup 1: PTA 23 to <27%; subgroup 2: 27 to <33%; subgroup 3: 33 to <40%]. Results: FS LASIK for MRSE -3.5D +/- 1.6D with mean PTA of 31.6 +/- 4.4% (range 23.8-39.8%), showed statistically significant decrease in CH and CRF. Mean CH decreased from a preoperative value of 10.4 +/- 1.9 to 8.1 +/- 1.1; mean CRF from 10.5 +/- 1.6 to 7.5 +/- 1.3 at 6-months postoperative period, respectively. Mean preoperative CH decreased by 25%, 24%, 23%, and 21% and mean preoperative CRF decreased by 34%, 28%, 28%, and 28% at postoperative day 1, month 1, 3, and 6 follow-ups. Mean CH and CRF showed a significant negative correlation with PTA (CH: r =- 0.33 [P = <0.0001], CRF: r =- 0.34 [P = <0.001]. Subgroup analysis noted greater decrease in CRF and CH in eyes with higher PTA (subgroup 3). Conclusion: Myopic FS LASIK causes a decrease in corneal biomechanics with a significant negative correlation with PTA indicating a greater decrease in corneal biomechanics with higher PTA.

AB  - The role of oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation and cholinergic dysfunction is already established in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sinapic acid (SA), a hydroxylcinnamic acid derivative, has shown neuro-protective effects. The current study evaluates the neuro-protective potential of SA in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) induced cognitive impairment in rats. Male Wistar rats were bilaterally injected with ICV-STZ. SA was administered intragastrically once daily for three weeks. Rats were divided into sham, ICV-STZ, STZ + SA (10 mg/kg), STZ + SA (20 mg/kg) and SA per se (20 mg/kg). Behavioral tests were assessed on day 0 and 21 days after STZ. Later, rats were sacrificed for biochemical parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression and neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The results showed that SA 20 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) improved cognitive impairment as assessed by Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. SA 20 mg/kg reinstated the altered levels of GSH, MDA, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in the cortex and hippocampus. STZ-induced decreased expression of ChAT and neuronal loss were also significantly (p < 0.05) improved with SA. Our results showed that SA exhibits neuro-protection against ICV-STZ induced oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, cholinergic dysfunction and neuronal loss, suggesting its potential in improving learning and memory in patients of AD.

AB  - Background Shannon's index is one of the measures of biodiversity, which is intended to quantify both richness and evenness of the species/individuals in the ecosystem or community. However, application of Shannon's index in the field of substance use among the street children has not been done till date. Methods This paper is concerned with methods of estimating Shannon's diversity index (SDI), which can be used to capture the variation in the population due to certain characteristics. Under the consideration that the probability of abundance, based on certain characteristics in the population, is a random phenomenon, we derive a Bayesian estimate in connection with Shannon's information measure and their properties (mean and variance), by using a probability matching prior, through simulation and compared it with those of the classical estimates of Shannon. The theoretical framework has been applied to the primary survey data of substance use among the street children in Delhi, collected during 2015. The measure of diversity was estimated across different age profiles and districts. Results The results unrevealing the diversity estimate for street children corresponding to each region of Delhi, under both the classical and Bayesian paradigms. Although the estimates were close to one another, a striking difference was noted in the age profile of children. Conclusions The Bayesian methodology provided evidence for a greater likelihood of finding substance-using street children, belonging to the lower age group (7-10, maximum Bayesian entropy-3.73), followed by the middle (11-14) and upper age group (15-18). Moreover, the estimated variance under the Bayesian paradigm was lesser than that of the classical estimate. There is ample scope for further refinement in these estimates, by considering more covariates that may have a possible role in initiating substance use among street children in developing countries like India.

TI  - Investigating the Effect of Vibrotactile Feedback in Transfemoral Amputee With and Without Movable Ankle Joint
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
KW  - Limit of stability
KW  - lower limb amputation
KW  - vibrotactile feedback
KW  - weight shifting exercise
AB  - The loss of somatosensory feedback after transfemoral amputation imposes a serious challenge in achieving postural stability. In the recent past, weight shifting exercises with fixed ankle joint have been reported useful in boosting the limit of stability (LOS) only in the sound limb; the LOS on the prosthetic limb did not improve. A fixed ankle joint restricts movement in the anteriorposterior direction at the ankle level. Thus, it may suppress the ability tomove forward LOS despite awareness of center of pressure (COP) due to vibrotactile feedback. Therefore, it could have limited the improvement in the LOS of a prosthetic limb in previous studies. This article investigates this hypothesis by evaluating the effect of vibrotactile feedback in the LOS of transfemoral amputees with fixed as well as movable ankle joints. This evaluation is done during weight shifting exercises. Firstly, we developed an in-houseCOP guided vibrotactile sensory feedback system. Next, we recruited five transfemoral amputees to perform a weight-shifting exercise with a) fixed ankle joint (singleaxis cushion heel (SACH) foot) and b) movable ankle joint (single-axis foot). Finally, we analyzed the recorded center of pressure trajectory signals for the limit of stability. The findings of repeatedmeasures ANOVA showed a marginally significant interaction (F-(1,F- 4) = 5.7, p = 0.07, eta p(2) = 0.591) between ankle joint and feedback conditions during backward shifting in weight shifting exercise. Further analysis showed that during the backward shifting fixed ankle joint did not improve in the presence of vibrotactile feedback, while a marginally significant (p = 0.14) improved LOS was observed in the movable ankle joint with feedback. The findings conclude that the vibrotactile feedback ismore effective in transfemoral amputees with movable ankle joint compared with fixed ankle joint.

AB  - Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder with variable clinical presentation most commonly involving the skeletal system. The long bones are the most common site of involvement giving a characteristic bone scintigraphy pattern of increased bilateral symmetric uptake in metadiaphyseal regions. We describe the findings of serial F-18-FDG PET/CT in a 16-year-old adolescent girl with ECD, emphasizing the role of F-18-FDG PET/CT in response assessment of ECD.

AB  - Drug dependence associated with increased dopamine neurotransmission and neuroplastic changes is influenced by Dopamine transporters (DAT) which are modulated by genetic and epigenetic factors. This study assesses DAT availability in relation to the 40bp DAT1 VNTR (genetic) and DAT1 promoter methylation (epigenetic) changes in patients with alcohol dependence (AD) and opioid dependence (OD). A total of 60 subjects (n= 20 each of AD, OD and controls) were recruited. SPECT/CT imaging using Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 was performed for measuring striatal DAT availability and DNA screened to check DAT1promoter methylation and 40bp VNTR polymorphism. SPECT/CT imaging revealed significant decrease in DAT availability in the striatum and putamen and significant increase in DAT1 promoter methylation in AD compared to control and OD. The 40bp VNTR distribution was similar in all three groups with 1 Orepeat and 9repeat alleles being the most common. The AD individuals with DAT1 promoter methylation showed significantly lower TRODAT-1 uptake compared to the ones with no methylation. AD individuals homozygous for the lOrepeat VNTR also showed reduced DAT availability. This is the first imaging study using Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 from India documenting significantly reduced striatal DAT availability, increased DAT methylation and frequency of 1 Orepeat individuals associated with decreased DAT availability in AD.

AB  - Background: Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a potentially fatal pneumonia predominantly caused by infection due to Legionella pneumophila although more than 50 other Legionella species are described. Water systems contaminated with Legionella spp. are the implicated sources of Legionnaires' disease. In this study, we aimed to assess Legionella contamination in the water sources of a tertiary care hospital and to determine the virulence properties and molecular characteristics of L. pneumophila environmental isolates.
   Methods: During May 2015 through August 2018, a total of 201 hospital water samples were tested for L. pneumophila by standardized culture procedures; environmental isolates were examined for the presence of two virulence genes: Legionella vir homolog (lvh) and repeats in structural toxin (rtxA) by PCR. The genotyping of isolates was performed by sequence-based typing (SBT) according to the protocol of the European Study Group for Legionella Infections (ESGLI).
   Results: L. pneumophila was isolated from 38/201 (18.9%) water samples; among the 46 isolates, the lvh locus was present in 45 (97.8%), the rtxA locus was found in 45 (97.8%), and both loci were found in 44 (95.7%) isolates. A total of 23 sequence types (STs) were identified among the 44 isolates (index of discrimination [IOD] of 0.929), and 11/23 (47.8%) STs were new to the ESGLI database.
   Conclusions: The study results showed genetic diversity in L. pneumophila isolates from the hospital environment along with a high percentage of pathogenicity loci. Besides, certain STs may have an increased ability to cause legionellosis, thus requires specific infection control and prevention strategies whenever identified.

AB  - Soil contains diverse and complex natural elements having physical, chemical, mineralogical and biological components. Soil being a transferable physical component (it can be transferred from one location to another with the help of shoes, tires, clothes, tools etc.), acts as a tool of forensic investigation to correlate a specific crime scene with criminal suspects. A variety of techniques and combinations of methods can be used to discriminate soil from different geographical locations. The present review highlights various analytical techniques (ATR-FTIR, pyGC-MS, SEM-EDX, ICP-MS/OES and XRD) for soil analysis (colour comparison, texture and particle size determination, density gradient methods and organic matter estimation) and discusses some of the famous cases solved with soil trace evidence. The objective of the present study is to provide an overview of the importance of soil as physical evidence in forensic science based on literature analysis that will help forensic scientists and researchers to select appropriate methods to discriminate different soil samples. This article reviews various analytical techniques used to differentiate soils and provides compiled information regarding soil as trace evidence in order to help academicians, researchers and forensic soil scientists.

(Aug. 13 issue)(2) shows that patients with NPM1 mutations had a response with respect to composite complete remission (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) that was inferior to that of patients with FLT3 mutations; this finding differs from that in previous studies.(3,4) The presence of a FLT3 mutation signifies venetoclax resistance . . .

AB  - Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) affects approximate to 40 million people and claims nearly 300 000 lives each year. The historic passing of a World Health Assembly resolution on RHD in 2018 now mandates a coordinated global response. The American Heart Association is committed to serving as a global champion and leader in RHD care and prevention. Here, we pledge support in 5 key areas: (1) professional healthcare worker education and training, (2) technical support for the implementation of evidence-based strategies for rheumatic fever/RHD prevention, (3) access to essential medications and technologies, (4) research, and (5) advocacy to increase global awareness, resources, and capacity for RHD control. In bolstering the efforts of the American Heart Association to combat RHD, we hope to inspire others to collaborate, communicate, and contribute.

AB  - Introduction: Many Indians are at high-risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Yoga is an ancient Indian mind-body discipline, that has been associated with improved glucose levels and can help to prevent T2DM. The study aimed to systematically develop a Yoga program for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) among high-risk people in India using a complex intervention development approach.
   Materials and Methods: As part of the intervention, we developed a booklet and a high-definition video for participants and a manual for YOGA-DP instructors. A systematic iterative process was followed to develop the intervention and included five steps: (i) a systematic review of the literature to generate a list of Yogic practices that improves blood glucose levels among adults at high-risk of or with T2DM, (ii) validation of identified Yogic practices by Yoga experts, (iii) development of the intervention, (iv) consultation with Yoga, exercise, physical activity, diet, behavior change, and/or diabetes experts about the intervention, and (v) pretest the intervention among Yoga practitioners and lay people (those at risk of T2DM and had not practiced Yoga before) in India.
   Results: YOGA-DP is a structured lifestyle education and exercise program, provided over a period of 24 weeks. The exercise part is based on Yoga and includes Shithilikarana Vyayama (loosening exercises), Surya Namaskar (sun salutation exercises), Asana (Yogic poses), Pranayama (breathing practices), and Dhyana (meditation) and relaxation practices. Once participants complete the program, they are strongly encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle in the long-term.
   Conclusions: We systematically developed a novel Yoga program for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) among high-risk people in India. A multi-center feasibility randomized controlled trial is in progress in India.

AB  - The methodology exploring the cardioprotective potential of the flavonoid Fisetin through its ability to modulate PPAR-gamma was unraveled in the present study. Computational modelling through molecular docking based binding study of interactions between Fiestin and PPAR-gamma revealed the potential role of Fisetin as an agonist of PPAR-gamma. A murine model of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury was used to explore this further. Male Wistar Rats were randomly assigned to five groups. Fisetin (20 mg/kg; p.o) was administered for 28 days. Ischemia was induced for 45 min on the 29th day followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Fisetin pretreatment upregulated the expression of PPAR-gamma in heart tissue significantly Cardioprotection was assessed by measurement of hemodynamic parameters, infarct size, ELISA for oxidative stress, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay for apoptosis, and western blot analysis for MAPK proteins and inflammation. PPAR-gamma activation by fisetin led to significantly reduced infarct size, suppression of oxidative stress, reduction of cardiac injury markers, alleviation of inflammation, and inhibition of apoptosis The MAPK-based molecular mechanism showed a rise in a key prosurvival kinase, ERK1/ERK2 and suppression of JNK and p38 proteins. The aforementioned beneficial findings of fisetin were reversed on the administration of a specific antagonist of PPAR-gamma. In conclusion, through our experiments, we have proved that fisetin protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury and the evident cardioprotection is PPAR-gamma dependant. In conclusion, our study has revealed a prime mechanism involved in the cardioprotective effects of fisetin. Hence, Fisetin may be evaluated in further clinical studies as a cardioprotective agent in patients undergoing reperfusion interventions.

AB  - Objective The objectives of this study were to evaluate ENDIT score and develop a novel outcome prediction score for outcome of pediatric convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) at the hospital and 3 months postdischarge.
   Methods Children and adolescents aged 1 month to 14 years, presenting with CSE to a tertiary care teaching center in North India from January 2017 to March 2019, were screened for enrollment. In-hospital and 3-month postdischarge outcome were defined as poor if Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS) score dropped by >= 2 levels.
   Results Overall, 61 patients were enrolled for final analysis after applying exclusion and inclusion criteria. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for ENDIT score in predicting mortality and differentiating good from poor outcome at the hospital and at 3 months postdischarge was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58-0.89), 0.7 (95% CI = 0.57-0.83), and 0.72 (95% CI = 0.6-0.82), respectively. Based on predictors in the present cohort that were significantly different between good and poor outcome cases at the hospital and 3 months postdischarge, a new six-point score named PEDSS (pre-status epilepticus PCPCS, background electroencephalographic abnormalities, drug refractoriness, semiology, and critical sickness) was developed. The area under ROC curves for PEDSS score in predicting mortality and differentiating good from poor outcome at the hospital and at 3 months postdischarge were 0.93 (95% CI = 0.87-0.99), 0.8 (95% CI = 0.7-0.9), and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.8-0.96), respectively. The best cutoff PEDSS scores for predicting mortality and poor outcome at the hospital and at 3 months postdischarge were >= 4, >= 3, and >= 3, respectively.
   Significance The PEDSS score has high predictive accuracy for mortality and differentiating good from poor outcome at the hospital and 3 months postdischarge in pediatric CSE. Future studies should be planned to validate it in various geographical and health care settings and in adults.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency and functionality of DCs and its associated stimulatory and inhibitory markers in the pathogenesis of PV Active PV patients (n = 30) having both skin and oral lesions, and 30 healthy controls were recruited in the study. The frequency of DCs was determined by flow cytometry followed by the primary culture by using recombinant IL-4 (250 IU/ml) and GM-CSF (600 IU/ml). The culture supernatant was used for ELISA. RNA was isolated from sorted DCs and used for the mRNA expression of DC-associated stimulatory (CD40 and CD80) and inhibitory (PSGL1 and ILT3) markers. Tissue localization of Langerhans cells was done by immunohistochemistry. In this study, altered frequency of myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) was seen in the circulation of PV patients. The primary culture of patient-derived DCs showed anomalous cytokine profiling. In the culture supernatant of DCs, elevated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-12 were detected in PV patients. Meanwhile, reverse trend was found in the case of IFN-alpha and IL-10 cytokine levels. Similarly, a discrepancy in the expression of DC-associated stimulatory (CD40 and CD80) and inhibitory (PSGL1 and ILT3) markers suggested their possible involvement in the immunopathogenesis of PV. An elevated number of tissue localizing Langerhans cells was also observed in the perilesional skin. This study indicates the distorted frequency and functionality of DCs in the immunopathogenesis of PV. Targeting these functional markers in the future may generate novel therapeutic options for better management of PV.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory cardiac disorder. An early diagnosis is likely to help in the prevention and proper management of this disease. As the study of proteomics provides the potential markers for detection of a disease, in the present investigation, attempt has been made to identify disease-associated differential proteins involved in CAD pathogenesis. For this study, a total of 200 selected CAD patients were considered, who were recruited for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment. The proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Samples were also subjected to Western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolation immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, analytical screening by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and in silico analysis. The representative data were shown as mean +/- SD of at least three experiments. A total of 19 proteins were identified. Among them, the most abundant five proteins (serotransferrin, talin-1, alpha-2HS glycoprotein, transthyretin (TTR), fibrinogen-alpha chain) were found to have altered level in CAD. Serotransferrin, talin-1, alpha-2HS glycoprotein, and transthyretin (TTR) were found to have lower level, whereas fibrinogen-alpha chain was found to have higher level in CAD plasma compared to healthy, confirmed by Western blot analysis. TTR, an important acute phase transport protein, was validated low level in 200 CAD patients who confirmed to undergo PCI treatment. Further, in silico and in vitro studies of TTR indicated a downexpression of CAD in plasma as compared to the plasma of healthy individuals. Lower level of plasma TTR was determined to be an important risk marker in the atherosclerotic-approved CAD patients. We suggest that the TTR lower level predicts disease severity and hence may serve as an important marker tool for CAD screening. However, further large-scale studies are required to determine the clinical significance of TTR.

AB  - PURPOSEChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a significant toxicity of chemotherapy. Olanzapine is recommended in adult patients for the prevention of CINV but has not been prospectively investigated in children.METHODSThis investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label trial evaluated olanzapine in children (ages 5-18 years) scheduled to receive the first cycle of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). All participants received aprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone during and 2 days after chemotherapy. Participants in the study group additionally received oral olanzapine 0.14 mg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest 2.5 mg; maximum, 10 mg) during the chemotherapy block and 3 days postchemotherapy. The primary objective was to compare complete response (CR) rates (no vomiting and no rescue medication) between the groups in the acute, delayed, and overall periods. Nausea comparison and safety evaluation were secondary and additional objectives, respectively. The collection of outcomes and adverse events was performed daily until the completion of the overall period.RESULTSA total of 240 patients underwent randomization. We performed a modified intention-to-treat analysis on 231 patients (116 in the control group and 115 in the study group). A higher proportion of patients in the olanzapine group achieved CR in the acute period (78% v 59%; P = .001), delayed period (74% v 47%; P < .001) and overall period (64% v 38%; P < .001) than in the control group. The proportion of patients with no nausea was significantly higher in the olanzapine group in the acute period (74% v 52%; P < .001), delayed period (74% v 47%; P < .001), and overall period (64% v 37%; P < .001). Grade 1/2 somnolence was greater in the olanzapine group (35% v 11%; P < .001). There was no grade 3/4 somnolence reported.CONCLUSIONOlanzapine significantly improved CR rates for vomiting in children receiving the first cycle of HEC.

AB  - Background Hypertension and diabetes are among the most common and deadly chronic conditions globally. In India, most adults with these conditions remain undiagnosed, untreated, or poorly treated and uncontrolled. Innovative and scalable approaches to deliver proven-effective strategies for medical and lifestyle management of these conditions are needed. Methods The overall goal of this implementation science study is to evaluate the Integrated Tracking, Referral, Electronic decision support, and Care coordination (I-TREC) program. I-TREC leverages information technology (IT) to manage hypertension and diabetes in adults aged >= 30 years across the hierarchy of Indian public healthcare facilities. The I-TREC program combines multiple evidence-based interventions: an electronic case record form (eCRF) to consolidate and track patient information and referrals across the publicly-funded healthcare system; an electronic clinical decision support system (CDSS) to assist clinicians to provide tailored guideline-based care to patients; a revised workflow to ensure coordinated care within and across facilities; and enhanced training for physicians and nurses regarding non-communicable disease (NCD) medical content and lifestyle management. The program will be implemented and evaluated in a predominantly rural district of Punjab, India. The evaluation will employ a quasi-experimental design with mixed methods data collection. Evaluation indicators assess changes in the continuum of care for hypertension and diabetes and are grounded in the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Data will be triangulated from multiple sources, including community surveys, health facility assessments, stakeholder interviews, and patient-level data from the I-TREC program's electronic database. Discussion I-TREC consolidates previously proven strategies for improved management of hypertension and diabetes at single-levels of the healthcare system into a scalable model for coordinated care delivery across all levels of the healthcare system hierarchy. Findings have the potential to inform best practices to ultimately deliver quality public-sector hypertension and diabetes care across India.

AB  - Dysregulation of IFN-alpha is the basis for pathogenesis of autoimmune as well as infectious diseases. Identifying inflammatory signatures in peripheral blood of patients is an approach for monitoring active infection. Hence, estimation of type I IFNs as an inflammatory biomarker to scrutinize disease status after treatment is useful. Accordingly, an Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) for the detection of IFN-alpha in serum samples was developed. Sixteen aptamers were screened for their ability to bind IFN-alpha. Aptamer IFN alpha-3 exhibited specificity for IFN-alpha with no cross-reactivity with interferons beta and gamma and human serum albumin. The disassociation constant (K-d) was determined to be 3.96 +/- 0.36 nM, and the limit of detection was similar to 2 ng. The characterized IFN alpha-3 aptamer was used in ALISA to screen tuberculosis (TB) patients' sera. An elevated IFN-alpha level in sera derived from untreated TB patients (median = 0.31), compared to nontuberculous household contacts (median = 0.13) and healthy volunteers (median = 0.12), and further a decline in IFN-alpha level among treated patients (median = 0.13) were seen. The ALISA assay facilitates direct estimation of inflammatory protein(s) in circulation unlike mRNA estimation by real time PCR. Designing of aptamers similar to the IFN alpha-3 aptamer provides a novel approach to assess other inflammatory protein(s) in patients before, during, and after completion of treatment and would denote clinical improvement in successfully treated patients.

AB  - A rhodamine appended Fe(III)-catecholate complex Fe(RhoCat)(3) is reported as a smart dual-modal T-1 MRI-optical imaging probe. The high spin Fe(III) coordination sphere and rhodamine unit act as MRI and optical reporters, respectively. The probe showed a r(1)-relaxivity of 4.37 mM(-1) s(-1) at 1.41 T via the interaction of second sphere water molecules to coordinated oxygen atoms. It produced an enhanced signal intensity of phantom images on the 7.0 T animal research MRI/MRS scanner at 25 degrees C and pH 7.3. The interaction of the probe with bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly improved r(1) relaxivity (7.09 mM(-1) s(-1)). Moreover, the optical imaging reporter rhodamine moiety exhibited sensitivity towards biomolecule nitric oxide (NO) and acidic pH via the formation of a ring-opened tautomer of rhodamine, wherein the r(1) relaxivity of the probe was enhanced to 5.19 mM(-1) s(-1) for NO and slightly decreased for acidic pH. Further, the probe visualized NO in adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cells via a turn-on fluorescence mechanism with 80% cell viability. Thus, Fe(RhoCat)(3) is demonstrated as a potential dual "MRI-ON and Fluorescence-ON" molecular imaging probe to visualize the NO molecule and acidic pH in the tumour microenvironment.

AB  - Cardiomyocyte inflammation followed by apoptosis and fibrosis is an important mediator for development and progression of heart failure. Activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an important regulator of inflammation, causes the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and injury. However, the precise mechanism of TLR4-mediated adverse cardiac outcomes is still elusive. The present study was designed to find the role of TLR4 in cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis, and molecular mechanism thereof. Rats were treated with TLR4 agonist (LPS 12.5 mu g/kg/day) through osmotic pump for 14 days. To simulate the condition in vitro, H9c2 cells were treated with LPS (1 mu g/ml). Similarly, H9c2 cells were transfected with TLR4 and SIRT2 c-DNA clone for overexpression. Myocardial oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and mitochondrial parameters were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Cardiac inflammation after LPS treatment was confirmed by increased TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression in rat heart. There was a marked increase in oxidative stress as observed by increased TBARS and decreased endogenous antioxidants (GSH and catalase), along with mitochondrial dysfunction as measured by mitochondrial complex activity in LPS-treated rat hearts. Histopathological examination showed the presence of cardiac fibrosis after LPS treatment. Protein expression of nuclear p53 and cleaved caspase-7/caspase-9 was significantly increased in LPS treated heart. Similar to in vivo study, nuclear translocation of p53, mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular apoptosis were observed in H9c2 cells treated with LPS. Our data also indicate that decreased expression of SIRT2 was associated with increased acetylation of p53 after LPS treatment. In conclusion, TLR4 activation in rats promotes cardiac inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and fibrosis. p53 and caspase 7/caspase 9 were found to play an important role in TLR4-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that, reducing TLR4 mediated fibrosis and apoptosis could be a novel approach in the treatment of heart failure, keeping in the view the major role played by TLR4 in cardiac inflammation.

AB  - Classical plant uptake is limited to hydrophilic or water-dispersible material. Therefore, in order to test the uptake behaviour of hydrophobic particles, here, we tested the fate of hydrophobic particles (oleylamine coated Cu2-xSe NPs (CS@OA)) in comparison to hydrophilic particles (chitosan-coated Cu2-xSe NPs (CS@CH)) by treatment on the plant roots. Surprisingly, hydrophobic CS@OA NPs have been found to be similar to 1.3 times more efficient than hydrophilic CS@CH NPs in tomato plant root penetration. An atomic force microscopy (AFM) adhesion force experiment confirms that hydrophobic NPs experience non-spontaneous yet energetically favorable root trapping and penetration. Further, a relative difference in the hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic NPs movement from roots to shoots has been observed and found related to the change in protein corona as identified by two dimensional-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) analysis. Finally, the toxicity assays at the give concentration showed that Cu2-xSe NPs lead to non-significant toxicity as compared to control. This technology may find an advantage in fertilizer application.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by cognitive deficit and memory loss. The pathological feature of the disease involves beta -amyloid senile plaques, reduced levels of acetylcholine neurotransmitter, oxidative stress and neurofibrillary tangles formation within the brain of AD patients. The present study aims to screen the inhibitory activity of newly synthesized and existing novel 4-methylthiocoumarin derivative against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, BACE1, beta -amyloid aggregation and oxidative stress involved in the AD pathogenesis. The in vitro assays used in this study were Ellman's assay, FRET assays, Thioflavin T, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism, FRAP, and TEAC. Molecular docking and dynamics studies were performed to correlate the results. C3 and C7 (thiocoumarin derivatives) were found to be the most potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (IC50-5.63 mu M) and butyrylcholinesterase (IC50-3.40 mu M) using Ellman's assays. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that C3 and C7 compounds followed by the mixed mode of inhibition using LB plot. C3 also moderately inhibited the BACE1 using FRET assay. C3 inhibited the fibrillization of beta -amyloid peptides in a concentration-dependent manner as observed by Thioflavin T, TEM studies and Circular dichroism data. Molecular modeling studies were performed to understand the probable mode of binding of C3 and C7 in the binding pocket of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, BACE1 and amyloid beta peptides. This indicates the important role of hydrophobic interactions between C3 and acetylcholinesterase. C3 also exhibited significant antioxidant potential by FRAP and TEAC assays. Hence, C3 might serve as a promising lead for developing novel multi target-directed ligand for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Background Sudoku is a popular cognitively stimulating leisure-time activity. Many studies have been directed toward finding an algorithm to solve Sudoku, but the investigation of the neural substrates involved in Sudoku has been challenging. Methods Sudoku task was divided into two steps to understand the differential function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) while applying heuristic rules. PFC activity was recorded at 16 optode locations using functional near infrared spectroscopy. Classical two-way analysis of variance as well as general linear model-based approach was used to analyze the data from 28 noise-free recordings obtained from right-handed participants. Results Post hoc analysis showed a significant increase in oxyhemoglobin concentrations and decrease in deoxyhemoglobin concentrations at all 16 optode locations during step 1 (3 x 3 subgrids) and step 2 (easy level 9 x 9 Sudoku) when compared with the rest (p < 0.0001). Contrasting the step 2 - step 1 revealed that medial regions of PFC were preferentially activated. Conclusion Both the medial and lateral regions of PFC are activated during Sudoku task. However, the medial regions of PFC play a differential role, especially when we consider searching and selecting the heuristic rules. Thus, Sudoku may be used for cognitive remediation training in neuropsychiatric disorders involving PFC.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of 2019 COVID-19 pandemic, national lockdown, and unlocking on ophthalmic care provided by the government-funded apex health institute of India. Methods: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients presenting to the ophthalmology department from March 23, 2020, to July 15, 2020, was compared with that from March 23, 2019, to July 15, 2019. The data between March 23, 2020, to May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 06, 2020, to July 15, 2020 (unlock) was compared separately. Parameters evaluated were age, gender, presenting complaints, final diagnosis, treatment advised, and surgical interventions. Results: During the lockdown, routine outpatient flow reduced by 97.14% (P < 0.001), the median age of presentation decreased to 29 years (55 years last year) and males increased by 4.7% (from 61.51% to 66.21%) in 2020. Emergency services decreased by 35.25%, percentage of children decreased by 4.28% (from 34.28% to 30%) and males increased by 13.53% (from 59.97% to 73.5%). Mechanical trauma, microbial keratitis, and conjunctivitis were the most common reasons for presentation. The former lessened by 41.75% while the latter two amplified by 1.25 times and 2 times, respectively. While sanitizer-associated chemical injury increased in proportion, endophthalmitis, and postoperative complications declined. The number of donor corneas collected and emergency therapeutic keratoplasties performed decreased by 99.61% and 92.39%, respectively (P < 0.001). During the unlocking phase, routine patient consultations were 71 +/- 19/ day, significantly lower than 978 +/- 109/day of last year (P < 0.001). No voluntary eye donation was reported during this period. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown severely hampered the delivery of ophthalmic care by the apex-ophthalmic institute. Unlike anticipated, lifting of pandemic-associated lockdown served only minimally in improving patient inflow in its initial phases.

AB  - In the accompanying article appearing in this issue of the Journal, Prabhu and his colleagues, from Bengalaru in India, describe their experience with patients having a right aortic arch. They discuss the fact that the anomalous arrangements they encountered can all be interpreted on the basis of the hypothetical double arch proposed by Edwards. They point to the fact that interpretation of the developmental changes underscoring the production of the double arch is currently confused by reference to the so-called Rathke diagram, in which six sets of arteries are shown extending through the mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arches. As the authors point out, Graham and his associates have now shown that the alleged fifth set of pharyngeal arches do not exist. Based on our own observations, we endorse this statement. It means that new explanations must now be provided for the lesions previously described on the basis of persistence of the alleged artery of the fifth pharyngeal arch. We have previously claimed to have observed such an artery in a human fetus. We now believe, on the basis of our latest findings, that our earlier observation is better explained on the basis of presence of a collateral channel. We suggest that the so-called "fifth arch arteries" are themselves then best explained either on the basis of existence of such collateral channels, or remodelling of the aortic sac, which is the manifold, during development, that gives rise to the pharyngeal arch arteries.

TI  - Epithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinoma of the Lacrimal Gland: Case Report of Youngest Patient
T2  - OPHTHALMIC PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
KW  - TUMORS
AB  - The authors report a case of extremely uncommon malignancy of lacrimal gland epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. This carcinoma is more commonly encountered in salivary glands and comprises 1% of all salivary gland tumors. Its occurrence in the orbit is very rare with only 6 cases reported in the literature, most of which arose in a pleomorphic adenoma. Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma is primarily a tumor of older adults, with a peak incidence in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The present case is the youngest patient reported to date and had no history of preexisting neoplasm in the lacrimal gland. Histological diagnosis of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma is challenging because of the similarity with other lacrimal gland epithelial tumors like malignant adenoid cystic carcinoma and benign pleomorphic adenomas.

AB  - The present study evaluates the postmortem redistribution of ketamine in ocular matrices, such as vitreous humor, aqueous humor, and ocular tissues in an animal model. To understand the redistribution of ketamine and its metabolite (norketamine) in the ocular matrices, an in vivo study was performed in rabbits. The rabbits were divided into two groups: perimortem and postmortem. The postmortem samples were collected at 17 h after the administration of ketamine (40 mg/kg) intravenously. For a better understanding of the metabolism of ketamine in eyes, an ex vivo study was conducted in goat eyes after administration of ketamine intravitreally. The samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and the levels of ketamine and norketamine in these matrices were compared with that of whole blood and plasma. The results of the in vivo study showed a decrease in ketamine levels in whole blood and plasma while an increase in ocular matrices at postmortem. Though, in most cases, this increase/decrease was statistically insignificant. Moreover, there was an increase of norketamine level in ocular matrices. Ex vivo study also shows the presence of norketamine in ocular matrices of goat eyes. The presence of norketamine in goat eyes may be indicative of the metabolism of ketamine in the eyes.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens, a rod-shaped, gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium is one of the most widely occurring bacterial pathogens, associated with a spectrum of diseases in humans. A major virulence factor during its infection is the enzyme phospholipase C encoded by the plc gene, known as Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (CpPLC). The present study was designed to understand the role of CpPLC in inducing survival mechanisms and mitochondrial-induced epigenetic changes in a human lymphocyte cell culture model. Following exposure to CpPLC, a significant generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was observed, which coincided with the changes in the expression of vital components of MAP/ERK/RTK signaling cascade that regulates the downstream cellular functions. These disturbances further led to alterations in the mitochondrial genome and functioning. This was supported by the observed upregulation in the expression of mitochondrial fission genes Drp1, Fis1, and Mff, and mitochondrial fusion genes MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 following CpPLC exposure. CpPLC exposed cells showed upregulation of OMA1, DELE1, and HRI genes involved in the integrated stress response (ISR), which suggests that it may induce the ISR that provides a pro-survival mechanism to the host cell. CpPLC also initiated immune patho-physiologic mechanisms including mitochondrial-induced epigenetic modifications through a mitochondrial-ROS driven signaling pathway. Interestingly, epigenetic machinery not only play a pivotal role in lymphocyte homeostasis by contributing to cell-fate decisions but thought to be one of the mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens survive within the host cells. Importantly, the impairment of mtDNA repair among the CpPLC exposed cells, induced alterations within mtDNA methylation, and led to the deregulation of MT-CO1, MT-ND6, MT-ATPase 6, and MT-ATPase8 gene expression profiles that are important for mitochondrial bioenergetics and subsequent metabolic pathways. This was further confirmed by the changes in the activity of mitochondrial electron chain complexes (complex I, II, III, IV and V). The altered mtDNA methylation profile was also found to be closely associated with the varied expression of mitomiRs and their targets. CpPLC exposed cells showed up-regulation of miR24 expression and down-regulation of miR34a, miR150, and miR155, while the increased expression of mitomiR target genes i.e. of K-Ras, MYC, EGFR, and NF-k beta was also observed in these cells. Altogether, our findings provide novel insights into the derailment of redox signaling machinery in CpPLC treated lymphocytes and its role in the induction of survival mechanisms and mitochondrial-induced epigenetic modifications.

AB  - Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of BRAF(V600E) and TERT promoter mutations in paediatric and young adult patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and the secondary objective, to assess their association with clinicopathological features.
   Methods: Patients <= 20 years who underwent surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) from 2005 to 2018 were consecutively enrolled for BRAF(V600E) and TERT promoter mutations analysis and records analysed for the association of aggressive features. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the independent predictors of BRAF(V600E) mutations.
   Results: Among 100 patients with DTC, 68 patients were <= 18 years and the remaining 30 patients were >18 years of age with a median age of 17 years (IQR 14-19 years) 98 patients had PTC and 2 had FTC. BRAF v600E mutation was present in 14/98 (14.3%) PTC and TERT promoter mutation noted in none. Multivariate analysis identified RAI refractoriness (OR:10.57, 95% CI: 2.6 to 41.6, P-0.0008) as an independent factor associated with BRAF(V600E) mutation. 17 patients with distant metastases were negative for both BRAF(V600E) or TERTpromoter mutation. No significant association was observed between age, gender, PTC variants, extra-thyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, multifocality, RAI administration and event rate with BRAF(V600E)mutation. Irrespective of BRAF(V600E) mutation, radioiodine refractory status (p-0.0001) had a reduced EFS probability.
   Conclusion: In paediatric & young adult PTC, TERT promoter mutation is absent and BRAF(V600E) mutation is not associated with distant metastasis. The prevalence rate of the BRAF(V600E) mutation is much lower compared to adult PTC patients.

AB  - Background: Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is a form of neuromodulation for patients with drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE), in whom extensive preoperative evaluation fails to localize the epileptogenic zone. VNS is often compared to Corpus callosotomy (CC) in terms of both indications and efficacy. However, VNS represents a less invasive and less morbid procedure compared to CC and is the preferred procedure in majority of patients with DRE.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to present the surgical technique and nuances involved in the implantation of vagal nerve stimulator.
   Procedure: A 16-year-old boy suffering from DRE, with bilateral seizure onset on evaluation, for 12 years, underwent left vagal nerve stimulator placement. The VNS device has a lead and a pulse generator, the lead has coils to be wrapped around the vagus nerve and the pulse generator is placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the infraclavicular region (demonstrated in the video).
   Results: The patient is relieved of the disabling drop attacks along with improved cognitive functions at 1 year follow up.
   Conclusions: In carefully selected patients, VNS is a safe and effective procedure to alleviate seizures, in cases otherwise morbidly affected due to drug refractory epilepsy.

AB  - Background: The fractures of the odontoid process constitute 10% of all cervical spine injuries. Odontoid screw placement, although technically challenging, in indicated cases is the ideal treatment. Hence, a thorough knowledge of the odontoid dimensions is necessary prior to the surgical endeavor, more so for planning double odontoid screws. Materials and Methods: A prospective morphometric analysis of retrospective data of 250 patients was acquired at our institute using Somatom Definition edge 128 slice 64-row detector Siemens CT scanner. The dimensions of the odontoid process were measured at the waist (narrowest portion), widest diameter both in anteroposterior and transverse diameters. The dimensions of the C2 vertebra were measured at the level of the superior and inferior endplate in both the planes. Results: A total of 250 patients were evaluated with age ranging from 1 to 80 years. Males constituted 174 (69.6%) and 76 (30.4%) were females. The mean transverse diameter (TD) at the odontoid waist (narrowest diameter) was 8.66 mm. The mean TD at the widest point of odontoid was 9.68 mm. Mean anteroposterior (AP) diameter 2.5 mm away from the midline on the left side at the level of the waist was 9.51 mm and 2.5 mm on the right of midline was 9.01 mm. The mean AP diameter at the C2 base was 15.824 mm in males and 14.833 mm in females (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Double odontoid screw insertion is feasible in only 36% of Indians in the transverse plane, whereas 98.4% of the odontoids can accommodate double screws in the sagittal plane.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third among the most commonly occurring cancers worldwide, and it causes half a million deaths annually. Alongside mechanistic study for CRC detection and treatment by conventional techniques, new technologies have been developed to study CRC. These technologies include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics which elucidate DNA markers, RNA transcripts, protein and, metabolites produced inside the colon and rectum part of the gut. All these approaches form the omics arena, which presents a remarkable opportunity for the discovery of novel prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers and also delineate the underlying mechanism of CRC causation, which may further help in devising treatment strategies. This review also mentions the latest developments in metagenomics and culturomics as emerging evidence suggests that metagenomics of gut microbiota has profound implications in the causation, prognosis, and treatment of CRC. A majority of bacteria cannot be studied as they remain unculturable, so culturomics has also been strengthened to develop culture conditions suitable for the growth of unculturable bacteria and identify unknown bacteria. The overall purpose of this review is to succinctly evaluate the application of omics technologies in colorectal cancer research for improving the diagnosis and treatment strategies.

AB  - Epilepsy surgery currently offers the best treatment for patients with drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE). Resective surgery, in the presence of a well-localized epileptogenic focus, remains the best modality towards achieving seizure freedom. However, localization of the focus may not be possible in all the cases of DRE, despite comprehensive epilepsy workup. Neuromodulation techniques such as vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) may be a good alternative in these cases. This article intends to provide an overview of VNS in the management of DRE, including indications, comprehensive preoperative workup, exemplified by case illustrations and outcomes by reviewing the evidence available in the literature.

AB  - Background: Bilateral anterior cingulotomy (BAC) constitutes the most commonly performed procedure for treatment of refractory OCD. Evolution of stereotactic procedures has rekindled the interest in the effective management of refractory psychiatric disorders, especially OCD with utmost safety and excellent outcomes.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the technique of performing BAC under robotic guidance using radiofrequency ablation with an operative video.
   Procedure: A 23-year-old gentleman diagnosed with symptoms of OCD for a duration of 8 years and was refractory to conventional therapy. The trajectories for BAC were planned on the robotic platform (ROSA, Zimmer-Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana, USA). The target point was selected on the anterior cingulate, approximately 2 cms posterior to the anterior most point of the frontal horn, 2-3 mm above the corpus callosum and 7 mm lateral to the midline. Pre coronal (1 cm anterior and 3 cms lateral to midline) holes of 2.5 mm diameter were made using pneumatic handheld drill. Radiofrequency (RF) thermocoagulation of the anterior cingulum was performed using an RF probe of 2.2 mm diameter and 4 mm uninsulated tip under robotic guidance after confirming the position with intraoperative O-arm imaging bilaterally.
   Results: The surgery was uneventful and the patient had a significant improvement following surgery, with the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale of 18 at 1 year follow-up compared to the preoperative score of 36.
   Conclusion: Robotic-guided BAC is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of drug-refractory OCD. Intraoperative O arm CT augments the precision of the lesions created.

KW  - TUMORS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Granular cell astrocytoma (GCA) is an aggressive variant of astrocytoma characterized by predominantly round-to-polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. This tumor usually lack the morphological signatures of conventional astrocytoma and are devoid of typical features which define a malignant neoplasm, leading to potential misdiagnosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report GCA in a 50-year-old man presenting with severe headache along with vertiginous sensation and sensory seizures of left upper limb for past two months. Imaging showed multiple intra-axial, hyperintense space-occupying lesions in bilateral anterior temporal lobe, left parietal lobe, left thalamus and cerebellum, raising possibility of lymphoma/metastases. Histopathologic examination revealed sheets of large polygonal cells with distinct cellular outline, ample amount of eosinophilic PAS-positive granular cytoplasm, eccentrically placed irregular, round-to-ovoid nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were diffusely immunopositive for Olig2, S100, EMA, lysozyme and CD68, and they were immunonegative for GFAP, LCA, pan-CK, TTF-1, TFE-3, PAX-8, SOX10, MAP2, MBP, NF, H3K27M, H3K27me3, p53, IDH1 (R132H), CD1a, langerin and BRAFV600E. Numerous scattered macrophages were highlighted by CD163. MIB 1-labelling-index was approximately 5%-6%. Overall features were congruous with final diagnosis of GCA.
   CONCLUSIONS: GCAs behave in a belligerent manner irrespective of their morphologic grade as they are seen to exhibit genetic alterations similar to glioblastoma. Thereby, they warrant early diagnosis for conducive patient management.

AB  - Quantitative estimates for the global impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis and management of patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are lacking. We collected relevant data from 16 specialized medical centers treating IEM patients in Europe, Asia and Africa. The median decline of reported IEM related services in March 1st-May 31st 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 were as high as 60-80% with a profound impact on patient management and care for this vulnerable patient group. More representative data along with outcome data and guidelines for managing IEM disorders under such extraordinary circumstances are needed.

KW  - STIMULATION
AB  - Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently the preferred surgical treatment for various movement disorders. Pallidotomy is an effective procedure for patients with dystonia and Parkinson's disease and was the surgical treatment of choice before the advent of DBS. However, it can be the preferred modality in immunocompromised patients and those patients who cannot afford DBS due to financial constraints. Hypophonia, dysarthria and dysphagia are the most significant complications of bilateral pallidotomy. Objective: The aim of this study was to present the surgical technique and nuances involved in bilateral simultaneous pallidotomy in a patient with generalized dystonia. Procedure: A 30-year male with primary generalized dystonia presented to us with preoperative Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) Dystonia Rating Scale of 24. After acquiring preoperative volumetric 3T MRI and stereotactic CT, bilateral pallidotomy was done under general anesthesia. There were no procedure related complications. Results: At two months of follow-up, his BFM dystonia score improved from 24 to 4.5. Conclusion: Appropriately acquired volumetric MRI, meticulous planning and meticulously performed surgical procedure can help in achieving good outcome and minimize the complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Despite the rising trend of medicolegal challenges in India, there is an absolute dearth of literature from India on this issue. The authors conducted a survey, to their knowledge a first of its kind, to assess the perceptions of Indian neurosurgeons about the medicolegal challenges faced in everyday practice.
   METHODS An anonymous online survey performed using Google Forms was widely circulated among neurosurgeons practicing in India via email and social media platforms. The questionnaire consisted of 38 questions covering the various aspects of medicolegal issues involved in neurosurgery practice.
   RESULTS A total of 221 survey responses were received, out of which 214 responses were included in the final analysis, barring 7 responders who had no work experience in India. The respondents were categorized according to their working arrangements and work experience. Out of all of the respondents, 20 (9.3%) had >= 1 malpractice suits filed against them. More than 90% of the respondents believed that malpractice suits are on the rise in India. Almost half of the respondents believed the advent of teleconsultation is further compounding the risk of malpractice suits, and 66.4% of respondents felt that they were inadequately trained during residency to deal with medicolegal issues. Most respondents (88.8%) felt that neurosurgeons working in the government sector had lesser chances of facing litigations in comparison to those working in the private sector. The practice of obtaining video proof of consent was more commonly reported by respondents working in freelancing and private settings (45.1%) and those with multiple affiliations (61.3%) compared to respondents practicing in government settings (22.8%) (p < 0.001). Neurosurgeons working in the private sector were more likely to alter management and refer sick patients to higher-volume treatment centers to avoid malpractice suits than their government counterparts (p = 0.043 and 0.006, respectively). The practices pertaining to legal preparedness were also found to be significantly higher among the respondents from the private sector (p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS This survey highlights the apprehensions of neurosurgeons in India with regard to rising malpractice suits and the subsequent increase of defensive neurosurgical practices, especially in the private sector. A stronger legal framework for providing for quick redress of patient complaints, while deterring frivolous malpractice suits, can go a long way to allay these fears. There is a dire need for systematic training of neurosurgeons regarding legal preparedness, which should begin during residency.

AB  - Current therapy for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), compromised by drug resistance, toxicity, and high cost, demands for more effective, safer, and low-cost drugs. Artemisinin has been found to be an effectual drug alternative in experimental models of leishmaniasis. Comparative genome and transcriptome analysis of in vitro-adapted artesunate-resistant (K133AS-R) and -sensitive wild-type (K133WT) Leishmania donovani parasites was carried out using next-generation sequencing and single-color DNA microarray technology, respectively, to identify genes and interlinked pathways contributing to drug resistance. Whole-genome sequence analysis of K133WT vs. K133AS-R parasites revealed substantial variation among the two and identified 240 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 237 insertion deletions (InDels), 616 copy number variations (CNVs) (377 deletions and 239 duplications), and trisomy of chromosome 12 in K133AS-R parasites. Transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of 208 genes (fold change >= 2) in K133AS-R parasites. Functional categorization and analysis of modulated genes of interlinked pathways pointed out plausible adaptations in K133AS-R parasites, such as (i) a dependency on lipid and amino acid metabolism for generating energy, (ii) reduced DNA and protein synthesis leading to parasites in the quiescence state, and (iii) active drug efflux. The upregulated expression of cathepsin-L like protease, amastin-like surface protein, and amino acid transporter and downregulated expression of the gene encoding ABCG2, pteridine receptor, adenylatecyclase-type receptor, phosphoaceylglucosamine mutase, and certain hypothetical proteins are concordant with genomic alterations suggesting their potential role in drug resistance. The study provided an understanding of the molecular basis linked to artemisinin resistance in Leishmania parasites, which may be advantageous for safeguarding this drug for future use.

TI  - Validation of an indigenous assay for rapid molecular detection of rifampicin resistance in presumptive multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis patients
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
KW  - MTB/RIF

KW  - TB
AB  - Background & objectives: There is a need for an affordable, easy, high-sensitivity test usable at the peripheral health facility for diagnosis of drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) to interrupt disease transmission. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for early detection of DR-TB are ideal to bring testing near to the patient. TruenatTM MTB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and TruenatTM MTB-RIF (rifampicin) is an indigenous chip-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based test for detection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. The test involves extraction of DNA using automated, battery operated Trueprep instrument and real-time PCR performed on the Truelab analyzer. We report here multicentric validation of Truenat MTB-RIF for detection of DR-TB in suspected DR-TB patients. Methods: Consecutive patients aged 18-65 yr, with symptoms suggestive of TB and with a history of previous treatment, reporting to the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) clinics under four national institutes, namely AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi), NITRD (National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases, New Delhi), NIRT (National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai) and ICMR-National JALMA Institute for Leprosy and other Mycobacterial Diseases, Agra, were included in the study. Two sputum samples (one spot and one morning) were collected from each patient, after obtaining informed written consent. The samples were subjected to smear, GeneXpert and MGIT 960 culture (and drug susceptibility testing to RIF) (surrogate for MDR-TB) to serve as reference tests. The samples were coded to ensure blinding and subjected to Truenat MTB-RIF. Truenat MTB-RIF Version 1.5 was used for testing 1084 samples for RIF resistance, while Version 2.0 was used to test another 1201 samples. Results: Truenat MTB-RIF Version 1.5 in comparison with comprehensive laboratory reference standards yielded sensitivity and specificity of 76.2 and 94.7 per cent, respectively for the detection of RIF resistance in 1084 samples, collected across four sites. Based on the analysis of discordant samples, Version 2.0 of Truenat was developed by the manufacturer and this was further tested on additional 1201 samples, yielding a sensitivity of 87.5 per cent and specificity of 99.5 per cent. Interpretation & conclusions: Multicentric trial of TruenatTM MTB-RIF demonstrated a great potential of this point of care NAAT for detection of MDR-TB. The test would be useful in limited resource settings and inaccessible areas without need for any additional infrastructure.

AB  - Background and Aim: Treatment trial with antitubercular therapy [ATT] is a common strategy in tuberculosis-endemic countries in case of a diagnostic dilemma between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease [CD]. Our aim was to determine the long-term clinical course of patients who received ATT before an eventual diagnosis of CD was made.
   Methods: We performed retrospective comparison between CD patients who received >= 6 months of ATT vs those who did not receive ATT. Outcomes assessed were change in disease behaviour during follow-up, requirement of surgery and medication use.
   Results: In all, 760 patients with CD were screened for the study and, after propensity matching for location and behaviour of disease, 79 patients in each group were compared. Progression from inflammatory [B1] to stricturing/fistulising [B2/B3] phenotype was increased among CD patients who received ATT [61, 62, B3: 73.4%, 26.6%, 0% at baseline vs: 41.8%, 51.9%, 6.3% at follow-up, respectively] as compared with those who did not receive ATT [B1, B2, B3: 73.4%, 26.6%, 0% at baseline vs: 72.2%, 27.8%, 0% at follow-up, respectively] with an odds ratio of 11.05[3.17-38.56]. The usage of 5-aminosalocylates, steroids, immunosuppressants and anti-tumour necrosis factor was similar between both the groups. On survival analysis, CD patients who received ATT had a lower probability of remaining free of surgery 145%] than those who did not [76%] at 14 years of follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.22, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-7.12, p= 0.004].
   Conclusions: Crohn's disease patients diagnosed after a trial with antitubercular therapy had an unfavourable long-term disease course with higher rate of stricture formation and less chance of remaining free of surgery.

KW  - DEFINITION
AB  - Background: Segmental vitiligo has a different clinical course and prognosis as compared to nonsegmental vitiligo, which necessitates its correct diagnosis. It may be difficult to distinguish segmental vitiligo from the limited or focal types of nonsegmental vitiligo.
   Objective: To validate the previously proposed diagnostic criteria for segmental vitiligo.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional validation study involving patients with limited vitiligo. The diagnostic criteria were used to classify vitiligo lesions as segmental or nonsegmental, and was compared with the experts' diagnosis, which was considered as the "gold standard".
   Results: The study included 200 patients with 225 vitiligo lesions. As per the diagnostic criteria, 146 vitiligo lesions were classified as segmental and 79 as nonsegmental. The experts classified 147 vitiligo lesions as segmental and 39 as nonsegmental, while the diagnosis either was labeled "unsure" or could not be agreed upon for 39 lesions. As compared with the experts' opinions ("for sure" cases, n = 186), the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic criteria was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.2%-95.7%) and 100% (95% CI: 91%-100%), respectively. The positive predictive value was 100% (95% CI: 97.3-100%), while the negative predictive value was 76.5% (95% CI: 62.5%-87.2%). There was a 93.5% agreement between the clinical criteria and experts' opinions (k = 0.83, P < 0.001).
   Limitation: The diagnostic criteria were compared with the experts' opinion in the absence of an established diagnostic "gold standard".
   Conclusions: The proposed diagnostic criteria for segmental vitiligo performed well, and can be used in clinical practice, as well as in research settings.

AB  - Objectives. Tissue hypoxia in oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) induces hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), causing angiogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may predict susceptibility to environmental carcinogens and to development of OSMF, as well as its severity and malignant transformation. This study aimed to determine the serologic levels and frequencies of SNPs of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF in OSMF.
   Study Design. In this prospective pilot study, the frequencies of SNPs of HIF-1 alpha (C1772 T, G1790 A); VEGF-A 936 C/T; and VEGF-C (rs7664413, rs1485766) in patients with OSMF or oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and in healthy controls were determined by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (n = 100 each), and serologic levels were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA (n = 50 each), in a North Indian population.
   Results. Heterozygous forms of HIF-1 alpha C1772 T (CT: odds ratio [OR] 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.24 - 11.16; P <.001); HIF-1 alpha G1790 A (GA: OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.62-5.16; P <.001); and VEGF-C rs1485766 (AC: OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.19 - 3.99; P <.05) were associated with OSMF. The mean serologic levels of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF-A, and VEGF-C were significantly raised in patients with OSMF compared with healthy controls (P <.001).
   Conclusions. The SNPs of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF-A, and VEGF-C and their serologic levels can act as prognostic biomarkers and aid in the development of specialized anti-HIF-1 alpha or anti-VEGF drugs for the management and prevention of OSCC in patients with OSMF.

AB  - Introduction: In effusion cytology, mesothelial cells can occasionally present with striking intracytoplasmic accumulation of rod- and crystal-like cytoplasmic lamellar inclusions (LIs). Their nature and function are poorly understood, and their diagnostic relevance is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the nature of LIs in mesothelial cells and determine their prevalence and diagnostic utility in routine practice. Material and Method: We reviewed a consecutive series of cytological specimens of reactive (n = 102) and malignant effusions (n = 90), respectively. Malignant effusions included malignant mesotheliomas (n = 63) and carcinomas (n = 27). LIs of one effusion were analyzed by electron microscopy (EM). Results: LIs were found exclusively in benign mesothelial cells in 14% (14/102) of reactive and in 4% (1/27) of malignant effusions with carcinomatosis. They were absent in effusions of malignant mesothelioma. EM revealed mainly straight lamellar, less tubular, structures in cisternae of the hyperplasic rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). Conclusion: Cytoplasmic LIs located within hyperplastic rER can be found in up to 14% of effusions restricted to benign mesothelial cells. They can be used as an indirect morphological clue favoring the diagnosis of benign effusion and helping the cytologist to differentiate between reactive and malignant mesothelial cells in daily practice.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sublingual gland flap in the reconstruction of surgical defect following sequestrectomy in medication induced osteonecrosis of jaws (MRONJ), osteomyelitis (OML), and osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of mandible. A total of 6 patients with MRONJ (n = 4) osteomyelitis (n = 1) and ORN (n = 1) underwent sequestrectomy and reconstruction with sublingual gland flap. There were 03 males and 03 females. The age range was 45-71-70 years. All defects were present in the posterior mandible. All patients' undergone sequestrectomy, debridement, and reconstruction with sublingual gland flap under local anesthesia. Postoperatively patients were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months. Patients were monitored for complete epithelization of defect, infection, pain, and recurrence of the lesion. Complete epithelization with closure of the defect was achieved in all cases. None of the patients had residual pain or inflammation at the surgical site. None of our patients experienced any donor site morbidities. There was no case of postoperative infection. Reconstruction of intraoral defects using sublingual gland flap is an effective treatment modality to reconstruct small to medium sized defect of oral cavity.

AB  - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is the most common benign tumor of the nasopharynx. For reasons unknown, this tumor is found almost always in male population. However, site of origin of JNA is still an enigma. Previously, JNA was considered to arise from the superior aspect of sphenopalatine foramen. Over last decade, the vidian canal was considered to be the more specific and likely site of origin. However, based on our observations, we believe this hypothesis to be anomalous as it does not explain major blood supply, pattern of skull base erosion in early stage of tumor and newer studies on electron microscopic and immunopathological findings. To explain these anomalies, we hypothesize the site of origin to be palato-vaginal canal.

TI  - Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose rapidly increases haemoglobin and serum ferritin among pregnant females with moderate-to-severe anaemia: A single-arm, open-label trial
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Infusion of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) can correct iron deficiency anaemia in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. However, large-scale public health use of FCM is constrained by two issues. First, there is limited evidence on the efficacy and safety profile of FCM in the Indian context. Second, logistic challenges in administering FCM at a subdistrict healthcare setting have not been assessed. We aimed to measure the mean increase in haemoglobin (Hb) level 2 weeks after infusion of FCM to pregnant females with moderate-to-severe anaemia attending a subdistrict hospital in India. Methods. During June-December 2016, we did a single-arm, open-label trial among pregnant females with a gestation of 16-32 weeks, Hb 5.0-9.9 g/dl. FCM was infused (per Ganzoni formula) in a single session up to a maximum of 1000 mg of iron. Hb and s-ferritin levels were measured at recruitment, 2 weeks post-infusion and at delivery. Adverse events were noted. Results. Seventy-seven pregnant females were enrolled with mean (SD) age 23.2 (3.1) years, gestation 27.6 (3.8) weeks and Hb 8.4 (0.9) g/dl. At 2 weeks post-infusion (n=63), the mean Hb level increased by 1.9 g/dl (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-2.3) and at delivery (n = 64) by 2.9 g/dl (95% CI 2.4-3.4). The median (interquartile range) (in ng/ml) for serum ferritin at baseline (n = 68), 2 weeks post-FCM infusion (n = 61) and at delivery (n = 39) was 6.3 (5.1-11.7), 275.4 (186.4-330.3) and 61.3 (42.5-132.0), respectively. No major adverse effects were reported. Conclusion. Infusion of FCM rapidly corrected anaemia, sustained its effect till delivery and replenished body iron reserves. FCM is safe and effective in treating anaemia in pregnant females in the second and third trimester at the subdistrict healthcare setting in India.

AB  - Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with refractive capsulorhexis and toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in 14 eyes with senile cataract and a preexisting regular corneal astigmatism of 1.5 D or more. Intraoperatively, the accuracy of the capsular rim marks was confirmed using the digital overlay of CALLISTO Eye and Z Align (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). Postoperatively, the mean deviation from target axis of implantation was 2.07 degrees +/- 1.49 degrees. Refractive capsulorhexis combines the advantages of a femtosecond laser capsulotomy with a one-step visual guide for intraoperative toric IOL alignment as well as postoperative assessment of rotational stability.

KW  - ERA
AB  - Background. Although the outcomes of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and corrective surgery for male infertility are reported in the literature, these are based on studies specifically designed to assess the outcomes of individual interventions and do not reflect the real-life (intent-to-treat) outcomes of managing infertility. There are sparse data on the actual utilization of treatment and pregnancy outcomes in these patients. We aimed to evaluate the demographics, aetiology, treatment utilization and outcomes of treatment of male infertility in a tertiary care centre. Methods. We prospectively enrolled 447 infertile males for evaluation over 30 months beginning October 2015. All patients were evaluated and investigated as per the study protocol to identify the cause of infertility. The patients were advised interventions based on the diagnosis and were followed up to assess delivery of treatment and outcomes of interventions in terms of pregnancy rates. Results. Of the 447 enrolled patients, 426 (mean age 31 years) completed the initial diagnostic evaluation. About 83% had primary infertility, 40% had oligo/astheno/ teratozoospermia, 40% had azoospermia, and 21.1% had obstructive azoospermia. Genetic abnormalities were detected in 9.3% of the 162 patients screened. ART was advised for 71.8% of patients, but only 18% of patients actually received the treatment though they had a high success rate (38%). In contrast, surgery was recommended to only 35 (8.2%) patients, but only 18 (58%) received the recommended treatment with a pregnancy rate of 33.3%. Overall, only 24.4% of patients received the advised treatment with a pregnancy rate of 36.8%. Conclusions. ART was the most common intervention recommended, but less than one-fourth of couples received the recommended treatment. Surgery is indicated in a small number of patients, but is delivered to a larger proportion than those advised ART with both modalities having similar pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - The authors report a rare case of persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) associated with lens subluxation, axial myopia, and a thick bifid vascular stalk connecting the lens to an anomalous disc, along with medullated nerve fibers temporal to the disc. A thick fibrous membrane encasing the subluxated lens with multiple branch-like fibrovascular channels extending to the zonules was noted. This membrane with its extensions had similar histology as that of the PFV stalk. This case report adds to the understanding of PFV spectrum.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of seagull-shaped nasolabial flap (NLF) along with adjunctive short-term oral pentoxifylline in the surgical reconstruction of oral sub mucous fibrosis (OSMF) following fibrotomy. We retrospectively evaluated 18 patients with grade IV oral sub mucous fibrosis treated by NLF. There were 3 females and 15 males. All patients were classified as stage IV OSMF with a mean preoperative mouth opening of 8.11 +/- 3.38 mm. Postoperatively, patients were administered 400 mg of pentoxifylline (PTX) thrice daily for 3 months. Patients were followed up at one month, six months and one year. Mouth opening, presence or absence of malignant transformation, relapse and complications were recorded at each follow-up. We found statistically significant increase in mouth opening from 8.11 +/- 3.3 to 37.67 +/- 3.74 in the postoperative period. The complications associated with NLF were very minimal. The PTX was well tolerated by all the patients. There was no incidence of relapse or rebound fibrosis seen in our series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that oral pentoxifylline has been administered along with surgical treatment of oral submucous fibrosis to prevent relapse. The use of oral PTX as an adjunct along with surgical reconstruction in OSMF improves mouth opening, reduces burning sensation and relapse. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the main cancer in women having multiple receptor based tumour subtypes. Large scale genome sequencing studies of BC have identified several genes among which GATA3 is reported as a highly mutated gene followed by TP53 and PIK3CA. GATA3 is a crucial transcription factor, and was initially identified as a DNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of immune cell functions. Different missense mutations in the region of the DNA-binding domain of GATA3 are associated with BC and other neoplastic disorders. In this study, computational based approaches have been exploited to reveal associations of various mutations on structure, stability, conformation and function of GATA3. Our findings have suggested that, all analysed missense mutations were deleterious and highly pathogenic in nature. A molecular dynamics simulation study showed that all mutations led to structural destabilisation by reducing protein globularity and flexibility, by altering secondary structural configuration and decreasing protein ligand stability. Essential dynamics analysis indicated that mutations in GATA3 decreased protein mobility and increased its conformational instability. Furthermore, residue network analysis showed that the mutations affected the signal transduction of important residues that potentially influenced GATA3-DNA binding. The present study highlights the importance of different variants of GATA3 which have potential impact on neoplastic progression in breast cancer and may facilitate development of precise and personalized therapeutics.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of dopamine chemicals resulting in urinary incontinence, gastrointestinal dysfunction, gait impairment and mitochondrial dysfunction. Study investigated urinary metabolic profiles of patients with idiopathic PD as compared to healthy controls (HC) to identify the potential biomarkers.
   Methods: Urine samples were collected from 100 PD subjects and 50 HC using standard protocol. Metabolomic analyses were performed using high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The integral values of 17 significant metabolites were estimated and concentration values were calculated, which were subjected to univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.
   Results: We found significantly increased levels of ornithine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, tyrosine and succinate in the urine of patients with PD in comparison with HC. These metabolites exhibited area under the curve greater than 0.60 on ROC curve analysis. We also observed a significant association between succinate concentration and UPDRS motor scores of PD.
   Discussion Metabolic pathway alterations were observed in aromatic amino acid metabolism, ketone bodies synthesis, branched chain amino acid metabolism and ornithine metabolism. Comprehensive metabolomic profiling revealed variations in urinary signatures associated with severity of idiopathic PD. This profiling relies on non-invasive sampling and is complementary to existing clinical modalities.

AB  - Performance of endoscopic procedures is associated with a risk of infection from COVID-19. This risk can be reduced by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, shortage of PPE has emerged as an important issue in managing the pandemic in both traditionally high and low-resource areas. A group of clinicians and researchers from thirteen countries representing low, middle, and high-income areas has developed recommendations for optimal utilization of PPE before, during, and after gastrointestinal endoscopy with particular reference to low-resource situations. We determined that there is limited flexibility with regard to the utilization of PPE between ideal and low-resource settings. Some compromises are possible, especially with regard to PPE use, during endoscopic procedures. We have, therefore, also stressed the need to prevent transmission of COVID-19 by measures other than PPE and to conserve PPE by reduction of patient volume, limiting procedures to urgent or emergent, and reducing the number of staff and trainees involved in procedures. This guidance aims to optimize utilization of PPE and protection of health care providers.

AB  - Study Objective: To assess diagnostic value of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in endometrial aspirates (EAs) in comparison with conventional tests for diagnosis of female genital tuberculosis (TB) and to find agreement between EA PCR done for endometrial TB and laparoscopic findings of pelvic TB in women with unexplained infertility.
   Design: Prospective observational cohort study.
   Setting: Tertiary care hospital.
   Patients: A total of 732 infertile females screened and 385 enrolled to undergo procedure to obtain EAs.
   Interventions: EAs were tested by conventional tests (histopathology, acid-fast bacilli, Lowenstein-Jensen staining, liquid culture) and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Patients with positive conventional tests were started on antitubercular treatment (ATT). Patients with negative conventional tests underwent laparohysteroscopy irrespective of PCR results to assess changes of tubercular infection in the pelvis. Peritoneal washings were also sent for liquid culture and PCR for TB, and suspicious lesions were biopsied at laparohysteroscopy. Findings at laparoscopy upgraded the diagnosis in these women. EAPCR results were analyzed to find agreement with the findings at laparoscopy.
   Measurements and Main Results: Conventional tests were positive in 8 of 385 (2%) patients. PCR was positive in 58.1% (n = 224) of endometrial samples, with sensitivity of 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.49-91.48), specificity of 41.91% (95% CI, 36.88-47.07), positive predictive value of 2.23% (95% CI, 1.31-3.78), negative predictive value of 98.14% (95% CI, 95.53-99.24), and a diagnostic accuracy of 42.34% (95% CI, 37.35-47.45) with conventional tests. A total of 265 patients underwent laparoscopy, of whom 165 were PCR positive and 100 were PCR negative. Laparoscopic findings suggestive of TB were found in 39.3% of patients who were PCR positive and 9% of patients who were PCR negative. Kappa agreement was 0.25, suggesting fair agreement between PCR and laparoscopy.
   Conclusion: PCR as a stand-alone diagnostic test for endometrial TB is not justified to confirm diagnosis and initiate ATT. The addition of laparohysteroscopy improves diagnostic yield for genital TB. Referring patients with a suspicion of female genital TB to tertiary care for 1-time laparoscopy is better than initiating ATT solely on the basis of PCR results. (c) 2020 AAGL. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to assess the prevalence of sleep abnormalities in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and characterize their polysomnographic profile and to further compare it with well-controlled epilepsy (WCE) and age-matched typically developing children (TDC).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study consisting of 40 children in each group (DRE, WCE, and TDC) was conducted. Children's sleep habits questionnaire (CSHQ) and modified pediatric Epworth daytime sleepiness scale (MPEDSS) were administered to all three groups. Thirty-five children each in the DRE and WCE group and 17 TDC underwent single night polysomnography (PSG).
   Results: The prevalence of sleep abnormalities by the administration of CSHQ in DRE group was 72.5% (95% C.I-58.7 to 86.3%, mean score: 47.5 7.1) compared to 32.5% (42.4 +/- 6.2) and 15% (37.3 +/- 5) in WCE and TDC groups respectively (P = 0.01). On MPEDSS, 52.5% of children in the DRE group had excessive daytime sleepiness compared to 12.5% in WCE and 5% in TDC groups respectively (p-0.03). On overnight PSG, sleep efficiency and REM sleep duration were significantly reduced in the DRE group in comparison to WCE and TDC. N2 duration, REM latency, arousal, and apnea-hypopnea index were significantly increased in the DRE group when compared to WCE and TDC groups.
   Conclusion: Sleep-related problems are major comorbidity in up to three-fourths of patients with DRE and sleep architecture is significantly affected particularly in the DRE group.

AB  - In low-risk febrile neutropenia (FN) patients, outpatient management is now an accepted treatment, but there is a scarcity of data on high-risk patients. The aim of our study was to describe the outcome of FN treated primarily in an outpatient setting on the basis of the severity of illness at presentation, irrespective of the intensity of chemotherapy, and absolute neutrophil count. In this prospective study, not severely ill (NSI) patients were treated with empiric antibiotics at the daycare center (outpatient) and were admitted subsequently if there was persistent fever or any complication arose. Severely ill (SI) children were admitted to the hospital upfront. A total of 118 FN episodes among children with cancer on chemotherapy 18 years of age and younger were studied. Among NSI patients managed as outpatients (n=103), 89 patients (86%) recovered with outpatient treatment, and 14 patients required hospitalization after the median duration of 5 days (interquartile range: 4 to 6 d) of antibiotic therapy. The main indication for hospital admission in the SI group was hypotension (n=5), and in the NSI group, it was persistent fever (n=11). Overall, 5% of patients (6/118) died, and 2 of these were in the NSI group. The results of this study suggest that carefully selected NSI patients could be successfully treated at outpatient management in resource-poor settings and subsequent admission if warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the possibility of modulating retinal glucose transporters in diabetic conditions to prevent retinal complications of diabetic retinopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In silico and in vitro binding assays were performed to assess the effect of genistein and positive controls (pioglitazone and estradiol) on nuclear receptor estrogen receptor beta and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). In vivo effects of compounds were tested on diabetic rats. Structural and functional analysis of retina was performed at 28th day followed by gene expression analysis of glucose transporters and nuclear receptors. Pioglitazone and genistein levels were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Genistein showed equi-affinity toward PPAR gamma in in silico experiments contrary to in vitro findings. In multidose study, their therapeutic effects were observed by analyzing the retinal function. Retinal gene expression studies revealed that both test agents significantly up regulated PPAR gamma, GLUT4, and down regulated GLUT1. Genistein showed significant up regulation of GLUT4 and down regulation of GLUT1 as compared to PGZ which has been well correlated with the Electroretinography (ERG) outcome. CONCLUSION: This study showed the possibility of selective upregulation of GLUT4 (independent of PPAR gamma activation) in the retina of diabetic rats using genistein. Selective modulation of retinal glucose transporters as therapeutic target in ocular diabetic complications can be possibly explored.

AB  - Objective: Febrile neutropenia though a dreaded complication of chemotherapy, not all patients need inpatient treatment. Risk score indices like MASCC and CISNE have been developed to identify low risk patients eligible for outpatient management. We undertook this study to compare the performances of MASCC and CISNE.
   Methods: This was a prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care centre from August 2017 to April 2019 where patients with chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia were included. Basic demographic data and primary site of cancer were collected with characteristics required to calculate both MASCC and CISNE scores. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Apart from the 3 group risk stratification of CISNE, apriori it was decided that two-tier CISNE score will be calculated with 0 or 1 score as low risk and >= 2 as high risk. Descriptive statistics are reported and predictive performance of each score was analysed.
   Results: Total of 129 patients were recruited. The performance of three-tier CISNE score was more specific (90.6%, 95% CI 76.9-96.9) but sensitivity (25.1%, 95% CI 17.0-36.3) was low compared to that of MASCC score (sensitivity 58.1%, 95% CI 47.0-68.5; specificity 65.1, 95% CI 49.0-78.5%). However, analysis with two-tier CISNE score demonstrated a better sensitivity (56.9%, 95%CI 45.8-67.4). Kappa for agreement between the two scores was 0.520 (95% CI 0.373-0.667, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: CISNE and MASCC have fair discriminatory power in identifying low risk febrile neutropenia cases. Two group stratification on CISNE scoring will help in better decision making in emergency department. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which greatly affects patients' quality of life. Despite an exponential increase in PD cases, not much attention has been paid to enhancing their quality of life (QoL). Thus, this systematic review aims to summarize the available literature for the role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) intervention to improve QoL of PD patients. Methods: Literature review was carried out using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus databases. The key search words were, "rTMS AND Parkinson AND QoL","rTAIS AND Parkinson AND Quality of Life". Cochrane Collaboration software Revman 5.3 was used to assess the quality of studies. Results: Over 707 studies were identified out of which 5 studies were included which consisted of 160 subjects, 89 male and 71 female, with mean age of 65.04 years. PD type varied from idiopathic PD, rigid, akinetic, tremor dominant to mixed type. The overall risk of bias across the studies was low and unclear with high risk of bias in incomplete outcome data domain in one study. Conclusions: The efficacy of rTMS as an adjunct intervention to enhance QoL of PD patients is uncertain due to dire lack of research in this area. The findings of the present review would help researchers conduct a well-defined; randomized, controlled trial by overcoming the present limitations associated with rTMS intervention to improve QoL of PD patients.

AB  - The choice of neuromodulation techniques has greatly increased over the past two decades. While vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has become established, newer variations of VNS have been introduced. Following the SANTE's trial, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now approved for clinical use. In addition, responsive neurostimulation (RNS) has provided exciting new opportunities for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. While neuromodulation mostly offers only a 'palliative' measure, it still provides a significant reduction of frequency and intensity of epilepsy. We provide an overview of all the techniques of neuromodulation which are available, along with long-term outcomes. Further research is required to delineate the exact mechanism of action, the indications and the stimulation parameters to extract the maximum clinical benefit from these techniques.

AB  - Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most conunon cause of dementia worldwide in the older population. There is no disease-modifying therapy available for AD. The current standard of care drug therapy for AD is cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil. Bacopa monnieri or brahmi is used in traditional Indian medicine for memory loss. We conducted a phase 2b randomized controlled trial (RCT) to find out the efficacy of brahmi and donepezil in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Patients and Methods: The study was planned as a 52 week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase-2 single-center clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Bacopa monnieri (brahmi) 300 mg OD and donepezil 10 mg OD for 12 months in 48 patients with AD and MCI-AD including cognitive and quality of life outcomes. The primary outcome was differences in the change from baseline of the neuropsychological tests [Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and postgraduate institute (PGI) memory scale] at 12 months between the intervention group (brahmi) and active comparison group (donepezil). Results: The study was terminated after 3 years and 9 months, after recruiting 34 patients, because of slow recruitment and a high dropout rate. Intention to treat analysis after adjusting for baseline confounders showed no difference in the rate of change in ADAS-Cog score from baseline at any time point, including the last follow-up. There was no difference in the rate of change in PGI Memory scale (PGIMS) at 3, 6, and 9 months. In the last follow-up, there was a significant difference in the change in total PGIMS score between brahmi and donepezil, while there was no difference in individual scores of the PGI memory scale. Conclusion: This phase-2 RCT on the efficacy of brahmi vs. donepezil showed no significant difference between them after 1 year of treatment. Larger phase-3 trials, preferably multicentric, are required to find the superiority of brahmi over donepezil.

AB  - Objective
   Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a rare, potentially aggressive tumour, with relatively worse prognosis than well-differentiated thyroid cancer. We evaluated the long-term outcomes and prognosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma patients at a single institution in India and compared outcomes based on results of RET protooncogene mutation analysis.
   Methods
   Data were retrieved through a prospectively maintained thyroid cancer database from 1998 to June 2019, and medullary thyroid carcinoma patients were recruited. RET gene mutation status (exon 10-16) was assessed. Patient with a minimum follow-up of 12 months was eligible to be part of the long-term outcome analysis.
   Results
   Out of 149 peripheral blood samples, 42 were positive for RET gene mutation (prevalence of 28.1%). The median follow-up duration was 48 months, ranging from 12 to 240 months. Long-term clinical outcomes of 113 patients were assessed. Two deaths were noted in this series. Both 5- and 10-year survival was cent per cent. Overall survival was 98.2% (97.3% in RET positive and 98.7% in RET negative group). Progression-free survival was 55.4% in total (60% in RET positive and 53.3% in RET negative group). No statistically significant difference was found between RET positive and RET negative groups concerning overall survival (P = 0.6011) and progression-free survival (P = 0.5140). Univariate analysis revealed high calcitonin (>10 pg/mL), stage IV disease, and presence of lymph nodal metastasis to be significant predictors of disease recurrence, however, multivariate analysis demonstrated the presence of lymph node metastases as the only significant predictor of recurrence (P = 0.0005).
   Conclusions
   Medullary thyroid carcinoma patients had relatively favourable long-term outcomes. Long-term survival was similar irrespective of RET mutation status. Presence of lymph node metastases appeared to be the strongest predictor of overall and progression-free survival, followed by Calcitonin level and stage of the disease.

TI  - Sample size calculation with simple math for clinical researchers
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Clinicians often need a quick and rough idea of the sample size to assess the feasibility of their clinical research question, but developing countries often lack access to online calculators or its language. I describe a formula that clinicians, residents or any health researcher can remember and use to calculate sample size with mental arithmetic or with the use of a simple pocket calculator. This article covers controlled clinical trials. The formula for two equal-sized groups is simple: n = (16p [100-p])/d2 per group for dichotomous outcomes, where p is average of the two proportions with events, and d is the difference between the two proportions. For continuous scale outcomes, the formula is n=16s2/d2 per group where s is the standard deviation of the outcome data and d is the difference to be detected. The formula needs to be modified for unequal-sized groups. This simple formula may be helpful to clinicians, residents and clinical researchers to calculate sample size for their research questions. The feasibility of many research questions can be easily checked with the calculated sample size.

AB  - Neuromodulation therapies, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and pump therapies, are currently the standard of care for PD patients with advanced disease and motor complications that are difficult to control with medical management alone. The quest for alternate lesser invasive approaches led to the development of several novel therapies like intrajejunal levodopa infusions (IJLI), continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions (CSAI) and Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) in recent years. To achieve good outcomes with any of these therapeutic modalities, careful patient selection, multidisciplinary evaluation and technical expertise are equally important. In this review, we will provide an overview of the neuromodulation strategies currently available for PD, emphasizing on patient selection and choosing among the various strategies.

AB  - Purpose
   Both bone-scan and cross-sectional imaging are indicated in the staging of high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET/computed tomography (CT) has proven to be an excellent tracer for detection of skeletal metastases. The aim of this study was to assess if adding skeletal imaging (with 18F-Fluoride-PET/CT) to 68-Ga-PSMA-PET/CT had any impact on high-risk PCa staging.
   Method
   Fifty treatment-naive, histopathologically proven, high-risk (European Association of Urology) PCa patients underwent both 68-Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and 18F-Fluoride-PET/CT for staging.
   Results
   Fluoride-PET/CT detected significantly a higher number of skeletal metastases/patient than PSMA-PET/CT (median 4.5/patient vs 3.0; Wilcoxan-signed-rank-test, P = 0.060) and there was a significantly higher proportion of only Fluoride-avid than only PSMA-avid lesions (McNemar-test P < 0.001). No significant advantage was seen in patient-wise metrics. Most lesions missed by PSMA-PET/CT were in flat bones (25/33). serum prostate specific antigen (S.PSA) showed positive correlation with both, the number of lesions [r(PSMA)-0.555 (P = 0.006) and r(Fluoride)-0.622 (P = 0.001)] as well as tumor to background ratio (TBR) [[r-0.706 (P < 0.001) and 0.516 (P = 0.010)]. Median TBR was significantly higher in PSMA-PET/CT (22.77 vs 16.30; P < 0.001). All three patients with only Fluoride-avid lesions (also not identified in bone-scan) showed biochemical response with additional therapy.
   Conclusion
   Though, Fluoride-PET/CT detected a higher absolute number of lesions than PSMA-PET/CT, no significant advantage was seen in patient-wise metrics. Fluoride-PET/CT added second-line management in only 3/50 patients, which could have been reduced to 1/50, with more sensitive evaluation of flat bones in PSMA-PET-CT. Therefore, additional skeletal imaging is not needed with 68-Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in initial staging of high-risk PCa.

AB  - The various lesions seen in the clinical presentation of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) are reflected in the histopathology of the type of lesion biopsied. The cells that form the dermal infiltrate include lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells in varying proportions. The infiltrate, which is mild and confined to the superficial dermis in macular lesion becomes denser with the increasing severity of the lesion. Leishman-Donovan bodies (LDB) in general are rarely demonstrable in macules and somewhat infrequently in the rest, though at times they may be numerous; mucosal lesions offer a greater chance of visualizing LDB than biopsies from the skin. A characteristic histomorphology in nodules is prominent follicular plugging with a dense plasma cell-rich lymphohistiocytic dermal infiltrate that shows an abrupt cut-off in the lower dermis, an appearance highly suggestive of PKDL even in the absence of LDB. Russell bodies within plasma cells, vascular changes, and xanthoma-like hue have been seen in plaques from chronic PKDL. The histopathologic picture in some may also mimic that seen in tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy, and other granulomatous dermatoses. In contrast to Indian PKDL, epithelioid cell granulomas with giant cells are more common in African PKDL, and vascular changes are rare though neuritis showing LDB has been described.

AB  - High-risk hospital-associated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterococcus faecalis clonal complexes (CCs) such as CC2 and CC87 are enriched with virulence determinants that help to accumulate, colonize, and cause serious nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to establish the epidemiology and clonal composition of 134 clinical E. faecalis isolates and to link molecular typing data with antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants. All isolates were identified by conventional methods and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (16srRNA gene and ddl genes of E. faecalis/ E. faecium) in 5-years. Disc diffusion test was performed on all strains. We screened all E. faecalis for aac(6')-aph(2 ''), vanA, and vanB resistance genes, and aggregation substance-asa1, cytolysin-cylA, collagen-binding protein-ace, enterococcal surface protein-esp, gelatinase-gelE, and hyaluronidase-hyl virulence genes by PCR. Representative isolates of E. faecalis were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Out of 539 patients with enterococcal infections, 134 (24.9%) had E. faecalis infections, 366 (67.9%) had E. faecium infections, and 39 (7.2%) had infections due to other enterococcal species. Of the 134 isolates, 79.1% and 61.9% isolates were high-level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) and MDR. In multivariate analysis, independent predictor for infection due to MDR E. faecalis strains was a surgical intervention (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.17-4.96, P = 0.017). Overall, the observed rate of in-hospital mortality was 11.9%. The gelE, asa1, ace, cylA, esp and hyl genes were detected in 87.3%, 78.4%, 54.5%, 53.7%, 36.6% and 3.0%, respectively in E. faecalis isolates. The asaI, cylA, and gelE genes were significantly correlated with MDR E. faecalis. The PFGE analysis showed 28 clones with four major clones. MLST analysis revealed two sequence types-ST28 (CC87) and ST181 (CC2). This is the first Indian report on the emergence of the high-risk hospital-associated worldwide-disseminated ST28 (CC87) and ST181 (CC2), which have enriched with multiple virulence determinants and resistance to antibiotics, paticularly ampicillin. This report indicates serious health concern and calls for on-going surveillance, close monitoring, and improved infection control procedures to stop further spread of these isolates.

AB  - Objectives To study the profile of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) among outborn and inborn babies at a tertiary-care centre. Methodology In a prospective observational study from 2015-2016, outborn and inborn babies eligible for ROP screening were evaluated for ROP profile and treatment results. Results 532 outborns and 38 inborns had ROP. Respiratory distress, sepsis and apnea were present in 81.3%, 51.5% and 36.2% of outborns with ROP and 68.4%, 39.4% and 36.8% of inborns with ROP. Type 1 ROP was noted in 49.2% eyes of outborns with ROP and 36.8% eyes of inborns with ROP. Type 1 ROP regressed with laser in 97.3% and 100% eyes of outborn and inborn with ROP, respectively. Stage 4, 5 and sequelae were noted in 5.2%, 22.8% and 4.6% eyes of outborns with ROP, respectively, but none in inborns. Conclusions Quality neonatal care and timely screening ensured lesser ROP-related morbidity in inborns as compared to outborns.

AB  - In the wake of the pandemic COVID-19 and nationwide lockdowns gripping many countries globally, the national healthcare systems are either overwhelmed or preparing to combat this pandemic. Despite all the containment measures in place, experts opine that this novel coronavirus is here to stay as a pandemic or an endemic. Hence, it is apt to be prepared for the confrontation and its aftermath. From protecting the vulnerable individuals to providing quality care for all health conditions and maintaining essential drug supplies, it is going to be a grueling voyage. Preparedness to sustain optimal care for each health condition is a must. With a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease in infants, need of high-dose hormonal therapy with a concern of consequent severe disease, presence of comorbidities, and a need for frequent investigations and follow-up; children with West syndrome constitute a distinctive group with special concerns. In this viewpoint, we discuss the important issues and concerns related to the management of West syndrome during COVID-19 pandemic in the South Asian context and provide potential solutions to these concerns based on the current evidence, adeptness, and consensus. Some plausible solutions include the continuation of containment and mitigation measures for COVID-19, therapeutic decision- making for West syndrome based on risk stratification, and tele-epileptology.

AB  - Purpose: This study assessed adjuvant potential of Ocimum sanctum hydroalcoholic extract (OSHE) with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin (PHT) in maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model in male Wistar rats.
   Material and Methods: Pharmacodynamic effect of OSHE (1000 mg/kg) was assessed through seizure pro-tection potential, neurobehavioral tests and oxidative stress estimation in MES model after 14 days administration of OSHE alone or combination with maximal (M) and sub-maximal (SM) dose of CBZ or PHT. Pharmacokinetic interaction of OSHE with AEDs was also assessed after 14 days of drug treatment.
   Results: OSHE per se showed 50% protection against MES-induced seizures. Combination of OSHE with AEDs' SM dose enhanced its seizure protection potential. Significant reduction in duration of tonic hind limb extension was observed in CBZ-SM + OSHE as compared to control group (p = 0.006). Among neurobehavioral tests in Morris water maze test rats of CBZ-M + OSHE took significantly less time to reach the platform (p = 0.022) and spent more time in target quadrant (p = 0.016) as compared to other groups. Similarly, rats of PHT-SM + OSHE group spent significantly more time in the target quadrant (p = 0.013). In elevated plus maze test, CBZ-M + OSHE had significantly decreased transfer latency compared to other groups (p = 0.013). OSHE alone treated group had significantly lower oxidative stress as compared to other groups. No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between OSHE and AEDs (CBZ, PHT).
   Conclusion: Ocimum's potential of enhanced seizure protection and neuroprotection along with minimal drug interaction with AEDs substantiate its adjuvant role in the management of epilepsy. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving impairment of general cognitive abilities. This disorder impacts the conceptual, social, and practical skills adversely. There is a growing interest in exploring the neurological behavior associated with these disorders. Assessment of functional brain connectivity and graph theory measures have emerged as powerful tools to aid these research goals. The current research contributes by comparing brain connectivity patterns of IDD individuals to those typical controls. Considering the intellectual deficits linked to the IDD population, we hypothesized an atypical connectivity pattern in the IDD group. Brain signals were recorded by a dry-electrode Electroencephalography (EEG) system during the rest and music states observed by the subjects. We studied a group of seven IDD subjects and seven healthy controls to understand the connectivity within the human brain during the resting-state vis-a-vis while listening to music. Findings of this research emphasize (1) hyper-connected functional brain networks and increased modularity as potential characteristics of the IDD group, (2) the ability of soothing music to reduce the resting state hyper-connected pattern in the IDD group, and (3) the effect of soothing music in the lower frequency bands of the control group compared to the higher frequency bands of the IDD group.

AB  - Aim: NAFLD is a chronic and progressive disease for which there are no FDA-approved drugs available in the market. Drug discovery is a time-consuming procedure and requires screening of hundreds of small molecules to find new chemical entities (NECs) for a particular disease. Current preclinical NAFLD animal models take a longer time, which enhances the duration and expenses of the screening procedure. Hence to shorten the duration, we have proposed a preclinical animal model for rapid induction of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced stage of NAFLD in rats.
   Methodology: The animals were divided into three groups; control, high fat choline deficient (HFCD) and high fat choline deficient diet with sodium nitrite (40 mg/kg b.w. i.p. per day) (HFCD + NaNO2) respectively. Four weeks later physical and serum biochemical parameters were assessed, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed, and histopathology and gene expression were analysed.
   Key findings: Hypoxic stress aggravates the lipid accumulation, ballooning, lobular inflammation and fibrosis in hepatic tissue in presence of HFCD diet.
   Significance: This novel rodent model could be a useful NAFLD model to screen small molecules rapidly for treatment of NASH.

AB  - Aim of the scoping review: Scientific recommendations on resuscitation are typically formulated from the perspective of an ideal resource environment, with little consideration of applicability in lower-income countries. We aimed to determine clinical outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in low-resource countries, to identify shortcomings related to resuscitation in these areas and possible solutions, and to suggest future research priorities.
   Data sources: This scoping review was part of the continuous evidence evaluation process of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), and was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We identified low-resource countries as countries with a low-or middle gross national income per capita (World Bank data). We performed a literature search on outcomes after OHCA in these countries, and we extracted data on the outcome. We applied descriptive statistics and conducted a post-hoc correlation analysis of cohort size and ROSC rates.
   Results: We defined 24 eligible studies originating from middle-income countries, but none from low-income regions, suggesting a reporting bias. The number of reported patients in these studies ranged from 54 to 3214. Utstein-style reporting was rarely used. Return of spontaneous circulation varied from 0% to 62%. Fifteen studies reported on survival to hospital discharge (between 1.0 and 16.7 degrees 0) or favourable neurological outcome (between 1.0 and 9.3%). An inverse correlation was found for study cohort size and the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (11= 0.48, p = 0.034).
   Conclusion: Studies of OHCA outcomes in low-resource countries are heterogeneous and may be compromised by reporting bias. Minimum cardiopulmonary resuscitation standards for low-resource settings should be developed collaboratively involving local experts, respecting culture and context while balancing competing health priorities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Diagnosing brain tumor recurrence, especially with changes that occur after treatment, is a challenge. MRI has an exceptional structural resolution, which is important from the perspective of treatment planning. However, its reliability in diagnosing recurrence is relatively lower, when compared to metabolic imaging. The latter is more sensitive to the early changes associated with recurrence and relatively immune to confounding by treatment related changes.
   CONCLUSION. There is no one-stop shop for the diagnosis of recurrence in brain tumors. The sensitivity of metabolic imaging is not a substitute for the resolution of the MRI, making a multi-modal approach the only way forward.

AB  - Background Increase in incidence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) has been attributed in part to the availability of sensitive diagnostic modalities, such as(68)Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/CT. However, it suffers from problems such as obscurement of tracer-avid lesions by physiological gut activity and collapsed gut lumen. Contrast-enhanced CT and CT enterography (CTE) do not have these drawbacks. Purpose The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of contrast-enhanced CT + CTE and the(68)Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/noncontrast CT in GEP-NETs. Methods Fifty-six patients (mean age, 57.8 +/- 13.3 years [male:female, 1.95:1]), with histopathologically proven gastroenteropancreatic NETs, who had undergone both(68)Ga-DOTANOC-PET/NCCT (60 minutes, post-IV injection of 111-185 MBq) and contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) + CTE (using 1.5-2 L isotonic mannitol solution and 1-2 mg/kg of IV contrast), were retrospectively selected. Twenty-three patients had been referred for identification of primary lesions and 33 for staging/restaging. The scans were independently evaluated by 2 blinded physicians, who documented the number and site of lesions, with reporting confidence (3 = high confidence, 2 = equivocal confidence, 1 = low confidence). Reference standard was created using clinical, biochemical, and imaging parameters (ie, uptake and contrast enhancement), along with corroboration from previous or follow-up scans. Finally, PET images coregistered to the CECT + CTE were independently evaluated for any additional benefit. Results The numbers of primary lesions detected by CECT + CTE and PET/CT were 69 and 57, respectively. Lesion-wise sensitivities for patients with unknown primary in CECT + CTE and PET/CT were 57.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.0%-74.5%) and 71.4% (95% CI, 52.9%-84.7%), respectively. Corresponding numbers in patients who had come for staging/restaging were 73.2% (95% CI, 58.1%-84.3%) and 73.8% (95% CI, 58.9%-84.7%). Lesions missed in CECT + CTE were gastrointestinal (n = 14), lymph nodes (n = 25), mesenteric (n = 1), and pancreatic (n = 7), whereas corresponding numbers for PET/CT were 14, 5, 3, and 2. Contrast-enhanced CT + CTE showed more false-positives (n = 26) than PET/CT (n = 9). Lesions missed by CECT + CTE were smaller than detected lesions (median, 9.7 mm [interquartile range, 7.5-31.1] vs 17.7 mm [interquartile range, 12.2-30.0];P= 0.062), and lesions missed by PET had significantly lower tumor/background (liver) SUVmax ratio (median, 1.3 [interquartile range, 0.6-3.8] vs 4.7 [interquartile range, 2.7-10.8]). The ratio of true-positives to false-positives dropped markedly, when reporting confidence in CECT + CTE was low (4/15 [for rating 1 or 2] vs 93/11 [rating 3]). Corresponding numbers for PET/CT were (40/7 [for rating 1 or 2] vs 80/2 [rating 3]). Combination of these 2 modalities would have increased the lesion-wise sensitivities in patients with unknown primaries to 89.7% (95% CI, 73.6%-96.4%) and the confidence rating of soft tissue lesions to predominantly high (134 lesions rated 3, and 10 rated 1 or 2). Conclusions PET/CT is a sensitive modality for staging and restaging well-differentiated NETs. Use of CECT + CTE as a complementary modality in patients with uncertain uptake or high clinical suspicion of gastroenteropancreatic NETs should be considered, as it improves the lesion detection and reporting confidence.

TI  - Facility preparedness for an obstetric unit during the Covid-19 pandemic
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Covid-19 infection has placed health systems under unprecedented strain and foresight for preparedness is the key factor to avert disaster. Every facility that provides obstetric service needs a certain level of preparedness to be able to handle at least Covid-suspect pregnant women awaiting test reports, who need to be managed as Covid-positive patients till reports are available. Thus, these facilities need to have triage areas and Covid-suspect labour rooms. Healthcare facilities can have designated areas for Covid-positive patients or have referral linkages with designated Covid-positive hospitals. Preparation includes structural reorganization with setting up a Covid-suspect and Covid-positive facility in adequate space, as well as extensive training of staff about infection control practices and rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE). A systematic approach involving five essential steps of making standard operating procedures, infrastructural reorganization for a triage area and a Covid-suspect labour ward, procurement of PPE, managing the personnel and instituting appropriate infection control practices can ensure uninterrupted services to patients without compromising the safety of healthcare providers.

AB  - Many routine and elective services have already been postponed or suspended by both Government and private setups in most parts of the world because of the unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19. Healthcare systems everywhere in the world are under pressure. Being a component of essential health services, family planning and abortion services should continue to cater the population in order to prevent the complications arising from unintended pregnancies and sudden rise in STIs. Due to airborne nature of transmission of the virus, it is advisable for all consultations relating to family planning services to be done remotely unless and until visit is absolutely necessary.
   Contraception initiation and continuation can be done by telemedicine in most individuals. Post partum contraception can be advised before discharge from hospital. In an individual planning for pregnancy, currently it is not advisable to discontinue contraceptive and plan for pregnancy as not much is known about the effect of the virus on foetal development. Also, pregnancy requires routine antenatal and peripartum care and complications arising from pregnancy may necessitate frequent hospital visits, exposing the individual to the risk of infection. Abortion services are time sensitive therefore should not be denied or delayed beyond legal limit. We need to change from real to virtual consultation to prevent the rise in unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections and unsafe abortions.

AB  - Lamellar keratoplasty procedures have gained momentum in the field of corneal transplantation because of their inherent advantages over full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty. While penetrating keratoplasty is an open sky procedure fraught with sight-threatening intraoperative and postoperative complications, lamellar keratoplasties are relatively closed-system procedures that involve selective removal and replacement of diseased corneal layers and are free from these complications. Anterior lamellar procedures involve partial or lamellar replacement of anterior stroma and reduce the risk of graft rejection, retain structural integrity, and require less stringent donor criteria. Posterior lamellar procedures involve removal of the affected endothelium in eyes with relatively unaffected stroma. These procedures are associated with improved safety profile, accelerated wound healing, structurally stronger globe, and minimal astigmatism, thereby producing faster visual rehabilitation and timely initiation of amblyopia therapy in children. Although the use of lamellar grafts is increasing in adults, their relatively slower adoption in pediatric population is attributable to the steep learning curve and lack of long-term follow-up data. We describe the challenges associated with these procedures and their outcomes in pediatric eyes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emerged resistance in Typhoidal Salmonella has limited the treatment options for typhoid fever. In this scenario, there is a need to find alternate treatment modalities against this pathogen. Amongst the therapeutic agents currently being used to treat enteric fever, quinolones have enjoyed considerable success since past three decades. These drugs act upon DNA gyrase and the acquired resistance is due to mutations at Ser83 and Asp87 of gyrase A subunit. In the present study DNA gyrase enzyme was targeted to seek out potential new inhibitors which are not affected by these mutations. Molecular modelling and docking studies were performed in Schrodinger's molecular modelling software. Homology model of DNA gyrase-DNA complex was built using templates 1AB4 and 3LTN. Molecular dynamic simulations were performed in SPC solvent for 100 ns. Total 17,900,742 drug like molecules were downloaded from ZINC library of chemical compounds. The Glide XP score of the compounds ranged from -5.285 to -13.692. All the ligands bound at the four base pair staggered nick in the DNA binding groove of DNA gyrase enzyme with their aromatic rings intercalating between the bases of two successive nucleotides stabilized by pi-pi stacking interactions. The binding pocket of DNA gyrase B comprising conserved residues Lys 447, Gly 448, Lys 449, Ile 450, Leu 451, Gln 465 and Val 467 interacts with the ligand molecules through van der Waals interactions. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration), MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) and IC50 of the tested compounds ranged from 500 to 125 mg/L, 750 to 500 mg/L and 100 to 12.5 mg/L, respectively. The selected hits bind to quinolone binding pocket, but their mode of binding and conformation is different to fluoroquinolones, and hence, their binding is not affected by mutations at Ser83 or Asp87 positions. These lead compounds can be further explored as a scaffold to design inhibitors against DNA gyrase to bypass quinolone resistance.

AB  - In recent years, studies on mineralized tissues are becoming increasingly popular not only due to the diverse mechanophysical properties of such materials but also because of the growing need to understand the intricate mechanism involved in their assembly and formation. The biochemical mechanism that results in the formation of such hierarchical structures through a well-coordinated accumulation of inorganic and organic components is termed biomineralization. Some prime examples of such tissues in the human body are teeth and bones. Our current study is an attempt to dissect the compositional details of the inorganic and organic components in four major types of human teeth using mass spectrometry-based approaches. We quantified inorganic materials using inductively coupled plasma resonance mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Differential level of ten different elements, Iron (Fe), Cadmium (Cd), Potassium (K), Sulphur (S), Cobalt (Co), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Aluminum (Al), and Copper (Cu) were quantified across different teeth types. The qualitative and quantitative details of their respective proteomic milieu revealed compositional differences. We found 152 proteins in total tooth protein extract. Differential abundance of proteins in different teeth types were also noted. Further, we were able to find out some significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) backbone through the STRING database. Since this is the first study analyzing the differential details of inorganic and organic counterparts within teeth, this report will pave new directions to the compositional understanding and development of novel in-vitro repair strategies for such biological materials.

TI  - H2 blockers in the prevention of paclitaxel-related hypersensitivity reaction
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Dexamethasone and histaminic (H1 and H2) blockers are routinely used as pre-medication drugs for the paclitaxel-related hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). The inclusion of this strategy was more empirical than evidence-based following the initial experience with life-threatening HSR during phase 1 studies done in early 1981.(1) The inclusion was to reciprocate the prevention strategy similar to contrast-induced HSR.(2) People worldwide continued to use the same preventive measures over the past 40 years. Of the three components of a preventive strategy, the most argued one is the role of H2 receptor antagonists.(3) We congratulate Cox etal. for raising and successfully testing the research question. However, they selected a pre-post interventional study. A randomized study design is a preferred scheme to get a value close to the true one. In this study, steroids and clemastine (H1 blockers) were given with or without ranitidine (H2 blockers) during October 2018 to April 2019 and April to December 2019. The study design was an open-labelled, non-randomized, non-inferiority trial. The trial enrolled adult patients (18 years or above) who were to receive the first cycle of conventional paclitaxel (weekly or three-weekly, with or without partner drug) for a maximum of six cycles. The primary end-point was the incidence of grade 3 or more HSR. The sample size was 366 with a 6% non-inferiority margin, 90% power and a one-sided alpha error of 0.05. The common tumour type was oesophagus (42%), breast (32%), lung (9%) and gynaecological (14%). In both the arms, an equal proportion of patients received corticosteroids (9.8%) and antihistamines (4.95) for other associated comorbid conditions. In the two study arms with and without ranitidine, the rate of all grades HSR was (20% v. 12%), grade 3 or higher HSR (4.4% v. 1.6%) and grade 1-2 HSR (16% v. 10%).(4) The difference between the two arms was -2.7% (90% CI -6.2% to 0.1%). The present study concluded that ranitidine (H2 blocker) can be safely omitted from the standard paclitaxel pre-medication strategy.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute respiratory infection (RSV-ARI) constitutes a substantial disease burden in older adults aged >65 years. We aimed to identify all studies worldwide investigating the disease burden of RSV-ARI in this population. We estimated the community incidence, hospitalization rate, and in-hospital case-fatality ratio (hCFR) of RSV-ARI in older adults, stratified by industrialized and developing regions, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January 1996 and April 2018 and 8 unpublished population-based studies. We applied these rate estimates to population estimates for 2015 to calculate the global and regional burdens in older adults with RSV-ARI in the community and in hospitals for that year. We estimated the number of in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ARI by combining hCFR data with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based studies. In 2015, there were about 1.5 million episodes (95% confidence interval [CI],.3 million-6.9 million) of RSV-ARI in older adults in industrialized countries (data for developing countries were missing), and of these, approximately 14.5% (214 000 episodes; 95% CI, 100 000-459 000) were admitted to hospitals. The global number of hospital admissions for RSV-ARI in older adults was estimated at 336 000 hospitalizations (uncertainty range [UR], 186 000-614 000). We further estimated about 14 000 in-hospital deaths (UR, 5000-50 000) related to RSV-ARI globally. The hospital admission rate and hCFR were higher for those aged >65 years than for those aged 50-64 years. The disease burden of RSV-ARI among older adults is substantial, with limited data from developing countries. Appropriate prevention and management strategies are needed to reduce this burden.

AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated the evidence for associations between malnutrition and dental curies among children and adolescents in primary and permanent dentition. Methods: A search was conducted in Medline, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies comparing malnourishment and dental curies among children and adolescents. PRISMA guidelines were followed for the meta-analysis. Participants included well-nourished and malnourished children and adolescents ranging in age from six months to 19 years. The primary outcome was the prevalence of dental caries in primary and permanent dentition and early childhood curies (ECC) for children younger than six years. Quality was evaluated using the risk of bias assessment tool, Random-effects model was used to assess the odds ratio of the association between malnutrition and dental caries. Results: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 1,851 and 1,395 malnourished and well-nourished children available for analysis. Analysis of the longitudinal studies indicated that malnourished children were associated with a higher presence of caries (odds ratio equals 2.69, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] equals 2.05 to 3.53, P<0.001). Malnourished children were associated with a higher presence of dental caries in permanent dentition (odds ratio equals 3.56, 95 percent CI equals 2.21 to 5.74, P<0.001). Conclusion: Meta-analysis suggests that malnutrition is associated with dental caries in permanent dentition. However, no such association was observed between malnutrition with dental and ECC in the primary dentition.

   Methods: In this cross-sectional study (2017-2019), eligible pregnant women underwent a 75-g OGTT, followed by placement of a CGMS.
   Results: Women (n = 96, 58 with normoglycemia and 38 with GDM) were enrolled at 14.0 +/- 3. 2 weeks of gestation. Mean preprandial, 1-h and 2-h postprandial and peak glucose values were significantly higher in women with GDM. Peak glucose value was achieved 60.0 +/- 12.3 and 64.3 +/- 11.6 min after meal in the normoglycemia and GDM group, respectively. 24-h mean glucose (5.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/L), mean daytime glucose (6.0 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.5 +/- 0. 4 mmol/L) and mean nocturnal glucose (5.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.0 0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L) were significantly higher in women with GDM. Total time spent in range was significantly lower in the GDM group compared to the normoglycemia group (92.1 vs. 98.2%).
   Conclusions: This study highlights differences in glycemic patterns between women with normoglycemia and GDM in the context of a South Asian population where burden of GDM is high but good quality data in early pregnancy are limited. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective: Accurate segmentation of prostate and its zones constitute an essential preprocessing step for computer-aided diagnosis and detection system for prostate cancer (PCa) using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). However, low signal-to-noise ratio and high variability of prostate anatomic structures are challenging for its segmentation using DWI. We propose a semi-automated framework that segments the prostate gland and its zones simultaneously using DWI.
   Methods: In this paper, the Chan-Vese active contour model along with morphological opening operation was used for segmentation of prostate gland. Then segmentation of prostate zones into peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) was carried out using in-house developed probabilistic atlas with partial volume (PV) correction algorithm. The study cohort included MRI dataset of 18 patients (n = 18) as our dataset and methodology were also independently evaluated using 15 MRI scans (n = 15) of QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset. The atlas for zones of prostate gland was constructed using dataset of twelve patients of our patient cohort. Three-fold cross-validation was performed with 10 repetitions, thus total 30 instances of training and testing were performed on our dataset followed by independent testing on the QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard coefficient (JC), and accuracy were used for quantitative assessment of the segmentation results with respect to boundaries delineated manually by an expert radiologist. A paired t-test was performed to evaluate the improvement in zonal segmentation performance with the proposed PV correction algorithm.
   Results: For our dataset, the proposed segmentation methodology produced improved segmentation with DSC of 90.76 +/- 3.68%, JC of 83.00 +/- 5.78%, and accuracy of 99.42 +/- 0.36% for the prostate gland, DSC of 77.73 +/- 2.76%, JC of 64.46 +/- 3.43%, and accuracy of 82.47 +/- 2.22% for the PZ, and DSC of 86.05 +/- 1.50%, JC of 75.80 +/- 2.10%, and accuracy of 91.67 +/- 1.56% for the TZ. The segmentation performance for QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset was, DSC of 85.50 +/- 4.43%, JC of 75.00 +/- 6.34%, and accuracy of 81.52 +/- 5.55% for prostate gland, DSC of 74.40 +/- 1.79%, JC of 59.53 +/- 8.70%, and accuracy of 80.91 +/- 5.16% for PZ, and DSC of 85.80 +/- 5.55%, JC of 74.87 +/- 7.90%, and accuracy of 90.59 +/- 3.74% for TZ. With the implementation of the PV correction algorithm, statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements were observed in all the metrics (DSC, JC, and accuracy) for both prostate zones, PZ and TZ segmentation.
   Conclusions: The proposed segmentation methodology is stable, accurate, and easy to implement for segmentation of prostate gland and its zones (PZ and TZ). The atlas-based segmentation framework with PV correction algorithm can be incorporated into a computer-aided diagnostic system for PCa localization and treatment planning. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to devise a dual functionalized chitosan based hydrogel dressing to control haemorrhage/ bleeding. The haemostatic hydrogel was formulated by amalgamation of a definite ratio of quaternized chitosan and phosphorylated chitosan along with tannic acid which acted as adjuvant hemostat and a crosslinker. Additionally, the hydrogel contained poly-epsilon-lysine to impart the elastic and adhesive properties. The optimized hydrogel exhibited superior haemostatic activity (clotting time, 225 +/- 5 s), platelet activation (soluble P-selectin concentration 2098 +/- 150.19 ng mL(-1)), adhesion strength (almost 3 times higher in comparison to Axiostat), higher fluid absorption (approx. 14 times in 12 h) in addition to better mechanical properties, faster coagulation attributes (Prothrombin time, 12.6 s and activated partial thromboplastin time, 30.1 s) and lower proinflammatory potential (almost 3 times lower Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha levels and 45 times lower InterLeukin-6 levels at 48 h against control) over marketed chitosan based dressing (clotting time, 300 +/- 25 s). Cytotoxicity studies using L929 fibroblasts cells and in-vivo studies using Wistar rats confirmed that the optimized hydrogel was non-toxic, cytocompatible and biocompatible.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most commonly used surgical treatment for drug-refractory movement disorders such as tremor and dystonia. Appropriate patient selection along with target selection is important to ensure optimal outcome without complications. This review summarizes the recent literature regarding the mechanism of action, indications, outcome, and complications of DBS in tremor and dystonia. A comparison with other modalities of surgical interventions is discussed along with a note of the recent advances in technology. Future research needs to be directed to understand the underlying etiopathogenesis of the disease and the way in which DBS modulates the intracranial abnormal networks.

AB  - Introduction: Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are key driver alterations in lung adenocarcinomas (ADCAs). Exon 19 deletions (exon19del) and exon 21 L858R (L858R) mutations account for 70-90 % of all such alterations and predict sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the predictive value of uncommon and compound EGFR mutations for TKIs has not been clearly established.
   Objective: To assess the spectrum of EGFR mutations in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and to compare the treatment responses and outcomes among single common, single uncommon, and compound mutations.
   Method: The study was of combined retrospective (January 2010-December 2015) and prospective (January 2016-February 2020) design spanning 10 years. Tumor samples from TKI-naive NSCLC patients were tested for EGFR mutations by a qPCR-based method. Objective response rates (ORRs) and survival outcomes were analyzed.
   Result: In total, 1227 tumor samples were tested. EGFR mutations were detected in 391 samples (31.8 %), and included 79.5 % (311/391) single common (exon19del/L858R), 6.6 % (26/391) single uncommon (non-exon19del/L858R), and 13.8 % (54/391) compound mutations. Exon 20 T790M mutations were most prevalent among uncommon/compound mutations (40/391, 10.2 %). Overall, patients with single uncommon/compound mutations responded poorly to both EGFRTKI (47 % ORR) and chemotherapy (43 % ORR), with significantly shorter time to progression (median 7 months) compared to those with exon19del/L858R mutations (median 14.7 months). Patients with baseline T790M mutations (single/compound) were least responsive to EGFR TKIs (11 % ORR) and chemotherapy (27 % ORR) and showed the shortest progression-free survival compared to other uncommon and compound mutations.
   Conclusion: Approximately one fifth of EGFR-mutant patients harbor uncommon and compound mutations. Unlike those with exon19del/L858R, these patients-particularly those with baseline T790M mutations-show significantly inferior response rates to treatment (EGFR TKI or chemotherapy) and early disease progression.

AB  - This document aims to assist oncologists in making clinical decisions encountered while managing their patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), specific to Indian practice, based on consensus among experts. Most patients are staged by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system which comprises patient performance status, Child-Pugh status, number and size of nodules, portal vein invasion and metastasis. Patients should receive multidisciplinary care. Surgical resection and transplant forms the mainstay of curative treatment. Ablative techniques are used for small tumours (<3 cm) in patients who are not candidates for surgical resection (Child B and C). Patients with advanced (HCC should be assessed on an individual basis to determine whether targeted therapy, interventional radiology procedures or best supportive care should be provided. In advanced HCC, immunotherapy, newer targeted therapies and modern radiation therapy have shown promising results. Patients should be offered regular surveillance after completion of curative resection or treatment of advanced disease.

AB  - Purpose: To compare surface quality and endothelial cell viability of descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) donor lenticules prepared with femtosecond laser (FSL) or microkeratome (MK). Methods: Experimental ex-vivo evaluation of 15 DSAEK donor lenticules prepared from optical quality donor corneas using 200 KHz FSL (9 eyes) or MK (6 eyes). Surface quality and smoothness of the cut were assessed using atomic force microscopy and endothelial cell viability was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. Results: Mean lenticule thickness was 121.89 +/- 17.13 mu m in FSL group and 112.67 +/- 5.89 mu m in MK group (P = 0.33). Average roughness of stromal surface (RMSavg) [FSL- 30.51 +/- 4.55 nm, MK-22.37 +/- 1.83 nm; P = 0.02] and root mean square roughness (RMSrough) [FSL-31.39 +/- 5.75 nm, MK-23.08 +/- 0.40 nm; P = 0.012] was significantly more in FSL group. Increased granular and linear irregularities were observed in the FSL group. Endothelial cell disruption was more in FSL group (FSL- 29.49 +/- 6.91% MK-13.28 +/- 3.62%; P < 0.001) with decreased mean nucleus length (FSL-5.56 +/- 0.17 mu m, MK-7.52 +/- 0.65 mu m; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Automated MKs are still the standard of care for donor lenticule preparation and MK-assisted donor lenticules have smoother surface with less endothelial cell disruption than FSL. Further research is mandatory before FSL platforms can be considered a viable alternative to the MK.

AB  - Addictive disorders have become increasingly common in India. The health consequences of addictive disorders are immense, and the need for specialized addiction treatment and training far exceeds the capacity and human resources that currently exist. At the same time, increasing demand and treatment gap, need for specialized care, and the emerging sector of medical tourism in the country open avenues for superspecialty training in addiction psychiatry as an attractive career option for Indian psychiatrists. Human resource development and capacity building in the addiction psychiatry field in India is the need of the hour. In the present article, we describe the existing scenario and challenges related to addiction psychiatry training among postgraduate psychiatry trainees and psychiatrists in India and scope for the future.

AB  - In the present study, we have explored the prognostic value of the Phosphofructokinase Platelet-type (PFKP) expression and its therapeutic relevance in metastatic breast cancer. PFKP immunohistochemistry was performed on Invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs; n = 87) of breast, and its association with clinicopathological parameters were evaluated. Using online meta-analysis tools, PFKP's prognostic value was investigated in overall breast cancer as well as in triple negative subtype (TNBCs). For in vitro analysis, MDA-MB-231 cells model was used in order to elucidate mechanisms behind PFKP regulated glycolysis and its impact on cancer cell physiology. Therapeutic relevance of PFKP was further evaluated using PFKP siRNA and Quercetin. PFKP protein expression was found to be positively associated with nodal invasion (p = 0.009), receptor (ER & PR) negative status (p = 0.005 & p = 0.028) and reduced overall survival in breast cancer patients (p = 0.014). In MDA-MB-231 cells, quercetin treatment impaired PFKP-LDHA signaling axis thereby inhibiting aerobic glycolysis mediated increased migration of cancer cells. Our present study demonstrates that elevated PFKP levels are associated with basal cells/TNBC subtypes and might serve as prognostic indicator for TNBC patients. Ability of quercetin to inhibit aerobic glycolysis, cell migration and clonogenic potential of malignant breast cancer cells advocates possibility of quercetin in aggressive breast cancer treatment.

TI  - Case 283: Breast Filariasis
T2  - RADIOLOGY
AB  - History A 44-year-old woman who was a resident of Bihar, which is a state in eastern India, presented to the surgical outpatient department of our hospital with a history of gradually increasing swelling of the right breast associated with redness, pain, and itching over the past month. She reported a general sense of malaise and experienced episodes of chills over the past 6 months; however, she had no documented fever. There was no history of breast trauma. No history suggestive of a possible hypercoagulable state could be elicited (she was a nonsmoker, had undergone uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery 15 years earlier, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had no history to suggest past deep venous thrombosis). General physical examination findings were unremarkable. On local examination, she was found to have diffuse enlargement of the right breast. The skin over the lateral part of the breast was erythematous and showed the presence of prominent superficial veins. On palpation, few ill-defined firm mobile masses were found in the upper outer quadrant with overlying skin induration. No skin ulceration or nipple discharge was present. Few firm and discrete lymph nodes were palpable in the right axilla.
   Laboratory investigations showed mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 10 g/dL; normal range, 12-15 g/dL), a total leukocyte count of 14 000 cells per microliter (14 cells x 109/L) (normal range, 4500-11 000 cells per microliter [4.5-11 cells x 109/L]), a normal differential leukocyte count (74% neutrophils [normal range, 40%-80%], 24% lymphocytes [normal range, 20%-40%], and 2% eosinophils [normal range, 1%-4%]), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 31 mm per hour (normal range, 0-29 mm per hour). She underwent both mammography and US. Real-time US showed mobile structures on the series of US images obtained seconds apart. On the basis of the imaging findings, US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed to confirm the diagnosis, and appropriate treatment was instituted.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies are being increasingly recommended for initial or early management of patients with hypertension, as they reduce treatment complexity and potentially reduce therapeutic inertia.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of antihypertensive triple drug FDC therapy with therapeutic inertia and prescribing patterns compared with usual care.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A post hoc analysis of the Triple Pill vs Usual Care Management for Patients With Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) study, a randomized clinical trial of 700 patients with hypertension, was conducted. Patients were enrolled from 11 urban hospital clinics in Sri Lanka from February 2016 to May 2017; follow-up ended in October 2017. Data were analyzed from September to November 2019.
   INTERVENTIONS Once-daily FDC antihypertensive pill (telmisartan, 20mg; amlodipine, 2.5 mg; and chlorthalidone, 12.5mg) or usual care.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Therapeutic inertia, defined as not intensifying therapy in those with blood pressure (BP) above target, was assessed at baseline and during follow-up visits. Prescribing patterns were characterized by BP-lowering drug class and treatment regimen potency. Predictors of therapeutic inertia were assessed with binomial logistic regression.
   RESULTS Of the 700 included patients, 403 (57.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 56 (11) years. Among patients who did not reach the BP target, therapeutic inertia was more common in the triple pill group compared with the usual care group at the week 6 visit (92 of 106 [86.8%] vs 124 of 194 [63.9%]; P <.001) and week 12 visit (81 of 90 [90%] vs 116 of 179 [64.8%]; P <.001). At the end of the study, 221 of 318 patients in the triple pill group (69.5%) and 182 of 329 patients in the usual care group (55.3%) reached BP targets. Among those who received treatment intensification, the increase in estimated regimen potency was greater in the triple pill group compared with the usual care group at baseline (predicted mean [SD] increase in regimen potency: triple pill, 15 [6] mmHg; usual care, 10 [5] mmHg; P <.001), whereas there were no significant differences at the week 6 or at week 12 visit. Clinic systolic BP level was the only consistent predictor of treatment intensification during follow-up. During follow-up, there were 23 vs 54 unique treatment regimens per 100 treated patients in the triple pill vs usual care groups, respectively (P <.001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Triple pill FDC therapy was associated with greater rates of therapeutic inertia compared with usual care. Despite this, triple pill FDC therapy substantially simplified prescribing patterns and improved 6-month BP control rates compared with usual care. Further improvements in hypertension control could be achieved by addressing therapeutic inertia among the minority of patients who do not achieve BP control after initial FDC therapy.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the time to reversal of complete AV block (CAVB) in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with various modalities of treatment and to examine the factors associated with early reversal of CAVB.
   Methods: We prospectively assessed the STEMI patients complicated by CAVB. The mean time to reversal of CAVB was analyzed and compared according to the treatment received. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to find the predictors of mortality.
   Results: Of 3954 patients with STEMI, CAVB was present in 146(3.7%) patients. Inferior wall myocardial infarction (IWMI) was more commonly associated with CAVB than anterior wall myocardial infarction (AWMI) (74.7% vs 25.3%). The mean time to reversal of CAVB was 25.4 +/- 35.5 h. It was significantly lower with the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to thrombolysis (5.21 +/- 10.54 vs 12.98 +/- 17.14; p = 0.0001). Predictors of early reversal of CAVB were early presentation to hospital (<6 h) from symptom onset, presence of IWMI, any revascularization done, primary PCI performed in comparison to thrombolysis, and normal serum creatinine levels. The presence of older age, broader QRS complex, cardiogenic shock/heart failure, and elevated creatinine were independent predictors of mortality. The CAVB reverted in all the alive patients except one who required permanent pacemaker implantation.
   Conclusion: CAVB is uncommon in STEMI and it recovers in a vast majority of surviving patients. The time to reversal of CAVB in STEMI is lower with primary PCI compared to thrombolysis. Outcomes are poor without revascularization in such patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - Mortality
AB  - Objectives: To assess the impact of adding statin (atorvastatin) and/or aspirin on clinical deterioration in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who require hospitalisation. The safety of these drugs in COVID-19 patients will also be evaluated.
   Trial design: This is a single-centre, prospective, four-arm parallel design, open-label, randomized control trial.
   Participants: The study will be conducted at National Cancer Institute (NCI), Jhajjar, Haryana, which is a part of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and has been converted into a dedicated COVID-19 management centre since the outbreak of the pandemic. All RT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with age >= 40 years and < 75 years requiring hospital admission (patients with WHO clinical improvement ordinal score 3 to 5) will be included in the trial. Written informed consent will be taken for all recruited patients. Patients with a critical illness (WHO clinical improvement ordinal score > 5), documented significant liver disease/dysfunction (aspartate transaminase [AST] / alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 240), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase [CPK] > 5x normal), allergy or intolerance to statins or aspirin, prior statin or aspirin use within 30 days, history of active gastrointestinal bleeding in past three months, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100000/ dl), pregnancy, active breastfeeding, or inability to take oral or nasogastric medications will be excluded. Patients refusing to give written consent and taking drugs that are known to have a significant drug interaction with statin or aspirin [including cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors, hepatitis C protease inhibitor, telaprevir, fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil), niacin, azole antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), clarithromycin and colchicine] will also be excluded from the trial.
   Intervention and comparator: In this study, the benefit and safety of atorvastatin (statin) and/or aspirin as adjuvant therapy will be compared with the control group receiving usual care for management of COVID-19. Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. The dose of aspirin will be 75 mg once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. All other therapies will be administered according to the institute's COVID-19 treatment protocol and the treating physician's clinical judgment.
   Main outcomes: All study participants will be prospectively followed up for ten days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer for outcomes. The primary outcome will be clinical deterioration characterized by progression to WHO clinical improvement ordinal score >= 6 (i.e., endotracheal intubation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, pressor agents, renal replacement therapy, ECMO requirement, and mortality). The secondary outcomes will be change in serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6), Troponin I, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) from time zero to 5th day of study enrolment or 7th day after symptom onset, whichever is later. Other clinical outcomes that will be assessed include progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), shock, ICU admission, length of ICU admission, length of hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality. Adverse drug effects like myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding will also be examined in the trial to assess the safety of the interventions.
   Randomisation: The study will use a four-arm parallel-group design. A computer-generated permuted block randomization with mixed block size will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to group A (atorvastatin with conventional therapy), group B (aspirin with conventional therapy), group C (aspirin + atorvastatin with conventional therapy), and group D (control; only conventional therapy).
   Blinding (masking): The study will be an open-label trial.
   Numbers to be randomised (sample size): As there is no existing study that has evaluated the role of aspirin and atorvastatin in COVID-19 patients, formal sample size calculation has not been done. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited during six months of study period. Once the first 200 patients are included in each arm (i.e., total 800 patients), the final sample size calculation will be done on the basis of the interim analysis of the collected data. Trial Status: The institutional ethical committee has approved the study protocol (Protocol version 3.0 [June 2020]).
   Participant recruitment starting date: 28th July 2020
   Participant recruitment ending date: 27th January 2021
   Trial duration: 6 months
   Trial registration: The trial has been prospectively registered in Clinical Trial Registry - India (ICMR- NIMS): Reference no. CTRI/2020/07/026791 (registered on 25 July 2020)].
   Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest of expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.

AB  - Background [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ZOL has shown promising results from the dosimetry and preclinical aspects, but data on its role in the clinical efficacy are limited. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ZOL as a bone pain palliation agent in patients experiencing pain due to skeletal metastases from various cancers. Methods In total, 40 patients experiencing bone pain due to skeletal metastases were enrolled in this study. The patients were treated with a mean cumulative dose of 2.1 +/- 0.6 GBq (1.3-2.7 GBq) [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ZOL in a median follow-up duration of 10 months (IQR 8-14 months). The primary outcome endpoint was response assessment according to the visual analogue score (VAS). Secondary endpoints included analgesic score (AS), global pain assessment score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Assessment performance status (ECOG), Karnofsky performance status, overall survival, and safety assessment by the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria V5.0. Results In total, 40 patients (15 males and 25 females) with a mean age of 46.6 +/- 15.08 years (range 24-78 years) were treated with either 1 (N = 15) or 2 (N = 25) cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ZOL. According to the VAS response assessment criteria, complete, partial, and minimal responses were observed in 11 (27.5%), 20 (50%), and 5 patients (12.5%), respectively with an overall response rate of 90%. Global pain assessment criteria revealed complete, partial, minimal, and no response in 2 (5%), 25 (62.5%), 9 (22.5%), and 4 (10%) patients, respectively. Twenty-eight patients died and the estimated median overall survival was 13 months (95% CI 10-14 months). A significant improvement was observed in the VAS, AS, and ECOG status when compared to baseline. None of the patients experienced grade III/IV haematological, kidney, or hepatotoxicity due to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ZOL therapy. Conclusion [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ZOL shows promising results and is an effective radiopharmaceutical in the treatment of bone pain due to skeletal metastases from various cancers.

AB  - BackgroundEarly diagnosis is crucial for effective medical management of cancer patients. Tissue biopsy has been widely used for cancer diagnosis, but its invasive nature limits its application, especially when repeated biopsies are needed. Over the past few years, genomic explorations have led to the discovery of various blood-based biomarkers. Tumor Educated Platelets (TEPs) have, of late, generated considerable interest due to their ability to infer tumor existence and subtype accurately. So far, a majority of the studies involving TEPs have offered marker-panels consisting of several hundreds of genes. Profiling large numbers of genes incur a significant cost, impeding its diagnostic adoption. As such, it is important to construct minimalistic molecular signatures comprising a small number of genes.ResultsTo address the aforesaid challenges, we analyzed publicly available TEP expression profiles and identified a panel of 11 platelet-genes that reliably discriminates between cancer and healthy samples. To validate its efficacy, we chose non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most prevalent type of lung malignancy. When applied to platelet-gene expression data from a published study, our machine learning model could accurately discriminate between non-metastatic NSCLC cases and healthy samples. We further experimentally validated the panel on an in-house cohort of metastatic NSCLC patients and healthy controls via real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) (AUC = 0.97). Model performance was boosted significantly after artificial data-augmentation using the EigenSample method (AUC = 0.99). Lastly, we demonstrated the cancer-specificity of the proposed gene-panel by benchmarking it on platelet transcriptomes from patients with Myocardial Infarction (MI).ConclusionWe demonstrated an end-to-end bioinformatic plus experimental workflow for identifying a minimal set of TEP associated marker-genes that are predictive of the existence of cancers. We also discussed a strategy for boosting the predictive model performance by artificial augmentation of gene expression data.

AB  - In cor triatriatum sinister, the left atrium is divided by a membrane into a proximal and a distal chamber. Usually proximal chamber receives all the pulmonary veins and drains through an opening in the dividing membrane into distal chamber, which empties into left ventricle through the mitral valve. Rarely, the two chambers lack a communication and there is associated total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). We report a 1-month-old infant with cyanosis and heart failure, who had cor triatriatum sinister associated with supracardiac TAPVC. The case is reported for rarity of the association with a focus on contrast echocardiographic imaging.

AB  - Classical Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway is the mainstay of cellular response to DNA double strand breaks. While aberrant expression of genes involved in this pathway has been linked with genomic instability and drug resistance in several cancers, limited information is available about its clinical significance in colon cancer. We performed a comprehensive analysis of seven essential genes, including XRCC5, XRCC6, PRKDC, LIG4, XRCC4, NHEJ1, and PAXX of this pathway, in colon cancer using multi-omics datasets, and studied their associations with molecular and clinicopathological features, including age, gender, stage, KRAS mutation, BRAF mutation, microsatellite instability status and promoter DNA methylation in TCGA colon cancer dataset. This analysis revealed upregulation of XRCC5, PRKDC, and PAXX in colon cancer compared to normal colon tissues, while LIG4 and NHEJ1 (XLF) displayed downregulation. The expression of these genes was independent of age and KRAS status, while XRCC5, PRKDC, and LIG4 exhibited reduced expression in BRAF mutant tumors. Interestingly, we observed a strong association between XRCC6, XRCC5, PRKDC and LIG4 overexpression and microsatellite instability status of the tumors. In multivariate analysis, high PAXX expression emerged as an independent prognostic marker for poor overall and disease specific survival. We also observed hypomethylation of PAXX promoter in tumors, which exhibited a strong correlation with its overexpression. Furthermore, PAXX overexpression was also associated with several oncogenic pathways as well as a reduction in numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

AB  - Background: Hemophilia A is an X chromosome-linked bleeding disorder caused by the deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). The majority of the Indian population with hemophilia A use plasma-derived clotting factors and, in some instances, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. Safer and more efficient treatment options are needed for this group of patients.
   Objectives: To assess the safety of turoctocog alfa, a third-generation recombinant FVIII molecule, for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in previously treated Indian patients with moderate or severe hemophilia A.
   Patients/Methods: This single-country, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized trial enrolled 60 patients who received prophylactic treatment with turoctocog alfa for 8 weeks, which corresponded to a minimum of 20 exposure days. Confirmed development of FVIII inhibitors during the 8-week treatment period was evaluated. Other assessments included frequencies of adverse drug reactions (ARs), serious adverse reactions, drug-related allergic reactions, and infusion reactions during the 12-week period after the first treatment; hemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa for the treatment of bleeding episodes; and total annualized dose of turoctocog alfa administered during the 8-week treatment period.
   Results: No incidence of FVIII inhibitors was detected. No safety concerns such as ARs, serious ARs, or drug-related allergic reactions were noted. The hemostatic success rate for the treatment of bleeding episodes with turoctocog alfa was 81.6%.
   Conclusions: The trial results demonstrated that turoctocog alfa is a safe treatment option for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in previously treated adolescent and adult patients with hemophilia A in the Indian population.

KW  - HOST
AB  - The 2019-Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a global impact. The effect of environmental temperature on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19 and protective efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination towards COVID-19 remains ambiguous. Therefore, we explored the global impact of environmental temperature and neonatal BCG vaccination coverage on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19. The COVID-19 data for reported cases, deaths and global temperature were collected from 31(st)December 2020 to 3(rd)April 2020 for 67 countries. Temperature data were split into quartiles for all three categories (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and mean temperature). The impact of three types of temperature data and policy of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infection was determined by applying the multivariable two-level negative binomial regression analysis keeping daily new cases and daily mortality as outcome. The highest number of cases fell in the temperature categories as following:mean temperature in the second quartile(6 degrees C to 10.5 degrees C), median 26, interquartile range (IQR) 237;minimum temperature in the first quartile(-26 degrees C to 1 degrees C), median 23, IQR 173;maximum temperature in the second quartile (10 degrees C to 16 degrees C), median 27.5, IQR 219.For the minimum temperature category, 28% statistically significant lower incidence was noted for new cases from the countries falling in the second quartile (2 degrees C to 6 degrees C) compared with countries falling in the first quartile (-26 degrees C to 1 degrees C) (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.93). However, no statistically significant difference in incidence rate was observed for mean temperature categories in comparison to the first quartile. Countries with BCG vaccination policy had 58% less mortality as compared with countries without BCG coverage (IRR 0.42; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.95). Our exploratory study provides evidence that high temperature might not be associated with low transmissibility and countries having neonatal BCG vaccination policy had a low fatality rate of COVID-19.

AB  - Objective To determine the impact of roster reorganization on ensuring uninterrupted services while providing necessary relief to healthcare workers (HCW) in the obstetrics department of a tertiary care center amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods The COVID-19 rostering response began in April 2020 and evolved in two phases: (1) development of new areas for screening and managing suspected/positive cases of COVID-19; and (2) team segregation according to area of work. The impact of these changes on HCWs and patients was assessed 3 months later. Results Developing separate areas helped to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and HCWs to those with COVID-19. Residents and consultants worked intensively in clinical areas for 1 week followed by 1-2 weeks of non-clinical or standby assignments, providing adequate opportunity for isolation. Frequent re-evaluation of the roster was nevertheless required as the pandemic progressed. Segregating teams vertically significantly reduced the number of contacts identified on contact tracing and quarantine leaves, while maintaining patient satisfaction with no increase in adverse events. Residents found the roster to be "smart" and "pandemic-appropriate." Conclusion The "COVID emergency roster" helped ensure quality care with minimum risk of exposure and sufficient breaks for physical and psychological recovery of HCWs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. The etiology of AD is not known, and intense research involving multimodal neuroimaging data (e.g., MRI, functional MRI, PET etc.) is extensively used to identify the causal molecular process for AD. In this context, various imaging-based databases accessible to researchers globally, are useful for an independent analysis. Apart from MRI-based brain imaging data, the neurochemical data using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provide early molecular processes before the structural or functional changes are manifested. The existing imaging-based databases in AD lack the integration of MRS modality and, thus, limits the availability of neurochemical information to the AD research community. This perspective is an initiative to bring attention to the development of the neuroimaging database, "ANSH," that includes brain glutathione (GSH), gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and other neurochemicals along with MRI-based information for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy subjects. ANSH is supported by a JAVA-based workflow environment and python providing a simple, dynamic, and distributed platform with data security. The platform consists of two-tiered architecture for data collection and management further supporting quality control, report generation for analyzed data, and data backup with a dedicated storage system. The ANSH database aims to present a single neuroimaging data platform incorporating diverse data types from healthy control and patient groups to provide better insights pertaining to disease progression. This data management platform provides flexible data sharing across users with continuous project monitoring. The development of ANSH platform will facilitate collaborative research and multi-site data sharing across the globe.

AB  - Background India is the second most populated country in the world with 41% of the population (492 million) under 18 years of age. While numerous studies have shown an increasing prevalence of myopia worldwide, there continues to be uncertainty about the magnitude of myopia in Indian school going population. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We systematically identified published literature of last four decades from 1980 to March 2020 and assessed them for methodological quality. Data were gathered into 5-year age groups from 5-15, in urban or rural populations, and standardized to definition of myopia as refractive error >= -0.50 dioptre. Random effects meta-analysis was done. Results We included data from 59 quality assessed studies, covering nearly 1,66,000 urban and 1,20,000 rural children. The overall crude prevalence of myopia over last four decades is 7.5% (95% CI, 6.5-8.5%) in 5-15-year age group. The prevalence of myopia is 8.5% (95% CI, 7.1-9.9%) in urban and 6.1% (95% CI, 4.5-7.7%) in rural children, with highest prevalence in urban 11-15-year age group [15.0% in last decade]. A significant increment in prevalence is noted in the last decade in rural children from 4.6% to 6.8%, reflecting changing rural environment. Conclusion Myopia is an emerging public health problem in both urban and rural school going adolescents in India requiring urgent efforts.

AB  - We aim to discuss comprehensively the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) biology and their clinical utility as cancer biomarkers. We searched the scientific literature to select articles related to the role of lncRNAs and circRNAs in SCLC biology or as cancer biomarkers. We identified that a number of lncRNAs and circRNAs can regulate key biological processes involved in SCLC development, including cell proliferation, metastasis and chemoresistance mainly acting as miRNA sponges. Also, the expression of a few lncRNAs and circRNAs predicted survival outcome depicting their utility as prognostic biomarkers. Further investigations on the role of lncRNAs and circRNAs in SCLC tumors may yield novel therapeutic targets for SCLC.

A1  - Global Burden Dis 2019
TI  - Five insights from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019
T2  - LANCET
KW  - CLINICAL-TRIALS
AB  - The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a rules-based synthesis of the available evidence on levels and trends in health outcomes, a diverse set of risk factors, and health system responses. GBD 2019 covered 204 countries and territories, as well as first administrative level disaggregations for 22 countries, from 1990 to 2019. Because GBD is highly standardised and comprehensive, spanning both fatal and non-fatal outcomes, and uses a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of hierarchical disease and injury causes, the study provides a powerful basis for detailed and broad insights on global health trends and emerging challenges. GBD 2019 incorporates data from 281 586 sources and provides more than 3.5 billion estimates of health outcome and health system measures of interest for global, national, and subnational policy dialogue. All GBD estimates are publicly available and adhere to the Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Health Estimate Reporting. From this vast amount of information, five key insights that are important for health, social, and economic development strategies have been distilled. These insights are subject to the many limitations outlined in each of the component GBD capstone papers.

AB  - Background In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.
   Methods GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.
   Findings Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990-2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0-9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10-24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10-24 years were also in the top ten in the 25-49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50-74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.
   Interpretation As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

AB  - Background Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) involves all people receiving the health services they need, of high quality, without experiencing financial hardship. Making progress towards UHC is a policy priority for both countries and global institutions, as highlighted by the agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13). Measuring effective coverage at the health-system level is important for understanding whether health services are aligned with countries' health profiles and are of sufficient quality to produce health gains for populations of all ages.
   Methods Based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we assessed UHC effective coverage for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Drawing from a measurement framework developed through WHO's GPW13 consultation, we mapped 23 effective coverage indicators to a matrix representing health service types (eg, promotion, prevention, and treatment) and five population-age groups spanning from reproductive and newborn to older adults (>= 65 years). Effective coverage indicators were based on intervention coverage or outcome-based measures such as mortality-to-incidence ratios to approximate access to quality care; outcome-based measures were transformed to values on a scale of 0-100 based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of location-year values. We constructed the UHC effective coverage index by weighting each effective coverage indicator relative to its associated potential health gains, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years for each location-year and population-age group. For three tests of validity (content, known-groups, and convergent), UHC effective coverage index performance was generally better than that of other UHC service coverage indices from WHO (ie, the current metric for SDG indicator 3.8.1 on UHC service coverage), the World Bank, and GBD 2017. We quantified frontiers of UHC effective coverage performance on the basis of pooled health spending per capita, representing UHC effective coverage index levels achieved in 2019 relative to country-level government health spending, prepaid private expenditures, and development assistance for health. To assess current trajectories towards the GPW13 UHC billion target-1 billion more people benefiting from UHC by 2023-we estimated additional population equivalents with UHC effective coverage from 2018 to 2023.
   Findings Globally, performance on the UHC effective coverage index improved from 45.8 (95% uncertainty interval 44.2-47.5) in 1990 to 60.3 (58.7-61.9) in 2019, yet country-level UHC effective coverage in 2019 still spanned from 95 or higher in Japan and Iceland to lower than 25 in Somalia and the Central African Republic. Since 2010, sub-Saharan Africa showed accelerated gains on the UHC effective coverage index (at an average increase of 2.6% [1.9-3.3] per year up to 2019); by contrast, most other GBD super-regions had slowed rates of progress in 2010-2019 relative to 1990-2010. Many countries showed lagging performance on effective coverage indicators for non-communicable diseases relative to those for communicable diseases and maternal and child health, despite non-communicable diseases accounting for a greater proportion of potential health gains in 2019, suggesting that many health systems are not keeping pace with the rising non-communicable disease burden and associated population health needs. In 2019, the UHC effective coverage index was associated with pooled health spending per capita (r=0.79), although countries across the development spectrum had much lower UHC effective coverage than is potentially achievable relative to their health spending. Under maximum efficiency of translating health spending into UHC effective coverage performance, countries would need to reach $1398 pooled health spending per capita (US$ adjusted for purchasing power parity) in order to achieve 80 on the UHC effective coverage index. From 2018 to 2023, an estimated 388.9 million (358.6-421.3) more population equivalents would have UHC effective coverage, falling well short of the GPW13 target of 1 billion more people benefiting from UHC during this time. Current projections point to an estimated 3.1 billion (3.0-3.2) population equivalents still lacking UHC effective coverage in 2023, with nearly a third (968.1 million [903.5-1040.3]) residing in south Asia.
   Interpretation The present study demonstrates the utility of measuring effective coverage and its role in supporting improved health outcomes for all people-the ultimate goal of UHC and its achievement. Global ambitions to accelerate progress on UHC service coverage are increasingly unlikely unless concerted action on non-communicable diseases occurs and countries can better translate health spending into improved performance. Focusing on effective coverage and accounting for the world's evolving health needs lays the groundwork for better understanding how close-or how far-all populations are in benefiting from UHC.

AB  - Background Rigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease.
   Methods GBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories. GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated. This method has six analytical steps. (1) We included 560 risk-outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies. 12 risk-outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk-outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence. (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression. (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods. (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year. (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors. Across all six analytical steps, 30 652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis. Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden. Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks. Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden.
   Findings The largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure. Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure. The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 9.51-12.1) deaths (19.2% [16.9-21.3] of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8.71 million (8.12-9.31) deaths (15.4% [14.6-16.2] of all deaths in 2019). The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253-350) DALYs (11.6% [10.3-13.1] of all global DALYs that year). The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations. Among children aged 0-9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition. Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10-24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25-49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50-74 years and 75 years and older.
   Interpretation Overall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor. Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.

AB  - Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is reported as the second most common nosocomial infection among critically ill patients with the incidence ranging from 2 to 16 episodes per 1000 ventilator days. The use of probiotics has been shown to have a promising effect in many RCTs. Our systematic review and meta-analysis were thus planned to determine the effect of probiotic use in critically ill ventilated adult patients on the incidence of VAP, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, the incidence of diarrhea, and the incidence of oropharyngeal colonization and in-hospital mortality. Methodology Systematic search of various databases (such as Embase, Cochrane, and Pubmed), published journals, clinical trials, and abstracts of the various major conferences were made to obtain the RCTs which compare probiotics with placebo for VAP prevention. The results were expressed as risk ratios or mean differences. Data synthesis was done using statistical software - Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020). Results Nine studies met our inclusion criterion and were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of VAP (risk ratio: 0.70, CI 0.56, 0.88;P= 0.002;I-2= 37%), duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference -3.75, CI -6.93, -0.58;P0.02;I-2= 96%), length of ICU stay (mean difference -4.20, CI -6.73, -1.66;P= 0.001;I-2= 84%) and in-hospital mortality (OR 0.73, CI 0.54, 0.98;P= 0.04;I-2= 0%) in the probiotic group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Probiotic administration was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of hospital stay (MD -1.94, CI -7.17, 3.28;P= 0.47;I-2= 88%), incidence of oro-pharyngeal colonization (OR 0.59, CI 0.33, 1.04;P= 0.07;I-2= 69%), and incidence of diarrhea (OR 0.59, CI 0.34, 1.03;P= 0.06;I-2= 38%). Discussion Our meta-analysis shows that probiotic administration has a promising role in lowering the incidence of VAP, the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and in-hospital mortality.

AB  - Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is being increasingly recognized as a cause of new-onset movement disorders. Movement disorders in AE are diverse and range from hyperkinetic conditions such as oromandibular dyskinesias, tremors and chorea to hypokinetic ones such as bradykinesia and parkinsonism. Stereotypies have been described in association with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Similarly, sleep dysfunction is an underrecognized feature in many AE subtypes, prominently anti-IgLON5 although the correlation of phenotype of sleep dysfunction with a particular antibody subtype in AE is unclear. Despite the recognition of both these features as part of an overreaching spectrum in any patient with AE, seldom are they the sole presenting manifestations. Additionally, the challenge is further compounded in a patient who has seronegative AE since neither sleep disturbances nor stereotypies have been well characterized with this condition yet, and the diagnosis is conditional to exhausting a list of ancillary supportive features. In this brief communication, we describe the case of a young man who presented with hypersomnolence and an unusual focal nose-pinching stereotypy of subacute onset who lacked the presence of other typical clinical characteristics such as cognitive/memory impairment and seizures and had negative autoimmune antibodies but responded to immune therapy dramatically. We propose that the presence of de novo hypersomnolence and stereotypy should inform a potential diagnosis of AE.

AB  - Ovarian immature teratoma (IT) is uncommon after the first two decades of life. Management is largely surgical, and recurrences are rare. Ovarian IT has the potential to convert into mature disease at the time of recurrence. The current case report describes a 47-year-old female patient who developed two recurrences within three years. The primary disease and first recurrence were managed surgically, whereas the second recurrence was managed surgically plus adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) regimen. Histopathology was immature teratoma grade 3 initially which progressed to immature teratoma grade 1 in last recurrence. Alpha-feto protein levels were never raised except two months after the last laparotomy when the patient was diagnosed to have hepatic metastases and succumbed to disease. Prognosis was grave in our patient. Advanced age may be a one contributing factor. Relapse of ovarian IT is uncommon and its optimal management remains debatable.

AB  - Background Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) contribute to 90% of injuries occurring in the world. The liver is one of the commonest organs injured in abdominal trauma. This study aims to highlight the demographic and management profile of liver injury patients, presenting to four urban Indian university hospitals in India. Methods This is a retrospective registry-based study. Data of patients with liver injury either isolated or concomitant with other injuries was used using the ICD-10 code S36.1 for liver injury. The severity of injury was graded based on the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) grading for liver injuries. Results A total of 368 liver injury patients were analysed. Eighty-nine percent were males, with road traffic injuries being the commonest mechanism. As per WSES liver injury grade, there were 127 (34.5%) grade I, 96 (26.1%) grade II, 70 (19.0%) grade III and 66 (17.9%) grade IV injuries. The overall mortality was 16.6%. Two hundred sixty-two patients (71.2%) were managed non-operatively (NOM), and 106 (38.8%) were operated. 90.1% of those managed non-operatively survived. Conclusion In this multicentre cohort of liver injury patients from urban university hospitals in India, the commonest profile of patient was a young male, with a blunt injury to the abdomen due to a road traffic accident. Success rate of non-operative management of liver injury is comparable to other countries.

AB  - Rationale The extent of diaphragmatic atrophy and dysfunction in critically ill children from developing countries is not established. Objectives To estimate changes in ultrasound measurements of diaphragmatic thickness over the first week of mechanical ventilation. To assess magnitude and risk factors of diaphragmatic atrophy. Methods In an observational cohort study, children aged 1-18 years, requiring mechanical ventilation were included. Ultrasound measurements of diaphragmatic thickness at end-expiration (DTe) and end-inspiration (DTi), and diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) were performed daily during the first week of admission, and pre- and post-extubation. Diaphragmatic atrophy (%) and atrophy rate (rate of decline in DTe, % per day) were calculated. Measurements and Main Results Of 55 children (74.6% boys) enrolled, 20 (36.4%) died. Of 35 children with planned extubation, 5 (14.3%) required reintubation. Baseline median (interquartile range [IQR]) DTe, DTi, and DTF were 1.27 mm (1, 1.6), 1.76 mm (1.35, 2.10), and 33.75% (26.90, 44.60), respectively. There was a significant reduction in DTe over the first week of mechanical ventilation (p < .001), median (IQR) diaphragmatic atrophy and atrophy rate of 9.91% (5.26, 17.35) and 2.01% (1.08, 3.04) per day, respectively. Diaphragmatic atrophy rate was lower in pressure targeted ventilation (n = 44; 1.79% [1.03, 2.87]) than volume targeted ventilation (n = 11; 3.10% [1.31, 5.49]),p = .038. There was no difference in diaphragmatic parameters (atrophy rate, and peri-extubation DTe and DTF) in extubation success versus failure. Conclusions The diaphragm undergoes progressive atrophy during the first week of mechanical ventilation in critically ill children. Future studies should evaluate ventilation strategies to reduce the diaphragmatic atrophy.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory infection and commonly called as COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It widely transmitted through direct or indirect contact. Currently, no specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 are available; only prevention and supportive strategy are the preventive measures. The present review emphasizes the latest research related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the current status of potential inhibitors identified. Recent interest in SARS-CoV-2 has focused on transmission, symptoms, structure, and its structural proteins that exhibit promising therapeutics targets for rapid identification of potential inhibitors. The quick identification of potential inhibitors and immune-boosting functional food ingredients are crucial to combat this pandemic disease. We also tried to give an overview of the functional food components as a nutritional supplement, which helps in boosting our immune system and could be useful in preventing the COVID-19 and/or to improve the outcome during therapy.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), the intracellular pathogen causing tuberculosis, has developed mechanisms that endow infectivity and allow it to modulate host immune response for its survival. Genomic and proteomic analyses of non-pathogenic and pathogenic mycobacteria showed presence of genes and proteins that are specific to M. tb. In silico studies predicted that M.tb Rv1954A is a hypothetical secretory protein that exhibits intrinsically disordered regions and possess B cell/T cell epitopes. Treatment of macrophages with Rv1954A led to TLR4-mediated activation with concomitant increase in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-12 and TNF-alpha. In vitro studies showed that rRv1954A protein or Rv1954A knock-in M. smegmatis (Ms_Rv1954A) activates macrophages by enhancing the expression of CD80 and CD86. An upregulation in the expression of CD40 and MHC I/II was noted in the presence of Rv1954A, pointing to its role in enhancing the association of APCs with T cells and in the modulation of antigen presentation, respectively. Ms_Rv1954A showed increased infectivity, induction of ROS and RNS, and apoptosis in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Rv1954A imparted protection against oxidative and nitrosative stress, thereby enhancing the survival of Ms_Rv1954A inside macrophages. Mice immunized with Ms_Rv1954A showed that splenomegaly and primed splenocytes restimulated with Rv1954A elicited a Th1 response. Infection of Ms_Rv1954A in mice through intratracheal instillation leads to enhanced infiltration of lymphocytes in the lungs without formation of granuloma. While Rv1954A is immunogenic, it did not cause adverse pathology. Purified Rv1954A or Rv1954A knock-in M. smegmatis (Ms_Rv1954A) elicited a nearly two-fold higher titer of IgG response in mice, and PTB patients possess a higher IgG titer against Rv1954A, also pointing to its utility as a diagnostic marker for TB. The observed modulation of innate and adaptive immunity renders Rv1954A a vital protein in the pathophysiology of this pathogen.

AB  - Docetaxel (DTX), an FDA approved chemotherapeutic agent, is used as a first-line treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Its poor aqueous solubility, rapid metabolism, short half-life, and effective targeting to the cancer cells limits its optimal therapeutic use. Herein, we report folate targeted amphiphilic lipopolymer grafted with cholesterol conjugated carbonate and DL-lactide prepared by microwave assisted ring opening polymerization, for the efficient actively targeted delivery of DTX. The DTX-loaded folate-targeted lipopolymeric nanoparticles (F-DTX-LPNs) prepared by the emulsion solvent evaporation method exhibited a smaller size of similar to 115.17 nm with a PDI of 0.205 and encapsulation efficiency of >80%. Further, these lipopolymeric nanoparticles (F-DTX-LPNs) showed a good on-bench stability and sustained DTX release for 7 days. Cell-based assays in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed a significant enhancement in the intracellular uptake of folate-targeted lipopolymeric nanoparticles compared to non-targeted nanoparticles. Further, methyl beta-cyclodextrin (M beta-CD) completely inhibited the uptake of these nanoparticles in the cells, indicating a lipid raft-mediated uptake mechanism. The developed F-DTX-LPNs showed improved cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and significant fold-change in expression levels of Bcl-2, BAX and Ki-67 as compared to non-targeted DTX-LPNs and free DTX. Further, F-DTX-LPNs showed an improvedin vivopharmacokinetic profile inSprague Dawleyrats as compared to the free DTX. The bio-imaging ofex vivotissues demonstrated that the DiR loaded folate targeted LPNs exhibited intense signals after 24 h because of slow release of DiR dye from the nanoparticles.

AB  - Smooth muscle dysfunction in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has been rarely studied. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smooth muscle dysfunction (vascular, upper gastrointestinal, and bladder smooth muscle) in children with DMD using questionnaires (Pediatric Bleeding Questionnaire, Pediatric Gastroesophageal Symptom Questionnaire, and Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score). Investigations included bleeding time estimation, nuclear scintigraphy for gastroesophageal reflux, and uroflowmetry for urodynamic abnormalities. Ninety-nine subjects were included in the study. The prevalence of vascular, upper gastrointestinal, and bladder smooth muscle dysfunction was 27.2%. Mean bleeding time was prolonged by 117.5 seconds. The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux was 21%. Voided volume/estimated bladder capacity over 15% and abnormal flow curves on uroflowmetry were seen in 18.2% and 9.7% of the subjects, respectively. Our study highlights the need for addressing issues related to smooth muscle dysfunction in the routine clinical care of patients with DMD.

AB  - Background
   Despite the well-known short-term and long-term ill effects of elevated blood pressure in children and adolescents, pooled data on its burden among Indian adolescents have not yet been synthesized.
   Objectives
   We did a systematic review with meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence of hypertension among adolescents (10-19 years) in India.
   Methods
   We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Google Scholar and IndMed, and included cross-sectional studies reporting data on hypertension prevalence among 10 to19 years old and published in English language from their inception till 1(st) March 2020. Modified New castle Ottawa scale was used to assess risk of bias based on research design, recruitment strategy, response rate and reliability of outcome determination. A random effects model was used to estimate pooled prevalence, and heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane's Q statistic test of heterogeneity andI(2)statistic. To explore the heterogeneity, we did a meta-regression, and sub-group analyses based on region, study setting and number of blood pressure readings.
   Results
   Out of 25 studies (pooled sample of 27,682 participants) six studies were of high, eighteen of moderate, and one was of low quality. The prevalence of hypertension across studies ranged from 2% to 20.5%, with a pooled estimate of 7.6% (95% CI: 6.1 to 9.1%), I-2 = 96.6% (p-value < 0.001). Sub-group analysis restricted only to the western India demonstrated a smaller heterogeneity (I-2 = 18.3%). In univariate model of meta-regression, diagnostic criteria was significantly associated with pooled prevalence (-4.33, 95%CI: -7.532, -1.134)
   Conclusion
   The pooled prevalence of hypertension among adolescent in India is 7.6% with substantial heterogeneity between the studies. To tackle the high prevalence of hypertension among adolescents, early detection by screening under school health programme and opportunistic screening at Paediatric OPD should be implemented by Policy makers.

AB  - The current study was carried out on dominant fish Oreochromis niloticus and water collected from the polluted Yamuna River, Agra, India. The heavy metals in water, recorded as follows: Fe>Mn>Zn>Cu>Ni>Cr>Cd and all were found to be above the prescribed limits. According to metal pollution index, exposed muscle (49.86), kidney (47.68) and liver (45.26) have been recorded to have higher bioaccumulation. The blood biochemical analysis of exposed O. niloticus indicated significant increase in activities of aspartate aminotransferase (+343.5%), alkaline phosphatase (+673.6%), alanine aminotransferase (+309.1%), and creatinine (+494.3%) over the reference. However, a significant decrease in albumin (A): globulins (G) ratio (-87.86%) was observed. Similarly, the exposed fish also showed significant increase in total leucocyte count (+121%), differential leucocyte count, respiratory burst (+1175%), and nitric oxide synthase (+420%). The histological examination of liver and kidney showed tissue injury. Moreover, micronuclei (0.95%), kidney shaped nuclei (1.2%), and lobed nuclei (0.6%) along with DNA damage in the form of mean tail length in the liver (20.7 mu m) and kidney (16.5 mu m) was observed in the exposed O. niloticus. Potential health risk assessments based on estimated daily intake, target hazard quotient, hazard index, and target cancer risk indicated health risks associated with the consumption of these contaminated fishes. In conclusion, the present study showed that exposure to heavy metals contaminated water can alter immunological response; induce histopathological alterations and DNA damage in the studied fish. The consumption of this contaminated water or fish could have serious impact on human health.

AB  - In contemporary societies, computer use by children is a necessity and thus highly prevalent. Using computers for long hours is related to a higher risk of computer-related muscular disorders like forward head posture (FHP) and neck pain (NP). Deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscles are important head-on-neck posture stabilizers; thus, their training may lead to an improvement in FHP and NP. The aim of this study was to determine if 4 weeks of DCF training is effective in alleviating NP, improving FHP, and functional status in adolescent children using computers regularly, a pretest-posttest experimental group design was used. Subjects were randomly assigned into the experimental group (receiving DCF training and postural education) and the control group (receiving postural education only). 30 subjects with a mean age of15.7 +/- 1.725years with NP and FHP using computers regularly participated in the study. Dependent variables were measured on day 1 (at baseline) and after 4 weeks of training. Photographic analysis was used for measuring FHP, visual analog scale for NP intensity, and neck disability index for functional status. Data analysis showed that in both groups, no significant improvement occurred in FHP. In both groups, there was a significant improvement in functional status and NP. There was no significant difference between both groups for FHP and NP. There was a significant improvement in functional status in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. Four weeks of DCF training does not cause a significant improvement in FHP in 13 to 18 years old adolescent children using computers regularly.

Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of QSNYL and TC in the treatment of melasma in Fitzpatrick skin types IV and V. Methods In this split face randomized controlled trial, participants' cheeks were randomized to receive either weekly QSNYL (group A) or daily TC (group B) for 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of follow-up. Results Twenty-eight patients completed the intervention, and 21 of them completed follow-up. We found a significant but modest reduction in mean melanin index, modified Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI), and photographic and patient's assessment in both modalities (P < 0.01). No significant differences were detected between the groups. All patients had reappearance of pigmentation by the end of follow-up. Adverse reactions were significantly more in group B (P < 0.001). Limitation The desired sample size could not be achieved. Conclusion and Relevence No statistically significant differences were observed between QSNYL and TC as monotherapy in melasma. Reappearance of melasma is inevitable after stopping treatment.

AB  - Objectives To assess the effects of different types of cataract surgeries and intraocular lenses on generic as well as vision related quality of life of cataract patients, using EQ-5D and IND-VFQ 33 instruments respectively. Methods An observational, longitudinal study of patients undergoing cataract surgery was carried out at three ophthalmology centres. Patients were prospectively admitted for surgery for age-related cataract. Generic quality of life was assessed by using Euroqol's EQ5D-5L questionnaire and vision related quality of life was assessed by the IND-VFQ-33 questionnaire. Data pertaining to vision function and quality of life were collected pre surgery and 4 weeks after the surgery. Results Out of total patients (n = 814) recruited for the study, 517 patients were interviewed for both pre-surgery and post-surgery for EQ5D and 519 patients were interviewed for both pre-surgery and post-surgery for IND VFQ 33 tool. The combined data from all three centres showed that Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains observed in patients undergoing phacoemulsification with foldable lens implantation (2.25 QALY) were significantly higher (0.57 QALY) as compared to Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) with PMMA lens implantation (1.68 QALY). Highest improvement however, in all three subscales of IND-VFQ-33 tool were clearly observed for SICS with PMMA lens implantation. Conclusions The study has elicited the Health related and vision related Quality of Life scores for cataract surgeries and subsequent lens implantation. This study also offers Health State Utility Values along with visual outcomes for different surgical procedures, lenses and for the combination of surgery with lens implantation for cataract procedures providing a useful resource for future economic evaluation studies.

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to describe the clinical and demographic profile of patients who required vitreoretinal surgeries during the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in India. It also reports our operating protocols and initial experience while performing vitreoretinal surgeries during COVID-19 times at a government tertiary eye care hospital. Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional observational study of patients requiring emergent/urgent vitreoretinal surgeries between March 25, 2020 and May 31, 2020. A modified working protocol focussing on the enforcement of standard COVID-19 precautions, OT sterilization, and formation of dedicated infection control and disease surveillance committee was adopted. Patients underwent standard vitreoretinal procedures under general/local anesthesia. Relevant demographic and clinical data were recorded and analyzed. Surveillance data of healthcare workers (HCW) was also analyzed. Results: Eighty six patients were considered for vitreoretinal surgery in this period. Finally, 83 patients underwent surgery. The mean age of the patients was 38.4 +/- 20.1 years (Range, 1 month- 75 years). Majority of them were males (66%) and adults (82.6%). Majority of them came from nearby hotspot areas. Most common indications were acute retinal detachment (38.5%) and diabetic vitrectomies (22.9%). Trauma-related cases (14.4%) were less. Surgery was deferred in 3 patients who turned out to be COVID-19 positive. 4 HCWs were quarantined but none of them developed COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: During COVID-19 lockdown, vitreoretinal surgeries were most commonly performed for retinal detachment and diabetic complications. Proper implementation of infection control protocols helps in delivering adequate patient care while ensuring the safety of caregivers during this pandemic.

AB  - Posterior capsule plaques (PCPs) are a rare cause of suboptimal vision after eventless cataract surgery. While these can be managed with posterior capsulotomy, violation of the posterior capsular integrity and associated vitreous disturbances may lead to sight-threatening complications. Viscoseparation and peeling of PCPs with the aid of retinal end-grasping forceps and irrigation and aspiration have also been described in adults for getting rid of PCPs with minimal disturbance of PC and vitreous. While Sinskey hook (SH) has been used to peel PCPs in children, the combined use of SH with viscoseparation for removal of PCP, particularly for adults, remains vaguely described in the literature. Presently, we describe a method of SH and viscoelastic assisted PCP extraction (SVAPE) in adult eyes with centrally located PCPs.

AB  - Modification of Polylactic acid (PLA), a biopolymer, is a strategy still to be fully explored for the next generation of bioresorbable vascular stent (BVS) biomaterials. With this focus, inclusions upto 5% of Polycapmlactone (PCL) and Magnesium in PLA were tested in the rat subcutaneous model and their cellular and tissue interactions characterized, specifically with respect to inflammatory response, angiogenesis and capsularization. The cytokines IL6, TNF Alpha and IL-1Beta were estimated in the pen-implant tissue, all of which showed a nonsignificant difference between the non-implanted animals and those containing PLA by 8 weeks, speaking to the benign nature of PLA as an implant biomaterial. Both modified materials, had increased macrophage counts and cytokine levels, except IL6 at 8 weeks. Vascularization only at 8 weeks in PLA PCL containing tissue was significantly higher than pure PLA, which may be more carefully controlled along with the material hydrophobicity for possible efforts towards therapeutic angiogenesis. Capsule thickness, measured by staining with both Hematoxylin & Eosin and Masson's Trichome did not show any differences between materials, including PLA.

AB  - Research question: Do endometrial stromal cells from primary infertile patients with severe ovarian endometriosis display differential secretory profiles of inflammation-associated cytokines during the implantation window that may cause infertility?
   Design: Forty-eight cytokines were measured in conditioned medium of isolated endometrial stromal cells obtained from primary infertile patients without endometriosis (control group, n = 12) or with stage IV ovarian endometriosis (ovarian endometriosis group, n = 14) using multiplex assays. Key cytokines showing differential secretory profiles were validated using Western immunoblotting. Cellular phenotypic validation was carried out in vitro by comparing proliferation and migration capacity between control (n = 6) and ovarian endometriosis (n = 7) groups.
   Results: CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL10, FGF2, IFNG, IL1RN, IL5, TNFA, and VEGF could be detected only in the conditioned media of stromal cells obtained from the ovarian endometriosis group. Among other cytokines detected in the conditioned media of both groups, CCL2 (P = 0.0018), CSF3 (P = 0.0017), IL1B (P = 0.0066), IL4 (P = 0.036), IL6 (P = 0.0039) and IL13 (P = 0.036) were found to be higher, whereas the concentration of IL18 was lower (P = 0.023) in the ovarian endometriosis group. Concentrations of CCL2, IL1B, IL4 and IL13 in conditioned medium reflected significant diagnostic performance for predicting ovarian endometriosis. Cellular phenotypic validation in vitro revealed an enhanced proliferative phenotype (P = 0.046) with no change in cell migratory capacity of endometrial stromal cells from the ovarian endometriosis group.
   Conclusions: Endometrial stromal cells derived from severe ovarian endometriosis samples displayed a hyperinflammatory and hyperproliferative bias in the endometrial stroma during the 'window of implantation' putatively causing loss of fecundability.

AB  - Background: Monitoring of population salt intake is essential for compliance with the WHO target of a 30% relative reduction in mean population salt intake. Objective: This study was conducted to estimate the daily salt intake and find the associated variables among adult women in an urban resettlement colony of Delhi. Methods: In this community-based cross-sectional study, 426 women aged 20-59 years from an urban resettlement colony were randomly selected. Sociodemographic details, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and morning spot urine samples were obtained. INTERSALT equation was used to estimate the 24-h salt intake from spot urine sodium. Association of salt intake with related variables was studied using t-test/analysis of variance, and P < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Results: A total of 426 women participated in the study, and 381 participants' urine samples could be collected. The study participants' mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 34.5 (9.4) years. The mean salt intake (SD, 95% confidence interval) of the participants calculated using the INTERSALT equation was 7.6 (1.7, 7.5-7.8) g/day. The salt intake was significantly associated with educational status, occupation, marital status, socioeconomic status, blood pressure, and waist circumference. Waist circumference was found to have a significant positive linear relationship with daily salt intake. Conclusion: The daily salt intake of this population was well above the recommendation and had a positive linear relationship with waist circumference. Reduction in daily salt intake is a must to control the epidemic of hypertension.

AB  - Neurosurgery is a challenging surgical specialty that demands many technical and cognitive skills. The traditional surgical training approach of having a trainee coached in the operating room by the faculty is time-consuming, costly, and involves patient risk factors. Simulation-based training methods are suitable to impart the surgical skills outside the operating room. Virtual simulators allow high-fidelity repeatable environment for surgical training. Neuroendoscopy, a minimally invasive neurosurgical technique, demands additional skills for limited maneuverability and eye-hand coordination. This study provides a review of the existing virtual reality simulators for training neuroendoscopic skills. Based on the screening, the virtual training methods developed for neuroendoscopy surgical skills were classified into endoscopic third ventriculostomy and endonasal transsphenoidal surgery trainers. The study revealed that a variety of virtual reality simulators have been developed by various institutions. Although virtual reality simulators are effective for procedure-based skills training, the simulators need to include anatomical variations and variety of cases for improved fidelity. The review reveals that there should be multi-centric prospective and retrospective cohort studies to establish concurrent and predictive validation for their incorporation in the surgical educational curriculum.

AB  - To describe a smartphone-based telemedicine tool for monitoring of corneal ulcer size during the corona pandemic, a simple "U"-shaped tool was constructed using three Schirmer's strips that were provided to the patients with small to medium-sized corneal ulcers. The patient and the attendant were trained to use this simple U-shaped tool at home and send digital images to the treating ophthalmologist, to monitor the course of the ulcer. The tool was used in five eyes of five patients with active microbial keratitis. Patients were followed up regularly with the use of telemedicine facility every 48 h for an average duration of 7.6 days (range 6-9 days). In all the five eyes, assessment of the serial images with U-shaped tool showed decrease in size of corneal ulcer, which corroborated with subjective improvement in symptoms. Hence, the novel "'U'-shaped tool" may provide an effective measure in following-up of corneal ulcer patients in times of the COVID-19 pandemic, obviating frequent hospital visits and risk of contracting COVID.

AB  - BuprenorphineNaloxone Fixed Dose Combination (BNX) is widely used to manage opioid use disorders. Contrary to evidence based concepts about sublingual bio-availability of naloxone, a few small studies have reported non-negligible amounts absorbed sublingually. But the extent to which these amounts exert opioid antagonist effects is yet to be established. We hereby report the first case of opioid dependence who developed a rare phenomenon of moderate to severe opioid withdrawal symptoms on administration of sublingual BNX after several days of being stabilized on plain buprenorphine (BUP). The case demonstrates the need to consider using buprenorphine monotherapy whenever such adverse effects are encountered. We also discuss the possible pharmacological explanations behind this rare side effect.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent serious neurological diseases. It is unique, being the only severe and disabling neurological disease that is fully treatable in the majority of cases, but on the other hand, associated with stigma, prejudice and discriminatory practices, which negatively impact people's everyday life in important areas, such as access to education, employment, marriage and social integration. For centuries, people with epilepsy (PWE) were stigmatized in all societies, with the consequences of prejudice and discrimination adding to the medical burden of the disease. Myths and misconceptions about this disease still occur, mostly in low-resources settings, however, in many industrialized countries, the knowledge regarding epilepsy is still limited in the population. The stigma is perceived as a negative attribute that is undesirable for the community to which the individual belongs. PWE are intrinsically undervalued, both by themselves ("felt stigma") and by the others. Actual discrimination by peers and institutions generates what is referred to as "enacted stigma". Misconceptions, stigma and negative attitudes towards PWE dramatically decrease quality of life, affecting the most sensitive areas, such as marriage, employment and driving. The Resolution 68.28 of the World Health Assembly (2015), the WHO-ILAE-IBE Global Report "Epilepsy: a public health imperative", advocates for strengthening and implementing national policies and legislation to promote and protect the rights of PWE, reducing misconceptions about epilepsy and improving access to care. Consolidated efforts are required from different organizations, public health managers, healthcare providers, PWE and their families to work together to improve socialization and quality of life of PWE. Educational programs and awareness to support activities among the general population, health service providers and PWE are the best way to reduce all types of stigma and discrimination.

AB  - The Helping Babies Survive (HBS) initiative features a suite of evidence-based curricula and simulation-based training programs designed to provide health workers in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs) with the knowledge, skills, and competencies to prevent, recognize, and manage leading causes of newborn morbidity and mortality. Global scale-up of HBS initiatives has been rapid. As HBS initiatives rolled out across LMIC settings, numerous bottlenecks, gaps, and barriers to the effective, consistent dissemination and implementation of the programs, across both the pre- and in-service continuums, emerged. Within the first decade of expansive scale-up of HBS programs, mobile phone ownership and access to cellular networks have also concomitantly surged in LMICs. In this article, we describe a number of HBS digital health innovations and resources that have been developed from 2010 to 2020 to support education and training, data collection for monitoring and evaluation, clinical decision support, and quality improvement. Helping Babies Survive partners and stakeholders can potentially integrate the described digital tools with HBS dissemination and implementation efforts in a myriad of ways to support low-dose high-frequency skills practice, in-person refresher courses, continuing medical and nursing education, on-the-job training, or peer-topeer learning, and strengthen data collection for key newborn care and quality improvement indicators and outcomes. Thoughtful integration of purpose-built digital health tools, innovations, and resources may assist HBS practitioners to more effectively disseminate and implement newborn care programs in LMICs, and facilitate progress toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal health goals, targets, and objectives.

AB  - Even though neurosurgeons exercise these enormous and versatile skills, the COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the fabrics of the global neurosurgical family, jeopardizing human lives, and forcing the entire world to be locked down. We stand on the shoulders of the giants and will not forget their examples and their teachings. We will work to the best of our ability to honor their memory. Professor Harvey Cushing said: "When to take great risks; when to withdraw in the face of unexpected difficulties; whether to force an attempted enucleation of a pathologically favorable tumor to its completion with the prospect of an operative fatality, or to abandon the procedure short of completeness with the certainty that after months or years even greater risks may have to be faced at a subsequent session-all these require surgical judgment which is a matter of long experience." It is up to us, therefore, to keep on the noble path that we have decided to undertake, to accumulate the surgical experience that these icons have shown us, the fruit of sacrifice and obstinacy. Our tribute goes to them; we will always remember their excellent work and their brilliant careers that will continue to enlighten all of us.

AB  - Introduction: The role of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in postmastectomy breast cancer patients is not well established. This study was done to establish the role of two different HFRT schedules in the treatment of chest wall and regional lymph nodes after mastectomy. Materials and Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, consecutively registered patients of locally advanced breast cancer patients having undergone mastectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer center were analyzed. Locoregional recurrence (LRR) was the primary endpoint, whereas overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and both acute and late adverse events were secondary endpoints. Results: A total of 34 patients who were treated with 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 21/2 weeks and 35 patients who were treated with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks were identified. The median follow-up period was 47 months and 63.5 months in the 39 Gy and 40 Gy arms, respectively. LRR was seen in 11.8% and 8.6% of patients in the 39 Gy and 40 Gy arms, respectively. OS at 4 years was 66% and 71.5% in the 39 Gy and 40 Gy arms, respectively. The mean DFS for 39 Gy and 40 Gy arms was 43.6 months and 66.4 months, respectively (P = 0.822). Acute skin toxicity was similar in the two groups. Arm edema was significantly more in the 40 Gy arm. Conclusion: The two HFRT schedules are equivalent to each other in terms of survival outcomes. Arm edema is higher with 40 Gy arm as compared to 39 Gy arm.

AB  - We have evaluated the expression of CD123 in 751 samples of acute leukemia and compared with postinduction response. CD123 expression was associated with measurable residual disease-positive status in both B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P < .001) and acute myeloid leukemia (P = .001). In conclusion, CD123 may be considered as a cardinal marker for residual disease assessment and response evaluation in acute myeloid leukemia and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
   Introduction: CD123 is overexpressed in many hematologic malignancies and found to be useful in characterizing leukemic blasts of both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). CD123 has been recently found to be a marker of leukemic stem cells, and its utility to measure residual disease and potential role in disease relapse is under evaluation. Materials and Methods: Herein, we have evaluated the expression of CD123 in 757 samples of acute leukemia including 479 treatment-naive and 278 follow-up samples and compared with postinduction morphologic complete remission and measurable residual disease (MRD) status. Multiparametric flow cytometry was used for assessment of CD123 expression and immunophenotypic characterization of leukemic blasts at diagnostic and MRD assessment time points. Results: Using variable cutoffs of 5%, 10%, and 20% to define a case as CD123-positive, expression of CD123 was observed in 75.6%, 66.2%, and 50% of AML and 88.6%, 81.8%, and 75% of B-ALL, respectively. Of 11 patients, 7 (63.63%) had mixed phenotype acute leukemia, but none of the 12 patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed positivity for CD123. CD123 expression at diagnosis was associated with post-induction MRD-positive status in both B-ALL (P<.001) and AML (P = .001). We also evaluated the utility of CD123 as a leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype and found it to be useful in both patients with AML (baseline, 50.6%; follow-up, 53%) and B-ALL (baseline, 75%; follow-up, 73.07%). Conclusions: In conclusion, CD123 may be considered as a cardinal marker for residual disease assessment and response evaluation in AML and B-ALL. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. The guideline comes at a time when advances in diabetes technology and therapeutics offer new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. An enlarging base of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is available to evaluate important new treatments offering organ protection, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The goal of the new guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies. In addition, the guideline contains practice points to facilitate implementation when insufficient data are available to make well-justified recommendations or when additional guidance may be useful for clinical application. The guideline covers comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and self-management and health systems approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD.

TI  - Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
KW  - Coronavirus
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Neurosurgery
KW  - Social media
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon.
   METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions.
   RESULTS: A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32-70 years) and the post-residency experience was 7 years (range, 0-34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (P = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (>60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons.
   CONCLUSIONS: The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in publiceprivate practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histologic features of Descemet membrane detachment (DMD) to ascertain the involvement of the pre-Descemet layer (PDL).
   DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.
   METHODS: Clinical, histopathologic, and OCT features of a cohort of 41 cases with diagnosis of DMD from 4 centers were studied. OCT images were evaluated independently by 3 observers for number of detached layers (1 or 2), reflectivity, configuration (straight line or wavy), distance from posterior stroma, and presence or absence of a tear with any scrolling of the torn edges. Five had a histology specimen. The main outcome measure was the involvement of the PDL in DMD and its confirmation by histology.
   RESULTS: Three types of DMD were identified: type 1, where the PDL and DM were detached together; type 2, where only the DM was detached; and mixed, where the PDL and DM were detached but also separated from each other. These were further found to be rhegmatogenous or nonrhegmatogenous depending on the presence of absence of a tear in DM or both layers. Histology confirmed involvement of PDL in all 5 cases and showed it to be infiltrated by cells in 3 of 5 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PDL is involved in DMD. This fact significantly changes our understanding of DMD and could have implications for management. The detached PDL can be infiltrated with cells. A prospective study in relation to etiology and types of DMD is needed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents with myriad extra-pulmonary manifestation and a high mortality in patients with comorbidities. Its effect on patients with pre-existing acute pancreatitis is not known.
   Methods: We hereby, present 3 cases with severe acute pancreatitis with persistent respiratory failure who acquired nosocomial COVID-19 during their hospital stay after recovery from respiratory failure. Their clinical course is highlighted which reflects on pathophysiology of organ dysfunction in these 2 disease states.
   Results: None of the 3 patients with severe acute pancreatitis who developed nosocomial COVID-19 redeveloped respiratory failure due to COVID-19 despite having recently recovered from pancreatitis induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Only one patient developed SARS-CoV2 induced moderate pneumonia.
   Conclusion: These cases highlight that host responses and mechanisms of lung injury might be different in severe acute pancreatitis and COVID-19. (C) 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The literature reports increased suicide rates among general population in the weeks following the celebrity suicide, known as the Werther effect. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicide. The present study aimed to assess the quality of online media reporting of a recent celebrity suicide in India and its impact on the online suicide related search behaviour of the population. A total of 200 online media reports about Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide published between 14th to 20th June 2020 were assessed for quality of reporting following the checklist prepared using the WHO guidelines. Further, we examined the change in online suicide-seeking and help-seeking search behaviour of the population following celebrity suicide for the month of June using selected keywords. In terms of potentially harmful media reportage, 85.5 % of online reports violated at least one WHO media reporting guideline. In terms of potentially helpful media reportage, only 13 % articles provided information about where to seek help for suicidal thoughts or ideation. There was a significant increase in online suicide-seeking (U = 0.5, p < 0.05) and help-seeking (U = 6.5, p < 0.05) behaviour after the reference event, when compared to baseline. However, the online peak search interest for suicide-seeking was greater than help-seeking. This provides support for a strong Werther effect, possibly associated with poor quality of media reporting of celebrity suicide. There is an urgent need for taking steps to improve the quality of media reporting of suicide in India.

TI  - Interpersonal Violence during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in Nepal: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEPAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - domestic violence
KW  - interpersonal violence
KW  - Nepal
KW  - substance abuse
AB  - Introduction: The government issued a country-wide lockdown in Nepal as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in various difficult experiences which includes financial loss, separation from loved ones, grief, uncertainty over disease status and loss of freedom. During these stressful situations, interpersonal violence is likely to be aggravated. To avoid the occurrence of adverse events such as impulsive acts, homicide, or suicide, it is important to identify high-risk individuals.
   Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey by convenience sampling. The prevalence of different types of interpersonal violence with socio-demographic factors, substance use, and overall mental wellbeing was assessed by using descriptive statistical tests.
   Results: Out of total 556 participants included in the analysis, 50.9% (283) were male and 48.7% (271) were female. There were 100 (18.0%) participants who reported being a victim of interpersonal violence and 101 (18.2%) participants who reported being a perpetrator during the lockdown. The victims of violence were more likely to be living with their spouse alone. The victims and perpetrators were also more likely to have increased alcohol and tobacco use. More number of victims and perpetrators had lower mental wellbeing scores on the WHO wellbeing index.
   Conclusions: There was prevalence of interpersonal violence during the COVID-19 lockdown. In addition to the fear regarding pandemic, victims have to face domestic violence placing them at a double injustice. Identification of vulnerable groups and proper management of survivors must be prioritized given the unanimous consensus on the rise of interpersonal violence during periods of heightened stress.

AB  - Background & objectives: Early case detection is essential to interrupt transmission and to prevent further spread of tuberculosis (TB) in high endemic settings. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) with visual read-outs are ideal as point-of-care tests. Truenat (TM) MTB is an indigenous chip-based NAAT for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which involves extraction of DNA and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using portable, automated, battery-operated instruments. The current multicentric study was aimed to evaluate Truenat for detection of MTB in sputum samples obtained from patients with presumptive pulmonary TB with reference to culture as gold standard and Xpert as a comparator.
   Methods: The study was conducted at four sites, namely ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi; ICMR-National JALMA Institute for Leprosy and Other Mycobacterial Diseases, Agra; and National Institute of TB and Respiratory Diseases, New Delhi. Patients suspected to have TB were screened for eligibility. Two sputum samples were collected from each patient. Tests included smear, Xpert and Truenat directly from the sputum sample and culture by Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium and MGIT960 from decontaminated pellets. Sample used for Truenat assay was coded. Resolution of Truenat false positives was done using an in-house PCR with TRC4 primers.
   Results: The study enrolled 2419 presumptive TB patients after screening 2465 patients, and 3541 sputum samples were collected from the enrolled patients. Results of 2623 samples were available for analysis. Truenat showed a positivity rate of 48.5 per cent as compared to 37.0 per cent by Xpert. The sensitivities of Truenat and Xpert were was 88.3 and 79.7 per cent, respectively in comparison with culture.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Truenat MTB identified more positives among culture-confirmed samples than Xpert and had higher sensitivity. In addition, other advantageous operational features of Truenat MTB were identified which would be useful in field settings.

AB  - Background: Chronic tension type headache (CTTH) is one of the common cause of hospital visits among adolescents and adults. Chronic tension type headache produces pain, sleep disturbances, and disability among patients leading to a poor quality of life. Knowledge pattern of headache and various associated factors will aid appropriate management.
   Aims: To identify the headache dimensions and their various influencing factors among patients of chronic tension-type headache.
   Methods: Using consecutive sampling techniques, 169 patients with chronic tension-type headache were recruited in this cross-sectional survey. Approval was obtained from the Institute's Ethics Committee. The Wong-Baker Foundation Pain intensity scale was used to assess the pain severity.
   Results: A pain severity score of 6 out of 10 was reported by 56% of the patients, and the mean pain score reported by the patients was 6.62 +/- 1.16. The mean weekly headache frequency was 4.95 +/- 0.38, and the mean daily headache duration was 8.68 +/- 1.68 hours. Significantly more patients who are married, patients who had a duration of illness less than two years, and patients who were treated with only analgesics reported higher headache severity. Higher headache frequency was reported by significantly more patients who were male, married, from a nuclear family, educated, unskilled laborers or employed, urban inhabitants, or only on analgesics, or had illness duration less than two years. Headache duration was significantly higher in patients who were unskilled laborers or only on analgesics, or had illness duration less than two years.
   Conclusions: Patients with chronic tension-type headache experience moderate to high severity of headache, along with substantial duration and frequency, an outcome that was associated with various lifestyle-related factors that can result in stress. Lifestyle modification and nonpharmacological management are thus essential to reduce the severity, frequency, and duration of headache in patients with a chronic tension-type headache and medication overuse.

AB  - Background & objectives: Malaria continues to be a significant public health problem in tropical countries including India; however, there are limited tools to predict occurrence of severe disease due to malaria. This study was designed to evaluate the role of Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA)as disease biomarkers in uncomplicated malaria (UM) and severe malaria (SM).
   Methods: This is a prospective observational study carried out at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), tertiary referral hospital in New Delhi, India. The study population included patients diagnosed with malaria (Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax) either by rapid diagnostic kit test or positive peripheral smear and age more than 12 years. Forty-nine patients (25 with SM, 24 with UM) and 22 controls were recruited. In addition to routine investigations, serum concentrations of Ang-1, Ang-2, VEGF and ADMA were measured using ELISA technique.
   Results: We observed Ang-1 serum levels to be significantly lower in patients with severe malaria (7775 pg/ml) compared to uncomplicated malaria (17629 pg/ml) and healthy controls (43472 pg/ml) [p < 0.001]. Ang-2 levels were significantly higher in severe malaria (11100 pg/ml) compared to uncomplicated malaria (7315 pg/ml) and healthy controls (3679 pg/ml) (p < 0.001). The ratio of Ang-2/Ang-1 was significantly higher in patients with severe malaria. VEGF serum levels was significantly lower in severe malaria (130.36 pg/ml) compared to uncomplicated malaria (317.3 pg/ml). The Ang-1, Ang-2 and VEGF levels were able to differentiate severe malaria from uncomplicated malaria caused by P. vivax but not with P. falciparum.
   Interpretation & conclusion: We conclude that Ang-1, Ang-2 and VEGF are markers of disease severity in vivax malaria.

AB  - Endovascular treatment is a highly effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion and has recently revolutionized stroke care. Oftentimes, ischemic core extent on baseline imaging is used to determine endovascular treatment-eligibility. There are, however, 3 fundamental issues with the core concept: First, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which are mostly used in the acute stroke setting, are not able to precisely determine whether and to what extent brain tissue is infarcted (core) or still viable, due to variability in tissue vulnerability, the phenomenon of selective neuronal loss and lack of a reliable gold standard. Second, treatment decision-making in acute stroke is multifactorial, and as such, the relative importance of single variables, including imaging factors, is reduced. Third, there are often discrepancies between core volume and clinical outcome. This review will address the uncertainty in terminology and proposes a direction towards more clarity. This theoretical exercise needs empirical data that clarify the definitions further and prove its value.

AB  - Background: Atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) is the most heterogeneous subcategory of the Bethesda system for thyroid cytopathology with laid down permissible limits of frequency and risk of malignancy (ROM). Due to differences in thyroid clinical practice worldwide, variations have been found in frequency, resection rates (RR) and ROM. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis of AUS/FLUS across different regions was conducted and comparison of data from India was done with the rest of Asia and the West.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and Google search engines from January 2009-Dec 2019 using terms "AUS Thyroid" and "FLUS Thyroid". Meta-analysis was performed using DerSimonian-Laird method and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random effects model. Independent samples t-test was used to compare frequency, RR, and ROM of AUS/FLUS between India, rest of Asia and the West.
   Results: Out of 15,000 studies on internet, 60 (18 Indian, 12 Asian and 30 Western) were included. Total aspirates were 201,657; 14,279 Indian, 62,448 Asian, 124,930 Western. Pooled estimates were: frequency 7.3% (6.3-8.3%), RR 41.9% (37.4-46.6%), ROM 33.3% (26.8-39.9%). Pooled prevalence of rate did not vary significantly across the three regions. Pooled prevalence of RR was highest in India (52.9%) and lowest in rest of Asia (26.5%); of ROM was highest in Asia (45.9%), lowest in the West (26.3%) (P<0.01). Statistical analysis demonstrated publication bias, limited to Indian and Western studies. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was the most common surgical diagnosis (87.9%; 1,082/1,231).
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed differences in thyroid clinical practice followed in India, rest of Asia and the West. Although pooled prevalence of rate of AUS/FLUS was similar across the three, pooled RR and ROM varied. AUS/FLUS nodules were more frequently resected in Indian and Western studies than in rest of Asia. ROM was higher than recommended values in all three areas, being intermediate for India.

AB  - Stain normalization of microscopic images is the first pre-processing step in any computer-assisted automated diagnostic tool. This paper proposes Geometry-inspired Chemical-invariant and Tissue Invariant Stain Normalization method, namely GCTI-SN, for microscopic medical images. The proposed GCTISN method corrects for illumination variation, stain chemical, and stain quantity variation in a unified framework by exploiting the underlying color vector space's geometry. While existing stain normalization methods have demonstrated their results on a single tissue and stain type, GCTI-SN is benchmarked on three cancer datasets of three cell/tissue types prepared with two different stain chemicals. GCTI-SN method is also benchmarked against the existing methods via quantitative and qualitative results, validating its robustness for stain chemical and cell/tissue type. Further, the utility and the efficacy of the proposed GCTI-SN stain normalization method is demonstrated diagnostically in the application of breast cancer detection via a CNN-based classifier.

AB  - Background: Oxidative stress is crucial player in skeletal muscle atrophy pathogenesis. S-allyl cysteine (SAC), an organosulfur compound of Allium sativum, possesses broad-spectrum properties including immuno- and redox-modulatory impact. Considering the role of SAC in regulating redox balance, we hypothesize that SAC may have a protective role in oxidative-stress induced atrophy.
   Methods: C2C12 myotubes were treated with H2O2 (100 mu M) in the presence or absence of SAC (200 mu M) to study morphology, redox status, inflammatory cytokines and proteolytic systems using fluorescence microscopy, biochemical analysis, real-time PCR and immunoblotting approaches. The anti-atrophic potential of SAC was confirmed in denervation-induced atrophy model.
   Results: SAC pre-incubation (4 h) could protect the myotube morphology (i.e. length/diameter/fusion index) from atrophic effects of H2O2. Lower levels of ROS, lipid peroxidation, oxidized glutathione and altered antioxidant enzymes were observed in H2O2-exposed cells upon pre-treatment with SAC. SAC supplementation also suppressed the rise in cytokines levels (TWEAK/IL6/myostatin) caused by H2O2. SAC treatment also moderated the degradation of muscle-specific proteins (MHCf) in the H2O2-treated myotubes supported by lower induction of diverse proteolytic systems (i.e. cathepsin, calpain, ubiquitin-proteasome E3-ligases, caspase-3, autophagy). Denervation-induced atrophy in mice illustrates that SAC administration alleviates the negative effects (i.e. mass loss, decreased cross-sectional area, up-regulation of proteolytic systems, and degradation of total/specific protein) of denervation on muscles.
   Conclusions: SAC exerts significant anti-atrophic effects to protect myotubes from H2O2-induced protein loss and myofibers from denervation-induced muscle loss, due to the prevention of elevated proteolytic systems and inflammatory/oxidative molecules.
   General significance: The results signify the potential of SAC against muscle atrophy.

AB  - Purpose: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) offer an immense diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We sought to determine socioeconomic, psychological and demographic factors in PNES compared to age and gender matched epilepsy patients as well as healthy controls. We also examined psychiatric co-morbidities in PNES and epilepsy patients.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study at a tertiary centre in India with three groups including PNES only, age and gender matched epilepsy only and healthy participants. Factors including marital status, family type, education level and psychiatric comorbidities etc. were compared between the three groups. Details of PNES semiology, duration of event and disease were collected. Psychiatric assessment included MINI International Diagnostic Interview based on DSM-IV criteria and Holmes-Rahe Social Readjustment Scale for stress evaluation. The modified Kuppuswamy scale was used to assess socio-economic status.
   Results: We enrolled 100 PNES patients (mean age 26.1 +/- 10.8 years), 100 epilepsy patients (23.5 +/- 9.6 years) and 100 healthy controls (28.9 +/- 11.0 years). Ninety per cent of participants were female. Significant factors associated with PNES included family history of epilepsy [OR 20.3 (2.6-155.6) (p = 0.004)], low education including literate/illiterate status [OR 14.1 (2.5-78.9) (p = 0.003)], interpersonal conflict [OR 2.4 (1.1-6.0) (p = 0.05)] and presence of psychiatric comorbidity [OR 60.5 (24.1-152.2) (p < 0.001)] of which major depression was the most common. The current suicide risk was significantly elevated in PNES compared to epilepsy patients (p < 0.001). PNES disease duration correlated with presence of current depression, dysthymia and suicidality but not with other psychiatric comorbidities.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight that several socio-economic and demographic factors are associated with occurrence of PNES. High rates of psychiatric comorbidities including current suicide risk emphasise the need for a collaborative neuropsychiatric approach.

AB  - The global COVID-2019 pandemic has presented to the field of radiation oncology a management dilemma in providing evidence-based treatments to all cancer patients. There is a need for appropriate measures to be taken to reduce infectious spread between the medical healthcare providers and the patient population. Such times warrant resource prioritization and to continue treatment with best available evidence, thereby reducing the risk of COVID-2019 transmission in times where the workforce is reduced. There has been literature presented in different aspects related to providing safety measures, running of a radiation department and for the management of various cancer subsites. In this article, we present a comprehensive review for sustaining a radiation oncology department in times of the COVID-2019 pandemic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Ensuring universal access to sanitation in households is essential for public health. Objectives: The objective of the study was to assess the availability of sanitary latrine at the household level and its use at the individual level in a rural area and factors associated with availability and use of sanitary latrine. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from December, 2016 to January 2017 (mention month and year) at the rural Health and Demographic Surveillance Site, Ballabgarh, in district Faridabad, Haryana, North India. A total of 16,896 households were studied. House-to-house visits were made by trained health workers who conducted interviews regarding availability and pattern of use of sanitary latrine in the household. The health worker also observed the type of sanitation facility, its functional status, availability of water, and hand-washing facility. Results: Individual household latrine (IHL) was present in 87.3% of the households. An improved sanitation facility was available in 84.8% of the households, while 15.2% of the households had unimproved or no sanitation facility. Hand-washing facility along with improved sanitation was present in 70.4% of the households. Nonavailability of latrine among socially disadvantaged communities (scheduled caste households) was significantly higher (19.4%) as compared to other castes (10.4%) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of households below poverty line (28.9%) lacked IHL as compared to those above the poverty line (11.0%) (P < 0.001). Nearly 11% of the individuals reported open defecation. Conclusion: The availability of sanitary latrines in the study area was high. Nonavailability of in-house sanitary latrine was higher among economically poor households and those belonging to socially disadvantaged communities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors aimed to evaluate the impact of age and frailty on the surgical outcomes of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and to assess caregivers' perceptions regarding postdischarge care and challenges faced in the developing country of India.
   METHODS This was a retrospective study of patients with histopathologically proven GBM from 2009 to 2018. Data regarding the clinical and radiological characteristics as well as surgical outcomes were collected from the institute's electronic database. Taking Indian demographics into account, the authors used the cutoff age of 60 years to define patients as elderly. Frailty was estimated using the 11-point modified frailty index (mFI-11). Patients were divided into three groups: robust, with an mFI score of 0; moderately frail, with an mFI score of 1 or 2; and severely frail, with an mFI score >= 3. A questionnaire-based survey was done to assess caregivers' perceptions about postdischarge care.
   RESULTS Of the 276 patients, there were 93 (33.7%) elderly patients and 183 (66.3%) young or middle-aged patients. The proportion of severely frail patients was significantly more in the elderly group (38.7%) than in the young or middle-aged group (28.4%) (p < 0.001). The authors performed univariate and multivariate analysis of associations of different short-term outcomes with age, sex, frailty, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. On the multivariate analysis, only frailty was found to be a significant predictor for in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, and length of hospital and ICU stay (p < 0.001). On Cox regression analysis, the severely frail group was found to have a significantly lower overall survival rate compared with the moderately frail (p = 0.001) and robust groups (p < 0.001). With the increase in frailty, there was a concomitant increase in the requirement for readmissions (p = 0.003), postdischarge specialist care (p = 0.001), and help from extrafamilial sources (p < 0.001). Greater dissatisfaction with psychosocial and financial support among the caregivers of severely frail patients was seen as they found themselves ill-equipped to provide postdischarge care at home (p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS Frailty is a better predictor of poorer surgical outcomes than chronological age in terms of duration of hospital and ICU stay, postoperative complications, and in-hospital mortality. It also adds to the psychosocial and financial burdens of the caregivers, making postdischarge care challenging.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to be beneficial in traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have attempted to quantitatively synthesize the findings of current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this meta-analysis and analyzed the need for further trials using trial sequential analysis (TSA).
   METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library databases, and Google Scholar for RCTs until December 2019 evaluating the role of EPO in patients with TBI. Seven RCTs were finally included in the quantitative analysis. TSA was done to evaluate the need for further studies.
   RESULTS: The pooled estimate demonstrated that EPO significantly reduced mortality at 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.97; P = 0.04) but not in hospital mortality (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.31-2.32; P = 0.74). There was no significant difference in the rate of favorable outcomes with EPO (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.84-2.99; P = 0.16). The rate of deep vein thrombosis (RD, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02; P = 0.41) was also not found to be significantly different in the 2 groups. TSA showed that the accrued information is insufficient to make any definitive conclusions.
   CONCLUSIONS: EPO seems to be beneficial in terms of reducing 6-month mortality, however, its effect on in-hospital mortality, neurologic outcomes, and risk of deep vein thrombosis fails to reach statistical significance. TSA suggests a need for large trials to evaluate the role of EPO in patients with TBI in a more systematic way.

AB  - Intake of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6n-3) is very low among Indian pregnant women. Maternal supplementation during pregnancy and lactation may benefit offspring neurodevelopment. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of supplementing pregnant Indian women (singleton gestation) from <= 20 weeks through 6 months postpartum with 400 mg/d algal DHA compared to placebo on neurodevelopment of their offspring at 12 months. Of 3379 women screened, 1131 were found eligible; 957 were randomized. The primary outcome was infant neurodevelopment at 12 months, assessed using the Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants (DASII). Both groups were well balanced on sociodemographic variables at baseline. More than 72% of women took >90% of their assigned treatment. Twenty-five serious adverse events (SAEs), none related to the intervention, (DHA group = 16; placebo = 9) were noted. Of 902 live births, 878 were followed up to 12 months; the DASII was administered to 863 infants. At 12 months, the mean development quotient (DQ) scores in the DHA and placebo groups were not statistically significant (96.6 +/- 12.2 vs. 97.1 +/- 13.0, p = 0.60). Supplementing mothers through pregnancy and lactation with 400 mg/d DHA did not impact offspring neurodevelopment at 12 months of age in this setting.

AB  - In contrast to adults, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually leads to a mild illness in children. However, a few children have been reported to have severe manifestations including pneumonia, acute kidney injury, multi-organ failure and cardiac injury. This review focuses on cardiac involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the recently described likely immune mediated post-COVID-19 syndrome. Therapeutic strategies for cardiac dysfunction in both these settings are briefly discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of pathogenic variants in the SRD5A2 gene in children with 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD) with normal to high serum testosterone levels and absence of Mullerian structures on imaging and to evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation. Seventy-five patients with 46,XY DSD and probable clinical diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency or androgen insensitivity syndrome were enrolled. Genetic analysis was done for pathogenic variants in SRD5A2, and the genotype-phenotype correlation was studied. As a result, 10 pathogenic or likely pathogenic biallelic variants in SRD5A2, either homozygous or compound heterozygous, were identified in 25 of 75 (33.3%) patients. The hCG stimulated testosterone: dihydrotestosterone (T:DHT) ratio was elevated in all patients with pathogenic variants in SRD5A2 and in nearly 90% of those without pathogenic variants in SRD5A2 in whom this was assessed. The missense pathogenic variant p.R246Q was a hotspot. One novel pathogenic variant p.Y178*, and a variant p.F194I, not previously reported in patients with 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency, were identified. The missense variant p.F194I was predicted as deleterious and damaging by in silico analysis and as likely to reduce the enzyme activity by protein modeling. In conclusion, pathogenic variants in SRD5A2 can be detected in a wide spectrum of Indian patients with 46,XY DSD. Molecular genetic analysis should be considered as a first-line test as the T:DHT ratio lacks specificity and a hotspot variant is present in a vast majority.

KW  - prostate brachytherapy
AB  - Background: Prostate cancer is a common cancer found in men worldwide. Brachytherapy is an established modality used for the treatment of these patients. Although anesthetic management of such patients is challenging but the ideal anesthetic technique has not yet been established. Our study aims to identify the most efficacious anesthetic technique for perioperative management of prostate cancer patients undergoing brachytherapy. Methods: Retrospective analysis of ten patients who underwent 16 brachytherapy sessions under combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia between April 2016 and December 2016 was done. The data were collected, tabulated using MS Excel, and statistically analyzed with EPI Info 6 and SPSS-16 statistical software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA) to draw relative conclusions. Results: The median peak sensory dermatome level achieved was T6 and the median maximum motor block achieved was grade 2. The mean (+/- standard deviation (SD)) time to sensory regression to T10 (range T5-T8) dermatome was found to be 118.00 +/- 47.110 (range = 0-238) minutes. Despite the presence of co-morbidities, minor intraoperative complications were observed only in two patients. The postoperative numerical rating scale (NRS) was less than 4 in all patients during the first 24 hours. None of our patients complained of nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory depression. The mean (+/- SD) patient satisfaction score was 44.40 +/- 0.871 (range : 1-5) at the end of 24 hours. Conclusions: CSE anesthesia is a safe and effective technique for anesthetic management of patients undergoing prostate brachytherapy.

AB  - Rationale & Objective: The inconsistency in outcomes reported and lack of patient-reported outcomes across trials in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) limits shared decision making. As part of the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG)-Kids initiative, we aimed to generate a consensus-based prioritized list of critically important outcomes to be reported in all trials in children with CKD.
   Study Design: An online 2-round Delphi survey in English, French, and Hindi languages.
   Settings & Participants: Patients (aged 8-21 years), caregivers/family, and health care professionals (HCPs) rated the importance of out-comes using a 9-point Likert scale (7-9 indicating critical importance) and completed a Best-Worst Scale.
   Analytical Approach: We assessed the absolute and relative importance of outcomes. Comments were analyzed thematically.
   Results: 557 participants (72 [13%] patients, 132 [24%] caregivers, and 353 [63%] HCPs) from 48 countries completed round 1 and 312 (56%) participants (28 [40%] patients, 64 [46%] caregivers, and 220 [56%] HCPs) completed round 2. Five outcomes were common in the top 10 for each group: mor-tality, kidney function, life participation, blood pressure, and infection. Caregivers and HCPs rated cardiovascular disease higher than patients. Patients gave lower ratings to all out-comes compared with caregivers/HCPs except they rated life participation (round 2 mean difference, 0.1), academic performance (0.1), mobility (0.4), and ability to travel (0.4) higher than caregivers and rated ability to travel (0.4) higher than HCPs. We identified 3 themes: alleviating disease and treatment burden, focusing on the whole child, and resolving fluctuating and conflicting goals.
   Limitations: Most participants completed the survey in English.
   Conclusions: Mortality, life participation, kidney function, and blood pressure were consistently highly prioritized by patients, caregivers, and HCPs. Patients gave higher priority to some lifestyle-related outcomes compared with caregivers/HCPs. Establishing critically important outcomes for all trials in children with CKD may improve consistent reporting of survival, kidney health, and clinical and life impact outcomes that are meaningful for decision making.

AB  - Meditation is a complex mental process-practiced widely for stress management and promotion of health- exerts beneficial effects on physical and mental health, and cognitive performance. However, until now, few theoretical neural mechanisms of meditation had been proposed, still not completely elucidated. We have previously evaluated the brain activity during Preksha meditation using an innovative 18FDG-PET methodological approach. Based on our previous study observations, we proposed here the neurophysiological framework of longterm and regular practice of preksha meditation. This mechanism will provide the scientific evidence to understand the attention control mechanisms resulting from the advanced state of preksha meditation. This might have multiple clinical applications as well as effective in a healthy population for attention-related tasks. Also, it is expected that the present neural model will provide a scientific platform for future clinical studies of meditation.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims to review the pertinent anatomy, etiopathogenesis, current clinical and radiological concepts and principles of management in case of upper limb entrapment neuropathies.
   Methods: The review is based on critical analysis of the existing literature as well as our experience in dealing with entrapment neuropathies.
   Results: Entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb peripheral nerves are common conditions that are often misdiagnosed because of their varying clinical presentations and lack of standardized diagnostic methods. Clinical assessment and electrodiagnostic studies have been the mainstay; however, imaging techniques have provided newer insights into the pathophysiology of these entities, leading to a paradigm shift in their diagnosis and management. The current best practice protocols for entrapment syndromes are constantly evolving with increasing emphasis on the role high-resolution ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Many imaging criteria are described and we have tried to present the most validated measurements for diagnosing entrapment neuropathies.
   Conclusion: It is imperative for a clinical radiologist to be familiar with the etiopathogenesis and clinical features of these conditions, in addition to being thorough with the anatomy and the latest imaging strategies.

AB  - The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the sole target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Several mechanisms, such as the acquisition of mutations, variability of the loop length, and alterations in the glycan pattern, are employed by the virus to shield neutralizing epitopes on Env to sustain survival and infectivity within the host. The identification of mutations that lead to viral evasion of the host immune response is essential for the optimization and engineering of Env-based trimeric immunogens. Here, we report a rare leucine-to-phenylalanine escape mutation (L184F) at the base of hypervariable loop 2 (population frequency of 0.0045%) in a 9-month-old perinatally HIV-1-infected infant broad neutralizer. The L184F mutation altered the trimer conformation by modulating intramolecular interactions stabilizing the trimer apex and led to viral escape from autologous plasma bnAbs and known N160 glycan-targeted bnAbs. The L184F amino acid change led to the acquisition of a relatively open trimeric conformation, often associated with tier 1 HIV-1 isolates and increased susceptibility to neutralization by polyclonal plasma antibodies of weak neutralizers. While there was no impact of the L184F mutation on free virus transmission, a reduction in cell-to-cell transmission was observed. In conclusion, we report a naturally selected viral mutation, L184F, that influenced a change in the conformation of the Env trimer apex as a mechanism of escape from contemporaneous plasma V2 apex-targeted nAbs. Further studies should be undertaken to define viral mutations acquired during natural infection, to escape selection pressure exerted by bnAbs, to inform vaccine design and bnAb-based therapeutic strategies.
   IMPORTANCE The design of HIV-1 envelope-based immunogens capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is currently under active research. Some of the most potent bnAbs target the quaternary epitope at the V2 apex of the HIV-1 Env trimer. By studying naturally circulating viruses from a perinatally HIV-1-infected infant with plasma neutralizing antibodies targeted to the V2 apex, we identified a rare leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution, in two out of six functional viral clones, that destabilized the trimer apex. This single-amino-acid alteration impaired the interprotomeric interactions that stabilize the trimer apex, resulting in an open trimer conformation and escape from broadly neutralizing autologous plasma antibodies and known V2 apex-directed bnAbs, thereby favoring viral evasion of the early bnAb response of the infected host. Defining the mechanisms by which naturally occurring viral mutations influence the sensitivity of HIV-1 to bnAbs will provide information for the development of vaccines and bnAbs as anti-HIV-1 reagents.

AB  - Background: The choice of surgical procedure in severe (Bayne and Klug types 3 and 4) radial longitudinal deficiency (RLD) is contentious. Existing studies have reported varying results with both centralization and radialization procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic outcome of radialization and centralization procedures at a short-to-intermediate-term follow-up for the treatment of types 3 and 4 RLD.
   Methods: Fourteen patients with 17 affected limbs having types 3 or 4 RLD were recruited in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. After initial application of successive casts for soft tissue distraction, patients were randomized to 2 wrist alignment procedures-centralization and radialization. Clinical and radiologic parameters recorded at stipulated intervals until a final follow-up of 24 months included hand-forearm angle, ulnar bow, forearm length, arm length, total angulation, and range of motion at elbow, wrist, and fingers.
   Results: Centralization was performed in 9 affected limbs, whereas radialization was performed in 8 affected limbs. Nine affected limbs had type 4 RLD, and 8 affected limbs had type 3 RLD. There was no significant difference in the hand-forearm angle in the immediate postoperative period. At 3 months, the radiologic hand-forearm angle increased to 19 degrees in the centralization group, while the radialization group showed an average increase to 4 degrees. This increase in the hand-forearm angle continued at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up assessments. Worsening of the deformity was more in the centralization group, as compared with the radialization group. The forearm length also significantly differed in the 2 groups at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up; however, when adjusted for preoperative lengths, the difference was significant only at 12- and 24-month follow-up.
   Conclusions: At a short-to-intermediate-term follow-up, radialization fares better than centralization in terms of recurrence of deformity and in terms of affecting the forearm length. Longer follow-up with a larger sample size is needed to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Introduction: A grading system for pulmonary adenocarcinoma has not been established. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer pathology panel evaluated a set of histologic criteria associated with prognosis aimed at establishing a grading system for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
   Methods: A multi-institutional study involving multiple cohorts of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinomas was conducted. A cohort of 284 stage I pulmonary adenocarcinomas was used as a training set to identify histologic features associated with patient outcomes (recurrence-free survival [RFS] and overall survival [OS]). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to select the best model, which was validated (n = 212) and tested (n = 300, including stage I-III) in independent cohorts. Reproducibility of the model was assessed using kappa statistics.
   Results: The best model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.749 for RFS and 0.787 for OS) was composed of a combination of predominant plus high-grade histologic pattern with a cutoff of 20% for the latter. The model consists of the following: grade 1, lepidic predominant tumor; grade 2, acinar or papillary predominant tumor, both with no or less than 20% of high-grade patterns; and grade 3, any tumor with 20% or more of high-grade patterns (solid, micropapillary, or complex gland). Similar results were seen in the validation (AUC = 0.732 for RFS and 0.787 for OS) and test cohorts (AUC = 0.690 for RFS and 0.743 for OS), confirming the predictive value of the model. Interobserver reproducibility revealed good agreement (k = 0.617).
   Conclusions: A grading system based on the predominant and high-grade patterns is practical and prognostic for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma. (C) 2020 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence of differences in operator-related outcomes between single and double puncture arthrocentesis is limited. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare intraoperative outcomes with single puncture types 1 and 2, and double puncture, arthrocentesis. A total of 59 patients with 60 temporomandibular joints (TMJ) were treated sequentially by single puncture type 1 (n = 20), single puncture type 2 (n = 20), and double puncture arthrocentesis (n = 20). Total operating time, incidence of dislocation of the needle, preauricular swelling, and ease of operation were compared. Single puncture type 2 arthrocentesis took significantly less time than type 1 (p <0.0001) or double puncture arthrocentesis (p < 0.0001), but there was no difference in operating time between single puncture type 1 and the double puncture technique (p = 0.25). There were significantly fewer dislocations of the needle with single puncture type 1 (p = 0.041) and single puncture type 2 (p = 0.033) than with double arthrocentesis. Single puncture type 2 arthrocentesis was easier than the single puncture type 1 (p = 0.001) or double puncture technique (p < 0.0001). Extravasation of fluid caused swelling in seven patients after double puncture, and in three patients each after single puncture types 1 and 2, arthrocentesis. Our results indicate that the single puncture type 2 technique is easiest and requires the least operating time. There was no difference between single puncture type 1 and double puncture arthrocentesis in terms of operating time or ease of the procedure. There were fewer operative dislocations of the needle with the single than with the double puncture technique. (C) 2020 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Primary thyroid lymphomas (PTLs) are rare and most commonly present as rapidly enlarging thyroid mass causing obstructive symptoms. Due to worldwide differences in clinical practices related to thyroid malignancy, this review was conducted to compare the clinicopathological and diagnostic modalities related to PTL and their similarities and differences between the Asian and Western countries. Using the search engine PubMed, published data on thyroid lymphomas was collected and reviewed. A total of 18 Asian and 22 Western studies were included. Most of PTLs were B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). While mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma was the commonest (41.1%) among Asians, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (71.9%) predominated in the Western population. Some rare subtypes of PTL were also identified. Majority of all patients in Asian as well as Western studies presented with early stage (stage I/II) disease. Interestingly, when compared with Asian patients, a larger proportion of patients from the West presented with higher stage (stage III/IV) disease (12.2% vs. 3%). Ultrasonography (USG) and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in addition to histological examination usually by core needle biopsy and in some by open procedures were used for the diagnosis of PTL in both the cohorts. The various ancillary techniques used were immunocytochemistry (ICC), flowcytometry (FC), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and molecular testing. The use of ancillary techniques for PTL diagnosis was more common in the West compared to Asia and markedly increased the sensitivity of cytology to diagnose PTL. Treatment and prognosis largely depend upon the subtype of PTL and stage at presentation. To conclude, from the available published literature, there is an apparent difference between Asian and Western cohorts in the histological type and stage of presentation of PTL, but the results may be affected by publication and selection bias. Also, advanced ancillary techniques are more commonly adopted in the West.

AB  - The sudden emergence of severe respiratory disease, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently become a public health emergency. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed its close resemblance to the earlier reported SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, initial testing of the drugs used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been ineffective in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present study highlights the genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and, compared them with SARS-CoV and MERS viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis of drug target proteins has been performed to gain insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and the development of structure-guided therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and inflammatory signalling are different in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also highlighted possible therapies and their mechanism of action followed by clinical manifestation. Our analysis suggests a minimal variation in the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for a drastic change in the structures of target proteins, which makes available drugs ineffective.

AB  - Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular digestion process that degrades damaged proteins and organelles but the biological roles of autophagy in pathological aspects of oral tissues remain largely unknown. We sought to elucidate the function of autophagy, especially its interplay with apoptosis and oxidative stress, in the oral toxicity induced by exposure to 5 mM sodium fluoride (NaF). Human cementoblasts (HCEM-2) in culture were exposed to 5 mM NaF for 5 min, after which cell viability and cell apoptosis were assessed using the MTS assay and an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to characterize the expression levels of markers for autophagy, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Senescence-resistant (SAMR1) mice were exposed to 5 mM NaF in their drinking water from 12 to 58 weeks. Micro-computed tomography was used to measure changes in their alveolar bone while immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate protein expression levels. HCEM-2 cells exposed to 5 mM NaF had decreased levels of autophagy, as shown by reduced expression levels of ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3-II, elicited apoptosis, which in turn induced oxidative stress and inflammation, as manifested by elevated levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, SOD1 and phospho NF-kappa B. Treatment of mice with 5 mM NaF resulted in histological abnormalities in periodontal tissues, induced excessive oxidative stress and apoptosis, and reduced autophagy. Micro-computed tomography analysis demonstrated that 5 mM NaF caused a decrease in bone areas of mice compared with controls. Exposure to 5 mM NaF induced RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) and cathepsin K expression in periodontal tissues, while ATG5 and Beclin-1 expression was abrogated by 5 mM NaF. Taken together, our findings suggest that 5 mM NaF elicits oral toxicity that contributes to excessive apoptosis, oxidative stress, and defective autophagy, which aggravates periodontal tissue damage.

AB  - The present study is an attempt to investigate the presence of Naegleria fowleri in Indian population. A total of 307 patients were enrolled and water samples were collected from both residential and surrounding areas of patients found positive for N. fowleri. The different species of Naegleria from both clinical and water samples were identified taxonomically. Recommended microbiological conventional techniques were used to identify different Naegleria stages and other free-living amoebae from the samples. PCR assays, using both genus and species specific primers were also optimized. None of the samples were positive by conventional microbiological examinations. However, PCR assays detected only three samples positive for N. fowleri. A total of 10 water bodies (ponds), that were used by Naegleria positive patients were examined. The pH and temperature of the water samples collected from water bodies ranged between 5.6-7.2 and 25-32 degrees C respectively. Among all the 10 water samples tested, four samples were positive for genus Naegleria by PCR assay, of which only two samples, showed positive amplification for N. fowleri. The sequence analysis of N. fowleri strain belonged to genotype II. (C) 2020 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cholesterol embolization syndrome (CES) results from the distal embolization of cholesterol crystals from atheromatous plaques in large vessels such as the aorta and results in multiorgan damage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a patient with definite CES with skin manifestations (e.g., blue toes) and renal and neurological dysfunction, including parenchymal hematoma with cytotoxic and vasogenic edema after he had undergone left carotid artery stenting for symptomatic critical left carotid artery stenosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our patient with CES had cutaneous involvement affecting the lower limbs and renal and neurological involvement. High clinical suspicion and early treatment can reduce the mortality and morbidity after endovascular procedures. The neurological symptoms had most likely resulted from delayed cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome resulting in intracerebral hemorrhage.

AB  - Ambient air pollution, specifically particulate matter of diameter <2.5 mu m, is reportedly associated with cardiovascular disease risk. However, evidence linking particulate matter of diameter <2.5 mu m and blood pressure (BP) is largely from cross-sectional studies and from settings with lower concentrations of particulate matter of diameter <2.5 mu m, with exposures not accounting for myriad time-varying and other factors such as built environment. This study aimed to study the association between long- and short-term ambient particulate matter of diameter <2.5 mu m exposure from a hybrid spatiotemporal model at 1-kmx1-km spatial resolution with longitudinally measured systolic and diastolic BP and incident hypertension in 5342 participants from urban Delhi, India, within an ongoing representative urban adult cohort study. Median annual and monthly exposure at baseline was 92.1 mu g/m(3)(interquartile range, 87.6-95.7) and 82.4 mu g/m(3)(interquartile range, 68.4-107.0), respectively. We observed higher average systolic BP (1.77 mm Hg [95% CI, 0.97-2.56] and 3.33 mm Hg [95% CI, 1.12-5.52]) per interquartile range differences in monthly and annual exposures, respectively, after adjusting for covariates. Additionally, interquartile range differences in long-term exposures of 1, 1.5, and 2 years increased the risk of incident hypertension by 1.53x (95% CI, 1.19-1.96), 1.59x (95% CI, 1.31-1.92), and 1.16x (95% CI, 0.95-1.43), respectively. Observed effects were larger in individuals with higher waist-hip ratios. Our data strongly support a temporal association between high levels of ambient air pollution, higher systolic BP, and incident hypertension. Given that high BP is an important risk factor of cardiovascular disease, reducing ambient air pollution is likely to have meaningful clinical and public health benefits.

AB  - Purpose: To study the morphological changes within mature senile cataracts on modified posterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: A cross-sectional observational study recruiting patients of mature cataracts admitted for elective cataract surgery in tertiary eye care. A modified OCT imaging of the lens was done and lenticular findings were noted by a single observer. Corresponding slit-lamp biomicroscopic findings and intraoperative experiences were also noted by a second observer and respective surgeons. Results: Forty-four eyes of 44 patients were included. The mean age of patients was 65 +/- 5.7 years. The intralenticular findings were uniform in groups of eyes, and they were characterized into three stages. First was a stage of early lamellar separation where small intralenticular clefts were noted superficially. Second was the stage of established lamellar separation where crescentic fluid clefts appeared interspersed between the lens fibers, and the depth increased as a function of severity. Both these stages did not show any distinct slit-lamp or intraoperative findings. A third stage of liquefaction identified as extensive lamellar separation with subcapsular fluid pockets. This was also reflected in slit-lamp biomicroscopy, showing the hydrated cortex with intraoperative challenges. Two cases showed peculiar changes, one of a hyperreflective subcapsular sheath and another of superficial nuclear lamellar separation. Conclusion: Mature cataracts may also show graded progression, which could be delineated on lenticular OCT. This could be of immense help in pre-operative planning and optimal management of these high-risk cases.

AB  - Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) exhibit several advantages over polymeric and non-polymeric systems in terms of improved drug loading, controlled release, stability, and cellular uptake. Herein we report a scalable and stable monolithic lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) consisting of a combination of lipids (solid and liquid) and an amphiphilic copolymer, mPEG-PLA. Clobetasol propionate, a topical corticosteroid, was encapsulated in the hydrophobic core of these LPNs that showed spherical shaped particles with a z-average size of 94.8 nm (PDI = 0.213) and encapsulation efficiency of 84.3%. These dobetasol loaded LPNs (CP/LPNs) were formulated into a topical hydrogel using carbopol 974P. CP/LPNs gel showed a sustained in vitro clobetasol release for 7 days with no burst release and 6 month stability at 2-8 degrees C and room temperature. Further, CP/LPNs showed an improved cellular uptake with significant growth inhibition of HaCaT cells. In ex vivo studies, these LPNs penetrated into the viable epidermis and dermis region of the psoriatic skin with undetectable quantities leaching to the reservoir. Further, the topical application of CP/LPNs gel on Swiss albino mice with psoriasis-like inflammation showed negligible leaching of clobetasol into the systemic circulation. Efficacy assessment showed significantly improved PASI score, reduced skin damage and proliferation after treatment with CP/LPNs gel as compared to marketed product (Clobetamos (TM)). Collectively, the enhanced cellular uptake, high skin penetration with increased skin retention, and improved efficacy demonstrate the potential of these LPNs for future clinical application.

AB  - Context. The International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care developed a consensus-based definition of palliative care (PC) that focuses on the relief of serious health-related suffering, a concept put forward by the Lancet Commission Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief.
   Objective. The main objective of this article is to present the research behind the new definition.
   Methods. The three-phased consensus process involved health care workers from countries in all income levels. In Phase 1, 38 PC experts evaluated the components of the World Health Organization definition and suggested new/revised ones. In Phase 2, 412 International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care members in 88 countries expressed their level of agreement with the suggested components. In Phase 3, using results from Phase 2, the expert panel developed the definition.
   Results. The consensus-based definition is as follows: Palliative care is the active holistic care of individuals across all ages with serious health-related suffering due to severe illness and especially of those near the end of life. It aims to improve the quality of life of patients, their families and their caregivers. The definition includes a number of bullet points with additional details as well as recommendations for governments to reduce barriers to PC.
   Conclusion. Participants had significantly different perceptions and interpretations of PC. The greatest challenge faced by the core group was trying to find a middle ground between those who think that PC is the relief of all suffering and those who believe that PC describes the care of those with a very limited remaining life span.

AB  - Therapeutic artefacts are a challenge for forensic pathologists for correct interpretation at autopsy. A 23-year-old female was found unconscious at home and immediately admitted to an emergency of a tertiary care hospital where resuscitative measures were taken. However, she died after 4 h of hospitalization. The injuries (abrasions, subcutaneous bruising and haemorrhage in the deep structures of the neck) discovered at autopsy simulated the findings of throttling and aroused the suspicion of homicide. Later, enquiry revealed that it happened due to malpositioned central line in the carotid artery during internal jugular vein access to provide fluid as the patient was in shock due to aluminium phosphide (Celphos)poisoning. The bleeding diatheses in Celphos poisoning might have precipitated the extensive neck haemorrhage in this case.

AB  - Objective: Newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are expected to have less adverse effects (AEs) and drug interactions as compared to conventional AEDs but the high cost is the major limitation for their use. This study evaluated variation in the cost of treatment with newer and conventional AEDs through its correlation with treatment efficacy and AEs in persons with epilepsy (PWE).
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included PWE (28.9 +/- 9.9 years) having focal and generalized seizures on conventional [valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin] or newer AEDs [levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine] for >6 months. Seizure frequency during the study (6 months) was compared to that within 6 months before the study. Other parameters assessed were Quality of life in epilepsy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Gastrointestinal Quality of life Index, and Liverpool AEs Profile. The cost of treatment was determined as direct, indirect, and intangible costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis was also performed.
   Results: Out of 214 PWE, 51.4% were on newer AEDs. Newer and conventional AEDs did not differ significantly in seizure frequency reduction (60.29 vs. 53.09%), quality of life parameters, though these were improved significantly during the study period. The direct medical cost and total cost of treatment were lesser with conventional AEDs (p < 0.001 in both) than newer AEDs, but the intangible cost did not differ. The total cost of treatment was significantly influenced by factors (as per regression analysis) including the type of AEDs (significant difference between valproate, carbamazepine, and levetiracetam), frequency of seizures, cost of medicine (70.34% of total cost), hospital admission, and treatment of AEs. As per ICER, newer AEDs need an additional USD 8.39 per unit reduction in seizure frequency.
   Conclusion: Newer AEDs have comparatively better efficacy, though not significant than conventional AEDs. However, the additional cost per unit improvement is quite high with newer AEDs, necessitating pharmacoeconomic consideration in epilepsy treatment.

AB  - Osteoblastoma is a rare nonfibroblastic osteoid tissue-forming primary bony tumor usually arising in the medullary cavity/diploic space of any bone. The calvarium is an extremely rare site of its origin. Clinically, 2 types of osteoblastoma are noted: benign/conventional/typical and aggressive/high grade. Their imaging features are nondifferentiating and nonspecific, histopathologic features have a few subtle but nonspecific differences, and they have highly distinct clinical behavior. We report an extremely rare case of a patient with large aggressive cranial osteoblastoma, who developed massive inoperable multifocal recurrence 15 months after total en bloc resection with wide margins. A concise review of cases of aggressive osteoblastomas involving the cranium available in the English literature is also presented as an update.

KW  - RISK
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Both transient elastography (TE)-based and non-TE-based criteria exist for detection of varices needing treatment (VNT) in patients with asymptomatic advanced chronic liver disease (CLD). However, their performance in clinical settings at different risk thresholds of detection of VNT and in regions where elastography is not widely available is unknown. We aimed to validate existing noninvasive criteria in our patients with CLD and identify best TE- and non-TE-based criteria for VNT screening at usual risk thresholds.
   METHODS: Patients with compensated advanced CLD (cACLD) who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and TE within 3 months were included. Diagnostic performance of Baveno VI, expanded Baveno VI, platelet-model for end-stage liver disease, and platelet-albumin (Rete Sicilia Selezione Terapia-hepatitis C virus) criteria were estimated. Decision curve analysis was conducted for different predictors across range of threshold probabilities. A repeat analysis including all patients with compensated CLD (cACLD and non-cACLD) was performed to simulate absence of TE.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,657 patients (cACLD, 895; non-cACLD, 762) related to hepatitis B virus (38.2%), hepatitis C virus (33.4%), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (14.7%), and alcohol (11.8%) were included. Baveno VI identified maximum VNT (97.3%) and had best negative predictive value (96.9%), followed by platelet-albumin criteria. Expanded Baveno VI and platelet-model for end-stage liver disease had intermediate performance. At threshold probability of 5%, Baveno VI criteria showed maximum net benefit, and platelet-albumin criteria was next best, with need for 95 additional elastographies to detect 1 additional VNT. Similar results were obtained on including all patients with compensated CLD irrespective of TE.
   DISCUSSION: Baveno VI criteria maximizes VNT yield at 5% threshold probability. An acceptable alternative is the platelet-albumin criteria in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected all aspects of society, including mental and physical health. Often missed is the fact that the pandemic is occurring against the backdrop of a very high prevalence of mental health issues. Protecting the mental health of people and healthcare workers is important for long-term positive health outcomes and proper control of the outbreak.
   Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey by convenience sampling. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review committee of Nepal Health Research Council (reference no. 2467). Open access, pre-validated questionnaires were used. Participants with significantly poor Mental wellbeing were identified using the WHO well-being index threshold score. Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out.
   Results: Five hundred and fifty-six participants were included in the analysis. Forty percent of the participants reported a WHO well-being index score of below 13, indicative of poor mental wellbeing and a need for further assessment for depression. Poor Mental wellbeing was more prevalent among participants less than 30 years of age, female gender, never married, diagnosed mental disorder, living alone and those using informal sources for COVID-19 related information. More participants with lower sleep quality score and higher perceived stress score reported poor Mental wellbeing.
   Conclusions: Combating this challenge requires integration across disciplines. One potential part of the solution is psychological intervention teams. An emerging positive connotation to the pandemic is that it needs to be harnessed as a tool for improving health facilities, community participation, and fighting misinformation.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the visual outcomes of bilateral implantation of a new hydrophobic foldable extended depth of focus (EDOF) IOL. Methods: All cases undergoing phacoemulsification with bilateral implantation of Supraphob Infocus IOL between December 2017 and July 2018 at a tertiary eye care center were recruited in this prospective interventional study. The primary outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UIVA), and uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA). Postoperative follow-up was done on day 1, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Results: One hundred and four eyes of 52 patients with a mean age of 58.4 +/- 9.3 years were included. The mean UDVA improved from 0.84 +/- 0.32 logMAR preoperatively to 0.11 +/- 0.08 logMAR at 3 months following surgery. At the final follow-up, the binocular UDVA, UIVA, and UNVA was 0.03 +/- 0.07, 0.14 +/- 0.06, and 0.36 +/- 0.05 logMAR, respectively. The mean CS was 1.47 +/- 0.06 logCS. The distance and near stereopsis was 90.2 +/- 24.8 s of arc (arcsec) and 62.5 +/- 19.4 arcsec, respectively. The mean total higher-order aberration (HOA), point spread function, and modulation transfer function were 0.30 +/- 0.13, 0.07 +/- 0.08, and 0.26 +/- 0.07, respectively. Conclusion: The Supraphob Infocus EDOF IOL provides good unaided visual acuity for distance, intermediate, and near along with a high quality of vision as assessed by contrast sensitivity, HOAs, and stereoacuity. It may be a potential alternative to the currently available EDOF IOLs in providing good visual acuity at variable distances.

TI  - Efficacy of Ketogenic Diet, Modified Atkins Diet, and Low Glycemic Index Therapy Diet Among Children With Drug-Resistant Epilepsy: A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
KW  - INSIGHTS
AB  - Key PointsQuestionAre the modified Atkins diet and low glycemic index therapy diet noninferior to the ketogenic diet with regard to seizure reduction at 24 weeks among children aged 1 to 15 years with drug-resistant epilepsy? FindingsIn this randomized clinical trial of 158 children with drug-resistant epilepsy, the median reduction in seizure burden was similar between the ketogenic diet, modified Atkins diet, and low glycemic index therapy diet, although the noninferiority of the modified Atkins diet and low glycemic index therapy diet was not proven. The adverse events were least with the low glycemic index therapy diet, and 1 adverse event may be avoided for every 4.3 children treated with the low glycemic index therapy diet compared with a ketogenic diet. MeaningThe findings of this trial indicate that guidelines should support the use of the ketogenic, modified Atkins, and low glycemic index therapy diets for management of drug-resistant epilepsy; each dietary therapy should be discussed with caregivers in terms of the benefit in reducing seizure burden and the risk of adverse events.
   ImportanceThe ketogenic diet (KD) has been used successfully to treat children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Data assessing the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet (MAD) and low glycemic index therapy (LGIT) diet compared with the KD are scarce. ObjectiveTo determine whether the MAD and LGIT diet are noninferior to the KD among children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsOne hundred seventy children aged between 1 and 15 years who had 4 or more seizures per month, had not responded to 2 or more antiseizure drugs, and had not been treated previously with the KD, MAD, or LGIT diet were enrolled between April 1, 2016, and August 20, 2017, at a tertiary care referral center in India. ExposuresChildren were randomly assigned to receive the KD, MAD, or LGIT diet as additions to ongoing therapy with antiseizure drugs. Main Outcomes and MeasuresPrimary outcome was percentage change in seizure frequency after 24 weeks of dietary therapy in the MAD cohort compared with the KD cohort and in the LGIT diet cohort compared with the KD cohort. The trial was powered to assess noninferiority of the MAD and LGIT diet compared with the KD with a predefined, noninferiority margin of -15 percentage points. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. ResultsOne hundred fifty-eight children completed the trial: KD (n=52), MAD (n=52), and LGIT diet (n=54). Intention-to-treat analysis showed that, after 24 weeks of intervention, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) change in seizure frequency (KD: -66%; IQR, -85% to -38%; MAD: -45%; IQR, -91% to -7%; and LGIT diet: -54%; IQR, -92% to -19%) was similar among the 3 arms (P=.39). The median difference, per intention-to-treat analysis, in seizure reduction between the KD and MAD arms was -21 percentage points (95% CI, -29 to -3 percentage points) and between the KD and LGIT arms was -12 percentage points (95% CI, -21 to 7 percentage points), with both breaching the noninferiority margin of -15 percentage points. Treatment-related adverse events were similar between the KD (31 of 55 [56.4%]) and MAD (33 of 58 [56.9%]) arms but were significantly less in the LGIT diet arm (19 of 57 [33.3%]). Conclusions and RelevanceNeither the MAD nor the LGIT diet met the noninferiority criteria. However, the results of this study for the LGIT diet showed a balance between seizure reduction and relatively fewer adverse events compared with the KD and MAD. These potential benefits suggest that the risk-benefit decision with regard to the 3 diet interventions needs to be individualized. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02708030
   This randomized clincal trial assesses whether addition of either the modified Atkins diet or low glycemic index therapy diet to ongoing antiseizure drug therapy was noninferior to the ketogenic diet with regard to seizure reduction at 24 weeks among children aged 1 to 15 years with drug-resistant epilepsy.

AB  - Background Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is increasing across the world. However, information from India is sparse. This multicentre study evaluated the demographics, clinical phenotype and outcome of PIBD from India. Methods Data of children (<= 18 years) with PIBD were collected using a proforma containing details of demographics, clinical profile, extraintestinal manifestations (EIM), investigations, disease extent and treatment. Results Three hundred twenty-five children [Crohn's disease: 65.2%, ulcerative colitis: 28.0%, IBD unclassified (IBDU): 6.7%, median age at diagnosis: 11 (interquartile range 6.3) years] were enrolled. 6.9% children had family history of IBD. Pancolitis (E4) was predominant in ulcerative colitis (57.8%) and ileocolonic (L3, 55.7%) in Crohn's disease. Perianal disease was present in 10.9% and growth failure in 20.9% of Crohn's disease cases. Steroids were the initial therapy in 84.2%, 5-amino salicylic acid in 67.3% and exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in 1.3% cases. Overall, immunomodulators and biologics were given to 84.3 and 17.9% cases, respectively, and 2.9% cases underwent surgery. Very early onset IBD (VEOIBD) was seen in 60 (19.2%) children. IBDU was commoner in the VEOIBD than the older-PIBD (18/60 vs 4/253;P< 0.001). VEOIBD-Crohn's disease patients more often had isolated colonic disease than the older Crohn's disease (45.4% vs 11.8%;P< 0.001). Prevalence of perianal disease, EIM, therapeutic requirements and outcome were not different between VEOIBD and older-PIBD. Conclusion Disease location and phenotype of PIBD in Indian children is similar to the children from the west. However, the therapeutic options of EEN, biologics and surgery are underutilized. VEOIBD accounted for 19.2% of PIBD.

AB  - Entomophthoromycosis is a rare fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue occurring predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions. In children, it mostly affects the lower half of the body. With this, we report a case of Entomophthoromycosis in a 6-year-old girl who presented late with extensive involvement of the upper half of the body. She responded well to treatment with potassium iodide and itraconazole. We also reviewed cases of Entomophthoromycosis reported in children.

AB  - Purpose: To estimate the prevalence and determine risk factors for dry eye disease (DED) in geographically diverse regions of India.
   Method: A population based cross-sectional study was conducted on people aged >= 40 years in plain, hilly and coastal areas. Dry eye assessment by objective [tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer I, corneal staining] and subjective [Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)] parameters was performed with questionnaire-based assessment of exposure to sunlight, cigarette smoke, indoor smoke. The prevalence of DED with age, sex, occupation, location, smoking, exposure to sunlight, indoor smoke, diabetes, hypertension, was subjected to logistic regression analysis.
   Results: 9,735 people (age 54.5 +/- 0.1 years; range 40-99, males 45.5%) were included. The prevalence of DED was 26.2%, was higher in plains (41.3%) compared to hilly (24.0%) and coastal area (9.9%) (p < 0.001) and increased with age (p < 0.001), female gender (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.001), indoor smoke (p < 0.001), diabetes (p-0.02), hypertension (0.001), occupations with predominant outdoor activity (p-0.013) and increasing exposure to sunlight (trend). Multi-logistic regression showed a positive association with female sex (OR-1.2, CI-1.01, 1.4), exposure to indoor smoke (OR-1.3, CI-1.1, 1.5), smoking (OR-1.2; CI-1.03, 1.3), prolonged exposure to sunlight (OR-1.8, CI-1.5, 2.2), hypertension (OR 1.3, CI-1.2, 1.4), diabetes (OR-1.2, CI-1, 1.5) and negative association with region hilly (OR-0.5, CI-0.4, 0.6) and coastal (OR-0.2; CI-0.1, 0.2), and BMI (OR-0.8, CI-0.7, 0.9).
   Conclusion: DED is common in population >= 40 years of age. Its prevalence is affected by extrinsic (geographic location, exposure to sunlight, smoking, indoor smoke) and intrinsic (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, BMI) factors.

AB  - Epilepsy, a neurological disease characterized by recurrent seizures, is highly heterogeneous in nature. Based on the prevalence, epilepsy is classified into two types: common and rare epilepsies. Common epilepsies affecting nearly 95% people with epilepsy, comprise generalized epilepsy which encompass idiopathic generalized epilepsy like childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizure on awakening and focal epilepsy like temporal lobe epilepsy and cryptogenic focal epilepsy. In 70% of the epilepsy cases, genetic factors are responsible either as single genetic variant in rare epilepsies or multiple genetic variants acting along with different environmental factors as in common epilepsies. Genetic testing and precision treatment have been developed for a few rare epilepsies and is lacking for common epilepsies due to their complex nature of inheritance. Precision medicine for common epilepsies require a panoramic approach that incorporates polygenic background and other non-genetic factors like microbiome, diet, age at disease onset, optimal time for treatment and other lifestyle factors which influence seizure threshold. This review aims to comprehensively present a state-of-art review of all the genes and their genetic variants that are associated with all common epilepsy subtypes. It also encompasses the basis of these genes in the epileptogenesis. Here, we discussed the current status of the common epilepsy genetics and address the clinical application so far on evidence-based markers in prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment management. In addition, we assessed the diagnostic predictability of a few genetic markers used for disease risk prediction in individuals. A combination of deeper endo-phenotyping including pharmaco-response data, electro-clinical imaging, and other clinical measurements along with genetics may be used to diagnose common epilepsies and this marks a step ahead in precision medicine in common epilepsies management.

AB  - Purpose: Enrolling traumatic brain injury (731) patients with an inability to provide informed consent in research is challenging. Alternatives to patient consent are not sufficiently embedded in European and national legislation, which allows procedural variation and bias. We aimed to quantify variations in informed consent policy and practice.
   Methods: Variation was explored in the CENTER-TBI study. Policies were reported by using a questionnaire and national legislation. Data on used informed consent procedures were available for 4498 patients from 57 centres across 17 European countries.
   Results: Variation in the use of informed consent procedures was found between and within EU member states. Proxy informed consent (N = 1377;64%) was the most frequently used type of consent in the ICU, followed by patient informed consent (N 426;20%) and deferred consent (N 334;16%). Deferred consent was only actively used in 15 centres (26%), although it was considered valid in 47 centres (82%).
   Conclusions: Alternatives to patient consent are essential for TBI research. While there seems to be concordance amongst national legislations, there is regional variability in institutional practices with respect to the use of different informed consent procedures. Variation could be caused by several reasons, including inconsistencies in clear legislation or knowledge of such legislation amongst researchers. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Enhanced spontaneous GABA(A)receptor activity is associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex. Clinical manifestations in FCD vary with age at epilepsy onset with a more favorable prognosis in patients with late-onset (LO) compared to that in cases with early-onset (EO). This study was designed to test the hypothesis in FCD that spontaneous GABA(A)receptor-mediated epileptogenicity depends on the age at epilepsy onset and varies between patients with early and late-onset age in FCD. To this end, brain specimens were obtained from the maximal spiking region (MAX) and minimal spiking region (MIN) of the epileptic foci of EO (n= 14, mean age = 10.6 +/- 2.9 years) and LO (n= 10, mean age = 27 +/- 5.6 years) patients undergoing electrocorticography (ECoG) guided surgery. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record spontaneous GABAergic currents from normal-looking pyramidal neurons in slice preparations of resected brain samples. We detected higher frequency and amplitude of GABAergic events in MAX samples compared to MIN samples of LO patients, while they were comparable in MIN and MAX samples of EO patients. Further GABAergic activity in the MIN and MAX samples of EO patients was higher than the MIN samples of LO patients. This suggests that in LO patients, GABA(A)receptor-mediated epileptogenicity is confined only to the high spiking areas, but in EO patients, it affects low spiking regions as well.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy of noncultured hair follicle cell suspension and noncultured epidermal cell suspension in repigmentation of leukotrichia and skin patch in vitiligo: a randomized trial

AB  - Background Vitiligo manifests as hypo- to de-pigmented macules, which are sometimes associated with leukotrichia. For complete cosmetic improvement, the repigmentation of leukotrichia is an important component. Methods This randomized controlled trial included patients with stable vitiligo with leukotrichia. Two vitiligo patches in each patient were randomized to receive either of the two procedures. The patients were followed up for 9 months posttransplantation. The efficacy of hair follicle cell suspension (HFCS) with epidermal cell suspension (ECS) in repigmentation of leukotrichia and skin in vitiligo was compared. Results A total of 20 patients underwent the procedure, and 19 completed the follow-up. The area of the vitiligo patch and the number of leukotrichia in the patches were comparable between the two groups. There was a significant difference in the mean +/- S.D. number of cells transplanted between the two groups (5.06 x 10(5)in HFCS vs. 39.8 x 10(5)in ECS,P < 0.0001). The percentage viability of cells and proportion of melanocytes were comparable between the two groups. A total of 10 patients in HFCS and eight patients in ECS had repigmentation of leukotrichia. The mean +/- S.D. percentages of depigmented hair showing repigmentation at nine months were 7.42 +/- 11.62% in HFCS and 11.42 +/- 17.90% in ECS (P = 0.4195), whereas the mean +/- S.D. percentage repigmentation of vitiligo patches was 61.58 +/- 42.68% in HFCS and 78.68 +/- 30.03% in ECS (P = 0.1618). Conclusions The mean number of cells transplanted in the HFCS group was about eight times less than those in ECS. ECS was better than HFCS in repigmentation of leukotrichia and vitiligo, although the difference was not statistically significant.

AB  - Worldwide, millions of individuals have been affected by the prevailing SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a robust immune system remains indispensable, as an immunocompromised host status has proven to be fatal. In the absence of any specific antiviral drug/vaccine, COVID-19 related drug repurposing along with various other non-pharmacological measures coupled with lockdown have been employed to combat this infection. In this context, a plant based rich fiber diet, which happens to be consumed by a majority of the Indian population, appears to be advantageous, as it replenishes the host gut microbiota with beneficial microbes thereby leading to a symbiotic association conferring various health benefits to the host including enhanced immunity. Further, implementation of the lockdown which has proven to be a good non-pharmacological measure, seems to have resulted in consumption of home cooked healthy diet, thereby enriching the beneficial microflora in the gut, which might have resulted in better prognosis of COVID-19 patients in India in comparison to that observed in the western countries.

AB  - Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by loss-of-function variants inCREBBPorEP300. Affected individuals present with distinctive craniofacial features, broad thumbs and/or halluces, and intellectual disability. RSTS phenotype has been well characterized in individuals of European descent but not in other populations. In this study, individuals from diverse populations with RSTS were assessed by clinical examination and facial analysis technology. Clinical data of 38 individuals from 14 different countries were analyzed. The median age was 7 years (age range: 7 months to 47 years), and 63% were females. The most common phenotypic features in all population groups included broad thumbs and/or halluces in 97%, convex nasal ridge in 94%, and arched eyebrows in 92%. Face images of 87 individuals with RSTS (age range: 2 months to 47 years) were collected for evaluation using facial analysis technology. We compared images from 82 individuals with RSTS against 82 age- and sex-matched controls and obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.99 (p < .001), demonstrating excellent discrimination efficacy. The discrimination was, however, poor in the African group (AUC: 0.79;p= .145). Individuals withEP300variants were more effectively discriminated (AUC: 0.95) compared with those withCREBBPvariants (AUC: 0.93). This study shows that clinical examination combined with facial analysis technology may enable earlier and improved diagnosis of RSTS in diverse populations.

AB  - The object-context relationship and valence are two important stimulus attributes that affect visual perception. Although previous studies reveal how these two factors affect visual perception individually, the interplay between valence with congruent or incongruent object-context associations during visual perception is explored scarcely. Further, what is perceived, is affected by the intrinsic state of the brain at the moment of appearance of the stimulus which could be assessed by EEG microstates. Hence, the current study was designed to explore how the pre-stimulus EEG microstate influences the perception of emotional congruent and incongruent stimuli as well as perceptual reversals and stability during an intermittent binocular rivalry. Results revealed the association of specific pre-stimulus microstates with the perception of neutral and negative congruent stimuli as well as perceptual reversals and stability. Electrical neuroimaging of these microstates showed higher activation in the precuneus and middle occipital gyrus preceding the perception of neutral congruent stimuli and lingual gyrus preceding the perception of negative congruent stimuli. Increased source activity in superior temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus was found preceding stability and lower activation in parahippocampal gyrus was observed preceding reversals. Together these results suggest that the pre-stimulus activation of areas involved in visual priming, retrieval, and semantics leads to congruent perception. Pre-stimulus DMN suppression was required for perceptual reversals whereas stability was accompanied by pre-stimulus activation of areas related to the specific nature of the stimulus. Therefore, we propose that in addition to stimulus attributes, the pre-stimulus intrinsic brain activity could be an important determinant of the performance.

AB  - Rationale, aims, and objectives The recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected around 1 560 000 individuals till 10 April 2020, which has resulted in 95 000 deaths globally. While no vaccine or anti-viral drugs for COVID-19 are available, lockdown acts as a protective public health measures to reduce human interaction and lower transmission. The study aims to explore the impact of delayed planning or lack of planning for the lockdown and inadequate implementation of the lockdown, on the transmission rate of COVID-19. Method Epidemiological data on the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 cases as reported by public health authorities were accessed from six countries based on total number of infected cases, namely, United States and Italy (more than 100 000 cases); United Kingdom, and France (50 000-100 000 cases), and India and Russia (6000-10 000 cases). The Bayesian inferential technique was used to observe the changes (three points) in pattern of number of cases on different duration of exposure (in days) in these selected countries 1 month after World Health Organization (WHO) declaration about COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Results On comparing the pattern of transmission rates observed in these six countries at posterior estimated change points, it is found that partial implementation of lockdown (in the United States), delayed planning in lockdown (Russia, United Kingdom, and France), and inadequate implementation of the lockdown (in India and Italy) were responsible to the spread of infections. Conclusions In order to control the spreading of COVID-19, like other national and international laws, lockdown must be implemented and enforced. It is suggested that on-time or adequate implementation of lockdown is a step towards social distancing and to control the spread of this pandemic.

AB  - Background The epidemiology, clinical profile and outcome of paediatric candidemia vary considerably by age, healthcare settings and prevalentCandidaspecies. Despite these differences, few comprehensive studies are undertaken. This nationwide study addresses this knowledge gap. Methods 487 children who contracted ICU-acquired candidemia at 23 Indian tertiary care centres were assessed for 398 variables spanning demography, clinical characteristics, microbiology, treatment and outcome. Results Both neonates (5.0 days; range = 3.0-9.5) and non-neonatal children (7.0 days; range = 3.0-13.0) developed candidemia early after ICU admission. Majority of neonates were premature (63.7%) with low birthweight (57.1%). Perinatal asphyxia (7.3%), pneumonia (8.2%), congenital heart disease (8.4%) and invasive procedures were common comorbidities, and antibiotic use (94.1%) was widespread.C tropicalis(24.7%) andC albicans(20.7%) dominated both age groups. Antifungal treatment (66.5%) and removal of central catheters (44.8%) lagged behind. Overall resistance was low; however, emergence of resistantC kruseiandC aurisneeds attention. The 30-day crude mortality was 27.8% (neonates) and 29.4% (non-neonates). Logistic regression identified admission to public sector ICUs (OR = 5.64), mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.82), corticosteroid therapy (OR = 8.89) and antifungal therapy (OR = 0.22) as independent predictors of 30-day crude mortality in neonates. Similarly, admission to public sector ICUs (OR = 3.62), mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.13), exposure to carbapenems (OR = 2.18) and azole antifungal therapy (OR = 0.48) were independent predictors for non-neonates. Conclusions Our findings reveal a distinct epidemiology, including early infection with a different spectrum ofCandidaspecies, calling for appropriate intervention strategies to reduce candidemia morbidity and mortality. Independent factors identified in our regression models can help tackle these challenges.

AB  - BackgroundCell therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic interventions for retinitis pigmentosa. In the current study, we aimed to assess if peripheral blood-derived monocytes which are highly abundant and accessible could be utilized as a potential candidate for phenotypic differentiation into neuron-like cells.MethodsThe peripheral blood-derived monocytes were reconditioned phenotypically using extrinsic growth factors to induce pluripotency and proliferation. The reconditioned monocytes (RM) were further incubated with a cocktail of growth factors involved in retinal development and growth to induce retinal neuron-like properties. These cells, termed as retinal neuron-like cells (RNLCs) were characterized for their morphological, molecular and functional behaviour in vitro and in vivo.ResultsThe monocytes de-differentiated in vitro and acquired pluripotency with the expression of prominent stem cell markers. Treatment of RM with retinal growth factors led to an upregulation of neuronal and retinal lineage markers and downregulation of myeloid markers. These cells show morphological alterations resembling retinal neuron-like cells and expressed photoreceptor (PR) markers. The induced RNLCs also exhibited relative membrane potential change upon light exposure suggesting that they have gained some neuronal characteristics. Further studies showed that RNLCs could also integrate in an immune-deficient retinitis pigmentosa mouse model NOD.SCID-rd1 upon sub-retinal transplantation. The RNLCs engrafted in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the RP afflicted retina. Mice transplanted with RNLCs showed improvement in depth perception, exploratory behaviour and the optokinetic response.ConclusionsThis proof-of-concept study demonstrates that reconditioned monocytes can be induced to acquire retinal neuron-like properties through differentiation using a defined growth media and can be a potential candidate for cell therapy-based interventions and disease modelling for ocular diseases.

AB  - A blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(n-hexyl isocyanate-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PHIC-b-P2VP) in a common solvent shows the formation of long-range (micrometer-scale) nanowires of P3HT through hydrophobic interactions between the hexyl arms of P3HT and PHIC in a parallel way, which increase the planarity that leads to the generation of vibration bands with a lower free exciton bandwidth (W = 67 meV) in the solution state, which is further decreased to 9 meV after 48 h annealing of the blend film. The resulting nanowires of the P3HT show a 100-fold increase in current in comparison to pristine P3HT.

AB  - The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 19.7 million persons worldwide with 7 28 013 deaths till August 10, 2020. It has put an unprecedented workload on healthcare systems with special reference to labor rooms and obstetrics as deliveries cannot be stopped or postponed. Preparing their facilities using triage (COVID-positive patients, COVID-suspect patients, and COVID-negative patients) can help to better utilize the limited resources and help in prevention of spread of disease, and improve maternal and perinatal outcome. There is a need for proper training of healthcare providers for judicious use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for optimum outcome. Fortunately, the available literature suggests that there is no substantial increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 in pregnancy or its increased virulence in pregnancy and labor and there are no adverse effects on fetus and neonate with negligible fetal transmission rate. Nevertheless, utmost care is needed to manage such pregnancies, their prenatal care, and labor.

AB  - Aims Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is frequent in the sinonasal region. The recently described human papilloma virus (HPV)-related multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma (HMSC) histopathologically resembles solid AdCC, but has a better outcome. Thus, clinical and pathogenetic differences between HMSC and sinonasal AdCC necessitate their distinction. We conducted this study to assess p16 immunoexpression in previously diagnosed AdCC cases, and to identify HMSC cases in p16 immunopositive cases. Methods and results Cases diagnosed as sinonasal and nasopharyngeal AdCC were retrieved. Histomorphological features were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p16 was performed. HPV testing was performed in p16-positive cases by mRNAin-situhybridisation (mRNA ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.MYBrearrangement was assessed by fluorescencein-situhybridisation. One hundred and two AdCC cases were retrieved. Six cases (5.9%) showed diffuse p16 positivity. HPV mRNA ISH and PCR were negative in p16-positive cases. Two cases showedMYBrearrangement. p16-positive cases were composed of basaloid cells demonstrating a cribriform pattern, at least focally. The predominant pattern was cribriform in three and solid in three cases. One case showed two distinct components: keratinising squamous cell carcinoma and cribriform AdCC. Other morphological patterns seen were tubular, reticular, epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma-like, and glomeruloid, forming a minor component of the tumour area. Conclusions p16 staining alone, even when diffuse and strong, cannot be used as a surrogate for HPV testing to distinguish sinonasal AdCC from HMSC. p16 IHC should be accompanied by more specific methods, such as mRNA ISH, so as not to erroneously diagnose HMSC over sinonasal AdCC, bearing in mind the highly aggressive nature of the latter.

AB  - Background In human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, activation of astrocytes induces imbalance in physiological functions due to perturbed astrocytic functions that unleashes toxicity on neurons. This leads to inflammatory response finally culminating into neurocognitive dysfunction. In neuroAIDS, HIV-1 protein, transactivator of transcription (Tat) is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients. Mortalin, a multifunctional protein, has anti-inflammatory role following its activation in various stress conditions. Recent studies demonstrate downregulation of mortalin in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we explored the mechanisms of mortalin in modulating HIV-1 Tat-mediated neuroinflammation. Methods Expression of mortalin in autopsy section in normal and diseased individuals were examined using immunohistochemistry. To decipher the role of mortalin in HIV-1 Tat-induced activation, human fetal brain-derived astrocytes were transiently transfected with Tat and mortalin using expression vectors. HIV-1 Tat-mediated damage was analyzed using RT-PCR and western blotting. Modulatory role of mortalin was examined by coexpressing it with Tat, followed by examination of mitochondrial morphodynamics using biochemical assay and confocal and electron microscopy. Extracellular ATP release was monitored using luciferase assay. Neuroinflammation in astrocytes was examined using flow cytometry, dye based study, immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting. Indirect neuronal damage was also analyzed. Results HIV-1 Tat downregulates the expression of mortalin in astrocytes, and this is corroborated with autopsy sections of HIV-1 patients. We found that overexpression of mortalin with Tat reduced inflammation and also rescued astrocytic-mediated neuronal death. Using bioinformatics, we discovered that binding of mortalin with Tat leads to Tat degradation and rescues the cell from neuroinflammation. Blocking of proteosomal pathway rescued the Tat degradation and revealed the ubiquitination of Tat. Conclusion Overall, our data demonstrated the protective role of mortalin in combating HIV-1 Tat-mediated damage. We also showed that mortalin could degrade Tat through direct binding with HIV-1 Tat. Overexpression of mortalin in the presence of Tat could significantly reduce cytotoxic effects of Tat in astrocytes. Indirect neuronal death was also found to be rescued. Our in vitro findings were validated as we found attenuated expression of mortalin in the autopsy sections of HIV-1 patients.

AB  - Blood vessel segmentation is a vital step in automated diagnosis of retinal diseases. Some retinal diseases progress with structural changes in the vessels whereas in others, vessels may remain unaffected. Segmentation of vessels is inevitable in both the cases. The extracted vessel map can be studied for these structural changes or can be removed to highlight other abnormalities of the retina. This study presents a rule-based retinal blood vessel segmentation algorithm. It implements two multi-scale approaches, local directional-wavelet transform and global curvelet transform, together in a novel manner for vessel enhancement and thereby segmentation. The authors have proposed a generic field-of-view mask for extraction of region-of-interest. Further, a morphological thickness-correction step, to recover vessel-boundary pixels, is also proposed. The significant contribution of this work is, segmentation of fine vessels while preserving the thickness of major vessels. Moreover, the algorithm is robust, as it performs consistently well, on four public databases, DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB-1 and HRF. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of eight measures : accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-1 score, G-mean, MCC and AUC, where it has outperformed many other existing methods. Zero data dependency gives the suggested algorithm, an edge over other state-of-the-art supervised methods.

AB  - Cavernous sinus meningioma (CSM) with orbital involvement presents a unique challenge to modern-day neurosurgeons. In the modern era of preventive medicine with enhanced screening tools, physicians encounter CSM more frequently. An indolent natural history, late clinical presentation, close proximity to vital neurovascular structures, poor tumor-to-normal tissue interface, and high risk of iatrogenic morbidity and mortality with aggressive resection add to the complexity of decision-making and optimal management of these lesions. The clinical dilemma of deciding whether to observe or intervene first for asymptomatic lesions remains an enigma in current practice. The concepts of management for CSM with orbital involvement have gradually evolved from radical resection to a more conservative surgical approach with maximal safe resection, with the specific goals of preserving function and reducing proptosis. This change in surgical attitude has enabled better long-term functional outcomes with conservative approaches as compared with functionally disabled outcomes resulting from the pursuit of anatomical cure from disease with radical resection. The advent of stereotactic radiosurgery as an adjunct tool to treat residual CSM has greatly shaped our resection principles and planning. Interdisciplinary collaboration for multimodality management is key to successful management of these difficult to treat lesions and tailor management as per individual's requirement.

AB  - The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses particular challenges to the management of persons with chronic disease. Reports of a possible neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 as well as pathophysiological mechanisms and indirect consequences in severe COVID-19 cases raise the question of whether the infection can be associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence or the development of new onset and acute symptomatic seizures. Although the literature does not provide relevant evidence for seizure worsening in persons with epilepsy during the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are theoretical risks, for example, seizures triggered by fever. Moreover, a severe disease course and advanced disease stages can, for instance, result in hypoxic encephalopathy, cerebrovascular events, and cytokine storm, which may trigger the development of acute seizures. This is further confirmed by reports of occasional seizures in COVID-19 patients. Although the low number of reports so far suggests that the risk may be relatively low, the reports indicate that an early neurological manifestation with seizures should not be ruled out. In the context of these cases, we discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms that may trigger ictogenesis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Among the two GroEL paralogs inMycobacterium tuberculosis, GroEL1 and GroEL2, GroEL1 has a characteristic histidine-rich C terminus. Since histidine richness is likely to be involved in metal binding, we attempted to decipher the role of GroEL1 in chelating metals and the consequence onM. tuberculosisphysiology. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that GroEL1 binds copper and other metals. Mycobacterial viability assay, redox balance, and DNA protection assay concluded that GroEL1 protects from copper stressin vitro. Solution X-ray scattering and constrained modeling of GroEL1 -/+ copper ions showed reorientation of the apical domain as seen in functional assembly. We conclude that the duplication of chaperonin genes inM. tuberculosismight have led to their evolutionary divergence and consequent functional divergence of chaperonins.

AB  - Objectives In this study, we aimed to determine the consequences of different amounts of leukocyte transfusion on the outcome of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Design This was a prospective, single-blinded cohort study conducted for 1 year from July 2018 to June 2019. Setting The study setting was the Department of Transfusion Medicine, along with Cardiac Anaesthesia, Cardiac Surgery and Cardiac biochemistry departments in a tertiary care cardiac centre. Participants A total of 150 patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the study period were divided into three groups (50 in each): Leukofiltered (LR), Buffy coat depleted (BCD) and Non-leukoreduced (NLR). Intervention The intervention was intra- and postoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) having different amounts of leukocytes. Measurements and main results Patient details about length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, blood usage, inotropic drug duration, mechanical ventilation, urine output and infection were recorded from the patient data sheet, whereas patients were followed up for 30 days post-operation, and any mortality was noted. Haematological parameters and biochemical parameters for renal function test were analysed on pre- and post-surgical days 1, 3, 5 and 7, whereas on postoperative days 1 and 7, cytokine-like FAS ligands, Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) were tested. Patients in all three groups received an average of four, two and two units of packed red blood cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma, respectively. There was a statistically significant (P < .05) rise in total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in all three groups from day 0 to day 3, but it reduced to preoperative level on day 5. There was shorter ICU and hospital stay in the LR group of patients (46 +/- 19.9 hours and 7.5 +/- 2.4 days) compared to NLR (52.1 +/- 24.2 hours and 7.9 +/- 4.1 days) and BCD (53.3 +/- 26.7 hours and 8.8 +/- 3.1 days) group of patients, but it was statistically non-significant. The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly lesser in LR group patients (10.2 +/- 6.2 hours) as compared to NLR group (14.7 +/- 12.7 hours). On risk ratio calculation of developing postoperative kidney injury, the NLR group had 1.3 and 2.6 times more risk compared to the BCD and LR groups, respectively. On postoperative days 1 and 7, FAS-L levels significantly increased in all three group of patients, whereas IL-10 increased in the NLR and BCD groups and decreased in the LR group non-significantly. The INF-gamma levels decreased on day 1 in the NLR and BCD groups but increased in the LR group, but it was inversed on day 7. Conclusion Depletion of leukocytes decreased Transfusion Related Immunomodulation (TRIM) effects in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but this also depends on the degree of leukoreduction. As found in our study, leukofiltration is more effective compared to buffy-coat depletion only.

AB  - All mRNAs cannot be translated into full-length proteins due to ribosome-stalling that leads to release of peptidyl-tRNA which can be lethal for bacterial survival. The enzyme peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (PtH) hydrolyses the ester bond between nascent peptide and tRNA of peptidyl-tRNA and rescues the cells from toxicity. PtH is an essential enzyme in bacteria and inhibiting this crucial enzyme can serve to combat bacterial diseases. But due to lack of understanding about the catalytic mechanism of PtH, its inhibitors have not been developed. In this work, we have carried out the binding studies of M. tuberculosis and E. coli PtH with the peptidyl-tRNA analogue (puromycin) using ITC, FTIR, CD experiments followed by docking and MD simulations to identify the potential active site residues that would help to design PtH inhibitors. Binding studies of puromycin with both PtH by ITC experiments demonstrate similar thermodynamic parameters and three fold difference in their KD. CD and FTIR studies detected changes in secondary structure composition of PtH in the presence of puromycin with different degree of perturbation. Though interactions with puromycin are conserved in both proteins, modelling studies revealed that water mediated interactions in M. tb-PtH resulting in higher affinity to puromycin.

AB  - Drug repurposing is an efficient alternative approach to counter the increasing drug-resistant pathogens to treat infectious diseases. FtsZ is an essential bacterial cytokinesis protein involved in the formation of cell-division complex and targeting FtsZ using FDA approved drugs is a promising strategy to identify and develop a new antibacterial drug. Using in silico pharmacophore-based screening of drug bank, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we identified six drugs inhibiting the function of stFtsZ from Salmonella Typhi. The selected drugs target stFtsZ at the hydrophobic cleft formed between the C-terminal domain and helixa alpha 7 with binding energy better -8 kcal/mol. Out of these six drugs, benzethonium chloride showed promising results at 8 NM concentration where it inhibits stFtsZ GTPase activity by 80% and prevents polymerization. Benzethonium chloride also possesses an excellent antibacterial activity against the bacterial culture of Salmonella Typhi (ATCC 19430), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) with the MIC values of 8 Ng/mL, 1 Ng/mL and 12 Ng/mL, respectively. Based on our current study, the scaffold of benzethonium chloride can be used for the development of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents against drug-resistant pathogens. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pharmacological strategies aimed at co-activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway have shown promising results in alleviating myocardial injury. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of chrysin, a PPAR-gamma agonist, in ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats and to explore the molecular mechanism driving this activity. To evaluate this hypothesis, chrysin (60 mg/kg, orally), PPAR-gamma antagonist (GW9662, 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), or both were administered to rats for 28 days. On the 29th day, one-stage ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 min followed by 60 min of reperfusion was performed. Chrysin significantly decreased infarct size and improved cardiac functions following IR-induced MI. This improvement was corroborated by augmented PPAR-gamma/Nrf2 expression as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis. Chrysin exhibited strong anti-oxidant property as demonstrated by increased GSH and CAT levels and decreased 8-OHdG and TBARS levels. Our findings also imply that chrysin significantly inhibited inflammatory response as validated by decreased NF-kappa B, IKK-beta, CRP, TNE-alpha and MPO levels. In addition, chrysin decreased TUNEL/DAPI positivity, a marker of apoptotic response and normalized cardiac injury markers. The histopathological and ultrastructural analysis further supported the functional and biochemical outcomes, showing preserved myocardial architecture. Intriguingly, co-administration with GW9662 significantly diminished the cardioprotective effect of chrysin as demonstrated by depressed myocardial function, decreased PPAR-gamma/Nrf2 expression and increased oxidative stress. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that co-activation of PPAR-gamma/Nrf2 by chrysin may be crucial for its cardioprotective effect.

AB  - Th17 cells play vital role during pathogenesis of leprosy reactions. Previously, we have reported that IL-23 is involved in Th17 cells differentiation. Subsequently, our group also showed that IL-6 induces Th17 cell differentiation along with TGF-beta in leprosy reactions. Here, we next asked the question that whether IL-6 or IL-23 induced Th17 cells are different in nature? In this study, Type 1 Reactions (T1R) showed significantly (p<0.001) higher percentage of IL-17A producing CD4(+)IL6R(+) T cells as compared to non-reaction (NR) patients. Furthermore, recombinant IL-6, IL-23 and TGF-<beta> promoted IL-17A secretion by CD4(+)IL6R(+) T cells. Subsequently, IL-6R and IL-23R blocking experiments showed significantly (p<0.002) down regulated IL-17A in T1R reaction as compared to NR leprosy patients. The present study for the first time establishes that pathogenic Th17 cells produce IL-17 in an IL-6 dependent manner in leprosy T1R reactions. Thus, present approaches that specifically target Th17 cells and/or the cytokines that promote their development, such as IL-6, TGF-<beta> and IL-23A may provide more focused treatment strategies for the management of Mycobacterium leprae and its reactions.

AB  - Background Malnutrition is a common clinical concern among children in low-income communities affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We examined the effect of a community-based nutritional intervention on anthropometric and clinical outcomes of children of women living with HIV in rural India.
   Methods We assigned women living with HIV and their child (oldest 3-8 years) to 1 of 4 programs: (1) community-based HIV care program, (2) program 1 + nutrition education, (3) program 1 + food supplement, and (4) all elements of programs 1-3. Study data were collected at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18. We applied mixed-effects modeling with restricted maximum likelihood estimation to examine changes in weight (all children) and CD4(+) T-cell counts (children with HIV only).
   Results Overall, 600 mother-child pairs were enrolled (150/group) with 100% retention at follow-up visits. Approximately 20% of children were living with HIV. Children in program 4 had higher weight gain than those in programs 1, 2, and 3 at all time points (adjusted P < .001). We found a higher increase in CD4(+) T cells across all time points among participants in programs 3 and 4 compared with program 1 (adjusted P < .001). Factorial analysis suggested a synergistic effect of combining nutrition education and food supplements for weight gain but not for increase in CD4(+) T cells.
   Conclusions A combination of nutrition education and food supplements provided to women living with HIV significantly increased weight and CD4(+) T cells, and such interventions can be integrated into HIV-care programs in low-income settings.
   A combination of nutrition education and food supplements delivered by community healthcare workers to women living with HIV significantly increased body weight of their dependent child regardless of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection status, and CD4(+) T-cell counts among their children living with HIV.

AB  - This paper presents a low-cost wireless gait event detection system that incorporates infra-red range sensors mounted laterally at a specific anatomical location on the shoe. This system uses foot clearance information to extract heel strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events. A subject-specific algorithm based on signature curve matching was developed to estimate the HS and TO in six able-bodied subjects and three transfemoral amputees. The data were acquired in a real-life environment while the subject walked on level ground and ramp terrains, including the transitions. The HS and TO in the level ground were detected with an accuracy of 22.87 +/- 9.93 ms and 10.42 +/- 6.70 ms, respectively, in able-bodied participants. The accuracy of 37.91 +/- 12.36 ms and 20.41 +/- 11.23 ms in HS and TO, respectively, was observed in amputees during level ground walking. Further, within the ramp terrain, the HS and TO were detected with an accuracy of 23.33 +/- 11.20 ms and 13.36 +/- 9.5 ms respectively in able-bodied subjects and 40.35 +/- 12.64 ms and 47.51 +/- 19.23 ms in amputees. This method reports comparable accuracy, with minimal standard deviation, to other existing methods based on accelerometer, gyroscope, electromyography, and force myography. This system is robust, easy to operate, and avoids direct contact with the body. The developed system offers a movable sensor platform in two degrees of freedom that facilitates the adaptability of the proposed system for different heel height and shoe sizes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on various aspects of cytology practice in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to cytopathology laboratories in 24 Asia-Pacific countries to explore the impact of restrictive measures on access to health care, use of general and personal protective equipment (PPE), and changes in cytology workflow and workload from February to April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 167 cytopathology laboratories from 24 countries responded to the survey: the majority reported that restrictive measures that limited the accessibility of health care services had been implemented in their cities and/or countries (80.8%) and their hospitals (83.8%). The respondents noted that COVID-19 had an impact on the cytologic workflow as well as the workload. Approximately one-half of the participants reported the implementation of new biosafety protocols (54.5%) as well as improvements in laboratory facilities (47.3%). Rearrangement or redeployment of the workforce was reported in 53.3% and 34.1% of laboratories, respectively. The majority of the respondents reported a significant reduction (>10%) in caseload associated with both gynecological (82.0%) and nongynecological specimens (78.4%). Most laboratories reported no significant change in the malignancy rates of both gynecological (67.7%) and nongynecological specimens (58.7%) compared with the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the survey demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cytology specimens examined along with the need to implement new biosafety protocols. These findings underscore the need for the worldwide standardization of biosafety protocols and cytology practice. (C) 2020 American Cancer Society.

AB  - Background:Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticle (PLGA-NP) trafficking across cell membranes was investigated to confirm preliminary results that contradicted existing studies.Materials & methods:Uptake and retention of PLGA-NPs at 37 and 4 degrees C in the presence and absence of metabolic inhibitors in various cell lines was estimated.Results:Pulse experiments with metabolic inhibitors and culturing at 4 degrees C demonstrated the predominantly passive nature of PLGA-NP uptake. Chase experiments with metabolic inhibitors indicated the role of active exocytosis in the extrusion of these NPs. PLGA-NPs with ionic or nonionic hydrophilic coats with highly positive or negative zeta-potential also showed similar results.Conclusion:Our study opens up the possibility of modulation of active exocytosis to increase intracellular retention of NPs for an extended period of drug delivery.

AB  - Background: Several therapeutic agents have been investigated for treatment of novel coronavirus 2019 (nCOV-2019). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of various treatment modalities in nCOV-2019 patients.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted before 29 June 2020 in PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane library databases. A fixed-effect model was applied ifI(2) < 50%, else results were combined using random-effect model. Risk ratio (RR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to pool the results. Between-study heterogeneity was explored using influence and sensitivity analyses, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2.
   Results: Fifty studies involving 15 in vitro and 35 clinical studies including 9170 nCOV-2019 patients were included. Lopinavir-ritonavir was significantly associated with shorter mean time to clinical recovery (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.57 to -0.06), remdesivir was significantly associated with better overall clinical recovery (RR 1.17; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29), and tocilizumab was associated with less all-cause mortality (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93). Hydroxychloroquine was associated with longer time to clinical recovery and less overall clinical recovery. It additionally had higher all-cause mortality and more total adverse events.
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that except in vitro studies, no treatment has shown overall favourable outcomes in nCOV-2019 patients. Lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir and tocilizumab may have some benefits, while hydroxychloroquine administration may cause harm in nCOV-2019 patients. Results from upcoming large clinical trials may further clarify role of these drugs.

AB  - There have been concerted efforts toward cataloging rare and deleterious variants in different world populations using high-throughput genotyping and sequencing-based methods. The Indian population is underrepresented or its information with respect to clinically relevant variants is sparse in public data sets. The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of monogenic disease-causing variants in Indian populations. Toward this, we have assessed the frequency profile of monogenic phenotype-associated ClinVar variants. The study utilized a genotype data set (global screening array, Illumina) from 2795 individuals (multiple in-house genomics cohorts) representing diverse ethnic and geographically distinct Indian populations. Of the analyzed variants from Global Screening Array, similar to 9% were found to be informative and were either not known earlier or underrepresented in public databases in terms of their frequencies. These variants were linked to disorders, namely inborn errors of metabolism, monogenic diabetes, hereditary cancers, and various other hereditary conditions. We have also shown that our study cohort is genetically a better representative of the Indian population than its representation in the 1000 Genome Project (South Asians). We have created a database, ClinIndb, linked to the Leiden Open Variation Database, to help clinicians and researchers in diagnosis, counseling, and development of appropriate genetic screening tools relevant to the Indian populations and Indians living abroad.

AB  - The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) constitute about 90% of all head and neck cancers. HNSCC falls in the top 10 cancers in men globally. Epoxyazadiradione (EPA) and Azadiradione (AZA) are the limonoids derived from the medicinal plantAzadirachta indica(popularly known as Neem). Whether or not the limonoids exhibit activities against HNSCC and the associated mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that EPA exhibits stronger activity in HNSCC in comparison to AZA. The limonoids obeyed the Lipinski's rule of 5. EPA exhibited activities in a variety of HNSCC lines like suppression of the proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. The limonoid suppressed the level of proteins associated with anti-apoptosis (survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL), proliferation (cyclin D1), and invasion (MMP-9). Further, the expression of proapoptotic Bax and caspase-9 cleavage was induced by the limonoid. Exposure of EPA induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the FaDu cells. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (ROS scavenger) abrogated the down-regulation of tumorigenic proteins caused by EPA exposure. EPA induced NOX-5 while suppressing the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further, hydrogen peroxide induced NF-kappa B-p65 nuclear translocation and EPA inhibited the translocation. Finally, EPA modulated the expression of lncRNAs in HNSCC lines. Overall, these results have shown that EPA exhibit activities against HNSCC by targeting multiple cancer related signalling molecules. Currently, we are evaluating the efficacy of this molecule in mice models.

AB  - Background: Undernutrition is a leading risk factor for tuberculosis and is associated with adverse treatment outcomes. Energy-dense nutritional supplement (EDNS) may be helpful in managing undernutrition in tuberculosis patients. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted among 102 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients in the Ballabgarh tuberculosis unit in Haryana, India, between September 2018 and February 2019. Participants were provided daily supplementation with 2 sachets of peanut-based EDNS providing 1000 kcal along with the tuberculosis chemotherapy for 2 months. Acceptability was assessed after one month of supplementation. Reported side effects were assessed every 15 days for 2 months and adherence, in terms of proportion of supplement consumed, was assessed on weekly basis for 2 months. Weight was measured at baseline and after 1 month and 2 months. Results: Mean age of participants was 33 years (standard deviation: 13.8) and 75.5% of the participants were male. Almost 100% of the participants found the taste, smell, consistency, and color of the EDNS acceptable. Three participants rejected it after one month of consuming EDNS and another 7 rejected after 2 months of consuming EDNS. After consuming EDNS for 2 months, 13.9% of the participants complained of nausea, 11.9% complained of vomiting, 10.9% complained of diarrhea, and 9.9% complained of pain abdomen and abdominal fullness or bloating anytime during the period of supplementation. The adherence to EDNS among the participants was reported as 92.6%. Conclusion: A peanut-based EDNS was highly acceptable and safe, and the adherence to it was high among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

AB  - There is a desperate need for safe and effective vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for SARS- coronavirus 2 (CoV-2), the development of which will be aided by the discovery of potent and selective antibodies against relevant viral epitopes. Human phage display technology has revolutionized the process of identifying and optimizing antibodies, providing facile entry points for further applications. Herein, we use this technology to search for antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2. Specifically, we screened a naive human semisynthetic phage library against RBD, leading to the identification of a high-affinity single-chain fragment variable region (scFv). The scFv was further engineered into two other antibody formats (scFv-Fc and IgG1). All three antibody formats showed high binding specificity to CoV-2 RBD and the spike antigens in different assay systems. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated specific binding of the IgG1 format to cells expressing membrane-bound CoV-2 spike protein. Docking studies revealed that the scFv recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-interacting sites on the CoV-2 RBD. Given its high specificity and affinity, we anticipate that these anti-CoV-2 antibodies will be useful as valuable reagents for accessing the antigenicity of vaccine candidates, as well as developing antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics for CoV-2.

KW  - meta-analysis
AB  - Background There is no effective therapy for COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been used for its treatment but their safety and efficacy remain uncertain. Objective We performed a systematic review to synthesize the available data on the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods Two reviewers searched for published and pre-published relevant articles between December 2019 and 8 June 2020. The data from the selected studies were abstracted and analyzed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The quality of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach. Results We reviewed 12 observational and 3 randomized trials which included 10,659 patients of whom 5713 received CQ/HCQ and 4966 received only standard of care. The efficacy of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 was inconsistent across the studies. Meta-analysis of included studies revealed no significant reduction in mortality with HCQ use [RR 0.98 95% CI 0.66-1.46], time to fever resolution (mean difference - 0.54 days (- 1.19-011)) or clinical deterioration/development of ARDS with HCQ [RR 0.90 95% CI 0.47-1.71]. There was a higher risk of ECG abnormalities/arrhythmia with HCQ/CQ [RR 1.46 95% CI 1.04 to 2.06]. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for these outcomes. Authors' Conclusion The available evidence suggests that CQ or HCQ does not improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed randomized trials are required for assessing the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ for COVID-19.

AB  - A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 pandemic in humans, recently emerged and has exported in more than 200 countries as a result of rapid spread. In this study, we have made an attempt to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 genome reported from 13 different countries, identification of mutations in major coronavirus proteins of these different SARS-CoV-2 genomes and compared with SARS-CoV. These thirteen complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed high identity (>99%) to each other, while they shared 82% identity with SARS-CoV. Here, we performed a very systematic mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different geographical locations, which enabled us to identify numerous unique features of this viral genome. This includes several important country-specific unique mutations in the major proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, replicase polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein. Indian strain showed mutation in spike glycoprotein at R408I and in replicase polyprotein at I671T, P2144S and A2798V,. While the spike protein of Spain & South Korea carried F797C and S221W mutation, respectively. Likewise, several important country specific mutations were analyzed. The effect of mutations of these major proteins were also investigated using variousin silicoapproaches. Main protease (Mpro), the therapeutic target protein of SARS with maximum reported inhibitors, was thoroughly investigated and the effect of mutation on the binding affinity and structural dynamics of Mpro was studied. It was found that the R60C mutation in Mpro affects the protein dynamics, thereby, affecting the binding of inhibitor within its active site. The implications of mutation on structural characteristics were determined. The information provided in this manuscript holds great potential in further scientific research towards the design of potential vaccine candidates/small molecular inhibitor against COVID19.

AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) develop in a subset of HIV-1 infected individuals over 2-3 years of infection. Infected infants develop plasma bnAbs frequently and as early as 1-year post-infection suggesting factors governing bnAb induction in infants are distinct from adults. Understanding viral characteristics in infected infants with early bnAb responses will provide key information about antigenic triggers driving B cell maturation pathways towards induction of bnAbs. Herein, we evaluate the presence of plasma bnAbs in a cohort of 51 HIV-1 Glade-C infected infants and identify viral factors associated with early bnAb responses. Plasma bnAbs targeting V2-apex on the env are predominant in infant elite and broad neutralizers. Circulating viral variants in infant elite neutralizers are susceptible to V2-apex bnAbs. In infant elite neutralizers, multivariant infection is associated with plasma bnAbs targeting diverse autologous viruses. Our data provides information supportive of polyvalent vaccination approaches capable of inducing V2-apex bnAbs against HIV-1.

AB  - Background:Many patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) in India present with predominant/exclusive oral mucosal lesions. Current validated scoring systems for pemphigus do not adequately represent the clinical variability of oral lesions. Objective:To develop and validate a novel scoring system exclusively for oral lesions in PV. Methods:In this cross-sectional study, the Delphi method was used to build an initial scale that was administered in 115 patients with PV. Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the underlying factor structure of the new scale. The psychometric properties of the new scale were studied. Correlations between the new scale and Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS), Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI), and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) were also assessed. Results:Content validity of the initial scale was established with an average content validity index (CVI) of 0.8. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 3-factor structure with a total of 9 items. Corrected item-total correlation, a measure of data quality, was more than 0.30 for all items in the new oral mucosal scale-Pemphigus Oral Lesions Intensity Score (POLIS). Significant correlations were observed between POLIS and oral ABSIS (r= 0.85,p< 0.001), mucosal PDAI (r= 0.70,p< 0.001), and PGA (r= 0.60,p< 0.001). POLIS was also reliable with good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86) and strong inter-rater agreement. Limitations:The study cohort included participants from a single center. Usability and time taken to administer the scale were not assessed. Conclusions:The new scale, POLIS, has adequate validity and reliability. It includes both quality of life and clinical disease severity parameters, assessing disease severity holistically. Further studies evaluating the scale's responsiveness to change are in progress.

TI  - Dry ice in the eye: A rare occupational hazard!
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Superficial corneal foreign bodies (FBs) are a common occupational ocular hazard and can cause visually important astigmatism. A 23-year-old male working in a factory, which produced dry ice (solid carbon dioxide), presented to our emergency unit with symptoms of whitish discolouration of the right cornea for 1 day. Visual acuity in both eyes was 20/20 and slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed an irregularly shaped whitish superficial FB in the inferior paracentral cornea with surrounding superior nebular opacity. Its gentle removal with a moistened cotton bud revealed an underlying epithelial defect with residual whitish changes. At 1-month of follow-up, the patient had nebulo-macular corneal opacity with stromal thinning at the site of impacted dry ice. We speculate that dry ice causes corneal damage due to its extremely cold temperatures and the formation of carbonic acid.

AB  - Introduction: Vascular complications such as venous thrombosis (VT) and pseudoaneurysm are not uncommon in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). The aim of this study to was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for vascular complications in patients with CP.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients with CP presenting from January 2002 to August 2019 was performed. Venous thrombosis and pseudoaneurysm were identified using radiological imaging, and their risk factors were identified using multivariate Coxproportional hazards.
   Results: Of 1363 patients with CP, 166 (12.2%) had vascular complications. Isolated VT was present in 132, pseudoaneurysm in 17, and both in 17 patients. They were more commonly seen in males and alcoholic CP (ACP), and less commonly in patients with pancreatic atrophy and calcification. It involved the vessels in the closest proximity to the pancreas, VT most commonly involving the splenic vein whereas pseudoaneurysm most commonly involved the splenic artery. Alcoholic CP [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, p = 0.002], pseudocyst (OR 4.6, p < 0.001) and inflammatory head mass (OR 3.1, p = 0.006) were independent risk factors for VT, whereas ACP (OR 3.49, p = 0.006) and pseudocyst (OR 3.2, p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for pseudoaneurysm. Gastrointestinal bleed occurred in 3.5% patients, and more commonly in patients with pseudoaneurysm than VT (64.7% vs 15.9%), and in patients with ACP in comparison to other etiologies (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Vascular complications are a common complication of CP, VT being more frequent than pseudoaneurysm. Pseudocyst and ACP are independent risk factors for the development of vascular complications. (C) 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary systemic amyloidosis is an uncommon disease which presents with involvement of the kidney, heart, peripheral nervous system and liver. The involvement of skeletal muscles called amyloid myopathy is uncommon. We report a 74-year-old male who presented with progressively drooping shoulders followed by other muscular involvement without other organ involvement as a manifestation of amyloidosis. The patient was managed with melphalan, prednisolone and thalidomide with clinical improvement.

AB  - Background and Purpose Various neurological findings including stroke in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, although no clarity exists regarding the nature and pattern of this association. This systematic review aims to report the characteristics of stroke in patients with COVID-19.
   Methods Three authors independently searched Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PubMed starting from inception up to May 22, 2020. The data for individual patients was extracted where available from published reports including clinical and laboratory parameters and analysed for any significant associations between variables.
   Results We identified 30 relevant articles involving 115 patients with acute or subacute stroke with COVID-19. The mean +/- standard deviation age was 62.5 +/- 14.5 years. Stroke was ischemic in majority of the patients (101 [87.8%]). Hypertension (42 [42%]), dyslipidaemia (24 [26.1%]), and diabetes (23 [23.2%]) were the major vascular risk factors. Most of the patients (80 [85.1%]) had COVID-19 symptoms at the time of stroke with a median interval of 10 days to stroke from the diagnosis of COVID-19. Three-fourths (86 [74.8%]) of the patients were critically ill which frequently delayed the diagnosis of stroke. High levels of D-dimer, and ferritin were observed in these patients. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had a high mortality (47.9%). Factors associated with mortality were intensive care unit admission, having two or more vascular risk factors, particularly smoking and high levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase.
   Conclusions The association between stroke and COVID-19 is probably multifactorial including an amalgamation of traditional vascular risk factors, proinflammatory and a prothrombotic state. Prospectively collected data is required in the future to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being increasingly adopted as a label-free and non-invasive technique for biomedical applications such as cancer and ocular disease diagnosis. Diagnostic information for these tissues is manifest in textural and geometric features of the OCT images, which are used by human expertise to interpret and triage. However, it suffers delays due to the long process of the conventional diagnostic procedure and shortage of human expertise. Here, a custom deep learning architecture, LightOCT, is proposed for the classification of OCT images into diagnostically relevant classes. LightOCT is a convolutional neural network with only two convolutional layers and a fully connected layer, but it is shown to provide excellent training and test results for diverse OCT image datasets. We show that LightOCT provides 98.9% accuracy in classifying 44 normal and 44 malignant (invasive ductal carcinoma) breast tissue volumetric OCT images. Also, >96% accuracy in classifying public datasets of ocular OCT images as normal, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Additionally, we show similar to 96% test accuracy for classifying retinal images as belonging to choroidal neovascularization, diabetic macular edema, drusen, and normal samples on a large public dataset of more than 100,000 images. The performance of the architecture is compared with transfer learning based deep neural networks. Through this, we show that LightOCT can provide significant diagnostic support for a variety of OCT images with sufficient training and minimal hyper-parameter tuning. The trained LightOCT networks for the three-classification problem will be released online to support transfer learning on other datasets.

AB  - Objective: The following paper describes the technique and outcomes of fronto-orbital variant of supraorbital key hole approach (f-SOKHA) to clip anterior circulation aneurysms and compares the same with a similar cohort operated through pterional craniotomy (PT). Material and Methods: Ambispective study (2012-2019); Technique applied for anterior circulation aneurysms. Contraindications included: Large hematomas, tense brain, avoided in poor grade (Hunt and Hess grade III and IV). Large frontal sinus: Relative contraindication. Procedure included a trans-ciliary skin incision, burr hole over key point, cutting of orbital roof via the burr hole, and removal of a single small fronto-orbital flap (1). This was followed by drilling of the inner table of the frontal bone (2). Both 1 and 2 resulted in expansion of the operative space by 60%. Results compared with a similar cohort of PT. Results: n = 75 cases; most commonly used for ACom (anterior communicating: 43) followed by middle cerebral (16), internal cerebral (13), Posterior communicating (6), anterior cerebral (2), and anterior choroidal (1). Mean age: 47.9 +/- 14 years; mean Hunt and Hess grade: 1.96 +/- 1.35; duration of surgery: 203 +/- 45 minutes, mean size of aneurysm: 6.96 +/- 3.65 mm. Both blood loss and surgery duration was less (P: 0.099 and <0.001) when compared with a similar cohort with PT. It also demonstrated better cosmetic results and patient satisfaction. Conclusions: f-SOKHA provided a larger operating corridor (60% more) as compared with the standard supra-orbital key-hole approaches while preserving the same degree of minimally invasive nature and cosmetic results.

AB  - Aim To analyse long-term visual outcomes across different subtypes of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG).
   Methods Patients with PCG with a minimum of 5-year follow-up post surgery were included in the study. Snellen visual acuity recordings taken at their last follow-up were analysed. We evaluated the results using Kaplan-Meier curves to predict the probability of maintaining good vision (as defined by a visual acuity of 6/18 or better) in our patients after 30-year follow-up. The results were also analysed to determine whether there were any differences in the long-term visual acuities with time between the neonatal and infantile PCG. We also analysed the reasons for poor visual outcomes.
   Results We assessed a cohort of 140 patients with PCG (235 eyes) with an average follow-up of 127 +/- 62.8 months (range 60-400 months). Overall, the proportion of eyes with good visual acuity was 89 (37.9%), those with fair visual acuity between 6/60 and 6/18 was 41 (17.4%), and those with poor visual acuity (<= 6/60) was 105 (44.7%). We found a significant difference (p=0.047) between neonatal and infantile patients with PCG whereby the neonatal cohort fared worse off in terms of visual morbidity. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cumulative probability of survival of a visual acuity of 6/18 or better was more among the infantile PCG in comparison to the neonatal PCG (p=0.039) eyes, and more among the bilateral than the unilateral affected eyes (p=0.029). Amblyopia was the most important cause for poor visual acuity as shown on a Cox proportional-hazards regression model.
   Conclusions Long-term visual outcomes of infantile are better than neonatal PCG. Eyes with unilateral have worse visual outcomes compared with those with bilateral PCG because of the development of dense amblyopia.

AB  - Acquired drug resistance is a common occurrence and the main cause of melanoma treatment failure. Melanoma cells frequently developed resistance against cisplatin during chemotherapy, and thus, targeting delivery systems have been devised to decrease drug resistance, increase therapeutic efficacy, and reduce side effects. We genetically engineered a macromolecular carrier using the recursive directional ligation method that specifically targets cisplatin-resistant (Cis-R) melanoma. This carrier is composed of an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) and multiple copies of Cis-R melanoma-targeting ligands (M-peptide). The designed M16E108 contains 16 targeting ligands incorporated within an ELP and has an ideal thermal phase transition at 39 degrees C. When treated to melanoma cells, M16E108 specifically accumulated in Cis-R B16F10 melanoma cells and accumulated to a lesser extent in parental B16F10 cells. Consistently, M16E108 exhibited efficient homing and longer retention in tumor tissues in Cis-R melanoma-bearing mice than in parental B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice. Thus, M16E108 was found to display considerable potential as a novel agent that specifically targets cisplatin-resistant melanoma.

AB  - Background: Short-term peripheral venous catheters-related bloodstream infections (PVCR-BSIs) rates have not been systematically studied in developing countries, and data on their incidence by number of devicedays are not available.
   Methods: Prospective, surveillance study on PVCR-BSI conducted from September 1, 2013 to May 31, 2019 in 204 intensive care units (ICUs), members of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC), from 57 hospitals in 19 cities of India. We applied US INICC definition criteria and reported methods using the INICC Surveillance Online System.
   Results: We followed 7,513 ICU patients for 296,893 bed-days and 295,795 short term peripheral venous catheter (PVC)-days. We identified 863 PVCR-BSIs, amounting to a rate of 2.91/1,000 PVC-days.
   Mortality in patients with PVC but without PVCR-BSI was 4.14%, and 11.59% in patients with PVCR-BSI. The length of stay in patients with PVC but without PVCR-BSI was 4.13 days, and 5.9 days in patients with PVCR-BSI. The micro-organism profile showed 68% of gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (23%), Klebsiella spp (15%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%), and others. The predominant gram-positive bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (10%).
   Conclusions: PVCR-BSI rates found in our ICUs were much higher than rates published from industrialized countries. Infection prevention programs must be implemented to reduce the incidence of PVCR-BSIs. (C) 2020 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided systematic biopsy, the current gold standard for the detection of prostate cancer, suffers from low sensitivity for clinically significant cancer. The use of diagnostic multiparametric MRI has increased the relevance of targeted biopsy techniques such as MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy and direct (in-bore) MRI-guided biopsy, which have higher detection rate for clinically significant cancer. Although primarily used in patients who remain at high clinical suspicion for prostate cancer despite a negative systematic biopsy, with the increasing use of upfront diagnostic MRI, these biopsies are expected to replace routine systematic biopsies. This pictorial essay aims to enhance our understanding of the concepts of these biopsy techniques so that they can be performed safely and provide maximum diagnostic yield.

AB  - Background Universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is an essential human right, recognised in the Sustainable Development Goals as crucial for preventing disease and improving human wellbeing. Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities.
   Methods We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs.
   Findings Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39.4-40.7) to 50.3% (50.0-50.5), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46.3% (95% UI 46.1-46.5) in 2017, compared with 28.7% (28.5-29.0) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (>80%) in 2017. More than 253 000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88.6% (95% UI 87.2-89.7) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664-711) of the 1830 (1797-1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76.1% (95% UI 71.6-80.7) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53.9% (50.6-59.6) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017.
   Interpretation Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) has several advantages over a combined anterior-posterior procedure for management of severe, rigid spinal deformities. The technique, described by Suk et al., has a high complication rate. Modifications of the technique which can reduce this complication rate might make this challenging procedure safer.
   PURPOSE: To report the results of PVCR in severe, rigid spinal deformity; to describe a modified technique for PVCR and compare its results with the conventional technique.
   STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 38 patients who underwent PVCR for severe, rigid spinal deformities.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean correction of deformity (sagittal and/or coronal), estimated blood loss, operation time, neurological and non-neurological complications, patient-reported outcome score (SRS-22r).
   METHODS: Thirty-eight patients underwent PVCR for severe, rigid spinal deformities. These patients had a deformity in excess of 90 degrees and a flexibility index <20%. Twenty-one of 38 patients (Group 1) underwent PVCR by the technique reported by Suk et al.; 17 patients (Group 2) underwent a modified PVCR technique. Our technique involves retaining the posterior elements until the other steps of PVCR are completed, which prevents ventral settling and allows for less handling of an already tight spinal cord. The results and complications were compared between the two groups.
   RESULTS: The mean operating time was 251 minutes and the mean blood loss was 1,251 mL. Mean coronal correction of 50% and a mean sagittal correction of 52.4% were achieved. Intraoperative loss of motor evoked potentials was seen in eight patients while there were two instances of permanent postoperative deficit, both occurring with the conventional PVCR technique. The average operating time, mean correction and blood loss did not differ between the two techniques. There was, however, a reduction in the occurrence of neurological complications with the authors' modified technique.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study with a small cohort suggests that the authors' modified technique of PVCR, wherein the posterior elements are preserved until just prior to attempting to correct the deformity, may be safer in terms of neurological complications when compared with the conventional technique. However, larger studies are warranted to conclusively establish this. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bilateral nodular sclerokeratitis secondary to syphilis - A case report
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - Nodular scleritis
KW  - sclerokeratitis
KW  - syphilis
AB  - A 30-year-old female patient presented with bilateral anterior nodular sclerokeratitis and multiple erythematous skin lesions involving the face, trunk, arms, and legs. The patient had a history of temporary relief with steroids, however the lesions recurred. A dermatology consultation was sought and the patient was diagnosed to have syphilis, consequent to which she was started on benzathine penicillin and showed a dramatic improvement in both skin and ocular lesions. A high index of suspicion for syphilis should be kept in mind for patients presenting with nodular scleritis to initiate timely and appropriate management with penicillin.

AB  - A 7-day old term neonate with D-malposition of great arteries, large perimembranous ventricular septal defect (almost single ventricle), without pulmonary stenosis was admitted with cyanosis and congestive heart failure. ECG revealed supraventricular tachycardia with alternating QRS axis with every beat. We discuss our approach to this scenario, which leads us to a rather rare cause of changing QRS morphology.

AB  - Before 2013, the diagnosis of about 30% to 45% cases of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) posed a diagnostic difficulty because of the missing reliable clonal marker. Calreticulin (CALR) mutation was identified as a recurrent mutation in about 60% to 88% of JAK2/MPL-negative PMF and ET. Molecular methods like Sanger sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are considered gold standard, but they have limited availability, complex techniques, and labor intensive. In contrast to molecular methods, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a widely available, rapid, simple, and cost-effective option. There are only few studies evaluating the utility of IHC for CALR mutation detection. Hence, we studied the role of IHC in CALR mutation detection and compared it with PCR. Thirty-one JAK2V617F-negative PMF and ET were evaluated for CALR mutation status. PCR was done and interpreted by comparing bands with the expected product size. The bone marrow biopsy was simultaneously put up for IHC using antimutated CALR monoclonal antibody (CAL2). CALR mutation was detected in 64.5% (20/31) cases. Prevalence of CALR mutation in JAK2-negative PMF and ET was 60.9% (14/23) and 75% (6/8), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of IHC analyzed were 89.4%, 100%, 100%, and 84.6%, respectively. A very good level of agreement (kappa=0.86) was observed between PCR and IHC. We suggest that IHC is the best screening test to detect CALR mutation in resource limited countries with limited availability and affordability of molecular methods.

AB  - The field of language research has seen tremendous progress in the last two decades. Advances in neuro-imaging and stimulation mapping have changed the way we conceive the neural basis of speech and language processing. In the past, the Wernicke-Lichtheim model was the most influential model explaining the neuro-anatomical basis of language. More recently, the concept of dual stream language processing has emerged, wherein separate dorsal and ventral networks are synergistically involved in phonological (sound to articulation) and semantic (sound to meaning) processing respectively. In this review article, we highlight new insights and approaches to the neurobiology of language, across different aspects of language processing like perception, comprehension, production, hemisphere lateralization, role of subcortical structures and effect of damage to language networks.

AB  - Invasive central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis is acquired by either hematogenous dissemination or direct spread from a sinus infection. We describe a series of nine patients with CNS aspergillosis from a tertiary care teaching institute in North India who were treated with voriconazole alone or in combination with surgery. All patients who had clinical and radiological features consistent with fungal CNS infection, showed the presence of septate hyphae on histopathology/microscopy and were either culture positive forAspergillusspp. or had serum galactomannan positivity were diagnosed as CNS aspergillosis. Clinical features, risk factors, diagnostic modalities, treatment details and outcome at last follow-up were recorded for all patients diagnosed with CNS aspergillosis. A total of nine patients were diagnosed with CNS aspergillosis. The median duration of presentation at our hospital was six months (IQR-2-9 months). Six patients had concomitant sinus involvement, while two patients had skull-base involvement as well. All patients were treated with voriconazole therapy, and three of these patients underwent surgery. All but one patient survived at the last follow-up (median duration was 14 months (IQR- 8-21.5). Two patients had complete resolution, and voriconazole was stopped at the last follow-up, and the rest of the patients were continued on voriconazole. Of the six patients who were continued on voriconazole, all but one had more than 50% radiological resolution on follow-up imaging. Invasive CNS aspergillosis is an important cause of CNS fungal infection that is often diagnosed late and requires long-term voriconazole-based therapy.

AB  - Background: Adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often remains undiagnosed and undertreated among patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). Research is lacking with regard to adult ADHD in individuals with SUD. The current work was intended to study the prevalence of adult ADHD among individuals with opioid dependence and its correlates, and to assess the attitude of the individuals with adult ADHD toward its treatment.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 132 consecutive inpatients with opioid-dependence syndrome. Patients were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. 5.0, adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale, and Maudsley Addiction Profile. Those who screened positive for adult ADHD (ADHD+) were compared with those screened negative (ADHD-) on a number of sociodemographic, substance use, and clinical variable. Furthermore, attitude toward the treatment for ADHD was assessed among the ADHD+ individuals.
   Results: About a fifth (n=24, 18.2%) of the patients with opioid dependence screened positive for adult ADHD. One-third of the participants (n=8, 33.3%) were willing for the treatment of any kind, and only a half (n=3) was willing to pay. Earlier age of onset of opioid use (relative risk: 0.01; 95% confidence interval: 0.003, 0.85; P = 0.036) had higher likelihood to ADHD+ status.
   Conclusion: Despite a high rate of ADHD screen positivity among individuals with opioid dependence, a majority were not willing to receive the treatment. Sensitization of: (1) addiction psychiatrist to routinely screen for ADHD, especially in the presence of certain correlates and (2) patients-caregivers about the potential benefit of treatment in effectively addressing the symptoms of ADHD effectively in this population.

KW  - pseudolipomatosis cutis

KW  - DERMAL VACUOLES
AB  - Pseudolipomatosis cutis is a distinctive artifact characterized by the presence of adipocyte-like vacuoles in the biopsy specimens. We describe this change in a series of skin biopsies clustered over 2 periods, November 2017-December 2017 and February 2019. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from 21 skin biopsies were examined by 2 dermatopathologists. Variable-sized vacuoles were noted in the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutaneous fat in all biopsies. Vacuoles were seen in the stratum corneum in 2 biopsies, epidermis in 15 biopsies, papillary dermis in 19 biopsies, reticular dermis in 20 biopsies, and subcutis in 9 biopsies. The vacuoles resembled a true histological change in many biopsies: vacuolated keratinocytes (n = 6), basal cell vacuolization (n = 6), foamy histiocytes (n = 12), and adipocytes (n = 20). Other changes included dermal collagen sclerosis and empty ectatic vascular channels. The clustering of this peculiar change in biopsies from patients with unrelated skin diseases that stopped on changing the formalin solution in both instances suggests that it is an artifactual change due to improper tissue fixation.

AB  - Background: Despite an interest in the editorial process at biomedical journals, not much information is available on this topic.
   Aims: To study the characteristics of the submissions to the Indian Journal of Dermatology Venereology and Leprology (IJDVL) and analyze the editorial and peer-review process and factors influencing the final outcome.
   Methods: Retrospective review of the manuscripts submitted to the IJDVL from January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016.
   Results: The IJDVL received 639 manuscripts during the study period, most being Case reports (35%), Research articles (30%), and Letters to editor (20%). The proportion of submissions from Indian (53%) and foreign (47%) authors was comparable. About 55% (n = 353/639) of the submissions were editorially rejected. Some of the common reasons for editorial rejection included "sub-optimal images," "no novelty," "incomplete information or results," and "incorrect diagnosis or interpretation of results." The acceptance rate during this period was 19%. The median number of days to reach the final decision was 14 days for editorial rejection, 146 days for acceptance, and 85 days for rejection after external peer-review. The acceptance rates were higher for submissions from Indian authors [odds ratio (OR) 1.96], those submitted as Letters (OR 2.06), or in the area of tropical infections (OR 2.17). Submissions as research articles (expB = 1.23), those from Indian authors (expB = 1.15), final decision being acceptance (expB = 1.56), and those requiring preliminary author revisions (expB = 3.34), external re-reviews (expB = 2.22), and repeated author re-revisions (expB = 2.34) were associated with longer times to reach final decision.
   Limitations: A relatively short study period of 6 months.
   Conclusion: The IJDVL attracts submissions both from India and abroad. Articles submitted in the Letters category or related to tropical infections were most likely to be accepted. There is scope for improving the time taken for editorial processing of manuscripts.

AB  - Introduction: Febrile neutropenia is a common cause in morbidity and mortality during treatment of hematological neoplasms.
   Methods: Subjects included all cases admitted under hematology department with febrile neutropenia from February to June 2018. Each febrile episode was investigated by standard investigations (Blood culture, Chest x ray etc.); Procalcitonin (PCT) and c reactive protein (CRP) was sent at fever onset 0, 24, 48 h, day 7 and day 14.
   Results: Data was analyzed for 52 febrile episodes in 50 patients. PCT cut off value at 24 h of <= 1.2 ng/ml had a sensitivity and specificity of 62.5% and 87.5% for discriminating Invasive fungal infection (IFI) and Microbiologically documented infection (MDI) (p = 0.033). PCT had a negative predictive value of 70% for the diagnosis of IFI as compared to MDI. CRP cut off> 160 mg/dl at 48 h was suggestive of fever due to fungal infection with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 48%, PPV of 33.3% and NPV of 100%. CRP at 24 and 48 h of fever was useful to distinguish non-infectious causes of fever from infectious causes.
   Conclusion: PCT at 24 h and CRP at 48 h was useful in identifying fungal infection. CRP was a better marker when compared to PCT for identifying disease fever.

AB  - Trials in children with chronic kidney disease do not consistently report outcomes that are critically important to patients and caregivers. This can diminish the relevance and reliability of evidence for decision making, limiting the implementation of results into practice and policy. As part of the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Children and Adolescents (SONG-Kids) initiative, we convened 2 consensus workshops in San Diego, California (7 patients, 24 caregivers, 43 health professionals) and Melbourne, Australia (7 patients, 23 caregivers, 49 health professionals). This report summarizes the discussions on the identification and implementation of the SONG-Kids core outcomes set. Four themes were identified; survival and life participation are common high priority goals, capturing the whole child and family, ensuring broad relevance across the patient journey, and requiring feasible and valid measures. Stakeholders supported the inclusion of mortality, infection, life participation, and kidney function as the core outcomes domains for children with chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) are exposed to multiple cardiovascular risk factors predisposing them to accelerated atherosclerosis. This risk is negligible in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, but a substantial proportion of children with SRNS progress to chronic kidney disease, exacerbating the already existing cardiovascular risk. While dyslipidemia is an established modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in adults with NS, it is uncertain to what extent analogous risks exist for children. There is increasing evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis in children with persistently high lipid levels, especially in refractory NS. Abnormalities of lipid metabolism in NS include hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia due to elevated apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, decreased lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activity, increased hepatic PCSK9 levels, and reduced hepatic uptake of high-density lipoprotein. Existing guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia in children may be adapted to target lower lipid levels in children with NS, but they will most likely require both lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapy. While there is a lack of data from randomized controlled trials in children with NS demonstrating the benefit of lipid-lowering drugs, therapies including statins, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, ezetimibe, and LDL apheresis have all been suggested and/or utilized. However, concerns with the use of lipid-lowering drugs in children include unclear side effect profiles and unknown long-term impacts on neurological development and puberty. The recent introduction of anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and other therapies targeted to the molecular mechanisms of lipid transport disrupted in NS holds promise for the future treatment of dyslipidemia in NS.

AB  - Aims The goal of the global congestive heart failure (G-CHF) registry is to collect comparative international data on heart failure characteristics, management, and outcomes and to better understand the determinants that impact the clinical course of heart failure.
   Methods G-CHF is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of adult patients with a new or prior clinical diagnosis of heart failure. We have enrolled 23,047 participants from 257 centers in 40 countries from 8 major geographic regions of the world, with recruitment ongoing. Approximately 4,000 participants will also participate in substudies to assess frailty, comorbidity, diet, barriers to care, biomarkers, and planned detailed echocardiographic analyses. Follow-up is planned for a period of 5 years. The primary outcome is cause-specific mortality. Key secondary outcomes include hospitalizations, quality of life, and major cardiovascular and noncardiovascular outcomes. A total of 31.9% of participants were enrolled as inpatients. Thus far, mean age of the cohort at baseline is 63.1 years, and 60.8% are male. Participants most commonly have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (53.6%) followed by preserved ejection fraction (24.2%) and midrange ejection fraction (20.6%). The most common causes of heart failure are ischemic (37.8%) followed by hypertensive (20.0%), idiopathic (15.1%), and valvular disease (8.8%).
   Conclusion G-CHF will provide a greater understanding of the characteristics of the global heart failure population, variations in its management, clinical outcomes, and what continues to impact morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population.

KW  - Pandemic
AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 infection is caused by a new strain of SARS CoV-2 virus, which transmits directly from person-to-person and has become a pandemic. To counteract this, actions related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders have been used termed as lockdown. This study aims to study lifestyle, behaviour, perception and practice of people regarding during the lockdown.
   Methods: An online survey was conducted with structured questionnaire in Google forms after ethical approval from Nepal Health Research Council (Ref-2631). The attributes of knowledge, attitude and practices were explored using multiple-choice questions and results were statistically analysed using Microsoft excel.
   Results: Five hundred fifty-five respondents completed the survey with 280 (50.5%) males and 275 (49.5%) female. The knowledge regarding viral pandemic was increased in 496 (89.3%) respondents. 424 (76.4%) people developed stress due to pandemic. Three hundred fifty three (63.6%) were adversely affected by professional works or suffered economic loss in business. More than 42% participants are using their time for study in personal development, online classes etc.
   Conclusions: The knowledge of viral pandemic as well as personal hygiene habits have improved in majority of people but many also developed stress. They were convinced that lockdown lowered transmission of infection which in turn affected lifestyle behaviour and practices. Practicing social distancing becomes too difficult for the poor in the absence of proper social security system and government support. E-Learning has become more acceptable due to lockdown. Further studies with in-person interviews are warranted.

AB  - Background: Pain is still a common feature in all types of cancers including head and neck and thoracic cancer. Neuromodulatory techniques have gained popularity over opioids in recent times because of the risks associated with chronic opioid therapy. There are no clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of scrambler therapy (ST) for the management of pain due to head and neck and thoracic cancer.
   Objective: This trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of scrambler therapy (ST) for pain relief and to assess the possible effect of ST on the dosage of opioids in patients suffering from cancer pain.
   Study design: A randomized control trial (RCT) was performed.
   Setting: The trial was conducted at the Pain and Palliative Care Unit of the Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Method: Forty patients were included in each of the 2 arms, control and Intervention. In both arms, patients were given pain management drugs. In the intervention group, patients additionally received 10 consecutive sessions of ST with one follow-up after 7 days. A numeric rating scale (NRS-11) was used to measure pain. Drug dosage was also recorded.
   Results: Overall, pain decreased in both arms. However, pain decreased more in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm. The total change in the mean score of the NRS-11 from baseline to follow-up was 3.1 and 6.19 in the control and ST arms, respectively. Differences between pain scores in both arms became significant from day 3 onwards. Mean morphine dose was significantly lower in the intervention arm from day 7 onwards.
   Limitations: The study followed the patients until one week after the last treatment session and encouraged patients to return for treatment if their pain returned to previous levels within 10 days. Moreover, patients in the control arm received the standard of care in the form of pharmacological treatment but did not receive either transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or a sham (placebo) procedure.
   Conclusions: The trial showed that ST is an effective treatment for the management of pain due to head and neck and thoracic cancer. On the basis of this study, the use of ST for the management of refractory cancer pain in head and neck and thoracic cancer is recommended.

AB  - Background: Lack of compliance to medication and uncontrolled risk factors are associated with increased risk of recurrent stroke and acute coronary syndrome in patients with recent stroke. Multimodal patient education may be a strategy to improve the compliance to medication and early adoption of nonpharmacological measures to reduce the vascular risk factor burden in patients with stroke. We thus aim to develop multilingual short messaging services (SMS), print, and audio-visual secondary stroke prevention patient education package. The efficacy of the package will be tested in a randomized control trial to prevent major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Methods: In the formative stage, intervention materials (SMS, video, and workbook) were developed. In the acceptability stage, the package was independently assessed and modified by the stakeholders involved in the stroke patient care and local language experts. The modified stroke prevention package was tested for implementation issues (implementation stage). Results: Sixty-nine SMS, six videos, and workbook with 11 chapters with 15 activities were developed in English language with a mean +/- SD SMOG index of 9.1 +/- 0.4. A total of 355 stakeholders including patients (24.8%), caregivers (24.8%), doctors (10.4%), nurses (14.1%), local language experts (2.8%), physiotherapists (13.2%), and research coordinators (9.8%) participated in 10 acceptability stage meetings. The mean Patient Education Material Assessment Tool understandability score in all languages for SMS, video scripts, and workbook was 95.2 +/- 2.6%, 95.2 +/- 4.4%, and 95.3 +/- 3.6%, respectively. The patients [n = 20, mean age of 70.3 +/- 10.6 years and median interquartile range (IQR) baseline NIHSS 1 (0-3)] or the research coordinators (n = 2) noted no implementation issues at the end of 1 month. Conclusion: An implementable complex multilingual patient education material could be developed in a stepwise manner. The efficacy of the package to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events is being tested in the SPRINT INDIA study.

AB  - Context: Aphasia is a major disabling condition after a stroke that profoundly affects the quality of life of stroke survivors (SS) and their caregivers. Comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation has emerged as a complementary intervention that helps in improving the associated cognitive and psychological deficits and quality of life following a brain injury. A standardized, simple, and easy to administer intervention that can be delivered as a home-based intervention can assist in faster recovery. Aims: To describe the development, validation, and feasibility of a home-based, caregiver-delivered comprehensive neuropsychological and language rehabilitation for SS. Methods and Material: A culture-specific picture and task-based 8-week training workbook and manual were developed based on extensive review and focused group discussions. This intervention targeted areas of language (comprehension, fluency, and naming) and cognition (working memory, attention and concentration, executive functioning, and response inhibition). It was standardized on 40 healthy controls (HC) and 15 SS. Before recruitment, written informed consent was obtained from each patient, their primary caregiver, and the HCs. Results: All tasks were found to be effective in discriminating the performance of SS from the HC. The performance of the HC with respect to the errors and the time taken for each task was used for the hierarchical arrangement of the tasks. The developed intervention was later validated on 15 SS where they significantly improved in the pre-post assessment of language functioning (P < 0.001), quality of life (P < 0.001), and depression (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This intervention can be feasible to administer as a home-based intervention and may help to alleviate language and neuropsychological complaints after stroke in low-literate or mixed-cultural populations. Further, large sample size studies are recommended.

We had published our experience of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and its effect on hypothyroidism in morbidly obese patients previously. In this study, we have tried to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the whole cohort of hypothyroid patients and compare the effect of various bariatric procedures on thyroid hormone replacement dose.
   Objective: To assess outcome of bariatric surgery on the hypothyroid patients and to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and one-anastomosis gastric bypass in terms of reduction of thyroid hormone replacement dosage.
   Setting: Tertiary care University Hospital, India; Government Practice.
   Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a database of all bariatric procedures done in a single unit at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. Morbidly obese patients with hypothyroidism on thyroxine replacement were identified and their preoperative and postoperative thyroid hormone replacement dosage (THR) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were compared.
   Results: Of 883 patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 180 patients were hypothyroid (on thyroxine replacement). Ninety-three patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of the study population was 42.2 +/- 10.4 years and the mean preoperative body mass index was 47.8 +/- 8.3 kg/m(2). Mean follow-up duration was 29.8 +/- 19.6 months. The excess weight loss was 58.9%. Fifty-two (55.8%) patients had a decrease in the in THR dosage, 37 (39.8%) had no change in THR dosage, and 4 patients required an increase in THR dosage. Decrease of THR dose was observed in 61.7% patients in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in comparison to 45.4% in bypass group.
   Conclusion: Bariatric surgery might cause reduction of thyroid replacement dosage in hypothyroid, morbidly obese patients. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

AB  - Background: Long-term low-dose methotrexate therapy is associated with liver fibrosis. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard for detecting fibrosis, it is an invasive procedure associated with morbidity and mortality risks. Hence noninvasive imaging techniques such as transient elastography (TE) and shear wave elastography (SWE) have been studied to measure liver stiffness.
   Aims: To assess the utility of TE and SWE in detecting fibrosis in patients with psoriasis and reactive arthritis on long-term methotrexate therapy.
   Methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was undertaken on 54 patients with psoriasis and reactive arthritis who had received >= 1.5 g of methotrexate. Various clinical and biochemical [fibrosis 4 index (FIB4), aspartate-transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI)] parameters were calculated and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was done with TE and SWE. The degree of steatosis was measured using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Liver biopsy was done when indicated and was interpreted by a pathologist blinded to clinical and imaging results.
   Results: Fifty four patients with a mean age of 40.3 years and a male-to-female ratio of 5:1 were included. The mean cumulative methotrexate dose was 3.04 g. The median FIB4, APRI, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-to-platelet ratio values were 0.75, 0.23, and 0.15, respectively. The median LSM for TE and SWE was 5.3 and 7.32 kPa, respectively. SWE and TE showed a weak positive correlation (r = 0.26, P = 0.053). The mean CAP was 217 dB/m (area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.70). In the 19 of 26 cases whose liver biopsies could be assessed, only 4 (21%) showed F1 fibrosis (Ishak staging). The median LSM on SWE was significantly higher in patients with a cumulative methotrexate dose >= 4 g when compared with those with a dose <4 g (9.85 vs 7.1, P = 0.02). Other parameters did not correlate with TE and SWE.
   Limitations: The small sample size and the low number of cases with significant fibrosis on histopathology were the major limitations of this study.
   Conclusion: Histologically detectable LF is uncommon in patients with psoriasis and reactive arthritis on long-term methotrexate therapy. Both TE and SWE are good at detecting the absence of fibrosis in these patients. In our study, SWE and TE values did not correlate with clinical, biochemical, or histopathological parameters.

AB  - Background/objectives: This paper is part of the international consensus guidelines on chronic pancreatitis, presenting for interventional endoscopy.
   Methods: An international working group with experts on interventional endoscopy evaluated 26 statements generated from evidence on 9 clinically relevant questions. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the level of evidence. To determine the level of agreement, a nine-point Likert scale was used for voting on the statements.
   Results: Strong consensus was obtained for 15 statements relating to nine questions including the recommendation that endoscopic intervention should be offered to patients with persistent severe pain but not to those without pain. Endoscopic decompression of the pancreatic duct could be used for immediate pain relief, and then offered surgery if this fails or needs repeated endoscopy. Endoscopic drainage is preferred for portal-splenic vein thrombosis and pancreatic fistula. A plastic stent should be placed and replaced 2-3 months later after insertion. Endoscopic extraction is indicated for stone fragments remaining after ESWL. Interventional treatment should be performed for symptomatic/complicated pancreatic pseudocysts. Endoscopic treatment is recommended for bile duct obstruction and afterwards surgery if this fails or needs repeated endoscopy. Surgery may be offered if there is significant calcification and/or mass of the pancreatic head. Percutaneous endovascular treatment is preferred for hemosuccus pancreaticus. Surgical treatment is recommended for duodenal stenosis due to chronic pancreatitis.
   Conclusions: This international expert consensus guideline provides evidenced-based statements concerning indications and key aspects for interventional endoscopy in the management of patients with chronic pancreatitis. (C) 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Gaps in lithium-related knowledge among bipolar disorder (BD) patients on lithium prophylaxis may pose safety concerns and could adversely influence attitudes to lithium.
   Objective: To assess the lithium-related knowledge and attitudes among patients with BD.
   Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional, observational study assessing euthymic, adult outpatients with BD on lithium prophylaxis (>= 1 year) using a semi-structured pro forma, lithium questionnaire for knowledge, lithium attitude questionnaire (LAQ), and medication adherence rating scale (MARS).
   Results: Descriptive analysis revealed several deficits in knowledge, including lack of critical safety information or need for periodic blood tests. Lower knowledge group had significantly more negative attitudes. Favorable attitude toward lithium (lower LAQ score) was significantly associated with the number of psychiatric follow-ups in the last year and MARS score.
   Conclusion: There were critical deficits in lithium-related knowledge among the patients. Lower lithium knowledge was associated with negative lithium attitudes. Educative interventions should be delivered periodically to regular lithium users.

AB  - Background: Genetic heterogeneity in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been unambiguously reported across different populations. Assuming a higher genetic load, we tested variant burden in PD genes to an early onset PD cohort from India.
   Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed in 250 PD patients recruited following MDS-UPDRS criteria. The number of rare variants in the 20 known PD genes per exome were used to calculate average rare variant burden with the 616 non-PD exomes available in-house as a comparison group. SKAT-O test was used for gene level analysis.
   Results: 80 patients harboured rare variants in 20 PD genes, of which six had known pathogenic variants accounting for 2.4% of the cohort. Of 80 patients, 12 had homozygous and nine had likely compound heterozygous variants in recessive PD genes and 59 had heterozygous variants in only dominant PD genes. Of the 16 novel variants of as yet unknown significance identified, four homozygous across ATP13A2, PRKN, SYNJ1 and PARK7; and 12 heterozygous among LRRK2, VPS35, EIF4G1 and CHCHD2 were observed. SKAT-O test suggested a higher burden in GBA (p(unadjusted) = 0.002). Aggregate rare variant analysis including 75 more individuals with only heterozygous variants in recessive PD genes (excluding GBA), with an average of 0.85 protein-altering rare variants per PD patient exome versus 0.51 in the non-PD group, revealed a significant enrichment (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: This first study in an early onset PD cohort among Indians identified 16 novel variants in known genes and also provides evidence for a high genetic burden in this ethnically distinct population.

AB  - Aim To study the role of internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in the prevention of macular epiretinal membrane (ERM) formation following pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).
   Methods In a randomised trial, patients with macula-off RRD (duration <= 3 months) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy grade <= C1 and absence of pre-existing maculopathy were recruited from June 2016 to May 2018. Patients were randomised into two groups: group 1 (conventional treatment) underwent PPV alone, while group 2 underwent PPV with macular ILM peeling. The main outcome measures were macular ERM formation (detected on optical coherence tomography), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), retinal attachment and central macular thickness (CMT) at last follow-up (minimum 6 months).
   Results Sixty patients (30 in each group) completed the required follow-up. The two groups were comparable in sex distribution, age, duration of RRD, baseline CDVA and duration of follow-up (median 15.5 vs 14 months). Macular ERM developed in 20% (n=6) and 0% of eyes in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.002). Retinal reattachment was attained in all eyes. There was no statistical difference in final CDVA between the groups (p=0.43). Dissociated optic nerve fibre layer (DONFL) was found in 0% and 40% (n=12) of eyes in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.0001). However, DONFL did not significantly affect the final CDVA (p=0.84). The final CMT was 266.0 +/- 37.5 mu m and 270.0 +/- 73.7 mu m in groups 1 and 2, respectively, with no statistical difference (p=0.62).
   Conclusions ILM peeling prevents macular ERM formation following PPV for RRD but provides similar visual outcomes as compared with conventional treatment.

AB  - Ocular cysticercosis could involve subconjunctival space, anterior chamber, extraocular muscle, subretinal space, or vitreous. The presence of intraocular live cyst is a potential threat to visual acuity. The removal of the cyst in-toto is thus of importance to prevent inflammatory reaction and ocular damage. The presence of cysticercosis underneath the macula makes the management challenging. Herein, we describe the management of a submacular live cysticercus cyst with a good postoperative gain in visual acuity. Also, the swept-source optical coherence tomography changes are described.

AB  - Background and Aims: Poor knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] in pregnancy underlies unwarranted voluntary childlessness [VC], and risks poorer obstetric outcomes and adverse fetal outcomes. IBD is increasing worldwide but education on IBD issues might be heterogeneous based on cultural differences and variations in models of care.
   Methods: Consecutive female IBD subjects aged 18-45 years were prospectively recruited from two dedicated IBD-pregnancy clinics, two multidisciplinary IBD clinics and nine general gastroenterology clinics. Subjects completed the validated CCPKnow [score 0-17] with questions on demographics, medical history and pregnancy knowledge. The primary outcome was knowledge per clinic-type and per geographical region.
   Results: Surveys were completed by 717 subjects from 13 hospitals across ten countries. Dedicated IBD-pregnancy clinics had the highest knowledge, followed by multidisciplinary IBD clinics then general IBD clinics (median CCPKnow 10.0 [IQR: 8.0-11.0], 8.0 [IQR: 5.0-10.5] and 4.0 [IQR:2.0-6.0]; p < 0.001). Median CCPKnow scores in Western, Asian and Middle Eastern clinics were 9.0, 5.0 and 3.0 respectively [p < 0.001]. Dedicated IBD-pregnancy clinics, IBD support organization membership, childbearing after IBD diagnosis and employment independently predicted greater knowledge. Patient perception of disease severity [r = -0.18, p < 0.01] and consideration of VC [r = -0.89, p = 0.031] negatively correlated with CCPKnow score. The overall VC rate was 15.0% [95% CI: 12.2-18.2]. VC subjects had significantly lower pregnancy-specific IBD knowledge than non-VC subjects (median CCPKnow 4.0 [IQR: 2.0-6.0] and 6.0 [IQR: 3.0-9.0] respectively; p < 0.001). Pregnancy-specific IBD knowledge and dedicated IBD-pregnancy clinic attendance were significant negative predictors of VC.
   Conclusions: In this large international study we identified predictors of pregnancy-specific IBD knowledge. Dedicated IBD-pregnancy clinics had the greatest IBD-related pregnancy knowledge and lowest VC rates, reflecting the benefits of pre-conception counselling.

AB  - Objective: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a major global public health threat. India, as it shares a large fraction of the world's TB burden, is currently at a critical phase due to the rise of drug resistance. Monitoring the prevalence and patterns of drug resistance is essential to measure the progress of TB control programmes. We aimed to systematically review Indian studies on the prevalence and patterns of DR-TB among various treatment types and risk groups.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, IndMed, major TB journals and other databases for English language articles published till March 2018 that estimated the prevalence of DR TB in new, previously treated, presumptive multidrug resistance (MDR), paediatric and HIV co-infected pulmonary TB patients. Two authors independently conducted the search, assessed study quality, and extracted the relevant data. Pooled prevalence of DR-TB and its types were calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was investigated by sub-group and sensitivity analyses.
   Results: Ninety non-duplicate studies were included. The prevalence of MDR, any drug resistance and extensive drug resistance was 3.5%, 24.9% and 0.06% (among new) and 26.7%, 58.4% and 1.3% (among previously treated), respectively. MDR prevalence among presumptive MDR, paediatric and HIV coinfected TB patients was 23.3%, 5.1% and 18.8%, respectively. MDR prevalence among new TB patients was highest in Maharashtra and lowest in Telangana. There was high heterogeneity between the studies. Study period, place of study and zone were significantly associated with MDR prevalence.
   Conclusions: India suffers from a significant burden of DR-TB. Its patterns and prevalence are very heterogeneous across time, region and setting. Implementation of universal drug susceptibility testing in all districts and continuous DR-TB surveillance is crucial to ensure programmatic success. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Extrapulmonary drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-EPTB) poses a formidable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.Besides associated with high morbidity, it is a major financial burden for the patient and the health system. In spite of this, it has often been neglected as it does not "pose" a visible public health threat. We study clinical profiles, treatment outcomes, and factors associated with unfavourable outcomes among DR-EPTB patients under programmatic settings in New Delhi, India, and evaluate how this could impact TB elimination. A retrospective analysis of all DR-EPTB patients registered at three nodal DR-TB centres in Delhi in 2016 was carried out. Of the 1261 DR-TB patients registered, 203 (16%) were DR-EPTB, with lymph nodes (118, 58%) being the most common site, followed by bone (69, 34%). Nearly 29% (n= 58) experienced adverse drug reactions with severe vomiting (26, 13 %), joint pain (21, 10%) and behavioral disorder (15, 7%). History of previous TB treatment was observed in a majority of the cases (87.7%). Nearly one-third of DR-EPTB cases (33%) had unfavourable treatment outcomes, with loss-to-follow-up (n= 40, 58%) or death (n= 14, 20%) being the most common unfavourable outcomes. In the adjusted analysis, weight band 31-50 kilograms (aRR = 1.8, 1.2-3.4) and h/o previous TB (aRR = 2.1, 1.1-4.8) were mainly associated with unfavourable outcomes. TB elimination efforts need to focus on all forms of TB, including DR-EPTB, leaving no one behind, in order to realise the dream of ending TB.

AB  - ObjectivesConsidering the dearth of literature on West syndrome (WS) from South Asian countries, this study aimed to evaluate the management practices in South Asia by an online survey and meta-analysis.
   MethodsAn online questionnaire was sent to 223 pediatric neurologists/pediatricians in India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Their responses were evaluated and supplemented by a meta-analysis.
   ResultsOf 125 responses received (response rate: 56%), around 60% of responders observed male preponderance and an approximate lead-time-to-treatment (LTTT) of 4-12 weeks. The commonest etiology observed was a static structural insult (88.6% of responders). Most commonly used first-line drug (country-wise) was as follows: India-adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH, 50%); Pakistan-oral steroids (45.5%); Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal-oral steroids (94.4%); Bangladesh-ACTH (2/2); Bhutan-vigabatrin (3/5). ACTH and vigabatrin are not available in Myanmar and Nepal. The most commonly used regime for ACTH was maximal-dose-at-initiation-regime in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh and gradually escalating-regime in Pakistan. Maximum dose of prednisolone was variable-most common response from India: 3-4 mg/kg/d; Pakistan, Bhutan, and Bangladesh: 2 mg/kg/d; Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Myanmar: 5-8 mg/kg/d or 60 mg/d. The total duration of hormonal therapy (including tapering) ranged from 4 to 12 weeks (67/91). Most responders considered cessation of spasms for four weeks as complete response (54/111) and advised electroencephalography (EEG; 104/123) to check for hypsarrhythmia resolution. Difficult access to pediatric EEG in Bhutan and Nepal is concerning. More than 95% of responders felt a need for more awareness. The meta-analysis supported the preponderance of male gender (68%; confidence interval [CI]: 64%-73%), structural etiology(80%; CI 73%-86%), longer LTTT (2.4 months; CI 2.1-2.6 months), and low response rate to hormonal therapy(18% and 28% for ACTH and oral steroids respectively) in WS in South Asia.
   SignificanceThis study highlights the practices and challenges in the management of WS in South Asia. These include a preponderance of male gender and structural etiology, a longer LTTT, difficult access to pediatric EEG, nonavailability of ACTH and vigabatrin in some countries, and low effectiveness of hormonal therapy in this region.

AB  - Budd-Chiari syndrome is a vascular pathology of the liver, commonly seen in adults and uncommon in children. Most children with Budd-Chiari syndrome present with ascites, and an etiology is found in only about 50%. Ultrasonography (US) with color Doppler is the main modality used in the diagnosis. US imaging additionally guides radiologic interventions and follow-up after recanalization or shunt procedure. In this pictorial review, we illustrate the findings in pediatric Budd-Chiari syndrome as seen on B-mode and color Doppler US and describe the role of US in guiding percutaneous radiologic interventions, with a brief description of the role of US contrast agent and sonoelastography in this setting.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate if the parental origin of X-chromosome has an impact on the phenotype and biochemical profile in Turner syndrome (TS). Result of the previous studies have been equivocal and could be attributable to the multicentric study design with different experts examining heterogeneous TS population of various ethnic background.
   Methods: A cross-sectional single center study from Northern India. Fifty nine diagnosed subjects of TS and their parents participated in the study. Parental origin of intact X-chromosome was determined using 12 highly polymorphic short tandem repeats (STR) on X-chromosome. For the evaluation of parent-of-origin effects, typical phenotypic traits including congenital malformations, anthropometry, body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and biochemical profile were compared. Clinical stigmata of TS in all subjects were examined by a single expert.
   Results: The intact X-chromosome was of maternal origin (X-m) in 49.1% subjects while 50.9% had paternal origin (X-p). Skeletal anomalies were more common in X-m group, out of which prevalence of short neck and short fourth metatarsal reached statistical significance (p=0.04 and 0.01 respectively). A strong correlation was observed between subject's baseline height standard deviation score (Ht SDS) and paternal height (r=0.593, p<0.001), maternal height (r=0.564, p<0.001) and mid-parental height (MPH) (r=0.372, p=0.047) in X-p group. This effect was not seen in X-m subjects whose baseline Ht SDS showed no significant correlation with maternal height, paternal height or MPH. No differences were detected between the groups with regard to biochemical profile or body composition.
   Conclusions: We speculate that the differences in skeletal anomalies and height correlations between X-m and X-p groups could be due to the modifying effect of epigenetic signature on short stature homeobox (SHOX) gene of X-m. SHOX gene is not modified on X-p thereby explaining the paucity of skeletal changes and height correlations in X-p subjects.

AB  - Objective Knowledge about COVID-19 in children is limited due to the paucity of reported data. The pediatric age group comprises only less than 5% of total COVID-19 worldwide, therefore, large studies in this population are unlikely in the immediate future. Hence, we planned to synthesize the current data that will help in a better understanding of COVID-19 in children. Evidence acquisition Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We included studies reporting disease characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients aged less than 19 years. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates of various disease characteristics. Results 27 studies (4857 patients) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review, from a total of 883 records. About half of the patients had each of fever and cough, 11% (6-17%) had fast breathing, and 6-13% had gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the patients had mild to moderate disease, and only 4% had a severe or critical illness. Leukopenia was the commonest reported laboratory abnormality. Conclusion Even among the symptomatic COVID-19 cases, severe manifestations are seen in very few children. Though fever and respiratory symptoms are most common, many children also have gastrointestinal manifestations.

AB  - Background and Introduction: Patients with brachial plexus avulsion (BPA) injuries often suffer from chronic disabling drug refractory neuropathic pain. Dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning is currently the most effective surgical procedure for this intractable brachial neuralgia following BPA. Objective: To demonstrate a novel technique of "Micro-scissor DREZotomy" developed at our institution.
   Procedure: A 55-year-old gentleman underwent right cervical microscissor DREZotomy for post BPA neuralgia. Exclusive use of microscissors along the posterolateral sulcus, causing mechanical disruption of the nociceptive pathways through sharp dissection, results in precise lesioning with excellent pain free outcomes.
   Results: The patient had complete relief of the pain and uneventful recovery following the surgery and remains to be pain free at 1 year follow up.
   Conclusion: Microscissor DREZotomy is a simple cost-effective technique. It can easily be performed in the peripheral centers with limited resources and is a safe and effective technique in experienced hands.

AB  - Background. Functional neurological symptom disorder presents with varied neurological signs often as a result of stress. It is usually treated with supportive psychotherapy and occasionally antidepressants. Literature regarding treatment for resistant cases is scarce. We describe on such presentation.
   Case presentation. A 40-year-old man who presented with a history of sudden onset dysphonia for 5 days. There were no immediate stressors. Physical examination revealed that he was unable to make movements of the tongue while speaking although power and range of movement were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of brain and endoscopic examination of oral cavity and larynx did not reveal any organic cause. Functional magnetic resonance imaging imaging was conducted under a language protocol to determine neurophysiological circuits involved in this unique presentation. The patient failed conventional pharmacotherapy and supportive psychotherapy. Thereafter, he underwent lorazepam-assisted interviews where he would be asked to made purposive movements of the tongue and attempt to pronounce basic phonemes. He would converse normally during the lorazepam interviews and made gradual improvements after each session. The patient was able speak clearly after 12 such sessions and continues to maintain well since.
   Conclusions. We describe a resistant case of functional dysphonia. The patient presented without any stressor and failed conventional treatments. The case demonstrates that Lorazepam can be used effectively in drug-assisted interviews for functional dysphonia. It also provides information regarding functional activity of the brain during a dissociative state.

AB  - Photoreceptor cells undergo changes with aging. It is unknown if their microtubules are stable or not with aging. This study examined photoreceptor cell ultrastructure from 18 human donor retinas (32 eyes; age: 45-94 years) and quantified the photoreceptors with altered microtubules over six to ninth decades in four defined retinal regions. In addition, immunoreactivity (IR) to micmtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), tau and hyper-phophorylated tau was performed in retinal sections from companion eyes. In young donor retinas below 75 years of age, microtubules appeared straight in photoreceptor inner segments and axons. With age, they appeared bent or misaligned in macular and mid-peripheral photoreceptors. In addition, dense granular materials were present in photoreceptor axons and synaptic terminals in advanced ages. In all decades, rod microtubules were affected more than their cone counterparts (28% vs 15%, p < 0.005). Both rods and cones were significantly affected in mid-peripheral retina (5-8 mm outside the macular border) in eighth decade, compared to other decades or retinal regions (parafoveal, perifoveal and nasal) examined (p < 0.005). IR showed a steady expression of MAP-2 in inner segments, and tau in inner segments to axons below 75 years of age, but was absent for both markers in scattered macular and mid-peripheral photoreceptors in advanced ages (>75 years). IR to hyperphosphorylated tau was present mainly in inner retina and increased with aging. Markers of oxidative stress, e.g., lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy 2-nonenal) and nitmsative stress (nitrotyrosine) were immunopositive in aged photoreceptors. The sporadic loss of MAP-2 and tau-IR in photoreceptors may be due to microtubule changes; all these changes may affect intracellular transport and be partly responsible for photoreceptor death in aged human retina.

AB  - Background: Aphasia is a common consequence of stroke. To optimize recovery, it becomes critical as there are early identification and treatment of language deficits. The rising burden of stroke aphasia and lack of screening tools in the Indian context necessitates the need for a screening tool. Objective: We aimed to adapt and validate the Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test (FAST) to the Indian context in two widely spoken Indian languages, Telugu and Kannada, for the literate and illiterate population. Methods: A systematic process of adaptation and culturally appropriate modifications of the original FAST were done in 116 healthy controls and 115 patients. The validity of the adapted test was established. Results: The optimum cut-off values for detecting aphasia in our sample ranged from 25 to 25.5 (literate) and 13.5 to 15.5 (illiterate) with high sensitivity and specificity. There was also a significant correlation between aphasia scores for adapted FAST and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), establishing good convergent validity. Discussion: Results of the adaptation and validation of two Indian versions of FAST, suggest that it is an easy-to-use screening measure for detecting stroke-related language disabilities. The psychometric properties of the Indian version of FAST met the standardised requirements for adaptation and validation. Conclusions: The Indian version of FAST was found to be a reliable and valid bedside screening tool for aphasia in stroke patients. We aim that this study will facilitate the use of the test across other Indian languages and a large clinical population in the future.

AB  - Efficacy of neo-adjuvant therapy depends on the used regimens. There are contradictory findings regarding relative efficacy of these regimens. Accordingly, present study assessed the relative efficacy of Anthracyclines, Taxanes and added targeted therapies in neo-adjuvant setting simultaneously with a focus on tumor response and breast conserving surgery among breast cancer patients. The network meta-analysis model was used. Ranking of treatment was done by surface under cumulative ranking curve for each regimen. Out of 1286 screened records obtained by searching PubMed and Cochrane register of controlled trials, a total of 34 studies randomizing 12,630 breast cancer patients were included. Network meta-analysis for pathological complete response (pCR) revealed Addition of targeted therapies especially Trastuzumab for HER2 + breast cancer and Bevacizumab for HER2- breast cancer along with Anthracyclines and/or Taxanes based chemotherapy significantly improves pCR but with increased haematological toxicities. All the regimens performed similar in terms of breast conserving surgery rates.

AB  - Background. Tumours of the eyelid are a rare subgroup of neoplasms with varied histology and inherent differences in clinical behaviour. Surgery is the standard of care, and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is given in the presence of features suggesting a high risk of local recurrence. The treatment of lymph nodes in the neck is debatable. We reviewed the utility of RT for lymph nodes in the neck in patients with malignant tumours of the eyelid. Methods. We reviewed medical records of all patients with tumours of the eyelid treated at our centre from July 2006 to December 2014 for their demographic, clinical profile, treatment details and outcome. Results. The records of 37 patients were included for analysis, of these 34 underwent surgery and 21 received adjuvant RT. Their median age was 60 (range 30-85) years. Sebaceous cell carcinoma was the most common (50.4%). The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 35 months (95% CI 17.9-52.0). The 1- and 3-year DFS were 82.7% and 45%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed a superior outcome with early stage (T1) tumours (p=0.01), RT dose of >= 60 Gy and those underwent lymph node dissection (p=0.03). The presence of high-risk factors including close or positive margin had an inferior outcome with a trend towards statistical significance (p=0.06). Conclusion. We found a favourable outcome with early T stage, RT dose of >= 60 Gy and lymph node dissection. High-risk histopathological features including close margins and positive lymph nodes merit adjuvant RT including regional lymph nodes.

AB  - Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often difficult because of distinct and subjective clinical features, especially in the early stage. FOXO3a protein present in the cognitive centre of brain in inferior temporal region and parahippocampus. FOXO3a can be a potential novel target against AD. AD, Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) and Geriatric Control (GC) were recruited after diagnosis by clinical assessment, MRI, TauPET and FDG-PET. We have quantified serum FOXO3a by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and compare with TauPET between of AD, MCI patients and GC. Serum FOXO3A was significantly lower in AD (1.42 +/- 0.09 ng/mu l) compare to MCI (1.61 +/- 0.14 ng/mu l) and GC (1.89 +/- 0.07 ng/mu l). However, the Tau was higher in AD both in serum and also in PET scan. Serum pTau was significantly over-expressed in AD (0.176 +/- 0.03 ng/mu l), compare to other groups; MCI (0.16 +/- 0.014 ng/mu l) and GC (0.15 +/- 0.024 ng/mu l). Serum FOXO3A could significantly differentiate AD vs MCI, MCI vs GC and AD vs GC. However, Tau protein could only differentiate AD vs GC but not MCI vs GC. Serum FOXO3A may serve as novel blood marker for early detection for AD and target for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - The Adverse Effect of COVID Pandemic on the Care of Patients With Kidney Diseases in India
T2  - KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL REPORTS
KW  - coronavirus disease
KW  - dialysis
KW  - lockdown
KW  - pandemic
AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the care of patients with noncommunicable diseases, including those suffering from kidney-related ailments. Many parts of the world, including India, adopted lockdown to curb community transmission of disease. The lockdown affected transportation, access to health care facilities, and availability of medicines and consumables as well as outpatient and inpatient services. We aimed to analyze the effect of lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of patients with kidney diseases in India.
   Methods: We surveyed 19 major hospitals (8 in the public and 11 in the private sector) to determine the effect of lockdown on the care of patients with kidney disease, including those on dialysis after the first 3 weeks of lockdown.
   Results: The total number of dialysis patients in these centers came down from 2517 to 2404. Approximately 710 (28.2%) patients missed 1 or more dialysis sessions, 69 (2.74%) required emergency dialysis sessions, 104 (4.13%) stopped reporting for dialysis, and 9 (0.36%) were confirmed to have died. Outpatient attendance in the surveyed hospital came down by 92.3%, and inpatient service reduced by 61%. Tele-consultation was started but was accessed by only a small number of patients.
   Conclusion: Lack of preparedness before lockdown resulted in an interruption in health care services and posed an immediate adverse effect on the outcome of dialysis patients and patients with kidney disease in India. The long-term impact on the health of patients with less severe forms of kidney disease remains unknown. (C) 2020 International Society of Nephrology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Study 1: Evaluation of the signs of deficient posterior capsule in posterior polar cataracts using anterior segment optical coherence tomography
T2  - JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY
KW  - EYES
AB  - Purpose: To systematically observe and analyze the signs of deficient posterior capsule in posterior polar cataracts.
   Design: Ambispective observational study.
   Participants: Cases with posterior polar cataracts.
   Methods: Eyes with diagnosed posterior polar cataracts were imaged on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). A detailed assessment was performed to note the morphology of the posterior opacity, posterior capsule, and the common patterns to indicate their abnormality. In addition, generalized observation of the morphology was also performed about intraoperative surgical experiences.
   Results: A total of 101 eyes were included. Mean patient age was 52.85 +/- 10.72 years. The posterior capsule integrity was identified as intact in 91 eyes and abnormal/deficient in 10 eyes (9 had intraoperative defective capsule). These deficient/ abnormal morphologies were classified into 3 categories: conical (n = 2), moth- eaten (n = 5), and (3) ectatic (n = 3). Similarly, depending on the presence of hypoechoic spaces between the opacity and the capsule, remaining posterior polar cataracts were categorized into 2 generalized morphological types: without hypoechoic areas (n = 40) and with hypoechoic areas (n = 51). In the without hypoechoic areas group, 6 cases developed capsular rent; in the with hypoechoic areas group, 1 case developed capsular rent.
   Conclusions: In posterior polar cataracts, the deficient/abnormal capsular morphology could be specifically categorized into 3 categories, conical, moth-eaten, and ectatic types. In addition, to predict the ease of intraoperative separation between the opacity and the capsule, generalized categorization might help in better case management.

AB  - Background: India is now regarded as the country with one of the highest incidence of oral cancer in the world. Considering poor survival in cases with late diagnosis, early detection can reduce morbidity and mortality of cancer patients and may impede malignant transformation in cases of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD). Most of the diagnostic aids are expensive and not available for mass screenings in developing countries. There is a need to develop a sensitive and affordable technique for screening of oral cancer, which can be accurate even in hands of health care workers with limited experience. Fluorescein dye has been used for tumour detection in colon, stomach, breast and brain. However, its utility in the diagnosis of oral cancer and OPMD has not yet been explored.
   Methods: This is the first study to report the role of fluorescein in the detection of oral cancer and OPMD. The present cross sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care dental centre. It included 100 individuals presenting with 42 OPMDs, 40 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 18 controls.
   Results: The sensitivity and specificity for the fluorescein detection method for OPMDs and OSCC was found to be 96.6% and 52.4% respectively. The positive predictive value was 73.7% and the negative predictive value was 91.7% for the fluorescein method. The likelihood ratios stood at 2.03 for a positive test and 0.066 for a negative test.
   Conclusion: We conclude that fluorescein staining along with blue light is likely to improve detection of early oral cancers and dysplasia and can play a vital role in mass screening programmes of oral cancer.

KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Introduction: Comorbid depression and anxiety have been found to be highly present in patients suffering from chronic physical illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). These comorbid psychiatric conditions further reduce the quality of life (QOL) in the sufferers. The present study aimed to assess the association between depression, anxiety, and QOL among patients with DM and/or HTN.
   Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the outpatient setting of the medicine department of the tertiary care referral hospital of East Central Indian Railways. One hundred and twenty-three individuals of DM and/or HTN of more than 1-month duration were assessed for depression, anxiety, and QOL using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the World Health Organization QOL Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) version scale.
   Results: The mean age of the sample (53.7% had HTN, 12.2% had diabetes, and 34.1% had both HTN and diabetes) which comprised 87% males was 50.20 (+/- 6.0) years. The mean HADS (anxiety and depression) scores were 3.6 for both (range 0-14). Nearly 10.6% and 17.1% of the samples had scores above the cutoff for HADS anxiety and depression subscales. The WHOQOL-BREF scores were highest for the environmental domain and were lower for psychological, physical, and social domains. The HADS anxiety and depressive scores correlated significantly negatively with the WHOQOL-BREF physical and psychological domains. Female gender and the presence of an additional medical illness were significantly associated with higher HADS depression scores.
   Conclusion: Fair proportion of patients with HTN and/or diabetes has been affected with higher anxiety and depressive scores, which predicted a poor QOL. This calls for early identification of these mental health issues in sufferers of depression and HTN, which will facilitate an early holistic management.

AB  - Background Home-based newborn care has been found to reduce neonatal mortality in rural areas. Study evaluated effectiveness of home-based care delivered by specially recruited newborn care workers- Shishu Rakshak (SR) and existing workers- anganwadi workers (AWW) in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates. Methods This three-arm, community-based, cluster randomised trial was conducted in five districts in India. Intervention package consisted of pregnancy surveillance, health education, care at birth, care of normal/low birthweight neonates, identification and treatment of sick neonates and young infants using oral and injectable antibiotics and community mobilisation. The package was similar in both intervention arms-SR and AWW; difference being healthcare provider. The control arm received routine health services from the existing health system. Primary outcomes were neonatal and young infant mortality rates at 'endline' period (2008-2009) assessed by an independent team from January to April 2010 in the study clusters. Findings A total of 6623, 6852 and 5898 births occurred in the SR, AWW and control arms, respectively, during the endline period; the proportion of facility births were 69.0%, 64.4% and 70.6% in the three arms. Baseline mortality rates were comparable in three arms. During the endline period, the risk of neonatal mortality was 25% lower in the SR arm (adjusted OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99); the risks of early neonatal mortality, young infant mortality and infant mortality were also lower by 32%, 27%, and 33%, respectively. The risks of neonatal, early neonatal, young infant, infant mortality in the AWW arm were not different from that of the control arm. Interpretation Home-based care is effective in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates, when delivered by a dedicated worker, even in settings with high rates of facility births.

AB  - Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hyperinflation of the lungs leads to a remodeling of the inspiratory muscles that causes postural deformities and more labored breathing. Postural changes include elevated, protracted, or abducted scapulae with medially rotated humerus, and kyphosis that leads to further tightening of respiratory muscles. As the severity of the disease progresses, use of the upper limbs for functional tasks becomes difficult due to muscle stiffness. There are various studies that suggest different rehabilitation programs for COPD patients; however, to the best of our knowledge none recommends passive stretching techniques. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of respiratory muscle passive stretching on chest expansion and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Methods: Thirty patients were divided into two groups, experimental (n= 15) and control (n= 15). The experimental group received a hot pack followed by stretching of the respiratory muscles and relaxed passive movements of the shoulder joints. The control group received a hot pack followed by relaxed passive movements of the shoulder joints. Results: In the control group, there was no difference in chest expansion at the levels of both the axilla and the xiphisternum or in 6MWD between baseline and post treatment (p> 0.05). In the experimental group, chest expansion at the level of the axilla (p< 0.05) and 6MWD (p< 0.001) were significantly higher post treatment, while there was no difference in chest expansion at the level of the xiphisternum (p> 0.05). A comparison between control and experimental groups showed that chest expansion at the level of the axilla (p< 0.05) and 6MWD (p< 0.01) were significantly higher in the experimental group, while there was no difference in chest expansion at the level of the xiphisternum (p> 0.05). Conclusions: Although COPD is an irreversible disease, results of this study indicate that passive stretching of respiratory muscles can clinically improve the condition of such patients, especially in terms of chest expansion and 6MWD. Given the good effects of muscle stretching and the fact that such an exercise is harmless, clinicians and physiotherapists should consider including passive stretching of respiratory muscles in the rehabilitation plan of COPD patients.

AB  - Objectives: Evaluate and compare contraceptive efficacy, safety, continuation rates and duration of lactational amenorrhea (LA) in married lactating women (20-35 years) using the progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) or Copper-T380A intrauterine device (IUD) during the first postpartum year.
   Study design: We conducted a one-year multicenter, non-randomized, non-inferiority, open-label, comparative trial at 20 centers in India and compared efficacy, safety, continuation and LA plus feeding patterns and growth/well-being of participants' infants. Women used four 3-month PVRs consecutively (lost PVRs were not replaced) and were to breastfeed at least four times/day. We used Pearl Index (PI) and Kaplan Meier (K-M) rates to analyze pregnancy and K-M for continuation.
   Results: We enrolled 789 women (459 PVR, 330 IUD). Neither PI nor K-M one-year pregnancy rates differed significantly between groups (PI: PVR-0.62; IUD-0.35);(K-M: PVR-0.7; IUD-0.4, p = 0.58). Continuation rates at 12 months were 78.5% (IUD) vs. 56.9% (PVR) (p < 0.001). Ring expulsions and menorrhagia were the most common discontinuation among PVR/IUD users respectively. The median duration of LA among PVR vs. IUD users was 405 vs. 120 days (p < 0.001). Both groups reported similar adverse events (PVR: 24.2%; IUD: 23.0%); there were no serious adverse events among PVR users. Infants from both groups fed 12-7 times/day and grew at expected rates.
   Conclusions: Efficacy and safety outcomes were comparable among women in both groups. Continuation rates for PVR, a woman-controlled method, were shorter than IUD rates while PVR users maintained LA significantly longer than IUD users. Infant breastfeeding and growth patterns/well-being were favorable in both groups.
   Implications: PVR, a user-controlled device, offers an additional contraceptive choice for lactating women for one-year postpartum use and can help to address the unmet need for contraception among postpartum women while encouraging breastfeeding to enhance infant growth and well-being.

TI  - Managing Burns During COVID-19 Outbreak
T2  - JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
AB  - The coronavirus disease pandemic has affected our practice as healthcare professionals. As burn surgeons, we are obliged to provide the best possible care to our patients. however, due to the risk of viral transmission, the goal should be to provide safe care to our patients as well as ensure the safety of the whole team providing burn care. The burn patients are usually debilitated and require a prolonged hospital stay and multiple operative procedures which put them and everyone involved in their care at increased risk of coronavirus infections and transmission. This warrants special caution to the burn team while managing such patients. In this review, we aim to highlight the key considerations for burn care teams while dealing with burn patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - COVID-19 in health care workers - A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
KW  - TABLES
AB  - Background and objectives: It is essential to know the proportion of health care workers (HCW) who are COVID 19 positive, as well as the severity and mortality among them.
   Methods: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched from December-31, 2019 to April-23, 2020. The search was limited to the studies that reported the data on the number of COVID-19 positive healthcare workers, among the COVID-19 positive patients. Case reports, duplicate publications, reviews, and family-based studies were excluded. The methodological quality of studies was assessed by the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) tool.
   Results: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pooled eleven studies to investigate the above factors. The overall proportion of HCW who were SARS-CoV-2 positive among all COVID-19 patients was 10.1% (95% CI: 5.3-14.9). This proportion varied according to the country of study i.e. China (7 studies) - 4.2%, 95% CI:2.4-6.0; United States (3 studies) - 17.8%, 95%CI:7.5-28.0; and Italy (1 study) - 9.0%, 95%CI:8.6-9.4. The incidence of severe or critical disease in HCW(9.9%, 95%CI:0.8-18.9) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the incidence of severe or critical disease in all COVID-19 positive patients (29.4%, 95%CI:18.6-40.2). Similarly, the mortality among HCW (0.3%, 95%CI:0.2-0.4) was also significantly lower (p < 0.001) as compared to that of all patients (2.3%, 95%CI:2.2-2.4).
   Conclusion: Health care workers who are COVID-19 positive constituted a significant proportion of all COVID-19 patients; but the severity and mortality were lower among them. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Treatment of cancer is a major challenge even though the pathophysiology is becoming clearer with time. A number of new chemical entities are developed to target cancer growth inhibition, but the targeted delivery of these products still needs novel research. This is of utmost importance not only for higher efficacy but also for a reduction in systemic toxicity and cost of treatment. Although multiple novel targets and molecules are being researched, most of them could not pass the regulatory approval process, due to low benefit-risk ratio and lack of target specificity. Failure of a majority of these drugs was in part due to their superiority claimed via surrogate markers. Despite these, currently, more than 100 chemotherapeutic agents are in practice. This review paper discusses in detail the molecular basis, drug discovery, and pros and cons over conventional treatment approaches of three novel approaches in cancer therapy, i.e., (i) antibody-drug conjugates, (ii) cancer immunotherapy, and (iii) metronomic chemotherapy. All the drugs developed using these three novel approaches were compared against the established treatment regimens in clinical trials with clinical end points, such as overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life.

AB  - The acute encephalopathy occurring in children in Muzaffarpur, India, also recognised in other litchi-cultivating areas of India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and China, had previously been linked to litchi consumption. Recently, it has been identified as hypoglycaemic encephalopathy of an unusual aetiology with three key factors: undernutrition, prolonged fasting and litchi consumption. A second set of investigators has independently reconfirmed the diagnosis and the three-factor aetiology. Skipping the evening meal with an intake of large amounts of Litchi in undernourished children is causative. Early-morning hypoglycaemia with an inadequate glycogen store leads to initiation of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation, but methylene cyclopropyl alanine and glycine present in the litchi aril block the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. The outcomes are uncorrected hypoglycaemia and encephalopathy due to the entry of metabolic intermediates that cross the blood-brain barrier and affect neuronal function. Suggested measures include early 10% dextrose infusion. Awareness about the disease is of prime importance. The diagnosis and aetiopathogenesis are still under question from a part of the scientific community. This review was undertaken to present a comprehensive view of hypoglycaemic encephalopathy and to remove some of the Lingering doubts.

AB  - Aim: The present study aimed to compare the social cognition (SC) deficits in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls and evaluate the association of SC deficits with socio-occupational functioning, insight, quality of life, and stigma.
   Methods: This study included 30 patients with FEP in remission phase and 26 healthy controls matched for age, gender, education, and intelligent quotient. SC was assessed on the domains of theory of mind (ToM), social perception, and attributional bias.
   Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with FEP had significantly higher deficits in the domains of second-order ToM (unpaired t = 4.447, P < 0.001) and Faux Pas Composite Index (unpaired t = 2.824, P = 0.007). In the correlation analysis, higher age of patients with FEP was significantly associated with more externalizing bias (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.38, P = 0.039) and those with lower level of education had more social cognitive deficits in the domains of Faux Pas Composite Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.43, P = 0.018), Social Perception Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.38, P = 0.04), and Nonsocial Perception Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.5, P = 0.005). Duration of untreated psychosis was associated with higher deficits in the first-order ToM (Pearson's correlation coefficient = -0.38, P = 0.04) and Externalizing Bias Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient = -0.49, P = 0.006). Longer duration of treatment was associated with higher impairment in first-order ToM index (Pearson's correlation coefficient = -0.42, P = 0.02). General psychopathology and total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score correlated significantly with externalizing bias, with a higher level of psychopathology associated with more severe deficits in this domain. There was no correlation of SC with the quality of life, cognitive insight, and stigma (except for occasional correlation of stereotype endorsement and externalizing bias).
   Conclusion: The present study suggests that compared to healthy controls, patients with FEP have impairment in the domains of second-order ToM and Faux Pas Composite Index. However, social cognitive deficits have only a few correlations with various psychosocial outcomes of FEP.

AB  - Objective: To compare short term results of autologous rectus fascia pubovaginal sling surgery with synthetic transobturator vaginal tape procedure in treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI)
   Study design: It was a comparative study on 30 women between 25-65 years of age with urodynamic proven SUI who were randomly allocated to autologous rectus fascia pubovaginal sling surgery (Group I) (15 women) and synthetic transobturator vaginal tape procedure (Group II) (15 women). Preoperative and postoperative ICIQ (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire) score, urodynamic study and serum CRP and IL-6 were done in all cases.
   Results: The baseline characteristics in terms of age, body mass index (BMI), parity, mean ICIQ score and mean preoperative CRP and IL-6 levels were similar in two groups. Mean operative time was significantly longer (55.60 +/- 5.77 vs 25.27 +/- 4.32 minutes, p = 0.001) in group I than group II. Mean hospital stay of 7.1 +/- 1.2 vs 1.2 +/- 0.4 days, mean duration of catheterization 5.8 vs 1.2 day (<0.01) and postoperative urinary retention requiring recathterization were all significantly higher in group I than II. Wound infection was more in group I than in group II (p = 0.01) while groin pain was significantly more in group II (p = 0.01). One patient developed vesicovaginal fistula, while one patient required cutting of tape in group I. Pdet at Q max (Detrusor pressure at peak urine flow) increased significantly in both the groups after surgery. ICIQ score was zero in both the groups indicating 100 % success. Surgical trauma was more in group I as shown by significantly higher CRP levels.
   Conclusion: The success rate of the two groups was similar but, autologous rectus fascia sling surgery took longer, had more complications and urinary retention as compared to transobturator vaginal tape procedure. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Posttraumatic hydrocephalus (PTH) adds to the morbidity and mortality of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and there are insufficient clinical data to suggest usefulness of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) over endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in PTH or vice versa.
   Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of VPS and ETV in the treatment of PTH and to establish the indications for their usage.
   Materials and Methods: This was an ambispective study of 141 patients who developed PTH out of 2500 cases of TBI treated during the study duration (2012-2016). These patients were segregated into two groups depending on the primary procedure for PTH-ETV group and VPS group. The two groups were compared to analyze the differences in radiological and clinical outcome.
   Results: 141 patients were included in the study and 175 procedures were performed in these patients. ETV group had 30 procedures and VPS had 145 procedures. In the ETV group, 37% of cases showed improvement v/s 73% cases in the VPS group. A statistically significant number of patients had improvement in presenting symptoms in the VPS group, as compared with the ETV group (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at discharge (P = 0.15) and Glasgow outcome score at 6 months of follow-up (P = 0.22) between the two groups. Poor GCS, previous cerebrospinal fluid infection, and postoperative meningitis were found to have significant effect on the failure-free period of the procedure. On comparing the probabilities of failure-free period of ETV v/s VPS, the chances of VPS failure are 61% lesser than ETV.
   Conclusions: VPS is an effective modality for the management of PTH and has a much lower failure rate as compared to ETV. However, ETV can be considered as a salvage procedure in difficult situations of recurrent shunt malfunction or infection.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies have revolutionized the management of patients with NSCLC and have led to unprecedented improvements in response rates and survival in a subset of patients with this fatal disease. However, the available therapies work only for a minority of patients, are associated with substantial societal cost, and may lead to considerable immune-related adverse events. Therefore, patient selection must be optimized through the use of relevant biomarkers. Programmed death-ligand 1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry is widely used today for the selection of programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC; however, this approach lacks robust sensitivity and specificity for predicting response. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), or the number of somatic mutations derived from next-generation sequencing techniques, has been widely explored as an alternative or complementary biomarker for response to ICIs. In theory, a higher TMB increases the probability of tumor neoantigen production and therefore, the likelihood of immune recognition and tumor cell killing. Although TMB alone is a simplistic surrogate of this complex interplay, it is a quantitative variable that can be relatively readily measured using currently available sequencing techniques. A large number of clinical trials and retrospective analyses, employing both tumor and blood-based sequencing tools, have evaluated the performance of TMB as a predictive biomarker, and in many cases reveal a correlation between high TMB and ICI response rates and progression-free survival. Many challenges remain before the implementation of TMB as a biomarker in clinical practice. These include the following: (1) identification of therapies whose response is best informed by TMB status; (2) robust definition of a predictive TMB cut point; (3) acceptable sequencing panel size and design; and (4) the need for robust technical and informatic rigor to generate precise and accurate TMB measurements across different laboratories. Finally, effective prediction of response to ICI therapy will likely require integration of TMB with a host of other potential biomarkers, including tumor genomic driver alterations, tumor-immune milieu, and other features of the host immune system. This perspective piece will review the current clinical evidence for TMB as a biomarker and address the technical sequencing considerations and ongoing challenges in the use of TMB in routine practice.

AB  - Objective To determine the association between malocclusion and the severity of dental caries among children and adolescents in the permanent dentition. Method. A search was conducted in Medlin, Cochrane databases, Google scholar, Scopus and Web of Science through October 2020 for studies of malocclusion and dental caries among children and adolescents using the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI) and the Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index. Quality was evaluami using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool for cross-sectional studies. Data were extracted using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Meta-analysis used the Cochrane Program Review Manager Version 5. A random effects model was used to assess the association among different categories of malocclusion with dental caries. GRADE analysis assessed the certainty of evidence. Results: Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Handicapping malocclusion was significantly associated with higher mean DMFT scores (Mean difference: 1.03, 95% CI, 0.61, 1.44). Participants with severe malocclusion had higher mean DMFT when compared to subjects with normal occlusion (0.32, 95% CI, 0.13, 0.51). Definite malocclusion was also associated with higher mean DMFT scores (Mean difference: 0.19, 95% CI, 0.03, -0.35). Conclusion: Malocclusion is associated with dental caries in the permanent dentition. DMFT scores and the strength of the association increased with severity of malocclusion. Low to moderate certainty of evidence was observed for association between handicapping, severe, and definite malocclusion with dental caries.

AB  - Background: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) can be derived from various tissue sources and differentiated into dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons using various types of inducers. There are several strategies that have been reported to generate functional dopaminergic neuronal cells from hMSCs in the most efficient manner possible. However, this area is still under extensive research. In this study, we aim to compare hMSCs derived from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AD) and dental pulp (DP) to generate functional dopaminergic neurons, using FGF2 and forskolin. Post-differentiation, multiple factors were used to characterize the cells at morphological, morphometric, ultra-structural, mRNA and protein levels for various markers (Nestin, NF, MAP2, Tuj1, TH, DAT, PitX3, Ngn2, Kv4.2, SCN5A). Cells' functionality was studied by calcium ion imaging, along with the amount of dopamine secreted by the cells in the culture medium. Results: Data analysis revealed that forskolin has comparable effect on BM- and AD-derived MSC (28.43% and 29.46% DAergic neurons, respectively), whereas DP-MSC (42.78 +/- 1.248% DAergic neurons) show better outcome in terms of efficient generation of DAergic neuronal cells, expression of neuronal associated markers, dopamine release and calcium ion efflux. Ultra-structural studies by SEM and TEM also revealed a substantial change in both cellular morphology and composition of cellular organelles. It was observed that AD-MSCs showed the best neuronal features, at morphological, gene, and protein levels upon induction with the above-mentioned induction cocktail. Conclusion: It may be concluded that a combination of FGF2 and forskolin yields functionally active dopaminergic neuronal cells in vitro, with highest percentage of the same from AD-MSCs, as compared to that in BM-MSCs and DP-MSCs. The outcomes and comparative evaluation provide a substantial platform for further studies on molecular pathways involved in the process of DAergic neurogenesis in individual cases.

AB  - The DNA and protein complex known as chromatin is subject to posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that regulate cellular functions such that PTM dysregulation can lead to disease, including cancer. One critical PTM is acetylation/ deacetylation, which is being investigated as a means to develop targeted cancer therapies. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) family of proteins performs histone acetylation. In humans, MOF (hMOF), a member of the MYST family of HATs, acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac). MOF-mediated acetylation plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and embryonic stem cell development. Functionally, MOF is found in two distinct complexes: NSL (nonspecific lethal) in humans and MSL (male-specific lethal) in flies. The NSL complex is also able to acetylate additional histone H4 sites. Dysregulation of MOF activity occurs in multiple cancers, including ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. Bioinformatics analysis of KATS, the gene encoding hMOF, indicated that it is highly overexpressed in kidney tumors as part of a concerted gene coexpression program that can support high levels of chromosome segregation and cell proliferation. The linkage between MOF and tumor proliferation suggests that there are additional functions of MOF that remain to be discovered.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate an ergonomically improved microforceps, which is a neurosurgical instrument used in microscopic procedures. The distance between tips of microforceps becomes large at high magnification of the operating microscope. This results in tips moving out of view and causes ergonomic discomfort.
   METHODS: The design criteria for ergonomic microforceps were defined, which primarily involved a reduction in the distance between tips and applied force. Computer models of the existing and modified microforceps were created and fabricated using direct metal laser sintering. Ten neurosurgeons validated the developed instrument and provided feedback. In objective validation, video feed of the operating microscope was marked and analyzed by an expert neurosurgeon.
   RESULTS: In subjective validation, most of the neurosurgeons endorsed the ergonomic improvements. The parameters, including microforceps tips moving out of view (P = 0.0005), suture holding attempts (P = 0.001), and needle holding attempts (P = 0.03), were found to be statistically improved (Mann-Whitney U test), whereas the average time taken to tie 1 knot was not statistically improved (P = 0.06). The ergonomic modification also resulted in a reduction of applied force by 47.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Validation results show that the developed instrument provides several ergonomic benefits for the microsuturing task under high magnification of the operating microscope.

AB  - Cervical split cord malformations are extremely rare with less than 75 cases reported in the literature worldwide. The widely different terminologies used to describe the same pathoanatomy make the documentation of all reported cases a difficult task. We conducted a systematic review of 71 cases documented over 38 reports from 1889 to 2016. The controversy regarding prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic individuals remains. We advocate prophylactic surgery in all asymptomatic individuals to preclude severe neurological deficit following trivial trauma in future. The results of surgery in asymptomatic individuals are excellent while those in symptomatic individuals are good as well.

Limited data on PLA2R-related MN in Indians exist in literature, and THSD7A-related MN remains undocumented in this population. We aimed to characterize the baseline PLA2R and THSD7A profile of adult and pediatric membranous nephropathy (MN) in a large Indian single-institution cohort.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of all cases of MN (primary and secondary) between 2014 and 2017 was performed with PLA2R direct immunofluorescence and THSD7A immunohistochemistry on the biopsies and anti-PLA2R enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on baseline sera.
   Results: MN constituted 10% of kidney biopsies received in the study period. A total of 216 cases with adequate tissue underwent PLA2R direct immunofluorescence, and 110 of them had available sera for PLA2R ELISA. Combining both testing methods, the prevalence of PLA2R-related primary MN was 72.8%, with moderate concordance between the 2 methods (kappa 0.61). PLA2R was also detected in 16.7% cases of secondary MN, most commonly lupus MN. THSD7A immunohistochemistry performed on 176 cases showed a prevalence of 3.4% in primary MN. One case of lupus MN was also positive for THSD7A. Dual positivity (PLA2R and THSD7A) was noted in 2 cases. The large pediatric cohort tested showed a prevalence of 44% of PLA2R based on tissue testing, whereas 1 case demonstrated THSD7A positivity.
   Conclusion: This study in a large cohort of Indian patients demonstrates prevalence rates of PLA2R- and THSD7A-related MN similar to world literature, including the substantial cohort of pediatric MN. It also confirms variation in MN in the form of outliers within PLA2R (related to tissue and serum testing), dual positivity for PLA2R and THSD7A, and PLA2R/THSD7A-positive secondary MN.

AB  - Post fever retinitis (PFR), characterized by multiple cotton wool spot like lesions in the posterior pole, is commonly reported following viral and bacterial infections. Retinal perfusion defects have been documented with the help of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in cases of PFR. But long term changes in such cases have not been reported earlier. In the following report, we have described the swept-source OCTA findings of two PFR patients at initial presentation and three years follow-up. Initial OCTA scans may not provide accurate information regarding the perfusion status due to associated retinal edema and inflammation. However, persisting perfusion defects at the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus were noted on long term follow-up in both the cases.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed immense challenges for healthcare workers, among them are procedures related to suctioning of bodily fluids during surgery or intensive care. These procedures are potentially aerosol-generating and can lead to disease transmission. We have modified the usual suction apparatus in a simple and easy to do manner so that all suctioned material first passes through the 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution, which is virucidal and decontaminates the suctioned material. This innovation may help in addressing the safety concerns of all healthcare providers working in operation rooms and intensive care units.

AB  - An extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicking architecture was introduced with gelatin glycosaminoglycans like hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate and a triterpenoid using asiatic acid, possessing biodegradable and biocompatible properties that mark the functionality for the treatment of second-degree burn wounds. In the present work, a foam-based scaffold was fabricated and sterilized with gamma radiation at a 2.5 Mrad dose. The scaffolds were further characterized for morphology, swelling, degradation behaviour, release of bioactive components, ATR-FTIR, mechanical, thermal properties and compared with control.In vitrocytocompatibility of the developed scaffold was studied with L929 mouse fibroblast cells and human mesenchymal stem cells based on deoxyribonucleic acid and lactate dehydrogenase assay. Additionally, the developed scaffold was evaluated for its biocompatibility on the Wistar rat to assess any toxicity induced to the animal based on blood biochemistry and histopathology analysis. Finally, we assessed the efficacy of developed foam scaffolds on the second-degree burn wound-induced Wistar rat with a scaffold alone and a scaffold seeded with human bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a wound healing study for 28 d. The wound contraction assay, histopathology, immunohistochemistry analysis and pro-healing marker quantification using hexosamine, hydroxyproline, and pro-inflammatory markers like TNF-alpha and MMP-2 were carried out and compared with the commercially available wound dressing. The results revealed that foam-based ECM mimic was cytocompatible, biocompatible and biodegradable in 18 +/- 3 d inin vivoconditions and the scaffold fostered the process of healing of second-degree burns within 28 d of treatment. The obtained result proved that the scaffold has a potential for clinical settings in second-degree burn wound treatment.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate morphological characteristics and intraoperative dynamics of posterior polar cataract (PPC) using intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT).
   Setting: Rajendra Prasad Center for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Design: Prospective interventional study.
   Methods: Forty eyes with PPC undergoing phacoemulsification were evaluated. Primary outcome measure was morphology of PPC and intraoperative dynamics of posterior capsule (PC). Secondary outcome measure was PC rent, which was retrospectively compared with 72 PPC cases that underwent non-iOCT-guided surgery.
   Results: Of the 40 eyes evaluated, 3 morphological variants of PPC were observed: type I (19/40 [47.5%]) characterized by intact PCand clearance between PC and opacity, type II (12/40 [30%]) with intact PC in periphery of opacity, shadowing, and inability to detect PC in the center, and type III (9/40 [22.5%]) with dense opacity, extensive shadowing, and inability to delineate PC. In addition to hydrodelineation, hydrodissectionwas performed in all cases of type I PPC. In types II and III PPC, only hydrodelineation was performed. No case with type I opacity developed PC dehiscence. Three cases (7.5%) with types II (1 eye) and III (2 eyes) PPC developed PC dehiscence during aspiration of epinuclear cushion. Intraocular lens was implanted in all cases in the bag or sulcus. There was no significant difference in PC dehiscence between iOCT-guided and non-iOCTguided surgery (P = .7).
   Conclusions: iOCT-guided surgery helps to elucidate intraoperative dynamics in PPC and assess real-time PC integrity. It characterizes high-risk morphological features, enables safe hydrodissection in a subset of PPC, but does not decrease the incidence of PC dehiscence.

AB  - Traditionally, gross cardiac anatomy has been described mainly based on the findings in the dissection suite. Analyses of heart specimens have contributed immensely towards building a fundamental knowledge of cardiac anatomy. However, there are limitations in analyzing the autopsied heart removed from the thorax. Three-dimensional imaging allows visualization of the blood-filled heart in vivo in attitudinally appropriate fashion. This is of paramount importance for not only demonstration of cardiac anatomy for educational purposes, but also for the detailed anatomical evaluation in patients with acquired and congenital heart disease. In this review, we discuss the advantages of three-dimensional imaging, specifically focusing on virtual dissection, a volume rendering-based reconstruction technique using computed tomographic data. We highlight examples of three-dimensional imaging in both education and guiding patient management.

AB  - Chikungunya has re-emerged as an epidemic with global distribution and high morbidity, necessitating the need for effective therapeutics. We utilized already approved drugs with a good safety profile used in other diseases for their new property of anti-chikungunya activity. It provides a base for a fast and efficient approach to bring a novel therapy from bench to bedside by the process of drug-repositioning. We utilized an in-silico drug screening with FDA approved molecule library to identify inhibitors of the chikungunya nsP2 protease, a multifunctional and essential non-structural protein required for virus replication. Telmisartan, an anti-hypertension drug, and the antibiotic novobiocin emerged among top hits on the screen. Further, SPR experiments revealed strong in vitro binding of telmisartan and novobiocin to nsP2 protein. Additionally, small angle x-ray scattering suggested binding of molecules to nsP2 and post-binding compaction and retention of monomeric state in the protein inhibitor complex. Protease activity measurement revealed that both compounds inhibited nsP2 protease activity with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. More importantly, plaque formation assays could show the effectiveness of these drugs in suppressing virus propagation in host cells. We propose novobiocin and telmisartan as potential inhibitors of chikungunya replication. Further research is required to establish the molecules as antivirals of clinical relevance against chikungunya.

AB  - Amyloidosis is a disorder resulting from the deposition of fibrillary protein in the extracellular tissue and can be classified into primary, secondary, familial, and senile types. Isolated lymph node amyloidosis without any other organ involvement is very rarely seen in clinical parlance, and diagnosis remains very challenging owing to nonspecific imaging findings. We present a case of 50-year-old man with lymphadenopathy, which was later confirmed to be amyloidosis on biopsy and serum-free light chain assay with efficacious use of F-18-FDG PET/CT for response assessment to bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.

AB  - Aim Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare tumors arising from a peripheral nerve or in extraneural soft tissue which shows high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. They can arise de-novo or through malignant transformation in neurofibromatosis (NF-1). The purpose of our study is to evaluate potential role of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) in prognostication and management of MPNSTs. Materials and methods We have performed a retrospective analysis in patients of MPNSTs who underwent(18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging for staging and restaging. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) and texture parameters (calculated using radiomics package version 0.1.3) were measured for primary/recurrent lesions and were compared between two groups based on presence of event (recurrence/progression). Studentt-test was applied for comparative analyses using the SPSS software package (version 23.0; IBM), with a significance level of 0.05. Results Thirty patients (17 male, 13 female; mean age 42.7 +/- 15.66 years) were included, who underwent(18)F-FDG PET/CT for staging (n = 10) and restaging (n = 20). Change in management was observed in four patients at baseline and in three patients in follow-up imaging for response assessment, who had progressive disease which prompted treatment intensification. SUVmax of primary/recurrent lesion showed correlation with histopathologic grade (r = 0.712,P = 0.034). Textural analysis showed more heterogeneity in lesions in the high-risk group with recurrence and progression. Conclusion F-18-FDG PET/CT can be used for staging and restaging in MPNSTs leading to change in management. Texture analysis and quantitative(18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters can help in prognostication at both baseline and relapse.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Defect in internal elastic lamina, defect in tunica media, and the amount of collagen and elastin play a role in vessel wall weakening leading to aneurysm formation. A similar picture may be found in connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), neurofibromatosis type 1, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), where there is a predominant disorder of collagen formation/maturation.
   METHODS: Histopathology of skin and the superficial temporal artery (STA) was done. All specimens were obtained during craniotomy for ruptured aneurysm clipping or other indicated procedures (for control subjects). Parameters in skin biopsy seen were epithelial thickness, dermal collagen thickness, and so forth. For the STA, parameters such as intimal thickness, intimal proliferation, thickness of media, and so forth were studied.
   RESULTS: Twenty cases and twenty control subjects were studied. The mean age of the study population was 40.5 years. Salient findings on skin biopsy in patients of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) (cases) were haphazard orientation of collagen, inflammation in the subepidermal layer, increased dermal collagen thickness, and reduced and/or fragmented elastic fibers. Prominent findings on vessel wall biopsy were intimal proliferation, reduplication of internal elastic lamina, reduced and/or fragmented elastin, and vacuolation of smooth muscle cells. The average number of aberrations per patient was significantly higher in cases than control subjects.
   CONCLUSIONS: The histologic changes seen in skin and the STA in cases of IAs signify a weak connective tissue. Some of these findings are also seen in known connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, EDS, neurofibromatosis type 1, and LDS. The connective tissue abnormalities found in patients with IAs may be congenital, which gets further accentuated by known risk factors leading to weak vessel wall and subsequent aneurysm formation.

AB  - Ophthalmic genetics is a much needed and growing area in India. Ethnic diversity, with a high degree of consanguinity, has led to a high prevalence of genetic disorders in the country. As the second most populous country in the world, this naturally results in a significant number of affected people overall. Practice involves coherent association between ophthalmologists, genetic counselor and pediatricians. Eye genetics in India in recent times has witnessed advanced research using cutting edge diagnostics, next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches, stem cell therapies, gene therapy and genomic editing. This article will highlight the studies reporting genetic variations in the country, challenges in practice, and the latest advances in ophthalmic genetic research in India.

AB  - Aim We compared the performance of plasma lactate with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and paediatric sepsis-related organ failure assessment (pSOFA) score for predicting mortality in septic children. Methods Serial plasma lactate and hs-CRP levels and pSOFA score was assessed during early hospital stay in septic children. Results Out of 149 participants, 45 died. Plasma lactate at 0 h and 6 h was significantly higher, and lactate clearance was significantly lower in non-survivors. The optimal cut-off of plasma lactate at 6h for identifying mortality was 2.5 mmol/L (sensitivity 85% and specificity 74%). pSOFA score had the best predictive ability for mortality (AUC 0.89) followed by hs-CRP at 0 h (AUC 0.86), hs-CRP at 48 h (AUC 0.83), plasma lactate levels at 6 h (AUC 0.83), and plasma lactate at 0 h (AUC 0.67). Conclusion pSOFA score, hs-CRP and hyperlactemia at 6 h can identify septic children at risk of dying.

AB  - Background: Anticholinergic drugs are associated with significant cognitive and other adverse events in older adults, including those with Parkinson's disease (PD). Anticholinergic effects are considered lesser in younger individuals and the burden and outcomes in younger patients with PD are unknown.
   Objectives: To determine the cumulative anticholinergic burden in a cohort of younger of patients with PD and to correlate the same with cognitive impairment and freezing of gait (FOG).
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to identify the cumulative anticholinergic burden from medications prescribed to patients with PD. Two standard scales, the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale and the ACB score, were used to calculate the anticholinergic burden from prescriptions. We identified commonly prescribed drugs contributing to anticholinergic effects and correlated the cumulative ACB score with cognitive impairment (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale item 1.1) and FOG (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale items 2.13 and 3.11).
   Results: We recruited 287 patients with PD (68.9% male) with a mean age of 56.9 +/- 11.8 years and a duration of symptoms 6.3 +/- 6.9 years. Median ACB score was 4 (range 0-12). A total of 164 (58.4%) patients had total ACB score > 3. ACB score > 3 was independently associated with cognitive impairment (Odds Ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-4.53; P< 0.001) and FOG using patient-reported measures (Odds Ratio, 3.192; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.68-6.07; P< 0.001) and objective measures (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-4.6, P= 0.007).
   Conclusion: Patients with PD are exposed to significant anticholinergic burden from drugs prescribed for PD and non-PD indications. Higher anticholinergic burden is associated with cognitive impairment and FOG even in younger patients with PD.

AB  - A simple, efficient and transition metal-free strategy was established for the synthesis of highly functionalized, sterically hindered allylarenes (6,7&8) by base-mediated ring transformation of 2-oxo-6-aryl-4-(methylthio/sec-amino)-2H-pyran-3-carbonitriles (3/4) with 5-hexene-2-one (5). This provides a method for the synthesis of allylarenes functionalized with different electron donating and withdrawing groups in one pot. The structures of isolated products6cand7awere ascertained by spectroscopic and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. In addition, we have performed a molecular docking study to predict the biological activity of the synthesized molecules for binding to estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ER beta).

AB  - Background Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is an exceedingly rare malignancy, accounting for around 5% of all patients with chondrosarcoma. It is a translocation-related sarcoma that tends to have both local and distant recurrences. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment in localised cases however treatment of advanced cases remains a challenge. The rarity of the disease precludes dedicated clinical trials and hence guidelines for its management are not well defined. The dearth in literature makes it pertinent that the cases treated with newer therapies must be reported to contribute to existing knowledge. Case presentation We hereby report a case of a 39-year old male without any comorbidity presenting with pelvic pain and was diagnosed as mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the pelvis. He underwent an initial curative resection followed by a disease-free interval of 7 months. Subsequently, he was treated with pulmonary metastatectomy and local debulking surgery at time of initial relapse. He was then exposed to multiple lines of palliative chemotherapy, which limited our treatment options upon subsequent disease progression. Based on recent data, the patient was given trabectedin monotherapy as fourth line chemotherapy. He tolerated the therapy well and attained a progression-free survival of 12 months, which is an impactful figure in relapsed setting in this patient population. Conclusion This report aims to present a comprehensive review into available and newer treatment choices for mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and to highlight trabectedin monotherapy as a possible therapeutic option for mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in the relapsed setting.

AB  - Abdominal tuberculosis (ATB) continues to pose a major diagnostic challenge for clinicians due to its nonspecific clinical presentation, variable anatomical location and lack of sensitive diagnostic tools. In spite of the development of several assays till date; no single test has proved to be adequate for ATB diagnosis. In this study, we for the first time report the detection of circulating cell-freeMycobacterium tuberculosis(M.tuberculosis) DNA (cfMTB-DNA) in ascitic fluid (AF) samples and its utility in ATB diagnosis. Sixty-five AF samples were included in the study and processed for liquid culture, cytological, biochemical and molecular assays. A composite reference standard (CRS) was formulated to categorize the patients into 'Definite ATB' (M.tuberculosisculture positive, n = 2), 'Probable ATB' (n = 16), 'Possible ATB' (n = 13) and 'Non-TB' category (n = 34). Two molecular assays were performed, namely, the novel cfMTB-DNA qPCR assay targetingM.tuberculosis devRgene and Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), and their diagnostic accuracy was assessed using CRS as reference standard. Clinical features such as fever, loss of weight, abdominal distension and positive Mantoux were found to be strongly associated with ATB disease (p<0.05). cfMTB-DNA qPCR had a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI:40.9,86.7) with 97.1% specificity (95% CI:84.7,99.9) in 'Definite ATB' and 'Probable ATB' group collectively. The sensitivity increased to 70.9% (95% CI:51.9,85.8) in the combined 'Definite', 'Probable' and 'Possible' ATB group with similar specificity. The cfMTB-DNA qPCR assay performed significantly better than the Xpert assay which demonstrated a poor sensitivity of <= 16.7% with 100% (95% CI:89.7,100) specificity (p<0.001). We conclude that cfMTB-DNA qPCR assay is an accurate molecular test that can provide direct evidence ofM.tuberculosisetiology and has promise to pave the way for improving ATB diagnosis.

AB  - Paraneoplastic Pemphigus (PNP), a rare autoimmune blistering disease, can be accompanied by both benign and malignant neoplasms. The most frequently reported associated malignancies include lymphomatoid and hematologic malignancies, Castleman's disease, carcinoma, thymoma. In a patient suspected of PNP, with no known history of malignancy, an extensive workup is suggested to look for underlying malignancy, which has to be treated to induce PNP remission. In this clinical case report, cross sectional imaging of a young female diagnosed with PNP, unveiled a pericardial mass lesion extending into transverse pericardial sinus. Excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathology revealed pericardial ectopic thymoma.

AB  - Bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS), the only effective option for patients with obesity with or without comorbidities, has been stopped temporarily due to the ongoing novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there has been a recent change in the governmental strategy of dealing with this virus from 'Stay at Home' to 'Stay Alert' in many countries including India. A host of health services including elective surgeries are being resumed. In view of the possibility of resumption of BMS in near future, Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society of India (OSSI) constituted a committee of experienced surgeons to give recommendations about the requirements as well as precautions to be taken to restart BMS with emphasis on safe delivery and high-quality care.

AB  - Semen contains epithelial cells that can be culturedin vitro. For somatic cell nuclear transfer applications, it is essential to know whether clone(s) produced from semen-derived epithelial cells (SedECs) are healthy and reproductively competent. In this study, the semen and fertility profile of a cloned bull (C1) that was produced from a SedEC were compared with its donor (D1) and with two cloned bulls (C2, C3) that were produced from commonly used skin-derived fibroblast cells (SkdFCs). We observed variations in some fresh semen parameters (ejaculated volume and mass motility), frozen-thawed sperm parameters (plasma membrane integrity, and computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) indices), but values are within the normal expected range. There was no difference in sperm concentration of ejaculated semen and frozen-thawed semen parameters which include sperm motility, percentage of live and normal morphology sperm, and distance traveled through oestrus mucus. Followingin vitrofertilization (IVF) experiments, zygotes from C1 had higher (P < 0.05) cleavage rates (81%) than C2, C3, and D1 (71%, 67%, and 75%, respectively); however, blastocyst development per cleaved embryo and quality of produced blastocysts did not differ. The conception rate of C1 was 46% (7/15) and C2 was 50% (8/15) following artificial insemination with frozen-thawed semen. Established pregnancies resulted in births of 7 and 6 progenies sired by C1 and C2, respectively, and all calves show no signs of phenotypical abnormalities. These results showed that semen from a cloned bull derived from SedECs is equivalent to semen from its donor bull and bulls cloned from SkdFCs.

AB  - Background Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a standard of care modality for the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Transesophageal Bronchoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS-B-FNA), wherein one introduces the EBUS bronchoscope through the esophageal route, is also a safe and efficacious diagnostic modality for sampling the mediastinal lymph nodes. The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield and patient comfort with these two available approaches. Methods We randomized subjects with predominant subcarinal or lower left paratracheal mediastinal lymph node enlargement to either EBUS-TBNA or EUS-B-FNA (50 to each group). Co-Primary objectives were the comparison of adequate and diagnostic aspirates between groups. Key secondary objectives were a comparison of Operator rated cough and Operator rated procedural comfort on Visual Analog scale (VAS), procedure duration and complications between the groups. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. The proportion of adequate (EBUS-TBNA 46/50; 92% and EUS-B-FNA 48/50;96%,P = 0.4) and diagnostic aspirates (EBUS-TBNA 38/50; 76% and EUS-B-FNA 36/50;74%,P = 0.4) were similar between the two groups. Operator rated cough was significantly less, and Operator rated patient comfort significantly higher with the EUS-B-FNA approach. Procedure duration was significantly shorter with EUS-B-FNA [18.1(14.4) minutes versus 16.4 (49.6) minutes,P < 0.001]. Minor complications occurred in one patient in the EBUS-TBNA group and none in the EUS-B-FNA group. Conclusion During the endosonographic evaluation for undiagnosed mediastinal lymphadenopathy located at predominantly the subcarinal or lower left paratracheal stations, EUS-B-FNA as compared with EBUS-TBNA provides greater patient comfort with a similar diagnostic yield.

AB  - Background Mixed/polyclonal infections due to different genotypes are reported in Tuberculosis. The current study was designed to understand the fate of mixed infections during the course of treatment and follow-up and its role in disease pathogenesis. Methods Sputum samples were collected on 0,1,2,3,6,12 and 24 months from 157 treatment-naive patients, cultures subjected to Drug-Susceptibility-testing (MGIT 960), spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR and SNP genotyping. All isolated colonies on thin layer agar (7H11) were subjected to spoligotyping. Findings One thirty three baseline cultures were positive (133/157, 84.7%), 43(32.3%) had mixture of genotypes. Twenty-four of these patients (55.8%) showed change in genotype while six showed different drug-susceptibility patterns while on treatment. Twenty-three (53.5%) patients with polyclonal infections showed resistance to at least one drug compared to 10/90 (11.1%) monoclonal infections (P<0.0001). Eight patients had recurrent TB, two with a new genotype and two with altered phenotypic DST. Conclusions The coexistence of different genotypes and change of genotypes during the same disease episode, while on treatment, confirms constancy of polyclonal infections. The composition of the mixture of genotypes and the relative predominance may be missed by culture due to its limit of detection. Polyclonal infections in TB could be a rule rather than exception and challenges the age-old dogma of reactivation/reinfection.

AB  - Importance Mental health comorbidities are increasing worldwide and worsen outcomes for people with diabetes, especially when care is fragmented. Objective To assess whether collaborative care vs usual care lowers depressive symptoms and improves cardiometabolic indices among adults with diabetes and depression. Design, Setting, and Participants Parallel, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 socioeconomically diverse clinics in India that recruited patients with type 2 diabetes; a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of at least 10 (range, 0-27); and hemoglobin A(1c)(HbA(1c)) of at least 8%, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 140 mm Hg, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of at least 130 mg/dL. The first patient was enrolled on March 9, 2015, and the last was enrolled on May 31, 2016; the final follow-up visit was July 14, 2018. Interventions Patients randomized to the intervention group (n = 196) received 12 months of self-management support from nonphysician care coordinators, decision support electronic health records facilitating physician treatment adjustments, and specialist case reviews; they were followed up for an additional 12 months without intervention. Patients in the control group (n = 208) received usual care over 24 months. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the percentage of patients at 24 months who had at least a 50% reduction in Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (SCL-20) scores (range, 0-4; higher scores indicate worse symptoms) and a reduction of at least 0.5 percentage points in HbA(1c), 5 mm Hg in SBP, or 10 mg/dL in LDL cholesterol. Prespecified secondary outcomes were percentage of patients at 12 and 24 months who met treatment targets (HbA(1c)<7.0%, SBP <130 mm Hg, LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL [<70 mg/dL if prior cardiovascular disease]) or had improvements in individual outcomes (>= 50% reduction in SCL-20 score, >= 0.5-percentage point reduction in HbA(1c), >= 5-mm Hg reduction in SBP, >= 10-mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol); percentage of patients who met all HbA(1c), SBP, and LDL cholesterol targets; and mean reductions in SCL-20 score, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score, HbA(1c), SBP, and LDL cholesterol. Results Among 404 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 53 [8.6] years; 165 [40.8%] men), 378 (93.5%) completed the trial. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the intervention group vs the usual care group met the primary outcome (71.6% vs 57.4%; risk difference, 16.9% [95% CI, 8.5%-25.2%]). Of 16 prespecified secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in improvements in 10 outcomes at 12 months and in 13 outcomes at 24 months. Serious adverse events in the intervention and usual care groups included cardiovascular events or hospitalizations (4 [2.0%] vs 7 [3.4%]), stroke (0 vs 3 [1.4%]), death (2 [1.0%] vs 7 [3.4%]), and severe hypoglycemia (8 [4.1%] vs 0). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with diabetes and depression in India, a 12-month collaborative care intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in statistically significant improvements in a composite measure of depressive symptoms and cardiometabolic indices at 24 months. Further research is needed to understand the generalizability of the findings to other low- and middle-income health care settings.
   This randomized clinical trial compares the effect of a collaborative care model that integrates management of depression and enhanced diabetes care on depressive symptoms and HbA(1c), SBP, and LDL cholesterol measures among individuals with depression and diabetes in India.
   Question Among patients with diabetes and depression in India, does a 12-month collaborative care intervention that includes nonphysician care coordinators, decision support functions in electronic health records, and specialist case reviews improve depressive symptoms and measures of cardiometabolic health more than usual care at 24 months? Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 404 patients at urban clinics in India with poorly controlled diabetes and depression, patients in the collaborative care intervention group, compared with the usual care group, were significantly more likely to achieve the composite outcome of at least a 50% reduction in the 20-item Symptom Checklist Depression Scale score and at least 1 of the following: reduction of at least 0.5 percentage points in hemoglobin A(1c), reduction of at least 5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, or reduction of at least 10 mg/dL in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at 24 months (71.6% vs 54.7%). Meaning Among patients with diabetes and depressive symptoms in urban India, a multicomponent collaborative care intervention resulted in statistically significantly greater improvements in a composite measure of depressive symptoms and cardiometabolic indices compared with usual care.

AB  - Introduction Complement activation is central to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN). Low serum complement C3 and C4, are traditionally used as markers of lupus disease activity in general and LN in particular. In this study we prospectively measured plasma and urine C3d and C4d, degradation products of C3 and C4 corrected to creatinine in a cohort of biopsy proven LN in a longitudinal fashion for its correlation with disease activity. Methods Twenty eight biopsy proven active lupus nephritis (AN) were recruited along with four inactive nephritis (IN) and 10 healthy controls (HC). Plasma and urine were collected at baseline, prior to induction treatment and 3 months later. Clinical measures of disease activity, Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI 2K), renal SLEDAI, serum C3, C4 and antibodies to ds DNA, urine protein and creatinine excretion (UP/UC) were collected. Plasma and urine C3d and C4d were measured using ELISA and normalized to spot urine creatinine value. Results Twenty eight AN of median age of 26.5 (20-31.50) years and disease duration of 3 (0.7-5) years were enrolled. The median urinary C3d/creatinine before treatment was 388.20 (48.98-1296) ng/mg which fell significantly to 62.69 (28.04-502.4) ng/mg at 3 months followup (p-0.01). The baseline values for the active renal disease was significantly different from IN group (9.9 (4.5-46.53 ng/mg) p-0.00). Treatment responders (partial and complete) at 6 months showed a significant fall in urinary C3d at 3 months whereas non responders had a non significant change in value. There was a significant correlation of urine C3d/creatinine with SLEDAI2K (r-0.433, p-0.00), renal SLEDAI (r-0.356, p-0.00), UP/UC ratio (r-0.489, p-<0.0001) but no significant correlation with C3 or C4. There was a significant fall in the median values of plasma C3d from 791.1 (516.0.00-1550.43) mu g/ml to 338.52 (211.35-525.82) (p-0.00) mu g/ml at the end of 3 months. The values showed a significant correlation with SLEDAI 2K, renal SLEDAI, UP/UC along with a significant negative correlation with C3 and C4. Conclusion Urinary C3d/creatinine levels and plasma C3d levels can be used as biomarker of disease activity and treatment response.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the imaging characteristics and associations in patients with twisted atrioventricular connections on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography. Material and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 2605 CT angiography studies performed for suspected congenital heart diseases in our institution from January 2014 to December 2018. Twisted atrioventricular connections were diagnosed in 12 patients. Segmental sequential approach developed by Anderson et al was employed to characterize the complex congenital heart disease. Ventricular topology was also determined. CTA was also assessed to look for any associated intra- and extracardiac anomalies. Results Out of 12 patients with twisted atrioventricular connections, usual viscero-atrial arrangement was seen in nine patients, two patients had mirror-imaged viscero-atrial arrangement and one patient had mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. Right-sided heart was seen in four patients. Two patients had discordant atrioventricular connections, seven had concordant atrioventricular connections while three showed double-inlet right ventricle. Ventriculoarterial connections were concordant in two patients, discordant in one patient while nine patients had double-outlet right ventricle. Superior-inferior ventricular morphology with near-horizontal interventricular septum was seen in four patients. Left-sided aortic arch with normal branching pattern was observed in nine patients. No coronary anomaly was seen in any patient. Other associations included ventricular and atrial septal defects, pulmonic stenosis, hypoplasia/atresia of tricuspid valve, straddling of mitral valve, and duplicated superior caval veins. Conclusion CT angiography is useful in diagnosis of twisted atrioventricular connections with accurate identification of viscero-atrial arrangement, atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, and orientation and presence or absence of associated anomalies.

AB  - Study Design. Experimental Cadaveric Biomechanical Study.
   Objective. To establish an experimental procedure in cadavers to estimate joint stiffness/stability at craniovertebral junction (CVJ) region with various implant systems and to develop/validate an indigenous cost effective 3D-FEM (three-dimensional finite element model) of CVJ region.
   Summary of Background Data. Finite element analysis (FEM) tools can provide estimates of internal stress and strain in response to external loading of various implant systems used in CVJ fixations.
   Methods. Experimental setup for conducting biomechanical movements on CVJ region of cadaver was developed using cost effective innovative tools. A manually actuated seven- degrees of freedom parallel manipulator motion testing system (MA7DPM) was designed and developed to impart designed trajectories and to conduct various biomechanical motion studies at CVJ region for the present study.
   Results. FEM model of CVJ region was developed and subsequently validated with CVJ morphometry data of 15 human subjects of Asian origin. Validated FEM was subjected to force motion studies at the CVJ region. The force-motion maps obtained from the FEM studies were subsequently validated against biomechanical experiment results from cadaveric experiment results obtained with three different implant fixations.
   Conclusion. A cost effective biomechanical tool (which did not require decapitation of cadaveric head) and a customised chair (to place cadaver in sitting position during conduct of biomechanical movements simulating real-life scenario) was indigenously designed and developed. Developed biomechanical tool (MA7DPM) for this study is likely to be useful for stress-testing analysis of various implant systems for individual patients undergoing surgery at CVJ region in near future.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths and remains the hardest breast cancer to treat due to the lack of specific therapeutic targets. While chemotherapy is the mainstay of systemic treatment for TNBC, it is associated with chemotherapy-induced cancer stem cells (CSCs) and tumor regeneration. Here, it is found that Wnt and YAP target genes that have been closely associated with CSCs are highly expressed in TNBC patient tumors and negatively correlated with patient survival. Therefore, a nanotherapeutic strategy is employed, using nanomaterials that are approved by the FDA, and two co-delivery nanoparticle platforms (NPs) are developed to target TNBC. These NPs contain Wnt inhibitor PRI-724 (in clinical trials) and YAP/mevalonate inhibitor simvastatin (FDA-approved). Toward clinical translation, nanotherapeutic efficacy is assessed in clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. These NPs in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel effectively halt the growth of both paclitaxel-resistant and paclitaxel-sensitive PDX tumors, and diminish the paclitaxel-induced CSC enrichment around two to fourfold. Importantly, NPs also decrease the paclitaxel-enhanced PDX tumorigenesis after secondary transplantation. Together, this study demonstrates the efficacy of two NP platforms using clinically translatable TNBC PDX models, suggesting their application potential for the treatment of TNBC.

AB  - COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic with lung being the primarily afflicted organ. Deranged hemostasis has been observed in patients with COVID-19 with scales tipped towards a prothrombotic state. The pathogenesis differs from disseminated intravascular coagulation with a primary pulmonary localization. This is referred to as pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy with strong component of thrombo-inflammation. This is reflected in the lab tests with an increase in D-dimer which correlates with severity and outcomes of disease. Common coagulation tests such as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time are only mildly prolonged while most patients have normal to increased fibrinogen and marginal thrombocytopenia. Overall, the patients have an increase in venous and arterial thrombotic events especially in ICU patients. Routine thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is recommended in all hospitalized patients to reduce the incidence of thrombosis. Bleeding is uncommon and treated with blood products transfusion. This review shall discuss the hemostatic abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and their impact on prognosis. In addition, strategy of thromboprophylaxis and various academic society guidelines are discussed in detail.

AB  - Purpose Cardiac involvement in dengue fever is underdiagnosed due to low index of clinical suspicion and its contribution to hemodynamic instability in severe dengue is not well known. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted among admitted patients >= 14 years of age having confirmed dengue fever. Patients on medications affecting heart rhythm/rate, pre-existing heart disease and electrolyte abnormalities were excluded. A baseline electrocardiography (ECG), Trop-I and NT-proBNP were done for all patients. The biomarkers were measured using enzyme-linked fluorescent assay and recommended cut-off were used. Patients with elevated biomarkers underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography. Diagnosis of myocarditis was as per European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2013 criteria. Results A total of 182 patients were recruited with mean age of 30 +/- 12.6 years and 31% were females. Dengue with warning signs was present in 85 (47%) and severe dengue in 60 (33%) patients. ECG abnormalities were observed in 44 (24%) patients, biomarkers were elevated in 27 (15%) patients and 11 (6%) patients had echocardiographic abnormalities. According to ESC 2013 criteria, dengue fever with myocarditis was diagnosed in 13 [7.1% (95% CI 3.4-10.9)] patients. The patients with myocarditis were more likely to have shortness of breath, bleeding manifestations and higher respiratory rate at baseline. Clinical features of fluid overload were more common (69% vs. 1.7%,p < 0.01) and the duration of hospital stay longer in myocarditis group (7 +/- 4.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.9 days,p < 0.01). Conclusion Myocarditis among admitted dengue patients is not uncommon and may lead to increased morbidity.

AB  - Hyperglutamatergic activity in the hippocampus is a major feature of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). Here we investigated whether tonic alpha 7 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) activity could contribute to enhanced glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus of patients with MTLE-HS. Results showed that frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic events recorded from pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal samples obtained from patients with MTLE-HS were altered by alpha 7 nAChR antagonist, methyllycaconitine, suggesting alpha 7 nAChRs may influence hyperexcitability in MTLE-HS.

AB  - Introduction An increase in the common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) is generally considered an early marker of atherosclerosis and is a well-established predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). An association between changes in CCA-IMT and risk of stroke has been reported but has conflicting findings. Objective The present meta-analysis was aimed to clarify the association between CCA-IMT with the risk of stroke and its subtype by estimating pooled analysis of published literature. Methods Comprehensive search for all published articles was performed in electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Trip Databases, Worldwide Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar from 01 January 1950 to 30 April 2020. Results In our meta-analysis, a total of 19 studies, of which sixteen studies involving 3475 ischaemic stroke (IS) cases and 11 826 controls; six studies with 902 large vessel disease (LVD) and 548 small vessel disease (SVD) of IS subtypes; five studies with 228 intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and 1032 IS cases, were included. Our findings suggest a strong association between increased CCA-IMT with risk of IS as compared to control subjects [SMD = 1.46, 95% CI = 0.90-2.02]. However, there is an increased risk of LVD as compared to the SVD subtype of IS [SMD = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.19-0.52] and more chance of occurrence of IS rather than ICH [SMD = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.28-1.41]. Conclusions Carotid intima thickness measurements are found to be associated with the risk of stroke along with its subtypes and may be used as a diagnostic marker for predicting the risk of stroke events.

AB  - Leprosy is a chronic bacterial disease caused byMycobacterium leprae. Cytokines are known to play vital role as a peacekeeper during inflammatory and other immunocompromised conditions such as leprosy. This study has tried to bridge the gap of information on cytokine gene polymorphisms and its potential role in the pathogenesis of leprosy. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunosuppressive cytokine, found to be elevated in leprosy that accounted for the suppression of host's immune system by regulating the functions of other immune cells. T helper cells and T regulatory (Tregs) cells are the major source of IL-10 in lepromatous leprosy patients. In this study, we have documented the association of IL-10 cytokine gene polymorphism with the disease progression. A total of 132 lepromatous leprosy patients and 120 healthy controls were analyzed for IL-10 cytokine gene polymorphisms using PCR-SSP assay and flow cytometry was used to analyze IL-10 secretion by CD4 and Tregs in various genotype of leprosy patients. The frequencies of IL-10 (-819) TT and IL-10 (-1082) GG genotypes were significantly higher in leprosy patients as compared to healthy controls. This observation advocates that these genotypes were associated with the susceptibility and development of the disease. In addition, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated an increased number of IL-10 producing CD4 and Treg cells in IL-10 (819) TT genotype compared to CT and CC genotypes. These observations were further supported by immunohistochemical studies. Therefore, we can conclude that IL-10 cytokine gene polymorphisms by affecting its production can determine the predilection and progression of leprosy in the study population.

AB  - Fibromyalgia is a multi-symptomatic disorder characterized by generalized pain. The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia is supposedly an interplay between central nervous system hyper-responsiveness, autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral pain. In this cross-sectional study, the objective was to assess central sensitization and autonomic activity in patients with fibromyalgia compared with control. Fifty adults diagnosed with fibromyalgia by the modified American College of Rheumatology 2010 criteria and an equal number of age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study in an urban tertiary care hospital. Central sensitization was assessed by history and by evidence of increased prefrontal cortical activity as measured by cortical oxygenation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Autonomic activity was assessed by heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and deep breathing test in three physiological states: rest, sympathetic stress (cold pressor test), and deep breathing. Mann-WhitneyU-test, pairedt-test, Wilcoxon test, and Friedman test with Bonferronia prioriwere used to analyze the data. Cortical activity was significantly higher in the fibromyalgia group than control. There was no significant difference in autonomic activity between the fibromyalgia and control groups. In the fibromyalgia group, variable degrees of sympathetic hyperactivity and normal parasympathetic activity were observed. Central sensitization may be playing a primary role in the pathophysiology of generalized pain in fibromyalgia.

Retrospective record analysis of children (aged <= 16 years) with traumatic brain injury presenting to an apex-trauma-center in North India over 4 years was done. Of more than 15 000 patients with a suspected head injury, 4833 were children <= 16 years old. Of these, 1074 were admitted to the inpatient department; 65% were boys with a mean age at presentation being 6.6 years. Most patients (85%) had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15 at presentation while Glasgow Coma Scale scores of <= 8 was seen in 10% of patients. Neuroimaging (computed tomography [CT]) abnormalities were seen in 12% of patients, with the commonest abnormality being skull fracture, followed by contusions, and extradural hemorrhage. Around 2% of patients required decompressive craniotomy whereas 3% of patients succumbed to their illness. Among the inpatients with pediatric traumatic brain injury, two-thirds were boys with a mean age at presentation of 7.6 years. Severity of traumatic brain injury varied as mild (64%), moderate (11%), and severe (25%). The most common mode of injury was accidental falls (59%) followed by road traffic and rail accidents (34%). Neuroimaging abnormalities were seen in half of inpatients with pediatric traumatic brain injury, with the commonest abnormality being skull fracture. Pediatric head injuries are an important public health problem and constitute a third of all head injuries. They are more common in boys, and the most common modes of injury are accidental falls, followed by road traffic accidents.

AB  - Pelvic-acetabulum and spine surgery are two important constituents of complex trauma surgery and require a gamut of resources for fracture management. In the pandemic crisis of COVID-19 where existing health care resources are scarce and a major section of health care infrastructure has been assigned to fight against it, the compromised and less equipped health care facility is left to tackle the ongoing presentation of complex trauma surgery. One major challenge faced to manage these complex procedures is the availability of specialized radiolucent operation tables as even the apex level health care setups generally have one or two such kinds of table. Therefore, in this state of pandemic crisis, innovations utilizing the available local resources need to be developed to avoid deferring these complex operations.

AB  - Antibody-mediated rejections (AMR) in the absence of circulating anti-HLA-DSA have highlighted the role of non-HLA antibodies, particularly those directed against endothelial cells. Of these, MICA (major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule A) antibodies are the most notable and important because of their potential in promoting graft rejections. Limited studies have focused on the impact of MICA donor-specific antibodies (DSA) on graft outcome as compared to those that are not donor-specific (NDSA). We evaluated pre- and post-transplant sera at POD 7, 30, 90, 180 and the time of biopsy from 206 consecutive primary live donor renal transplant recipients for anti-MICA and anti-HLA antibodies using single antigen bead assay on a Luminex platform. Recipients who developed MICA antibodies and their donors were phenotyped for MICA alleles. For the purpose of antibody analysis, patients were categorized into three major groups: biopsy-proven AMR, acute cellular rejection (ACR) and those with no rejection episodes (NRE). During the mean follow-up period of 17.37 +/- 6.88 months, 16 of the 206 recipients developed AMR, while ACR was observed in only 13 cases. A quarter (25%) of the AMR cases had anti-MICA antibodies as compared to 7.7% of those experiencing ACR and 6.2% of the NRE group. Allelic typing revealed that all MICA Ab +ve AMR cases were due to the presence of donor-specific antibodies. MICA-DSA even in the absence of HLA-DSA was significantly associated with AMR but not with ACR when compared with the NRE group (P = <.01).

AB  - Drug use, including opioid use disorder, is one of the rapidly rising and serious problems affecting populations globally. There is a treatment gap and delay in presentation of drug users to treatment centers. The present study aimed at assessing the pathways to care among opioid-dependent individuals seeking treatment from a community-based treatment center in India. In a cross-sectional observational study conducted at a community clinic of the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC), New Delhi, India, a total of 100 treatment-seeking drug users (age 18-60 years) fulfilling DSM IV TR criteria for opioid dependence were recruited. The data were collected using a semistructured pro forma based on patient self-report and the encounter form used in the World Health Organization (WHO) Pathway Study. All participants were male, were mostly married, were employed, and belonged to nuclear families. Ninety-eight percent of participants has ever used heroin in a dependent fashion and 20% were using it currently. Mean age of the participants was 40.83 years (SD 12.7). Median age of onset of heroin use was 22 years (IQR 12). Median duration of heroin use was 138 months (IQR 132). Only 21% of participants visited the community deaddiction clinic at the first contact with care. The median time for first treatment-seeking attempt was 9.5 years (IQR 7). The study findings suggest significant delay between onset of drug-related problems and first treatment contact. There is a need to increase the availability and accessibility of treatment services to reduce the delay in treatment seeking.

AB  - Background Correct diagnosis of stroke and its subtypes is pivotal in early stages for optimum treatment. Aims The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize the published evidence on the potential of blood biomarkers in the diagnosis and differentiation of stroke subtypes. Methods A literature search was conducted for papers published until 20 April 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, TRIP, and Google Scholar databases to search for eligible studies investigating the role of blood biomarkers in diagnosing stroke. Quality assessment was done using modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies questionnaire. Pooled standardized mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Presence of heterogeneity among the included studies was investigated using the Cochran'sQstatistic andI(2)metric tests. IfI(2)was < 50% then a fixed-effect model was applied else a random-effect model was applied. Risk of bias was assessed using funnel plots and between-study heterogeneity was assessed using meta-regression and sensitivity analyses. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in STATA version 13.0. Results A total of 40 studies including patients with 5001 ischemic strokes, 756 intracerebral hemorrhage, 554 stroke mimics, and 1774 healthy control subjects analyzing 25 biomarkers (within 24 h after symptoms onset/after the event) were included in our meta-analysis; 67.5% of studies had moderate evidence of quality. Brain natriuretic peptide, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and D-dimer significantly differentiated ischemic stroke from intracerebral hemorrhage, stroke mimics, and health control subjects (p < 0.05). Glial fibrillary acidic protein successfully differentiated ischemic stroke from intracerebral hemorrhage (standardized mean difference -1.04; 95% confidence interval -1.46 to -0.63) within 6 h. No studies were found to conduct a meta-analysis of blood biomarkers differentiating transient ischemic attack from healthy controls and stroke mimics. Conclusion This meta-analysis highlights the potential of brain natriuretic peptide, matrix metalloproteinase-9, D-dimer, and glial fibrillary acidic protein as diagnostic biomarkers for stroke within 24 h. Results of our meta-analysis might serve as a platform for conducting further targeted proteomics studies and phase-III clinical trials. PROSPERO Registration ID:CRD42019139659.

BE fundi had changes of chronic CSCR with PED and NSD in the RE and subretinal fibrosis in the left eye. Both eyes had peripheral pigmentary changes. Multimodal imaging showed peripheral avascular retina in both eyes with neovascularization at disc in the right eye which promptly resolved with a single injection of anti-VEGF. Retinal neovascularization is an unusual finding in the setting of CSCR and has not been reported in the literature.

AB  - Cyanoacrylate glue (CG) is a commonly employed modality for sealing small corneal perforations. Presently, we describe the technique of emulsion polymer isocyanate (EPI)-gluing, a modification of its application, and its results in nine eyes with noninfectious, nontraumatic sterile corneal perforation with size <= 3 mm. The method involves harvesting a small patch of autologous epithelium adjacent to the melt area with the help of 10% alcohol and transplanting to the site of melt with its basement membrane facing downwards. CG, loaded on the reverse side of Sinskey hook or Weck-Cel sponge, is instilled on this epithelium-melt site complex and withdrawn immediately following which a bandage contact lens is placed on the corneal surface. In our series of patients with nine eyes where EPI-gluing was undertaken, all eyes reported a healed corneal scar with spontaneously dislodged glue and no underlying vascularization at 3-months follow-up. EPI-gluing is an inexpensive and host-friendly technique for the treatment of small noninfectious corneal perforations particularly with iris tissue prolapse.

AB  - Background: There are conflicting opinions on the effect of dexmedetomidine on cerebral autoregulation. This study assessed its effect on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) using a transcranial Doppler (TCD).
   Methods: Thirty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II patients between 18 and 60 years, who underwent lumbar spine surgery, received infusions of dexmedetomidine (Group D) or normal saline (Group C), followed by anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl, and maintenance with oxygen, nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. After five minutes of normocapnic ventilation and stable bispectral index value (BIS) of 40-50, the right middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCA(FV)) was recorded with TCD. The transient hyperemic response (THR) test was performed by compressing the right common carotid artery for 5-7 seconds. The lungs were hyperventilated to test carbon dioxide (CO2) reactivity. Hemodynamic parameters, arterial CO2 tension, pulse oximetry (SpO(2)), MCA(FV) and BIS were measured before and after hyperventilation. Dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued ten minutes before skin-closure. Time to recovery and extubation, modified Aldrete score, and emergence agitation were recorded.
   Results: Demographic parameters, durations of surgery and anesthesia, THR ratio (Group D: 1.26 +/- 0.11 vs. Group C: 1.23 +/- 0.04; P = 0.357), relative CO2 reactivity (Group D: 1.19 +/- 0.34 %/mmHg vs. Group C: 1.23 +/- 0.25 %/mmHg; P = 0.547), blood pressure, SpO(2), BIS, MCA(FV) time to recovery, time to extubation and modified Aldrete scores were comparable.
   Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine administration does not impair dCA and CO2 reactivity in patients undergoing spine surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia.

AB  - The term machine learning refers to a collection of tools used for identifying patterns in data. As opposed to traditional methods of pattern identification, machine learning tools relies on artificial intelligence to map out patters from large amounts of data, can self-improve as and when new data becomes available and is quicker in accomplishing these tasks. This review describes various techniques of machine learning that have been used in the past in the prediction, detection and management of infectious diseases, and how these tools are being brought into the battle against COVID-19. In addition, we also discuss their applications in various stages of the pandemic, the advantages, disadvantages and possible pit falls.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular compartments dedicated to the storage of metabolic energy in the form of neutral lipids, commonly known as "fat". The biogenesis of LDs takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but its spatial and temporal organization is poorly understood. How exactly sites of LD formation are selected and the succession of proteins and lipids needed to mediate this process remains to be defined. In our current study we show that the yeast triacylglycerol (TAG)- synthases, Lro1 and Dga1 get recruited to discrete ER subdomains where they initiate TAG synthesis and hence LD formation (Choudhary et al. (2020), J Cell Biol). These ER subdomains are defined by yeast seipin, Fld1, and a regulator of diacylglycerol (DAG) production, Nem1. Both Fld1 and Nem1 are ER proteins which localize at contact sites between the ER and LDs. Interestingly, even in cells lacking LDs, Fld1 and Nem1 show punctate localization at ER subdomains independently of each other, but they are required together to recruit the TAG-synthases and hence create functional sites of LD biogenesis. Fld1/Nem1-containing ER subdomains recruit additional LD biogenesis factors, such as Yft2, Pex30, Pet10 and Erg6, and these membrane domains become enriched in DAG. In conclusion, Fld1 and Nem1 play a crucial role in defining ER subdomains for the recruitment of proteins and lipids needed to initiate LD biogenesis.

AB  - Purpose To mitigate the effect of magnetization transfer (MT) from glutamate-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) contrast in healthy human brain and its demonstration in a rat brain tumor model. Procedures GluCEST data was acquired from six healthy human volunteers at 7T and on a rat brain with tumor at 9.4 T. Single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((HMRS)-H-1) data was acquired from three human volunteers. The magnetic resonance imaging protocol included CEST data acquisition at multiple frequencies for generating Z-spectra, B(0)and B(1)map. Partial Z-spectra at offset frequencies from +/- 100 to +/- 14 ppm were fitted to model semi-solid MT component by Lorentzian, Gaussian, super-Lorentzian, and 6th degree polynomial function lineshapes. Average residual errors per pixel was calculated. The MT effect of the Z-spectra was removed by subtracting fitted MT component from Z-spectra. GluCEST was computed as GluCEST(Neg)(normalized with signal at - 3 ppm) and GluCEST(M0)(normalized with unsaturated signal). The difference between GluCEST maps before and after MT removal was compared usingTtest. Results Better accuracy of fitting off-resonance Z-spectra was achieved with super-Lorentzian (sigma = 0.0009) and Lorentzian (sigma = 0.0017) compared to other lineshapes. There was significant (p < 0.01) increase in GluCEST(M0)and decrease in GluCEST(Neg)contrast after MT removal. GluCEST(Neg)and GluCEST(M0)maps after MT removal using Lorentzian lineshape showed gray matter (GM) to white matter (WM) contrast ratio of 1.47 and 1.52 respectively. These ratios are close to glutamate concentration ratio in GM/WM as observed from(1)HMRS data. Thus, the quantity of the MT removed from Z-spectra is appropriate using Lorentzian lineshape due to preservation of GluCEST contrast-ratio in GM/WM. The amount of MT removed from Z-spectra is overestimated using super-Lorentzian and underestimated using Gaussian and polynomial lineshapes. Tumor tissue showed unexpected increase in GluCEST contrast compared to contra-lesional tissue, which represents normal appearing tissue in the brain on contra-lateral side of tumor region, due to decrease in MT component. Conclusions Removal of MT effect from Z-spectra using Lorentzian lineshape increased the specificity of GluCEST contrast to glutamate in healthy human brain and was demonstrated in rat brain tumor model.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE
   Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) has been linked with vascular insufficiency, although the pathophysiology remains elusive. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a promising technology that noninvasively evaluates optic disc perfusion and that may help to characterize peripapillary vascular changes in NAION. PURPOSE
   This study aimed to evaluate peripapillary vascularity in NAION eyes and to compare it with fellow unaffected eyes and healthy control eyes using OCTA. METHODS
   In this cross-sectional study, OCTA of the optic nerve head was obtained in 10 nonacute unilateral NAION and 12 healthy age-matched controls using ZEISS Angioplex. Quantitative analysis of peripapillary retinal and choroidal vascularity of NAION eyes was done using the instrument's inbuilt algorithm and ImageJ software and compared with fellow and control eyes. RESULTS
   Mean total peripapillary superficial retinal vessel and perfusion density as calculated by the instrument was significantly reduced in NAION eyes compared with fellow eyes (13.93 +/- 4.27 mm(-1)/0.36 +/- 0.07 for NAION eyes; 17.77 +/- 1.26 mm(-1)/0.43 +/- 0.08 for fellow eyes; P = .01/P = .05). Using the ImageJ software technique, the mean superficial retinal perfusion was found to be significantly reduced in NAION eyes (0.17 +/- 0.07) compared with fellow eyes (0.25 +/- 0.06; P < .01) and control eyes (0.25 +/- 0.04; P < .01). At the level of choriocapillaris, it was not significantly affected in NAION eyes (0.37 +/- 0.13) versus fellow (0.34 +/- 0.14; P = .1) and control eyes (0.31 +/- 0.34; P = .83). Analysis with the two techniques yielded differing results: the ImageJ analysis technique found a 32% reduction in superficial retinal perfusion in NAION eyes, whereas the instrument's inbuilt algorithm found a 16% reduction compared with fellow and control eyes (P <=.01). CONCLUSIONS
   Peripapillary vascularity can be estimated both at the retinal and choroidal levels using ImageJ software to analyze OCTA images. Retinal peripapillary vascularity is compromised in NAION eyes, but vascularity is not significantly affected at the choroidal level.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To assess the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension and their relationship to cognitive function in older adults in India. DESIGN Longitudinal Aging Study in India-Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD), an in-depth national study of late-life cognition and dementia. SETTING Geriatric hospitals and respondents' homes across 14 states in India. PARTICIPANTS N = 2,874 individuals aged 60 years and older from LASI-DAD. MEASUREMENTS Hypertension was identified by self-report of physician diagnosis or measured blood pressure (BP) of 140/90 mmHg or higher. Undiagnosed hypertension was defined as hypertensive BP measurements, but no physician diagnosis. Controlled hypertension was defined as BP lower than 140/90 mmHg among those with a physician diagnosis. Total hypertension included both diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension. A summary cognition score, derived from the sum of 18 cognitive tests administered in the LASI-DAD (range = 0-360) was used to assess cognitive function. RESULTS Total hypertension prevalence was 63.2% (41.5% diagnosed and 21.6% undiagnosed). Among those with hypertension, 34.5% were undiagnosed, 34.2% were diagnosed but uncontrolled, and 31.3% were diagnosed and controlled. Neither diagnosed nor undiagnosed hypertension was related to cognitive function in fully adjusted models. Older age, female sex, less education, being widowed, rural residence, residing in the north or central regions, being in a scheduled caste or tribe, low consumption, being underweight, and history of stroke were all independently associated with worse cognitive test performance. CONCLUSION Two-thirds of older Indian adults had hypertension, with the majority being undiagnosed or diagnosed but not adequately controlled. Hypertension was not independently associated with cognitive function, whereas sociodemographic factors were independently related to cognitive function. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:S29-S35, 2020.

AB  - Precis: Iridotrabecular contact (ITC), a measure of angle closure, can be quantified along with other angle parameters on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT). Hence, angle changes and angle closure mechanisms can be detected predicting the efficacy of iridotomy. Purpose: To assess 360-degree ITC and ocular parameter changes, after laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI), in primary angle-closure disease (PACD) subgroups. Methodology: This was a prospective observational study including 90 subjects, 30 each of primary angle-closure suspect (PACS), primary angle closure (PAC), and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Anterior segment OCT parameters were measured before and 3 weeks after LPI ITC: central anterior chamber depth, lens vault, angle-opening distance, angle recess area, trabecular iris space area, trabecular iris angle at 500 and 750 mu m from scleral spur. Results: ITC was highest in PACG, 81.43%+/- 22.39%, followed by PAC, 28.53%+/- 21.30%, and PACS, 10.76%+/- 8.54% (P=0.011). There was a significant decrease in ITC in all 3 groups after iridotomy (P<0.001), with a residual ITC of 68.56%+/- 26.44% in PACG, 18.23%+/- 15.98% in PAC, and 5.13%+/- 5.11% in PACS. A significant positive correlation was seen between the extent of ITC, baseline intraocular pressure, and visual field index. ITC was highest in eyes with exaggerated lens vault (77.3%+/- 32.03%), as compared with eyes having a plateau iris configuration or relative pupillary block configuration (P<0.001). Conclusions: Iridotomy at any stage of PACD shows a significant decrease in ITC, with areas of residual ITC. Even in PACG, the iridotomy is effective in exposing parts of the trabecular meshwork that had contact earlier. Greater baseline ITC and postlaser ITC are a biomarker for higher intraocular pressure and greater visual field damage, which need lifelong review and appropriate management.

AB  - Aims Anatomic variations in hearts with common arterial trunk are well-known, although there is no large study of living patients. Detailed knowledge of the origins of the pulmonary and coronary arteries is vital for surgical management. We sought to clarify the variations using computed tomography.
   Methods and results We prospectively studied 70 consecutive patients using echocardiography and computed tomography. In 63 (90%) patients, there was aortic dominance, while 7 (10%) had dominance of the pulmonary component. In 27 (43%) patients with aortic dominance, part of the pulmonary segment arose from a truncal valvar sinus. A long confluent pulmonary channel was more common in patients with sinusal origin compared to those with non-sinusal origin of the pulmonary segment (19 vs. 0; P = 0.0005). Close proximity between the orifices of the coronary arteries and the pulmonary component was also more frequent with sinusal origin (21 vs. 6; P < 0.001) with 5 (19%) patients having pulmonary flow obstructed by a truncal valvar leaflet.
   Conclusion Sinusal origin of the pulmonary component is common with aortic dominance, frequently in association with a long confluent pulmonary segment, which may be in close proximity to the origin of a coronary artery. One-fifth of patients with sinusal origin of pulmonary component have a truncal valvar leaflet obstructing the pulmonary orifice. These morpho-anatomic findings have important implications for management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To investigate how cardiometabolic-inflammatory risk factors are related to cognition among older adults in India and the United States. DESIGN The Longitudinal Aging Study in India-Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD) and the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS-HCAP) in the United States conducted an in-depth assessment of cognition, using protocols designed for international comparison. SETTING Cognitive tests were conducted in hospital or household settings in India and in household settings in the United States. PARTICIPANTS Respondents aged 60 years and older from LASI-DAD (N = 1,865) and respondents aged 65 years and older from HRS-HCAP (N = 2,111) who provided venous blood specimen. MEASUREMENTS We used total composite scores from the common cognitive tests administered. Cardiovascular risk was indicated by systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP), and homocysteine. Metabolic risk was measured by body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein (a) (only in India). Inflammatory risk was indicted by white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, albumin, and uric acid (only in India). RESULTS The distribution of both total cognition scores and of cardiometabolic risk factors differed significantly between India and the United States. In both countries, lower cognition was associated with older age, lower education, elevated homocysteine, elevated proBNP, and lower albumin levels. The associations between HbA1c levels and cognitive measures were statistically significant in both countries, but in the opposite direction, with a coefficient of 1.5 (P < .001) in India and -2.4 (P < .001) in the United States for one percentage increase in absolute HbA1c value. CONCLUSION Cardiometabolic-inflammatory biomarkers are associated with cognitive functional levels in each country, but the relationships may vary across countries. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:S36-S44, 2020.

AB  - Inhalants are legally available substances, most of them inexpensive, which are often abused by adolescents. Craving causes their continued use and repeated relapses. There is a need to understand the cue-induced craving and the associated neural mechanisms. In absence of any such prior study, the present study compared the hemodynamic changes in brain associated with craving effect in adolescent inhalant users and healthy controls using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) mechanism. This was an observational case control study with twelve adolescents, aged 12-18 years, with current use of inhalants as their primary drug, and twelve healthy, age and gender-matched adolescents, with no lifetime use of inhalants. Clinical assessments included Teen Addiction Severity Index and Visual Analogue Scale for craving. Participants abstained from all substances during 48 h prior to fMRI, confirmed by urinalysis. A validated visual cue block paradigm with neutral and craving cues was presented during the BOLD assessments in a 3 T MR system. The inhalant users exhibited BOLD activation in inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior occipital gyrus, cingulate gyrus, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, and culmen as compared to control group. The control group exhibited activation of insula as compared to cases. The results may be attributed to visuo-spatial attention, visual perception, working memory, and motivation associated with visual cue reactivity. This preliminary study provides important findings pertaining to activation patterns in response to cue-induced craving among adolescent inhalant users.

AB  - Objective Patients with schizophrenia are at higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than healthy individuals. This study was conducted to compare the effect of lurasidone and olanzapine on cardiometabolic parameters in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia. Methods The present study was a randomized open-label, parallel design, active-controlled clinical trial. After recruitment and randomization of 101 patients, a baseline assessment was done by PANSS, SOFAS, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, HbA(1c), serum insulin and serum hs-CRP. HOMA-IR, atherogenic index, coronary risk index and cardiovascular risk indices were calculated as derived parameters. Patients received either lurasidone 80 mg or olanzapine 10 mg as monotherapy and followed up after 6 weeks. Results There was a significant increase in fasting blood glucose (p< 0.001), HbA(1c)(p< 0.001) and serum insulin (p< 0.001) after 6 weeks of therapy in both the treatment groups but the difference between the groups was not significant (FBS,p= 0.209; HbA1c,p= 0.209; serum insulin,p= 0.720). Olanzapine showed worsening of lipid profile (p< 0.001) while the same improved with lurasidone (p< 0.001) and the difference between the groups was found to be significant (p< 0.001). Serum HDL level decreased in both the treatment groups (olanzapine,p< 0.001; lurasidone,p< 0.001) but the difference between the groups was not significant (p= 0.333). There was an increase in hs-CRP levels in both the treatment groups (olanzapine,p< 0.001; lurasidone,p< 0.001) with no significant difference between them (p= 0.467). Atherogenic index, coronary risk index and cardiovascular risk index increased significantly in the olanzapine group as compared with the lurasidone group (p< 0.001). Conclusion Lurasidone showed a favourable effect on lipid profile and cardiovascular risk indices over olanzapine. However, long-term studies are needed to establish and generalize the findings.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent form of sleep disordered breathing which results in sleep fragmentation and deprivation. Obesity and cardiovascular disorders are the major risk factors associated with OSA. Molecular analysis of the factors associated with OSA could demarcate the clinical analysis pattern in a population.
   Objective: This study pertains to in-silico analyses of miRNA and their gene targets with validation for their potential role in OSA as putative biomarker candidates.
   Methods: miRDB, TargetScan and miRanda databases were used to identify targets of miR-27 and let-7 that have documented role in OSA and co-related obesity and cardiovascular disorders. Quantitative PCR was used to analyze expression pattern of miR-27 and let-7 in obese and non-obese OSA patient cohorts with respective controls. In-silico analysis was done using PatchDoc to obtain atomic contact energy (ACE) scores that indicated the docked gene targets to the predicted miRNA structures. The docked structures were analysed using Maestro Suite 11 for the hydrogen and aromatic interactions.
   Results: Downregulation of miR-27 and let-7 in OSA compared to controls was observed. In-silico data analysis was performed for gene targets (TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD2, SMAD4, CRY2 and CNR1) of the selected miRNAs (miR-27 and let-7). Among all, CNR1 and CRY2 were found to be better targets for miR-27 and let-7 respectively as per ACE scores, ROC scores and expression fold change in OSA.
   Conclusion: Our study gives insights to the expression profiling of miR-27 and let-7 and explore a set of potential target genes (CNR1 and CRY2) of these two miRNAs for a promising clinical relevance in OSA.

AB  - Four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. To reduce the invasiveness of standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has come about an attractive option for the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There have been no studies on SILC from Indian subcontinent. The present study was designed to compare the outcomes of SILC with the standard four-port LC in a prospective randomized controlled trial. All patients with symptomatic gallstone disease were evaluated between May 2012 and April 2014. Patients were randomized to either standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC group) or single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC group). Demographic profile, preoperative and intraoperative variables, postoperative complications, hospital stay, and pain scores were recorded. WHO-QOL BREF was used for quality of life analysis. Patients were followed up at regular intervals, and satisfaction scores were recorded. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 12 andpvalue < 0.05 was considered significant. Out of 94 patients, 90 received the intended treatment, and four cases in SILC group were converted to standard four-port cholecystectomy. The demographic profile and preoperative WHO-QOL BREF scores were comparable between the two groups. Severity of adhesions, successful dissection of Calot's triangle, ergonomics, and overall level of difficulty were also comparable. Operation time was significantly higher in SILC group, but the learning curve was seen to be achieved after 30-35 cases. There was no significant difference in the incidence of immediate postoperative and chronic pain over a mean follow-up of 6 months except for pain score during normal activity in immediate postoperative period which was significantly higher in SILC group. Overall complication rate was significantly higher in SILC group, however the incidence of SSI was not found to be significant among the two groups. There was one case of transient bile leak and one case of intra-abdominal bleeding due to slippage of cystic artery clip. Postoperative quality of life outcomes were similar in the two groups. Although not significant, patients with SILC group had higher cosmetic score compared with the LC group. In conclusion, this study shows that SILC is a safe and feasible with a higher rate of complications but comparable cosmetic and QoL outcomes when compared with standard 4-port cholecystectomy.

AB  - Background CT-guided tissue sampling is a very effective tool. However, false-negative results are obtained when regions such as necrotic core or surrounding reactive fibrosis and inflammation are sampled. PET/CT-guided sampling can circumvent these limitations. Purpose The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of PET/CT-guided sampling in patients with at least 1 instance of failed or inconclusive CT-guided procedure and factors determining the accurate sampling and complications. Methods One hundred eleven patients were prospectively included. After feasibility analysis in a diagnostic(18)F-FDG PET/CT, sampling was performed in 106 patients (45 women, 61 men; mean age, 48.09 +/- 15.42 years; biopsy in 80 and fine-needle aspiration cytology [FNAC] in 26 patients), using robotic arm and a lower IV injection dose of 74 to 111 MBq (2-3 mCi)F-18-FDG. In all patients, final check scans revealed needle at the target site. Using planned needle path as reference, deviations in first check scan were measured. Patient (n = 30) and respiratory motion (n = 57) were also recorded. Results Accurate lesion targeting was achieved in 81 cases (63 positive lesions, 12 confounding lesions, and 7 inadequate samples). Lesion was missed in 5 instances, and blood/necrotic tissue sampled in 19. Overall(18)F-FDG-avid lesions were accurately targeted in 77.36% of patients (86.25% [biopsy] + 50% [FNAC]). Significant variables affecting targeting were needle gauge, deviation from intended entry point, procedure duration, procedure type, and patient movement. Using binomial regression, the significant parameters were procedure type (biopsy vs FNAC; odds ratio [OR], 5.916;P= 0.002), patient movement (OR, 0.275;P= 0.023), and procedure duration (OR, 1.195;P= 0.011). Overall complication rate was 21.70%, with 4.71% major complications. It was dependent on target depth (mean depth, 69.74 +/- 20.29 mm [complications] vs 47.18 +/- 22.60 mm;P< 0.001). Positive correlation was seen between the target depth and distance of needle from the intended target (Spearman rho = 0.307;P= 0.001). In 28 procedures, the physician was asked to wear a pocket dosimeter, who received a mean dose of 2.52 (SD, 3.10) mu Sv. Conclusions PET/CT-guided sampling should be considered where CT-guided biopsy has failed or is inconclusive. The outcome is impacted by needle gauge and patient movement, and complication rate is dependent on target depth.

AB  - Background and objectives: Treponemal tests provide advantage of better detection during early, late and latent stages of syphilis with equal or higher sensitivity & specificity in comparison to non-treponemal tests. The objective of the present study was to analyse the level of concordance between treponemal and non-treponemal tests for donor screening and to correlate them with donor history.
   Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of syphilis screening by treponemal (Chemiluminescence & TPHA) and non-treponemal tests (RPR) was done and donor history for high-risk behaviour and factors associated with false positivity were collected from post-donation counselling and collected data was coded and analysed.
   Results: Amongst the 12,000 donors screened, reactivity rate by RPR, TPHA and Chemiluminescence was 0.45%, 0.8% and 1.17% respectively. There was discordance of 62% and 32% for reactive results by RPR and TPHA respectively when compared with Chemiluminescence. History of high-risk behaviour was present in similar to 50% and 15% of donors with discordant results by RPR and TPHA respectively. Of 34 donors who were reactive only by Chemiluminescence and were followed up, 15% had history of high-risk behaviour and 56% had factors associated with false reactivity.
   Conclusion: Treponemal tests showed high syphilis reactivity amongst blood donors as compared to non-treponemal tests most likely due to their ability to detect early, late and latent syphilis cases. This may confer added transfusion safety in centres dependent on replacement donors without NAT testing by identifying donors with high-risk history with negligible increase in discard rate due to false reactivity.

AB  - Purpose: Identification of noninvasive blood-based biomarkers is of utmost importance for the early diagnosis and predicting prognosis of advance stage lung cancer patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in numerous diseases, however, their role as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in Indian lung cancer patients has not been evaluated yet.
   Methods: For the identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in the serum of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we performed small RNA sequencing. We validated the expression of 10 miRNAs in 75 NSCLC patients and 40 controls using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). miRNA expression was correlated with survival and therapeutic response.
   Results: We identified 16 differentially expressed miRNAs in the serum of NSCLC patients as compared to controls. We observed significant downregulation of miR-15a-5p, miR-320a, miR-25-3p, miR-192-5p, let7d-5p, let-7e-5p, miR-148a-3p, and miR-92a-3p in the serum of NSCLC patients. The expression of miR-375 and miR-10b-5p was significantly downregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients than controls. The expression of miR-320a, miR-25-3p, and miR-148a-3p significantly correlated with stage. None of the miRNAs were correlated with survival outcome and therapeutic response.
   Conclusions: We conclude that the relative abundance of miRNAs in serum may be explored for the development of miRNA-based assays for better diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC. Moreover, further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of some of the less explored miRNAs, such as miR-375 and miR-320a, in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To introduce cost-effective expert clinical diagnoses of dementia into population-based research using an online platform and to demonstrate their validity against in-person clinical assessment and diagnosis. DESIGN The online platform provides standardized data necessary for clinicians to rate participants on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR(R)). Using this platform, clinicians diagnosed 60 patients at a range of CDR levels at two clinical sites. The online consensus diagnosis was compared with in-person clinical consensus diagnosis. SETTING All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India. PARTICIPANTS Thirty patients each at AIIMS and NIMHANS with equal numbers of patients previously independently rated in person by experts as CDR is 0 (cognitively normal), CDR is 0.5 (mild cognitive impairment), and CDR is 1 or greater (dementia). MEASUREMENTS Multiple clinicians independently rate each participant on each CDR domain using standardized data and expert clinical judgment. The overall summary CDR is calculated by algorithm. When there are discrepancies among clinician ratings, clinicians discuss the case through a virtual consensus conference and arrive at a consensus overall rating. RESULTS Online clinical consensus diagnosis based on standardized interview data provides consistent clinical diagnosis with in-person clinical assessment and consensus diagnosis (kappa coefficient = 0.76). CONCLUSION A web-based clinical consensus platform built on the Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India interview data is a cost-effective way to obtain reliable expert clinical judgments. A similar approach can be used for other epidemiological studies of dementia. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:S54-S59, 2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES To provide high-quality data on older adults in India that will enable an in-depth study of late-life cognition and dementia in India and cross-country analysis of risk factors for cognitive aging and dementia. DESIGN The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is a nationally representative survey of health, economic, and social well-being of the Indian population aged 45 and older. Its large sample of more than 70,000 older adults represents not only the country as a whole but also each state. LASI-Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) is an in-depth study of late-life cognition and dementia, drawing a subsample of over 3,000 LASI respondents aged 60 and older. SETTING Participants were interviewed at home or in a participating hospital according to their preferences. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged 60 and older (N = 3,224), along with 3,191 informants. MEASUREMENTS Respondents underwent a battery of cognitive tests, and informants were interviewed about their cognitive and health conditions. A common set of cognitive tests was selected to enable international comparisons, and additional cognitive tests suitable for illiterate and innumerate populations were also selected. Rich data on risk factors of dementia were collected through health examination, venous blood assays, and genotyping. RESULTS The response rate was 82.9%, varying across sex, education, and urbanicity. Data are available to other researchers. CONCLUSION LASI-DAD provides an opportunity to study late-life cognition and dementia and their risk factors in the older population in India and to gain further insights through cross-country analysis by pooling data from its international sister studies.

TI  - TB infection and BCG vaccination: are we protected from COVID-19?
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: The incidence of emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease is variable across the different parts of the world. Apart from travel patterns, other factors determining this difference may include host immune response. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tuberculosis (TB) endemicity and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) coverage on COVID-19.
   Study design: This was a cross-sectional study.
   Methods: We reviewed available data regarding TB incidence, BCG coverage (as per the World Health Organization), and COVID-19 incidence of 174 countries. We divided the countries into four cohorts depending on annual TB incidence and BCG coverage.
   Results: Countries with high TB incidence had lower COVID-19 than countries with low TB incidence. Similarly, countries with high BCG coverage had lower incidence of COVID-19, suggesting some protective mechanisms in TB-endemic areas. However, the ecological differences and different testing strategies between countries could not be accounted for in this analysis.
   Conclusion: Higher TB incidence and BCG coverage were found to be associated with lesser incidence of COVID-19. This outcome paves the way for further research into pathogenesis and immune response in COVID-19. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) refers to the formation of non-neoplastic blood cell lines outside the bone marrow and is a common incidental finding when patients with haematological disorders are imaged. EMH presenting as mass (tumefactive EMH) has long been a radiological conundrum as it resembles neoplasms. Several imaging findings have been described in EMH, and these vary depending on the activity of the underlying haematopoiesis. The older lesions are easier to diagnose as they often demonstrate characteristic findings such as haemosiderin and fat deposition. In comparison, the newer, actively haematopoietic lesions often mimic neoplasms. Molecular imaging, particularly Tc-99m labelled sulphur colloid scintigraphy, may be helpful in such cases. Although imaging is extremely useful in detecting and characterising EMH, imaging alone is often non-diagnostic as no single mass shows all the typical findings. Hence, a judgement based on the clinical background, combination of imaging findings, and slow interval growth may be more appropriate and practical in making the correct diagnosis. In every case, an effort has to be made in providing an imaging-based diagnosis as it may prevent a potentially risky biopsy. When confident differentiation is not possible, biopsy has to be resorted to. This article describes the causes, pathophysiology, and theories underlying the genesis of EMH, followed by the general and location-specific imaging findings. The purpose is to provide a thorough understanding of the condition as well as enable the clinical radiologist in making an imaging-based diagnosis whenever possible and identify the situations where biopsy has to be performed.

AB  - Plasmodium infections are co-endemic with infections caused by other agents of acute febrile illnesses, such as dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus, Leptospira spp., and Orientia tsutsugamushi. However, co-infections may influence disease severity, treatment outcomes, and development of drug resistance. When we analyzed cases of acute febrile illness at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, from July 2017 through September 2018, we found that most patients with malaria harbored co-infections (Plasmodium mixed species and other pathogens). DENV was the most common malaria co-infection (44% of total infections). DENV serotype 4 was associated with mild malaria, and Leptospira was associated with severe malaria. We also found the presence of P. knowlesi in our study population. Therefore, in areas with a large number of severe malaria cases, diagnostic screening for all 4 DENV serotypes, Leptospira, and all Plasmodium species should be performed.

AB  - AIM: To determine the diagnostic performance of split-bolus dual-energy computed tomography (CT) urography (SBDECTU) in the detection and characterisation of urolithiasis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-centre Institute Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved prospective study was conducted from April 2014 to November 2015. One hundred and thirty consenting adults with microscopic haematuria underwent dual-energy true non-enhanced CT (DETNE) of the whole abdomen followed by a SBDECTU. The SBDECTU protocol consisted of synchronous nephrogrameurogram acquisition following urine dilution by oral hydration and normal saline injection. Calculi were detected and characterised using virtual non-enhanced (VNE) images derived from SBDECT were compared with DETNE (the reference standard). The subjective image quality and radiation dose were compared.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six participants had one or more calculi (total 129 calculi) detected on DETNE CT. The sensitivity and specificity of VNE on a per-patient basis were 100%. Of the 129 calculi, 118 were detected on VNE, with a sensitivity of 91.47% and an accuracy of 91.47%. Of the calculi, 83.9% (99/118) could be characterised on SBDECTU images. On VNE images, complete iodine subtraction was seen in 73.1% (19/26). By omitting DETNE CT, the mean doseelength product of 537.6 +/- 152.9 mGy and volume CT dose index of 10.9 +/- 2.9 mGy.cm(2) could have been saved.
   CONCLUSION: SBDECTU has high diagnostic accuracy in the detection and characterisation of clinically significant urinary calculi at potentially half the radiation dose. (C) 2020 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Justification Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is increasingly being diagnosed in the West, while there is scant data on the subject from India. There is low awareness among pediatricians about its diagnosis and management; leading to improper diagnosis. Process A group of experts from the pediatric gastroenterology sub-specialty chapter of Indian Academy of Pediatrics (Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) met at Mumbai on 26 October, 2018 and discussed various issues relating to the subject. A broad consensus was reached and a writing committee was formed. They met again on 11 August, 2019 at Chennai for a detailed discussion. The statement was sent to the entire group by e-mail and their approval obtained. Objective To formulate a consensus statement enable proper diagnosis and management of Cow's milk protein allergy. Recommendations Cow's milk protein allergy is most common in the first year of life. Gastrointestinal manifestations are usually non-IgE mediated and therefore skin prick test and specific IgE levels are not useful in diagnosis. Clinical response to elimination diet followed by a positive oral food challenge is diagnostic. In patients with only gastrointestinal manifestations, sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy may be considered as an alternative. Management involves strict avoidance of all forms of bovine milk protein. For infants who are artificially fed, an extensively hydrolyzed formula is the first choice. Soy formula is an alternative in those above six months of age. Since most infants outgrow the allergy, elimination diet is only for a limited period and re-evaluation should be done periodically.

AB  - Objective: With the rising burden of dementia globally, there is a need to harmonize dementia research across diverse populations. The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) is a well-established cognitive screening tool to diagnose dementia. But there have been few efforts to standardize the use of ACE-III across cohorts speaking different languages. The present study aimed to standardize and validate ACE-III across seven Indian languages and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the test to detect dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the context of language heterogeneity.
   Methods: The original ACE-III was adapted to Indian languages: Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Urdu, Tamil, and Indian English by a multidisciplinary expert group. The ACE-III was standardized for use across all seven languages. In total, 757 controls, 242 dementia, and 204 MCI patients were recruited across five cities in India for the validation study. Psychometric properties of adapted versions were examined and their sensitivity and specificity were established.
   Results: The sensitivity and specificity of ACE-III in identifying dementia ranged from 0.90 to 1, sensitivity for MCI ranged from 0.86 to 1, and specificity from 0.83 to 0.93. Education but not language was found to have an independent effect on ACE-III scores. Optimum cut-off scores were established separately for low education (<= 10 years of education) and high education (>10 years of education) groups.
   Conclusions: The adapted versions of ACE-III have been standardized and validated for use across seven Indian languages, with high diagnostic accuracy in identifying dementia and MCI in a linguistically diverse context.

AB  - Background:Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute rheumatic carditis (ARC) continue to be a major public health problem in developing countries.Objective:To study the characteristics of children with ARC being treated at a tertiary centre.Methods and Results:We studied 126 children (mean age 10.4 +/- 2.3 years, range 5-15 years, 60% males) diagnosed with ARC by treating cardiologists. Most had lower socio-economic status. Fifty of 126 (40%) presented with a first episode of ARC. Joint symptoms were present in 29% and fever in 25%. Only 2.4% had subcutaneous nodules and none had erythema marginatum or chorea. Fifty-one percent presented in NYHA class II and 29% in NYHA class III or IV. Tachycardia and heart failure were present in 53% and 21%, respectively. Recent worsening of NYHA class (dyspnoea) was the commonest feature (48%). Laboratory investigations showed raised antistreptolysin O titres (>333 units) in only 36.7% of patients. Raised C-reactive protein (CRP) was present in 70%, while raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found in only 37% of patients. On the basis of above findings, the modified Jones criteria (2015) for the diagnosis of ARF were satisfied only in 46% of children. Echocardiography showed mitral valve thickening in 77% and small nodules on the tip of the leaflets in 43% (27 and 8%, respectively for aortic valve). Left ventricular ejection fraction was <50% in only 3 patients. The dominant valve lesion was mitral regurgitation (MR) (present in 95% of patients; severe in 78%, moderate in 15%), while aortic regurgitation was present in 44% (severe in 14%).Conclusions:The criteria are often not satisfied by patients being treated for ARC. Recent unexplained worsening of dyspnoea, young age, significant MR, echocardiographic nodules, and elevated CRP are important indicators.

AB  - Background. Traditionally, quantification of aortic valve calcium (AVC) has been performed with noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) using the Agatston method. This study sought to derive and validate a systematic method enabling AVC quantification using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS).
   Methods. The study included 134 consecutive patients with AS who underwent both NCCT and CTA and were subdivided into derivation (n = 71) and validation cohorts (n = 63). AVC on NCCT (AVC(NCCT)) was quantified using the Agatston method using the software developed for semiautomatic assessment of coronary calcium. On CTA, the mean contrast attenuation of the aorta in Hounsfield units (AortaHU) and SD was measured in the region of interest at the level of the sinotubular junction.
   Results. Using an adjusted calcium detection threshold of AortaHU D 2 SD, we calculated AVC on CTA (AVC(CTA)) using the same software without modifying other variables. Correlation between AVCNCCT and AVCCTA in the derivation cohort was excellent (r = 0.9679; P <.001). We used a linear regression model to derive a formula for predicting AVC(CTA) that enabled conversion of AVC(CTA) to AVC(Derived) (AVC(Derived) = 1.821 3 AVC(CTA)). Applying this formula in validation cohort, we calculated AVCDerived, which showed excellent agreement with AVCN(CCT) (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.9648; 95% confidence interval, 0.9427-0.9782). Excellent correlation was also found between categorized AVCN(CCT) and AVC(Derived) scores (k = 0.9044; 95% confidence interval, 0.7989-1.0000), with 95.24% (60 of 63) of scores falling within the same severity category.
   Conclusions. AVC quantification on CTA is feasible with high accuracy and reliability and shows excellent agreement with the standard AVCN(CCT) score. With the systematic approach using "dynamic thresholds" being largely independent of the scan acquisition protocol, AVCDerived can potentially replace AVCN(CCT), eliminating the need for separate NCCT acquisition solely for AVC quantification.

AB  - Background We evaluated the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on septal perfusion and thickening at 6 months post implantation assessed on Tc99m-MIBI Gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (GMPS).We also studied the association of change in septal perfusion and thickening with primary outcome defined as at least one [improvement in >= 1NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by >= 5%, reduction of end-systolic volume (ESV) by >= 15%, and improvement >= 5 points in Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ)]. Method One hundred and five patients underwent clinical and GMPS evaluation before and at 6 months post CRT. Result Post CRT there was significant improvement in mean normalized septal perfusion uptake and in septal thickening (Pvalue = 0.001, both). There was no significant relation between improvement in septal perfusion and primary outcome. However, improvement in septal thickening was statistically significant with favorable primary outcome (P = 0.001).There was no significant correlation between improvement of septal perfusion and improvement in LVEF, reduction in End diastolic volume (EDV), ESV, and Left ventricular Dyssynchrony (LVD). But, there was significant correlation between improvement of septal thickening and these parameters. Conclusion Improvement in septal thickening was associated with reverse remodeling, improvement in LVEF, and reduction of LVD.

AB  - Importance: While laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) is being adopted with increasing enthusiasm worldwide, it is still challenging for both technical and anatomical reasons. Currently, there is no consensus on the technical standards for LPD.
   Objective: The aim of this consensus statement is to guide the continued safe progression and adoption of LPD.
   Evidence Review: An international panel of experts was selected based on their clinical and scientific expertise in laparoscopic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Statements were produced upon reviewing the literature and assessed by the members of the expert panel. The literature search and its critical appraisal were limited to articles published in English during the period from 1994 to 2019. The Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials databases were searched, The search strategy included, but was not limited to, the terms 'laparoscopic', 'pancreaticoduodenectomy, 'pancreatoduodenectomy', 'Whipple's operation', and 'minimally invasive surgery'. Reference lists from the included articles were manually checked for any additional studies, which were included when appropriate. Delphi method was used to establish expert consensus and the AGREE II-GRS Instrument was applied to assess the methodological quality and externally validate the final statements. The statements were further discussed during a one-day face-to-face meeting at the 1st Summit on Minimally Invasive Pancreatico-Biliary Surgery in Wuhan, China.
   Findings: Twenty-eight international experts from 8 countries constructed the expert panel. Sixteen statements were produced by the members of the expert panel. At least 80% of responders agreed with the majority (80%) of statements. Other than three randomized controlled trials published to date, most evidences were based on level 3 or 4 studies according to the AGREE II-GRS Instrument.
   Conclusions and Relevance: The Wuhan international expert consensus meeting on LPD has produced a set of clinical practice statements for the safe development and progression of LPD. LPD is currently in its development and exploration stages, as defined by the international IDEAL framework for surgical innovation. More robust randomized controlled trial and registry study are essential to proceed with the assessment of LPD.

AB  - This expert Consensus Statement from the Pediatric Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (PCRRT) workgroup presents recommendations for the management of hyperammonaemia requiring kidney replacement therapy in paediatric populations. Additional studies are needed to strengthen these recommendations, which will be reviewed every 2 years.
   Hyperammonaemia in children can lead to grave consequences in the form of cerebral oedema, severe neurological impairment and even death. In infants and children, common causes of hyperammonaemia include urea cycle disorders or organic acidaemias. Few studies have assessed the role of extracorporeal therapies in the management of hyperammonaemia in neonates and children. Moreover, consensus guidelines are lacking for the use of non-kidney replacement therapy (NKRT) and kidney replacement therapies (KRTs, including peritoneal dialysis, continuous KRT, haemodialysis and hybrid therapy) to manage hyperammonaemia in neonates and children. Prompt treatment with KRT and/or NKRT, the choice of which depends on the ammonia concentrations and presenting symptoms of the patient, is crucial. This expert Consensus Statement presents recommendations for the management of hyperammonaemia requiring KRT in paediatric populations. Additional studies are required to strengthen these recommendations.

AB  - Tetralogy of fallot is rarely associated with anomalous left coronary artery connection to main pulmonary artery. High index of suspicion is needed preoperatively to diagnose this association and treat successfully. We present a case of 9-year-old boy with the rare association of tetralogy of fallot and anomalous left coronary artery connection to pulmonary artery with a giant steal intercoronary collateral crossing right ventricular outflow tract who was treated successfully by single-stage surgical correction.

AB  - Background: The integration of point-of-care ultrasound in endotracheal tube placement confirmation has been focus of many recent studies. Objectives: We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in confirmation of endotracheal intubation compared with standard confirmatory methods. Methods: We completed an extensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and bibliographies of the selected articles from inception to October 2019. The search was limited to prospective studies conducted in human adults that compared the accuracy of ultrasonography in confirming the endotracheal tube position with a reference standard. The methodologic quality of studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. A bivariate random-effects model summarized diagnostic accuracy statistics. Subgroup analyses by ultrasonographic signs, study location, the operator's specialty, types of transducer, the technique of ultrasound confirmation, and clinical setting (cardiac arrest vs. non-cardiac arrest) were performed. Results: Thirty studies involving 2534 patients were selected for this meta-analysis. The estimated pooled sensitivity and specificity for ultrasonography were 0.982 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.971-0.988) and 0.957 (95% CI 0.901-0.982), respectively. Subgroup analyses did not reveal significant difference by ultrasonographic sign used, location, the sonographer's specialty, transducer type, or ultrasound technique used. Ultrasound was also found to be a useful adjunct in confirming endotracheal tube position in the subgroup of patients with cardiac arrest, with sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) and specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.671.00), respectively. Conclusions: Ultrasonography is a valuable and reliable adjunct for endotracheal tube confirmation, including during cardiac arrest resuscitation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - People suffering from malnutrition show compromised levels of omega-6 fatty acid and malnutrition is frequently observed among visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients as disease inflicts primarily the socioeconomic destitute communities. Dietary linoleic acid (LA, 18:2; omega-6 fatty acid) is the principal source of essential fatty acid and its derivatives i.e. eicosanoids possess immune-modulatory activities. However, its role in VL is not yet established. LA was measured in VL human subjects (serum) as well as in Leishmania(L.)donovani infected hamsters (serum and visceral organs). Organ-specific mRNA expressions of various enzymes of the LA metabolic pathway were measured in visceral organs of infected hamsters. Our findings showed a decrease in the concentrations of LA in the serum samples of VL patients, suggesting malnutrition among these patients. However, in L. donovani infected hamsters, its level was not altered in the early infection (15 days) and then increased at late infection (60 days). Importantly, the supplementation of LA restored the Th-1 type of immune response and significantly reduced the parasite load within infected macrophages in vitro. This protective response of LA was mediated through 5-lipoxygenase pathway not via the cyclooxygenase pathway. Preventive usage of LA to m phi followed by L. donovani infection also showed the strengthening of Th-1 immune response and significantly fewer parasite loads. Our findings demonstrate the protective role of LA in the containment of the parasite load. Incorporating LA rich oils in daily food habits across highly inflicted regions may be a significant advancement towards the eradication of the disease.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of optimized T1-Perfusion MRI protocol (protocol-2) with whole brain coverage and improved spatial resolution using Compressed-SENSE (CSENSE) to differentiate high-grade-glioma (HGG) and low-grade-glioma (LGG) and to compare it with the conventional protocol (protocol-1) with partial brain coverage used in our center.
   Methods: This study included MRI data from 5 healthy volunteers, a phantom and 126 brain tumor patients. Current study had two parts: To analyze the effect of CSENSE on 3D-T1-weighted (W) fast-field-echo (FFE) images, T1-W, dual-PDT2-W turbo-spin-echo images and T1 maps, and to evaluate the performance of high resolution T1-Perfusion MRI protocol with whole brain coverage optimized using CSENSE. Coefficient-of-Variation (COV), Relative-Percentage-Error (RPE), Normalized-Mean-Squared-Error (NMSE) and qualitative scoring were used for the former study. Tracer-kinetic (K-trans ,v(e) ,v(p) ) and hemodynamic (rCBV,rCBF) parameters computed from both protocols were used to differentiate LGG and HGG.
   Results: The image quality of all structural images was found to be of diagnostic quality till R = 4. NMSE in healthy T1-W-FFE images and COV in phantom images increased with-respect-to R and images provided optimum quality till R = 4. Structural images and maps exhibited artefacts from R = 6. All parameters in tumor tissue and hemodynamic parameters in healthy gray matter tissue computed from both protocols were not significantly different. Parameters computed from protocol-2 performed better in terms of glioma grading. For both protocols, rCBF performed least (AUC = 0.759 and 0.851) and combination of all parameters performed best (AUC = 0.890 and 0.964).
   Conclusion: CSENSE (R = 4) can be used to improve the resolution and brain coverage for T1-Perfusion analysis used to differentiate gliomas.

AB  - Aim: To study the prevalence of lagophthalmos and its related complications among the unconscious patients admitted in the intensive care units (ICU)/wards of a tertiary care centre. Methods: Cross-sectional observational study. Results: A total of 87 unconscious patients were included. 44 were children and 43 were adults. The overall median age of patients was 16 years (range: 9 days- 85 years). 53/87 (60.91%) showed signs of lagophthalmos, among which 56.60% (30/53) were children and 43.40% (23/53) were adults. There was no signi ficant dif- ference in the exposure patterns between children and adults (p = 0.25). Exposure related manifestations (conjunctival/corneal) were found in 49/87 patients (56.32%). The most common conjunctival manifestation was chemosis, occurring in 28/53 patients (52.83%). Corneal exposure was seen in 31/53 patients (58.49%), of which fragile epithelium was the commonest finding (32.08%). Only 17/31 (54.83%) cornea exposed eyes were taped, of which 15 were sub -optimal. 6 patients were unnecessarily taped. Signs of infection were noted in 8/53 eyes (15.09%). Conclusion: Optimal eye care in unconscious patients can avert the development of exposure -related compli- cations and subsequent ocular morbidity. Adoption and implementation of systematic protocols can help im- prove the standard of care.

AB  - Low-flow-mediated constriction (LFMC) has been used to assess resting endothelial function in peripheral conduit arteries. The literature describes discrepancies in the behaviour of radial versus brachial artery in response to low-flow state, the reasons for which were not addressed in a systematic and scientific way. Moreover, the influence of handedness on observed LFMC responses has not been investigated. The present study aimed at systematic measurement and comparison of the LFMC responses in radial and brachial arteries of both dominant and non-dominant arms of healthy human volunteers. We also investigated the physiological factors associated with differential LFMC response of radial versus brachial artery in the same group of subjects. Longitudinal B mode ultrasonographic cine loops of radial and brachial arteries were acquired at baseline and after producing distal circulatory arrest. Cine loops were screen grabbed and analyzed later using automated edge detection algorithms to measure end-diastolic diameters. Distal circulatory arrest was produced over the proximal forearm (for the brachial artery) and over the wrist (for the radial artery) at 250 mm Hg for 5 min after baseline measurements. Results suggested that arterial location (p = 0.0001) and baseline diameter (p < 0.0021) emerged as independent predictors of LFMC response. Differences in the LFMC responses are handedness independent and could be attributed to the arterial location along with the differences in their baseline diameters.

Methods Patients of chronic inflammatory arthritis of the knee underwent pretherapeutic evaluation in a form of knee ultrasonogram, bone scan and clinical evaluation. Fifty-seven recruited patients were allocated at random to receive either intraarticular injections of Lu-177 tin colloid or Re-188 tin colloid. Eventually, 27 patients received Re-188 tin colloid and 30 patients received Lu-177 tin colloid. The joint was then immobilized for 2 days. Response evaluation was done using knee ultrasound, bone scan and clinical findings. Result Of 30, 20 patients responded to radiosynovectomy in the Lu-177 tin colloid group compared to 21/27 patients in the Re-188 tin colloid group. Conclusion Lu-177 tin colloid is an effective alternative to Re-188 tin colloid for radiosynovectomy in patients with chronic inflammatory knee arthritis.

AB  - To find the clinical profile and prevalence of conjunctivitis and other ocular manifestations in mild COVID-19 positive patients in a nodal COVID-19 hospital. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional, single-center study conducted in 127 mild cases of COVID-19 positive patients admitted between 27th March and 19th April 2020 in a tertiary care COVID-19 hospital in north India. From the hospital records, demographic data is collected. Ocular history and ocular examinations were done by face-to-face survey during ward rounds. Results: A total of 127 patients were included in the study with a median age of 38.8 years. Forty-eight (37.80%) patients had upper respiratory tract symptoms, 20 (15.75%) patients had systemic illness, 18 (14.17%) patients were using spectacles, and 50 (39.37%) patients had history of hand-eye contact. Out of 12 (9.45%) patients who had ocular complaints, 11 (8.66%) had ocular manifestation after admission. Among 11 patients, eight (6.29%) had conjunctival congestion. Three (3/8) patients had developed conjunctival congestion even before the manifestation of definite COVID-19 symptoms. Five patients (5/8) patients had no other associated ocular symptoms other than congestion. Six patients (6/8) had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Conclusion: Mild conjunctivitis manifesting as conjunctival congestion is common and is one of the major ocular manifestations in COVID-19 positive patients even with milder disease.

TI  - Recalcitrant eumycetoma of the foot: Financial burden a major barrier on the road of recovery
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Eumycotic mycetoma has been recently included in the World Health Organization's list of neglected tropical diseases. It is the first fungal infection to get such significant attention by the international health community. The disease is distributed worldwide, with majority of cases reported from tropical and subtropical countries like India, Mexico and Sub-Saharan areas of Africa. However, due to chronic course of disease or lack of adequate medical services, the reported cases represent only the tip of iceberg. In addition to this, even after diagnosing the disease on time, successful outcomes are further hampered by various factors like duration, cost, toxicity, and compliance to treatment. We report a case of refractory eumycetoma who initially responded to the therapy but interruption due to financial constraints led to worsening of lesions and, finally, ending into amputation.
   A 30-year-old male resident of Rajasthan, India, presented to our Dermatology outpatient department with complaint of recurrent swelling on the left sole with multiple discharging sinuses. A small papule developed 15 years back, which slowly increased in size associated with bloody discharge and black granules. The patient could not recall any history of trauma. Due to recurrent episodes, multiple surgical excisions were performed providing temporarily relief only. He was then referred to our hospital, which is the apex health care institute of India. Grains collected from discharging sinuses were 1 mm to 2 mm, hard in consistency, crushed, and subjected to microscopy and culture. The potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount of discharge with black grains did not reveal any fungal elements. However, the KOH-calcofluor staining showed the presence of septate hyphae, and Madurella sp. grew on culture. Despite on itraconazole and terbinafine therapy, recurrence occurred after 5 months, with repeat culture also growing Madurella sp. Surgical excision was done, and posaconazole was added along with continuation of terbinafine. The patient showed clinical improvement after eleven months of treatment, after which he stopped treatment due to financial constraints. The lesions recurred within the following months, and he finally had to undergo amputation.
   Management of recurrent cases with newer potent antifungal, such as posaconazole, should be considered early in the course of the disease. Financial burden, prolonged duration, tolerability, and compliance with medical therapy are issues which need to be addressed. Such patient and their kin should be counseled for completing the regimen in spite of high cost of the drugs as it might prevent amputation, which in turn might affect their livelihood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Locally aggressive vertebral body tumors of the axis must be treated with wide local excision for best outcome. Reconstruction of the load-bearing vertebra needs to be done after tumor resection in such a manner so as to give stable, long-term fusion in this young population.
   METHODS: We describe the management strategy of a 25-year-old acutely quadriplegic patient, with respiratory distress, with a C2 giant cell tumor. The use of a novel iliac crest graft modification used for C2 reconstruction along with a modified mesh cage used as an anterior plate has been reported.
   RESULTS: The patient had a good outcome at 18 months' follow-up, with neurologic improvement and a solid fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Iliac crest autograft is inexpensive and easy to harvest and can be considered as a C2 prosthesis, especially in a resource-constrained setting. Modified iliac crest graft can be used for load transmission from C1 lateral mass to C3 body, and the mesh cage can be modified according to need as a plate with good results in an emergency.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Genetic factors play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive aging. However, it is unclear whether risk loci identified in European ancestry (EA) populations have similar effects in other groups, such as South Asians. DESIGN We investigated the allelic distribution and cognitive associations of 56 known AD risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from three EA genome-wide association studies (EA-GWASs) in a South Asian population. Single SNP and genetic risk score (GRS) associations with measures of episodic memory were assessed. SETTING The Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD). PARTICIPANTS A total of 906 LASI-DAD participants from diverse states in India. MEASUREMENTS Participants were genotyped using the Illumina Global Screening Array and imputed with 1000G Phase 3v5. Cognitive measures included total learning and delayed word recall. RESULTS Although only a few SNPs were significantly associated with memory scores (P < .05), effect estimates from the EA-GWAS and the LASI-DAD showed moderate correlation (0.35-0.88) in the expected direction. GRSs were also associated with memory scores, although percentage variation explained was small (0.1%-0.6%). CONCLUSIONS Discrepancies in allele frequencies and cognitive association results suggest that genetic factors found predominantly through EA-GWASs may play a limited role in South Asians. However, the extent of differences in the genetic architecture of AD and cognition in EA and South Asians remains uncertain. There is also a critical need to perform a more comprehensive assessment of the mutational spectrum of South Asia to identify novel genetic variants associated with AD and cognition in this population.

AB  - Synchronized and coherent activity in resting-networks during normal brain functioning could be altered in disconnection syndrome like schizophrenia. Study of neural oscillations as assessed by EEG appears to be a promising proposition to understand the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in patients and their first-degree relatives, where disturbances in neural oscillations point towards genetic predisposition. Therefore, present study aims at establishing EEG based biomarkers for early detection and management strategies. Thirty-two patients with schizophrenia, 28 first-degree relatives and 31 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Resting brain activity was recorded using 128-channel electroencephalography. After pre-processing and independent component analysis (ICA), an equivalent current dipole was estimated for each IC. Total of 1551 independent and localizable EEG components across all groups were used in subsequent analysis. Power spectral density and source coherence between IC clusters were computed. Patients and first-degree relatives displayed significantly higher power spectral density (PSD) than HC for all frequency bands in left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) (-7, -26, 8; BA 27). Another region within left deep PHG (-4, -28, 1), however, distinguished patients from first-degree relatives and HC in terms of significantly lower PSD in higher frequency bands. Functional connectivity (FC) was found to be lower in patients and higher in relatives compared to HC between different resting-state network areas. In patients, connectivity was lower compared to first-degree relatives. Altered activity within left PHG and FC of primarily this with other areas in resting-state network can serve as state and trait markers of schizophrenia. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a form of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhoea that has the potential to drastically reduce child mortality; yet, according to UNICEF estimates, less than half of children younger than 5 years with diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) received ORS in 2016. A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS, RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs.
   Methods We used a Bayesian geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous continent-wide surfaces in 2000-17, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 2 center dot 5th and 97 center dot 5th percentiles of those 250 draws.
   Findings While ORS use among children with diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below 50% in the majority (62 center dot 6%; 12 417 of 19 823) of second administrative-level units and an estimated 6 519 000 children (95% UI 5 254 000-7 733 000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017. Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations, and an estimated 52 230 diarrhoeal deaths (36 910-68 860) were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains lower than average.
   Interpretation To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities. Over 50 years after the discovery that led to this simple, cheap, and life-saving therapy, large gains in reducing mortality could still be made by reducing geographical inequalities in ORS coverage.

AB  - Studies on relationship between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) gene A1298C polymorphism with the risk of ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke have shown discordant results. Present meta-analysis was aimed to clarify the relationship between MTHFR gene A1298C polymorphism with risk of stroke. A comprehensive literature search for all published articles was performed in electronic database including PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Trip Databases, Worldwide Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar up to 31st December 2019. Pooled odds ratio (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) under dominant, recessive, and allelic models was calculated. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to detect the heterogeneity. In our meta-analysis, a total of 20 studies with 19 case control studies involving 2871 ischemic stroke (IS) cases and 3984 controls and 3 studies with 201 hemorrhagic stroke cases and 1349 controls were included. Our findings suggest that there was a significant relationship between MTHFR gene A1298C gene polymorphism with risk of ischemic stroke (dominant model: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06-1.66, recessive model: OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.06-1.99 and allelic model: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.00-1.84, respectively). However, no significant relationship between MTHFR gene A1298C gene polymorphism with the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Findings of this meta-analysis concludes that MTHFR gene A1298 C polymorphism could be capable of increasing stroke susceptibility in Asian, but not in Caucasian population. Genotyping of MTHFR gene A1298C polymorphism may be used as a predictor for the occurrence of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Isoproterenol (ISO) induced oxidative stress and inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial necrosis. To optimize the effect of erdosteine against myocardial necrosis, male albino Wistar rats were divided into eight groups (n = 6), that is, normal, ISO-control, erdosteine pretreatment with ISO. Rats were administered erdosteine orally for 28 days. Two doses of ISO (85 mg/kg), s.c. were given to ISO-C and erdosteine treatment groups on the 27th and 28th day. On the 29th day, hemodynamic parameters were recorded and the heart was excised for further parameters. In ISO-C rats, significantly increased levels of inflammatory markers, pro-oxidants, and structural damage were observed as compared with normal group. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling revealed an increased expression of apoptotic proteins. Erdosteine at 80 mg/kg reversed the deleterious effects of ISO and normalized myocardium. Erdosteine showed anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antioxidant activities through inhibition of MAPK and Nrf-2/HO-1 pathways. To conclude, erdosteine was found protective in ISO-induced myocardial necrosis through MAPK and Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway.

AB  - Background Kaposiform haemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular tumor and may involve skin, deep soft tissue or bone. It is a locally aggressive tumor usually seen in infants. Here we report a case of kaposiform hemagioendothelioma in a child who responded to propranolol and steroids. Case presentation A 3-year-old male child presented with a swelling below his right knee with characteristic violet skin lesion. There was no evidence of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon. After no improvement with several attempts at debridement and anti-tubercular treatment; a diagnosis of Kaposiform Haemangioendothelioma was reached on the basis of overall clinical picture and histology. The child was treated with propranolol and steroids and had an excellent clinical response and a near complete resolution on imaging at 5 months. Conclusions These cases are often misdiagnosed and despite a delay in diagnosis have good outcomes with appropriate multimodality management. This case highlights the unique and typical characteristics of kaposiform haemangioendothelioma.

AB  - Background: Anti-malarial drugs inhibit coronaviruses in-vitro. Few published studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
   Materials and Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials and observational studies. Major database searches were carried out up until June 5, 2020. Participants admitted with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS Cov-2 (COVID-19) infection were included. The "Intervention group" received anti-malarial drugs with or without other drugs (Azithromycin) administered as an adjunct to the standard treatment/care. The "Control group" received treatment except anti-malarial drugs. The primary outcome is "all-cause mortality." Secondary outcome measures were effects on clinical and laboratory parameters and adverse events.
   Results: Of 3,472 citations, 17 (six clinical trials and 11 observational studies) studies provided data of 8,071 participants. Compared to the control, Hydroxy-chloroquine (HCQ) has no significant effect on mortality [(OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.46-1.64); eight observational studies; N = 5,944]. Data from a single, small non-randomized trial (N = 42) also reached a similar conclusion (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.07-50.57; p = 0.69). Compared to the control, HCQ plus Azithromycin (AZM) significantly increased mortality [(OR 2.84; 95% CI 2.19-3.69); four observational studies; N = 2,310]. Compared to the control, risk of any adverse event was significantly increased in HCQ group [(OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.58-7.13); four clinical trials; N = 263]. Compared to control, risk of adverse cardiac events (abnormal ECG, arrhythmia, or QT prolongation) were not significantly increased in HCQ group (but significantly increased in the HCQ plus AZM group). The GRADE evidence generated for all the outcomes was of "very low-quality."
   Conclusions: As very low quality evidence suggests an increased risk of mortality and adverse event with HCQ plus Azithromycin combination (not HCQ alone), caution should be exercised while prescribing this combination for treatment of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infection. Good quality, multi-centric RCTs (including both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients) are required for any firm recommendation to be made during the ongoing pandemic.

AB  - Background and objective The optimal management of large vestibular schwannomas continues to be debated. We constituted a task force comprising the members of the EANS skull base committee along with international experts to derive recommendations for the management of this problem from a European perspective. Material and methods A systematic review of MEDLINE database, in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines, was performed. A subgroup analysis screening all surgical series published within the last 20 years (January 2000 to March 2020) was performed. Weighted summary rates for tumor resection, oncological control, and facial nerve preservation were determined using meta-analysis models. This data along with contemporary practice patterns were discussed within the task force to generate consensual recommendations regarding preoperative evaluations, optimal surgical strategy, and follow-up management. Results Tumor classification grades should be systematically used in the perioperative management of patients, with large vestibular schwannomas (VS) defined as > 30 mm in the largest extrameatal diameter. Grading scales for pre- and postoperative hearing (AAO-HNS or GR) and facial nerve function (HB) are to be used for reporting functional outcome. There is a lack of consensus to support the superiority of any surgical strategy with respect to extent of resection and use of adjuvant radiosurgery. Intraoperative neuromonitoring needs to be routinely used to preserve neural function. Recommendations for postoperative clinico-radiological evaluations have been elucidated based on the surgical strategy employed. Conclusion The main goal of management of large vestibular schwannomas should focus on maintaining/improving quality of life (QoL), making every attempt at facial/cochlear nerve functional preservation while ensuring optimal oncological control, thereby allowing to meet patient expectations. Despite the fact that this analysis yielded only a few Class B evidences and mostly expert opinions, it will guide practitioners to manage these patients and form the basis for future clinical trials.

AB  - Background Informational discontinuity can have far reaching consequences like medical errors, increased re-hospitalization rates and adverse events among others. Thus the holy grail of seamless informational continuity in healthcare has been an enigma with some nations going the digital way. Digitization in healthcare in India is fast catching up. The current study explores the components of informational continuity, its impact on clinical decision-making and captures the general perception among the doctors towards a digital solution. Methods Cross-sectional study with snowball sampling. A survey questionnaire was developed and validated through a pilot study, then circulated through online platforms. Responses from doctors were obtained through an online Google form for a period of 3 months and analyzed using SPSS 20. The categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square test. Results 1413 responses were obtained through a national level survey. Respondents were from a wide range of work experiences, locations, sectors, specialties and patient load. Components of patient records like clinical notes, investigation reports, previous diagnosis and treatment details were rated to be very important. 41% reported about half and 20% reported about 3/4th of their patients do not bring relevant records. Patients from rural areas, visiting state government hospitals and visiting general practitioners were less likely to bring relevant records during consultations. The fallouts of not having timely relevant patient information of the patients include more time per patient, repeat investigations, difficulty to arrive at definitive diagnosis, difficulty to take further treatment decisions and impaired overall clinical decision making which were said to be significant by respondents across the spectrum. The benefits of having timely relevant patient information were also reported consistently across the spectrum. An overwhelming proportion (83%), from across the spectrum, unequivocally expressed their willingness to use digital platforms for accessing patients' relevant medical records. Conclusion Prevalence of informational discontinuity and its impact on clinical decision making is significant with definite benefits of having timely relevant medical history. There is strong willingness among the doctors to use digital solution(s)without any extra investment or effort on their partmaking customized solutions pertinent.

AB  - Primary focal hyperhidrosis is a common reason for dermatology outpatient visit and has significant impact on patient's social and professional activities. The study describes the clinical profile of those patients and response with aluminum chloride hexahydrate lotion (ACH 20%) and oral glycopyrrolate (OGP). A retrospective study was carried out at a tertiary care center between the year 2016 and 2018. Details of history, baseline assessment, treatment response recorded in specially designed proformas were analyzed. Initially, the patients received topical ACH daily at night. Non-responders were advised OGP 1 mg BD and increased to 2 mg BD if they did not respond. Response was measured according to patient global assessment and objective evaluation of sweating. Among total 69 patients 57 had onset <10 years of age. There was male preponderance and most common trigger was situations causing anxiety (n = 15). Around 15.3% patients got adequate response with ACH lotion. The cumulative response increased to 45.8% by addition of OGP 1 mg BD and to 55.9% by increasing the dose to 2 mg BD. Addition of OGP to topical ACH increases the treatment efficacy in patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis. Increasing the glycopyrrolate dose augments the response further. However, the current medical treatment options are able to give moderate response.

AB  - Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the major reasons for renal failure. It provides vital clues to estimate the stage and the proliferation rate of end-stage kidney disease. IgA stage can be estimated with the help of MEST-C score. The manual estimation of MEST-C score from whole slide kidney images is a very tedious and difficult task. This study uses some Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) related models to detect mesangial hypercellularity (M score) in MEST-C. CNN learns the features directly from image data without the requirement of analytical data. CNN is trained efficiently when image data size is large enough for a particular class. In the case of smaller data size, transfer learning can be used efficiently in which CNN is pre-trained on some general images and then on subject images. Since the data set size is small, time spent in collecting large data set is saved. The training time of transfer learning is also reduced because the model is already pre-trained. This research work aims at the detection of mesangial hypercellularity from biopsy images with small data size by utilizing the transfer learning. The dataset used in this research work consists of 138 individual glomerulus (x 20 magnification digital biopsy) images of IgA patients received from All India Institute of Medical Science, Delhi. Here, machine learning (k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM)) classifiers are compared to transfer learning CNN methods. The deep extracted image features are used by machine learning classifiers. The different evaluation parameters have been used for comparing the predictions of basic classifiers to the deep learning model. The research work concludes that the transfer learning deep CNN method can improve the detection of mesangial hypercellularity as compare to KNN, SVM methods when using the small data set. This model could help the pathologists to understand the stages of kidney failure.

AB  - Purpose Encouraged by the excellent outcomes of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) reported by many authors, we added this procedure to our bariatric armamentarium in 2015. Here we present our initial experience of 68 cases and findings from routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 1 year. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of a single surgical unit in a tertiary referral centre. Patients undergoing OAGB from January 2015 to May 2019 were included. A fixed biliopancreatic (BP) limb length of 200 cm was used in all patients. Surveillance endoscopy was done at 1-year follow-up. Results Sixty-eight patients, of whom 67.6% were females, were analysed. Mean age was 40.8 +/- 1 years. Mean preoperative weight and body mass index (BMI) were 131 +/- 24.7 kg and 51 +/- 7 kg/m(2), respectively. Median follow-up was 23 months (range 9-55 months), with 88% follow-up at 6 months and 1 year. At 1 year, mean total weight loss (TWL) and excess weight loss (EWL) were 35% and 71%, respectively. Endoscopy at 1 year revealed a 9.5% rate of marginal ulcers, majority of which healed with conservative treatment. Eighty-eight percent patients had complete remission of diabetes, and 94% had complete remission of hypertension. There was no 30-day mortality. Conclusion OAGB is a safe and effective bariatric procedure with excellent short-term outcomes in terms of weight loss, resolution of obesity-related co-morbidities and complications. Routine surveillance endoscopy at 1 year may detect asymptomatic marginal ulcers and, thus, prevent ulcer-related complications.

AB  - Objectives The present study sought to estimate the incidence and evaluate the patterns and associations of systemic venous anomalies in patients with tetralogy of Fallot on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography. Methods We retrospectively reviewed CT angiographies of 973 pediatric age group patients diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot, performed at our institution between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2019, for systemic venous drainage patterns. We also proposed a structured classification and reporting system on CT angiography which would simplify the characterization, classification, and communication of these anomalies. Results Variations in systemic venous drainage patterns were observed in 146 (15.01%) patients. The most commonly observed anomaly was persistence of left superior caval vein, which was seen in 112 (11.51%) patients, with the most prevalent pattern being the presence of bilateral superior caval veins with no intercommunicating vein (n = 85). The second most common anomaly observed was presence of anomalous brachiocephalic vein (39/973 [4.01%]). Patients with an anomalous course of brachiocephalic vein had significantly higher prevalence of a right aortic arch than those without (23/39 [58.97%] vs 188/934 [20.13%];P < .0001). Similarly, a higher prevalence of pulmonary atresia was noted in patients with an anomalous course of brachiocephalic vein compared to those without (8/39 [20.51%] vs 80/934 [8.57%];P = .0109). Conclusion There is a high incidence of anomalies of superior caval veins and brachiocephalic vein in the presence of tetralogy of Fallot. With advancements in corrective cardiac surgery and use of intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass, the presence of systemic venous anomalies assumes greater significance making preoperative identification of these anomalies imperative.

AB  - Opinion statement Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the management of metastatic and selected cases of unresectable advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Importantly for patients, this implies that in the absence of a targetable oncogenic driver [especially epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements] and in the presence of high programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (>= 50%), they are eligible for mono-therapy with pembrolizumab thereby avoiding chemotherapy as the first line of treatment. This mono-immunotherapy approach for high PD-L1 metastatic NSCLC is associated with improved overall survival (OS) and radiological responses (RR) with lesser toxicity as compared with conventional platinum doublet chemotherapy for both non-squamous and squamous histological types. However, majority of NSCLC patients either have no or low expression of PD-L1 (< 50%) and such patients derive greater benefit from a combination of PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs with platinum doublet chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy alone. Again, benefits are seen for both OS and RRs. However, combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy, in general, does lead to higher toxicity than those seen with either of the two alone. Additionally, for non-squamous NSCLC patients, clinicians should not initiate ICI treatment till the results of common targetable genetic alterations like EGFR mutation, ALK, and ROS1 gene rearrangement testing are known (preferably on broad next generation sequencing) and are negative (even if results of PD-L1 testing are available)-as targeted therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment for patients harboring these oncogenic drivers. It is worth mentioning that PD-1 and PD-L1 ICIs are very expensive, and their usage is associated with occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) which occasionally can be severe. Hence, it is important to discuss efficacy, toxicity, and cost-related to ICI treatment with each and every patient at diagnosis in order to help them decide if they are willing to go ahead with this form of therapy either singly (for high PD-L1 expressors) or in combination with chemotherapy (for others).

AB  - Background Fenestration of the baffle/conduit is believed to reduce pleural effusion following the Fontan operation. However, equivocal results have been observed with or without fenestration. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of fenestration on the amount and duration of pleural effusion following the Fontan operation. Methods About 40 patients undergoing extracardiac Fontan (ECF) were randomized into two groups: one with fenestration (ECF-F; n = 20) or without fenestration (ECF-NF; n = 20). Primary outcome was the amount and duration of pleural effusions. Secondary outcomes were time to removal of the chest tubes, hospital stay, and readmission to the hospital because of recurrent pleural within 30 days of the operation. Results Mean age was 11.5 +/- 5.07 (range, 8.7-13.5) years in the ECF-F group and 13.6 +/- 0.4 years (range, 10.5-15.5) in the (ECF-NF) group. The total drain output was 7.89 mL/kg/d in ECF-NF compared with 6.9 mL/kg/d in the ECF-group (P = .14). Time for removal of pleural tubes was 14.6 +/- 0.95 days in the ECF-NF group compared with 11.6 +/- days in the ECF-F group. Total duration of hospital stay was higher but not significant in the ECF-NF group compared with the ECF-F group. Two patients in ECF-NF required readmission to the hospital within 30 days following discharge, while there were no readmissions in the ECF-F group. Conclusion Contrary to the literature, the creation of a fenestration in the ECF circuit was not clearly associated with a reduction in the amount and duration of pleural effusion compared with a non-fenestrated Fontan. These findings may be debatable in high risks versus low risk candidates. However in the present study, in a low risk canditates undergoing the Fontan operation, the daily amount of pleural drainage was no different. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Purpose A few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared crystalloid-based goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) with starch-based GDFT in patients undergoing major surgical procedures with conflicting results. In this meta-analysis, colloid-based GDFT was compared with crystalloid-based GDFT. Methods In this meta-analysis, RCTs comparing colloid- and crystalloid-based GDFT in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery were included. Binary outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes were reported as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). PubMed, PubMed central, The Cochrane Library database and EMBASE were searched for potentially eligible trials from inception to 28 February 2020. Results Data of 2392 patients from nine RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Mortality at the longest available follow-up [RR (95% CI) 1.44 (0.88, 2.34);p = 0.15], postoperative kidney dysfunction [RR (95% CI) 1.07 (0.72, 1.60);p = 0.73], postoperative length of hospital stay [MD (95% CI) - 0.29 ( - 1.25, 0.66) d;p = 0.55], cardiovascular complications [RR (95% CI) 1.20 (0.50, 2.88);p = 0.68], wound complications [RR (95% CI) 1.08 (0.76, 1.54);p = 0.66], pulmonary complications [RR (95% CI) 0.90 (0.71, 1.140);p = 0.40] and bleeding [RR (95% CI) 1.24 (0.77, 1.99);p = 0.37] were similar in both the groups. Postoperative major complications were also similar between patients who received colloid and crystalloid [RR (95% CI) 0.79 (0.48, 1.29);p = 0.34]. Conclusion Colloids in goal-directed fluid therapy protocol does not offer any benefit over crystalloid-based goal-directed fluid therapy protocol in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgical procedure.

AB  - The human implantation failure during first trimester leads to spontaneous abortions. Spontaneous abortions are consecutive and occur twice or thrice (with or without prior live births) due to factors which are either maternal or fetal. However, it also constitutes of unknown etiology; known as unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions (URSA). In this study, the medical terminated human normal early pregnancies (NEP) of the first trimester were taken as control samples, the normal decidual sample whose molecular and epigenetic changes were compared with that of decidua of human URSA subjects. Apoptosis-related genes reported in consecutive recurrent pregnancy loss became the basis for this study. So, in this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that "p53 methylation level through methyltransferases (G9aMT and DNMT1) implicates the fate of embryo towards sustenance or cessation of pregnancy". Further, the interaction between P53, BAX, BCL-2, CASPASE-6, G9aMT, DNMT-1, and methylated p53 expression level(s) during the first trimester of both URSA and NEP are included in this study. The degree of p53 methylation during the first trimester is found to be significant and positively correlated with that of G9aMT (p < 0.05), BCL-2 (p < 0.001), and DNMT1 (p < 0.001) at both transcript and protein level. A significant and negative correlation (with p-value < 0.001) between the degree of p53 methylation during the first trimester and that of the expression level of TUNEL assay (Apoptosis), P53, BAX, and CASPASE-6 are also observed in the present study. A positive correlation between apoptosis and a higher level of p53 expression (which is possibly due to low degree of p53 methylation) is observed both at the transcript and protein level in URSA which is in line with our findings. The analysis performed using structural equation modelling (SEM) further throws light on the causal relationship between sustenance of pregnancy or URSA during the first trimester of a human pregnancy and degree of methylation of p53 which is closely correlated with the interaction between G9aMT, DNMT1, BCL-2, BAX, P53, CASPASE-6, and apoptosis.

AB  - Seizures are the most common brain dysfunction. EEG is required for their detection and treatment initially. Studies proved that if seizures are detected at their early stage, proper and effective treatment can be given to patients. Automatic detection of seizures using the EEG signal was a very powerful area of research during the last decade. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature for feature extraction and classification of recorded EEG signals for seizure detection. However, to achieve reliable performance, some challenges in this area need to be addressed. In this work, an algorithm for seizure detection has been proposed, which is a combination of frequency-domain features and neutrosophic logic-based k-means nearest neighbor (NL-k-NN) classifier. An EEG database, collected at All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, has been used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The consistency in the performance of the proposed algorithm has been checked by applying it to the well-known Bonn University and CHB-MIT scalp EEG datasets. The classification accuracies of 98.16%, 100%, and 89.06% were achieved when the proposed algorithm was tested with AIIMS, Bonn University, and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. The main contribution of this study is that a novel neutrosophic classifier is proposed in the field of seizure detection, for improvement in reliability and precision. The accuracy of the NL-k-NN classifier has further been established by comparing it with the reported results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and traditional k-NN classifiers.

AB  - Biological understanding of pigmentation and its association with clinicopathological implications in uveal melanoma (UM) risk is still unexplored. HECT and RLD Domain Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 2 (HERC2) and Pink-eyed dilution protein (P-protein) are the important markers that regulate pigmentation in eye. Therefore, our aim of the study was to investigate the expression of HERC2 and P-protein in the UM patients and correlate with patient outcome. Fifty-two formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded UM tissue samples were included to detect the expression of HERC2 and P-protein by immunohistochemistry and validated by western blot. Cox proportional hazard model and log-rank test were used to determine the prognostic potential of these proteins. High pigmentation was seen in 67% of the UM cases. The expression of HERC2 and P-protein was present in 44% and 71% cases, respectively. On statistical analysis, increased pigmentation, epithelioid cell type, and ciliary body invasion were significant with the protein expressions (p < 0.05). Metastasis-free survival was reduced in UM cases which expressed HERC2 and P-protein. On multivariate analysis, P-protein expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor. Our findings suggest that HERC2 and P-protein could be used as novel predictors of high pigmentation in UM cases which have high metastatic potential.

AB  - Background and Aim The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly crossed international boundaries and placed increasing demands on healthcare facilities worldwide. Patients with diabetes and uncontrolled blood glucose levels are at increased risk for poor clinical outcomes and in-hospital mortality related to COVID-19. Therefore, achieving good glycaemic control is of paramount importance among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Basal-bolus insulin therapy is a safe and effective intervention for the management of hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients. The aim of this article is to provide a practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. Methods This guidance document was formulated based on the review of available literature and the combined personal experiences of the authors. We provide a comprehensive review on the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen, including its principles, rationale, indications, prerequisites, initiation, and dose titration, and also suggest targets for blood glucose control and different levels of capillary blood glucose monitoring. Various case scenarios are used to illustrate how optimal glucose control can be achieved, such as through adjustments in doses of prandial and basal insulin, the use of correctional insulin dosing and changes in the timing and content of major and minor meals. Conclusion The practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus presented here can be used for patients admitted to hospital for indications other than COVID-19 and for those in ambulatory care.

AB  - Background Genetic diathesis of suicide is supported by family and twin studies. Few candidate gene pathways are known, but does not explain fully the complexity of suicide genetic risk. Recent investigations opting for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) resulted in finding additional targets, but replication remained a challenge. In this respect small isolated population approach in several complex disease phenotypes is found encouraging. The present study is an attempt to re-test some of the reported significant SNPs for suicide among a small historical high- risk isolated population from Northeast India. Methods Two hundred ten cases (inclusive of depressed, suicide attempter and depressed + suicide attempter) and 249 controls were considered in the present study which were evaluated for the psychiatric parameters. Sixteen reported significant SNPs for suicide behaviour were re-tested using association approach under various genetic models. Networking by GeneMANIA tool was used for function prediction of the associated genes. Results Seven SNPs (of 6 genes) remained significant in different genetic models. On networking genes with significant SNPsIL7, RHEB, CTNN3, KCNIP4,ARFGEF3are found in interaction with already known candidate gene pathways while SNP rs1109089(RHEB) gained further support from earlier expression studies.NUGGCgene is in complete isolation. Conclusions Small population approach in replicating significant SNPs is useful in complex phenotypes like suicide. This study explored the region-specific demographics of India by identifying vulnerable population for suicide via genetic association analysis in bringing into academic and administrative forum, the importance of suicide as a disease and its biological basis.

AB  - Background Approximately 40% children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) invariably relapse, after attaining the first complete remission (CR), with dismal long-term outcome. There is little consensus regarding choice of optimal induction chemotherapy regimen for relapsed pediatric AML. Procedure A prospective single arm phase II study (CTRI/2017/02/007757) was carried out at our center to evaluate the safety and efficacy of outpatient cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE) regimen in pediatric AML (<= 18 years) at the first relapse. Response evaluation was done by bone marrow aspiration morphology along with minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment. All adverse events including need and duration of hospitalization, transfusion support, and antimicrobial use were recorded. Results Total 45 patients were included with median age of 12 years. The CR rate of the cohort was 66% and 54% of patients were MRD negative. The estimated 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 29% (+/- 7%) and 34% (+/- 7%), respectively. The presence of fever at relapse was associated with inferior CR rate (P = .001), positive MRD (P = .01), and inferior EFS (P = .02), while not achieving nadir absolute neutrophil count of zero during induction was associated with inferior CR rate (P = .03) and inferior OS (P = .04). Approximately all patients developed >= Grade 3 cytopenia and febrile neutropenia. Twenty-six (59%) patients required hospitalization for management of toxicity and there were four (9%) deaths attributed to infection. Conclusion ADE is an effective induction regimen for pediatric AML patients at the first relapse with reasonable toxicity profile. Outpatient administration of the regimen is feasible in the presence of proper support structure and rigorous follow up.

AB  - Nickel-Titanium (Nitinol) alloy is one of the shape memory alloys with potential applications in biomedical and aerospace industries. However, long-term deployment of nitinol-based alloys in fluid medium leads to corrosion. In an attempt to improve the corrosion resistance, electrochemical studies were performed on laser processed nitinol in the presence of simulated body fluid. Design of experiments technique of central composite design was used to formulate the five levels of the three laser processing parameters for surface texturing including average power, pulse frequency, and laser irradiation per unit area. The output responses such as corrosion potential, corrosion current, and corrosion rate were evaluated using response surface methodology. The linear and nonlinear interaction effects of the processing parameters on the output responses were analyzed. A decrease in the corrosion rate of three orders of magnitude was observed in laser processed nitinol in comparison to pristine nitinol.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection stimulates the release of cytokines, including interferons (IFNs). IFNs are initiators, regulators, and effectors of innate and adaptive immunity. Accordingly, the expression levels of Type I (alpha, beta) and II (gamma) IFNs, among untreated tuberculosis (TB) patients and household contacts (HHC) clinically free of TB was assessed. A total of 264 individuals (TB patients-123; HHC-86; laboratory volunteers-55; Treated TB patients-36) were enrolled for this study. IFN-alpha mRNA expression levels predominated compared to IFN-gamma and IFN-beta among untreated TB patients. IFN-alpha transcripts were similar to 3.5 folds higher in TB patients compared to HHC, (p<0.0001). High expression of IFN-alpha was seen among 46% (56/123) of the TB patients and 26%, (22/86) of HHCs. The expression levels of IFN-alpha correlated with that of IFN transcriptional release factor 7 (IRF) (p<0.0001). In contrast, an inverse relationship exists between PGE2 and IFN-alpha expression levels; high IFN-alpha expressers were associated with low levels of PGE2 and vice-versa (Spearman's rho = -0.563; p<0.0001). In-vitro, IFN-alpha failed to restrict the replication of intracellular M.tb. The anti-mycobacterial activity of IFN-gamma was compromised in the presence of IFN-alpha, but not by IFN-beta. The expression of IFN-alpha and beta diminished or is absent, among successfully treated TB patients. These observations suggest the utility of assessment of Type I IFNs expression levels as a prognostic marker to monitor tuberculosis patient response to chemotherapy because changes in Type I IFNs expression are expected to precede the clearance and /reduction in bacterial load.

AB  - Background: Pre-licensure trials of ROTAVAC (R) were not adequately powered to assess risk of intussusception, a rare adverse event associated with other rotavirus vaccines in some settings. We examined the risk of intussusception after ROTAVAC (R) vaccination among Indian infants during pilot rollout of the vaccine in the public health system in three states - Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
   Methods: Passive surveillance for intussusception was set up in 35 sentinel health facilities covering 26.3 million population in the three states under monitoring of an Interministerial-Interagency Steering Committee. Clinical and immunization data were collected by independent teams. An expert committee blinded to vaccination status, classified intussusception cases using Brighton criteria. The self-controlled case-series method was used to estimate risk of intussusception (Brighton Level 1) after ROTAVAC (R) vaccination.
   Results: 151 intussusception cases were included in the analysis. The relative incidence (incidence during the risk period compared to the control period) 1-21 days after doses 1 and 2 combined was 1.56 (95% CI, 0.0-5.28) and that for three doses combined was 1.88 (95% CI, 0.76-4.30). Attributable risk 1-21 days after doses 1 and 2 combined was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.0-0.25) and that for 3 doses combined was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.0-0.70) per 100,000 doses.
   Conclusions: No increased risk of intussusception within 21 days of receipt of the first two doses combined or all 3 doses combined of ROTAVAC (R) was detected. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background and Objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown has presented a unique challenge for sarcoma care. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early results and feasibility of surgeries for bone sarcomas during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods Our prospectively collected orthopaedic oncological database was reviewed to include two groups of patients- those who underwent surgery in the immediate 4 weeks before lockdown (non-lockdown group) and those operated in the first 4 weeks of lockdown (lockdown group). All patients were followed-up clinically and telephonically to collect the outcome data. Results Out of the 91 patients who qualified for inclusion, fifty were classified into the non-lockdown group while 41 patients formed the lockdown group. Both the groups were comparable with respect to baseline demographic parameters. However, during the lockdown period 37 patients (90%) had undergone a major surgical intervention as against 24 patients (48%) in the non-lockdown group (P < .001). There was no significant difference in type of anaesthesia, median estimated blood loss and procedure duration. None of the patients/health care workers had evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection at 15 days follow-up. Conclusion Our study results suggest that appendicular bone tumours can be safely operated with adequate precautions during the lockdown period.

AB  - Survivorship care is a major area of focus in the holistic management of childhood cancer with current knowledge and information almost exclusively from high-income countries. In this review, we summarize the state of scientific knowledge, service delivery, advocacy initiatives, and research efforts in this field in India. Twenty-one single-center studies published until today (20 in the last decade) confirm some of the well-documented issues in childhood cancer survivors and highlight the high prevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection in our survivors. Heterogeneity in methodology, outcome metrics, and quality precludes drawing further conclusions, and the ongoing multicenter Indian Pediatric Oncology Group study would address this. Besides the usual model of follow-up clinics in hospital settings, innovative models of service delivery led by not-for-profit organizations are being developed. Advocacy initiatives driven by survivors and support groups are also under way. All of these portend a promising future.

AB  - Mucolipidosis (ML) (OMIM 607840 & 607838) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder that occurs due to the deficiency of golgi enzyme uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) responsible for tagging mannose-6-phosphate for proper trafficking of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. Variants in GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (GNPTAB (alpha, beta subunits) and GNPTG (gamma subunits) are known to result in impaired targeting of lysosomal enzymes leading to Mucolipidosis (ML) Type II or Type III. We analyzed 69 Indian families of MLII/III for clinical features and molecular spectrum and performed in silico analysis for novel variants. We identified 38 pathogenic variants inGNPTABand 5 pathogenic variants inGNPTGgenes including missense, frame shift, deletion, duplication and splice site variations. A total of 26 novel variants were identified inGNPTABand 4 inGNPTGgene. In silico studies using mutation prediction software like SIFT, Polyphen2 and protein structure analysis further confirmed the pathogenic nature of the novel sequence variants detected in our study. Except for a common variant c.3503_3504delTC in early onset MLII, we could not establish any other significant genotype and phenotype correlation. This is one of the largest studies reported till date on Mucolipidosis II/III in order to identify mutation spectrum and any recurrent mutations specific to the Indian ethnic population. The mutational spectrum information in Indian patients will be useful in better genetic counselling, carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis for patients with ML II/III.

AB  - Background and aims Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and distressing toxicity in children on chemotherapy. There are a limited number of safe and effective therapeutic options available for OM. Ketamine oral rinse has shown promising results in a few studies in adults. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial aimed to test the efficacy of ketamine mouthwash in reducing chemotherapy-induced severe OM pain in children. Methods Children aged 8-18 years with severe OM were randomized to a single dose of ketamine mouthwash (4 mg/mL solution; dose 1 mg/kg) or a placebo. A sample size of 44 patients was determined. Pain score (6-point faces scale) was noted at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. The outcome variables were a reduction in pain score, need for rescue medications, and adverse events. Results The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. The mean OM pain at 60 min decreased by 1.64 points (CI 1.13-2.14) in the ketamine group and 1.32 points (CI 0.76-1.87) in the placebo group (P = 0.425), with a group difference of 0.32 points. Rescue pain medication (at 60 min) was required in 13.6% in the ketamine group and 18.2% in the placebo group (P = 1.000). No significant adverse events were observed. Conclusions Among children on cancer chemotherapy with severe OM, ketamine mouthwash at a dose of 1 mg/kg did not significantly reduce OM pain. It did not decrease the need for rescue pain medications. Further research is warranted to test higher doses of ketamine for a clinically significant effect.

AB  - Introduction: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mediated inflammation has been implicated, in knee osteoarthritis, despite being a predominantly degenerative condition. Patient Concerns: A 56-year old female, a case of left knee pain not responding to conventional conservative strategies. Diagnosis: A diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis of the left knee, grade 3 osteoarthritis as per the Kellgren-Lawrence Scale was established. Interventions: She was administered an intra-articular injection of 10 mg of Adalimumab, a commonly used anti-TNF agent. Outcomes: The patient was evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and at 6 months. There was a marked improvement in pain intensity (visual analog scale) and quality of life, despite no objective change on the parameters seen on ultrasound of the knee. Conclusion: Injection of adalimumab via the intra-articular route into the knee joint in primary osteoarthritis yields promising results.

AB  - Background Conventional cytotoxic agents and pazopanib are approved for advanced soft tissue sarcomas but have low response rates and modest survival benefits. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown clinically meaningful activity. The combination of pazopanib and immunotherapy has shown synergism in various other malignancies but has not been fully explored in advanced soft tissue sarcomas. Case presentation A 63 year old woman with metastatic undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma progressed after two lines of palliative combination chemotherapy-doxorubicin with olaratumab, and gemcitabine with docetaxel. In view of significant symptoms, she was treated with pazopanib in combination with pembrolizumab. She had remarkable radiological and clinical improvement, with a manageable toxicity profile and an ongoing response at ten months of therapy. Conclusions Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma is an immunologically active subtype of soft tissue sarcoma, which is particularly amenable to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Pazopanib with immune checkpoint inhibitors is a well-tolerated, yet hitherto underexplored combination that may offer significant clinical benefit in advanced sarcomas-this finding warrants further evaluation in clinical trials.

AB  - Objective In this research work, we hypothesized to predict the nanoparticulate system, best suited for targeted delivery of filgrastim. Significance:Targeted delivery of filgrastim to bone marrow is required to decrease the incidence of neutropenia/febrile neutropenia. This is achieved by nanoparticulate systems, duly designed by bioinformatics approach. Method The targeted delivery of filgrastim in nanoparticulate system was achieved by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. Two matrices comprising PLGA and SLN (tripalmitin, core component of SLN system) were modeled separately with proposed drug filgrastim. Energy minimization of all systems was done using the steepest descent method. PLGA and tripalmitin systems were equalized at 310 degrees C, at 1 bar pressure with Berendsen barostat for 200 ps using a v-rescale thermostat for 100 ps. Atomistic MD simulations of four model system and mass density of interacting systems were calculated. Results The mass density maps of each nanoparticle system, that is, PLGA and tripalmitin showed an increase in density toward the end of the simulation. The contact numbers attained equilibria with the average number of approx.. 1500 contacts in case of tripalmitin-filgrastim system. While PLGA-filgrastim system shows lesser contacts as compared to tripalmitin with average contacts of approx. 1000.The binding free energy was predicted to be -1104 kJ/mol in tripalmitin-filgrastim complex and -421 kJ/mol in PLGA-filgrastim system. Conclusion Findings of study revealed that both nanoparticle systems assumed to be good model for drug-carrier systems. Though SLN systems were thought to be more appropriate than PLGA, still thein vivofindings could ascertain this hypothesis in futuristic work.

AB  - This paper demonstrates a new and simplified configuration for capillary electrophoresis-amperometric detection (CE-AD) using a paper microfluidic chip incorporating inexpensive wax printing and screen printing based methods and then used for electrophoretic separation and simultaneous in-channel amperometric detection of three clinically relevant neurochemicals in a single run without using any decouplers. Detection of neurochemicalse.g., dopamine, epinephrine and serotonin is crucial for early prediction of neurological disorders including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia, as well as progressive neuro-psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, as well as certain cardiovascular diseases. The plasma concentrations of such neurochemicals are as important as those present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and can be useful for rapid and convenient biosensing. However, simultaneous detection of such neurochemicals in a complex mixture such as human serum requires their separation prior to detection. With the developed microchip, separation and detection of the neurochemicals were exhibited within 650 seconds without pre-treatment and the procedure was validated with spiked fetal bovine serum samples. Beside this, the developed paper microfluidic chip has potential to be integrated in point-of-care diagnosis with onsite detection ability. Moreover, the use of a straight channel capillary, a screen-printed carbon electrode without decoupler, in-channel amperometric detection and low sample volume requirements (2 mu L) are shown as additional advantages.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination offers an excellent prospect for the primary prevention of cervical cancer. The bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are both available in India. The nonavalent vaccine is licensed but not yet available. However, there still remain controversies regarding the vaccination of older women, immunocompromised females and other special groups. To provide recommendations for HPV vaccination in India. The Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI) convened an expert group on cervical cancer prevention to formulate good clinical practice recommendations (GCPR) with respect to vaccine efficacy and safety, target groups, optimal timing and dosing schedules. HPV vaccines are licensed for females aged 9-45 years in India and have been seen to be safe and effective. FOGSI recommends HPV vaccination of all girls <15 years of age as the best target group, in whom two-doses at an interval of 6 months, extendable to 18 months, are recommended. Three-doses are recommended in girls >15 years of age, immunocompromised persons and sexual assault survivors. Older women and women with abnormal screening results may be vaccinated with an understanding that vaccination does not protect against already acquired infections and screening has to continue. Single-dose vaccination results are promising. Increased awareness is required to reduce vaccine hesitancy. HPV vaccination should be the priority to achieve the elimination of cervical cancer. The introduction of affordable HPV vaccines and reduced dose schedules will improve coverage.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are fat storage organelles that originate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Relatively little is known about how sites of LD formation are selected and which proteins/lipids are necessary for the process. Here, we show that LDs induced by the yeast triacylglycerol (TAG)-synthases Lro1 and Dga1 are formed at discrete ER subdomains defined by seipin (Fld1), and a regulator of diacylglycerol (DAG) production, Nem1. Fld1 and Nem1 colocalize to ER-LD contact sites. We find that Fld1 and Nem1 localize to ER subdomains independently of each other and of LDs, but both are required for the subdomains to recruit the TAG-synthases and additional LD biogenesis factors: Yft2, Pex30, Pet10, and Erg6. These subdomains become enriched in DAG. We conclude that Fld1 and Nem1 are both necessary to recruit proteins to ER subdomains where LD biogenesis occurs.

AB  - Background Patch testing is the standard method to diagnose contact allergy. Patches are applied for 48 hours, which is inconvenient to patients in tropical weather. Therefore, we evaluated different patch test occlusion times with increased concentrations of an allergen to determine if occlusion time can be reduced without compromising patch test reactivity. Methods Patch test positive patients with parthenium dermatitis were enrolled and patch tested using five different concentrations (10%, 4%, 2%, 1%, and 0.5%) of parthenium extract. The patches were applied in triplicate. The first set was removed after 12 hours, whereas the second and third sets were removed after 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Readings were performed at 24, 48, and 96 hours. Results Fifty patients with parthenium dermatitis were included. The positive patch test reaction rates were comparable in all three sets at 24- and 48-hour readings irrespective of the occlusion time. All were positive, with 10%, 4%, and 2% concentrations at 96-hour reading with an occlusion time of 12 hours. Conclusion An occlusion time of 12 hours seems adequate to elicit positive patch test reaction at a 96-hour reading if the concentration of patch test allergen can be increased, that is, from 1% to 2% in these patients.

AB  - Background There is limited data on the safety and efficacy of metabolic and bariatric (MBS) surgery in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of data of patients with advanced liver fibrosis undergoing MBS at a tertiary care centre. Weight loss and complications were analysed. Transient elastography and liver biopsy findings 1 year after surgery were compared with baseline. Results Twenty-two patients had cirrhosis and 16 had stage 3 fibrosis; all were Child Pugh A. Majority (76%) underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Mean excess BMI loss was 65.8 +/- 18.9%. There were no leaks or 30-day mortality. One patient with cirrhosis had late mortality due to liver decompensation. Preoperative and postoperative median LSM were 15.5 kPa (interquartile range IQR = 24.4-11.6) and 10.9 kPa (IQR 19.3-7.6), respectively. Preoperative and postoperative median CAP were 352.5 dB/m (IQR = 372-315.5) and 303 dB/m (IQR 331-269.5), respectively. On follow-up biopsy, nine of twelve patients had improvement in fibrosis, while three had no change. Four out of five patients in the cirrhotic cohort had improvement in fibrosis stage and LSM improved in all of them. Five out of seven patients with stage 3 fibrosis had an improvement in fibrosis stage and none progressed to cirrhosis. LSM improved in three of these five patients. Conclusion MBS has the potential to ameliorate advanced liver fibrosis, including cirrhosis. Transient elastography can be used as an effective tool for screening and follow-up of liver disease in patients undergoing MBS.

AB  - Background The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of ultrasonography (USG) including power Doppler in detecting hand and wrist joint changes in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to compare USG findings with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods Thirty-four patients diagnosed as RA by 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria; with the onset of symptoms within last one year, were included in the study after institute ethical clearance and informed consent to undergo USG and contrast-enhanced MRI of the dominant affected hand. Second to fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, second to fifth proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and wrist joints (total nine joints) were evaluated for synovitis, erosions along with tenosynovitis. USG and MRI features were compared; agreement on the two imaging modalities as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography compared to MRI (gold standard) was calculated. Results One hundred thirty-six MCP, 136 PIP and 34 wrist joints (total 306 joints) and 136 flexor tendons were evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and diagnostic accuracy of USG for diagnosing synovitis was 78.6%, 91.1%, 86.1%, 85.8%, 86.3%; for erosions 67.2%, 97.5%, 84.8%, 90.5%, 91.5%; for tenosynovitis 86.5%, 100%, 100%, 92.3% and 94.8% respectively. The overall agreement between USG and MRI for detection of synovitis was achieved in 83% joints and for erosions in 89.5% joints. Conclusion In early RA, USG was nearly as effective in diagnosing features of joint and tendon sheath involvement, with relatively better performance of USG for tenosynovitis. The performance of USG in diagnosing erosions was limited likely due to difficult access of three-dimensional joint structure.

AB  - Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly grown into a public health emergency that has placed the national health systems as well as scientific research communities under enormous pressures. Drug repurposing or repositioning is a well-known strategy that seeks to deploy existing licensed drugs for newer indications and provides the quickest possible transition from bench to clinics for unmet therapeutic needs. Given the current, urgent, and dire need for effective therapies against novel coronavirus-19, this approach is particularly appealing. Areas covered Here, we review the significant anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties of minocycline as potential mechanisms for efficacy against the novel coronavirus and highlight the promises and pitfalls of this approach. Expert opinion As compared to other agents being investigated for COVID-19, minocycline offers distinct advantages in terms of potential efficacy in patients with life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and myocardial injury, well-known safety and interaction profile, relatively low costs, and widespread availability. We call upon public and private funders to facilitate urgent and rigorous research efforts before evidence-based recommendations for its widespread use can be made.

AB  - Several unusual variants of lichen nitidus are described in the literature. Spinous follicular lichen nitidus with perifollicular granulomas is one such variant characterized by generalized follicular as well as nonfollicular keratotic papules, which show perifollicular granulomas on histopathology as well as a lichenoid granulomatous tissue reaction typical of lichen nitidus. Owing to its atypical clinical and histopathologic manifestations, it raises several clinical possibilities and can be a diagnostic challenge. We report this rare variant of lichen nitidus in a 19-year-old female, and discuss its clinical and histopathological differential diagnosis.

AB  - Background/aim The majority of traumatic dental injuries (TDI) in childhood and adolescence occur in schools. Since school teachers are often the first responders, their knowledge about the emergency management of TDI needs to be adequate. The aim of this systematic review was to assess and analyse the global status of this knowledge as reported in previous studies and to provide recommendations for future research. Methods The protocol was designed as per PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO. A broad-based search using text-words and MeSH terms was performed in established databases as per a predefined strategy. Cohort-studies, cross-sectional, case-control studies and randomized/non-randomized trials without any distinction of language and year of publication were included while those without details of sampling strategy, validity and reliability were excluded. Data extraction was performed, risk of bias assessment was done by the Joanna-Briggs-Institute's critical appraisal checklist and meta-analysis was performed for four question stems using a random effects model. Results Twenty-three studies were included for qualitative analysis. Most of the studies had been conducted in Asia from 2009 to 2019. Ten studies used case-based questionnaires, mostly adapted from previous studies. Moderate to high risk of bias was observed in 14 studies. Less than 50% of teachers had witnessed a TDI in 8 studies and >75% desired to know more about TDI management in most studies. Less than 50% of teachers in 5 out of 6 studies knew about immediate replantation of avulsed permanent teeth, 95% with 17% of teachers having previous dental-trauma first-aid training and 38% knowing about replantation within 30 minutes. Conclusion The awareness level in several areas of the world is unknown. Studies lacked well-designed questionnaires and teachers exhibited low self-belief and knowledge level in the majority of studies.

AB  - The most common cytogenetic alteration was high hyperdiploidy (13.0%). ETV6-RUNX1 translocation occurred in 5.2% of children with ALL; BCR-ABL1 translocation occurred in 12.2%. Hypodiploidy was not seen in any patient. Children with poor-risk cytogenetic alterations had significantly lower event-free survival as compared with those with good- or intermediate-risk cytogenetic alterations (p = 0.0029).
   Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disorder with coexistence of multiple clones. The mortality rate in children with ALL has reduced to 15% to 20% in developed countries. However, it continues to be high in India (25%-35%), which may be attributed to ethnic variation and differences in disease biology. The treatment and outcome in ALL are dependent on risk stratification, which is derived from prognostic factors like leukocyte count, age at diagnosis, immunophenotypic subtypes and, most importantly, cytogenetic alterations. Chromosomal rearrangements are important initiating events in leukemogenesis.Approximately, 75% of children with ALL harbor a recurring chromosomal alteration detectable by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or other molecular techniques. The present study was planned to compare the prevalence of various cytogenetic alterations with western.literature and to see the association of these cytogenetic alterations with other prognostic factors as well as survival outcome. Methods: We enrolled, 117 children of 1 to 14 years of age with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL from August 2014 to Mar 2016 prospectively. Patients were monitored for response to prednisolone, postinduction complete morphological remission minimal residual disease assessment, and were followed for a minimum 2 years. Results and Discussion: We observed that poor-risk cytogenetic alterations were more prevalent, whereas good-risk cytogenetic alterations were less frequent in our patient cohort as compared with western studies. Conclusions: We observed that event-free survival is significantly less in those with poor-risk cytogenetics. We have also highlighted nonrecurrent alterations observed in our study group.

AB  - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene in 60%-85% of systemic cases. We report an 11-year-old boy with ALCL in whom serial FDG PET/CT revealed partial response and complete metabolic response at interim and end of treatment, respectively. However, the patient relapsed within 2 weeks, confirmed by cytology. Because of the inherent aggressive nature of ALCL, possibility of an early relapse should always be kept in mind.

AB  - Purpose: IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis is widely used for molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. Role of spoligotyping and Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (FAFLP) was studied in low-copy number IS6110 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc).
   Methods: The study isolates included 70 strains of Mtbc collected from different regions of India. IS6110 restriction fragment, spoligotyping and FAFLP were performed for genotypic analysis.
   Results: A single copy of IS6110 was found in 30% of isolates with 90.5% of them harboring characteristic 1.5-Kb IS6110 restriction fragment.IS6110RFLP identified 51 different types, FAFLP 41 types, and spoligotyping 31 types. Combination of all three techniques identified 67 different types.IS6110 RFLP analysis was found sensitive for genotyping isolates with more than one copy of IS6110 (Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI-1) while, neither spoligotyping (HGI-0.89) nor FAFLP (HGDI-0.92) or their combinations were as good. The discriminatory power of spoligotyping (HGDI- 0.89) in isolates with a single copy of IS6110 was higher than IS6110-RFLP.Clustering was reduced to 67% using spoligotyping and to 38% with FAFLP.
   Conclusion: Combination of FAFLP and Spoligotyping may prove to be valuable in studying the epidemiology of M. tuberculosis strains harboring few copies of IS6110 element.

AB  - The entire world is under a devastating pandemic caused by COVID-19 with a high mortality rate. Knowledge of the viral structure, factors that help in its progression and spread, pathological findings, diagnostic methods and, treatment modalities helps in understanding the viral disease and also in treating the patients in a better way besides preventing the community spread of this deadly infection. The causative agent is a single- stranded RNA virus. The clinical spectrum varies in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, who later become potential silent carriers, thus unknowingly spreading the virus. The virus constantly undergoes recombination, with reports of cross-species infections. Studies have indicated a strong immunological basis of COVID-19 infection. Not only does it weaken the immune system causing multi-organ involvement but also helps in its progression and spread to others.Multiple organs especially lungs, heart, kidney, gastrointestinal and hepatic system, brain and skin are affected varying in their severity. Similarly, persons with associated co-morbidities are likely to be affected more in terms of the number as well as in the severity. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirms the presence of COVID-19 infection. Serological diagnosis helps in diagnosing an ongoing outbreak or retrospective infection. Furthermore, it also identifies individuals who have been infected or have recovered from the disease especially the asymptomatic. This helps in the development of an effective vaccine indicating the status of herd immunity in the community. Different treatment modalities are being tried and under trial. This review article thus highlights the global epidemiological status, characteristic of the virus, symptomatology of the patients, role of diagnostic tests available, organs affected including their morphological changes and the latest line of treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Macular hypopigmentation, hair loss and follicular spongiosis: A distinct clinicopathological entity
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY VENEREOLOGY & LEPROLOGY
KW  - Follicular spongiosis
KW  - hair loss
KW  - hypopigmented macules
AB  - Background: Hypopigmented macules are seen in a variety of disorders and the diagnosis rests on clinicopathological correlation. However, some cases are difficult to classify and pose a diagnostic challenge.
   Aim: To describe the clinical and histopathological features of patients with hypopigmented macules and follicular spongiosis on histopathology.
   Materials and Methods: We undertook a retrospective analysis of clinical and histopathological findings in 12 patients who presented with clinically nondiagnostic hypopigmented macules and showed follicular spongiosis on skin biopsy, at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India between January 2015 and October 2016. The findings were compared with 12 patients with "unclassified" hypopigmented macules, who did not show follicular spongiosis on skin biopsy.
   Results: A total of 12 patients with hypopigmented macules showed spongiosis affecting the follicular epithelium on histopathology. There were eight men and four women, most in their second decade (mean age 19.1 +/- 8.05 years), presenting with hypopigmented macules most commonly on the upper limbs, for a mean duration of 6.33 +/- 5.10 months. Clinically evident lesional hair loss was seen in all patients, and follicular prominences in seven (58%) patients. Histological features suggestive of other diagnosis, namely leprosy, mycosis fungoides or sarcoidosis were not seen in any biopsy. Alcian blue stain revealed an minimal amount of mucin in one biopsy. Clinically apparent hair loss and follicular prominences were found to be statistically significantly associated with histological evidence of follicular spongiosis (P < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively).
   Limitations: Our study is limited by its retrospective design and small sample size.
   Conclusions: Patients with hypopigmented macules and follicular spongiosis on histopathology may represent a distinct clinicopathological entity that is associated with lesional hair loss and follicular prominences. It is probably a variant of an endogenous dermatitis similar to pityriasis alba.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Although imaging is the mainstay to differentiate ischemic stroke (IS) from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), these facilities are not available everywhere. The present study observed if any blood biomarker(s) could potentially help differentiate between ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage.
   Methods: 250 patients with acute stroke within 24 hours of onset (187 IS and 63 patients with ICH) were recruited in the present study. The blood samples were collected closest to the hospital presentation time, but within 24 hours of stroke onset. Blood was analyzed for five biomarkers [S100, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit antibody (NR2), interleukin 6 (IL6) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)] to assess discriminatory ability of each biomarker to differentiate ICH and IS.
   Results: S100 levels were statistically higher among patients with ICH compared with IS (8 pg/ml versus 4.2 pg/ml respectively, P = 0.003) and IL6 was higher in patients with IS compared with ICH (12.9 pg/ml vs 8.76 pg/ml, P = 0.02). The discriminatory ability to differentiate ICH from IS was better using a combination of the above two biomarkers. The overall discriminatory ability of all biomarkers were low (Area under curve for S100 65%; GFAP 56%; NR2 53%; IL6 59% and BNP 49.8%). Although the positive predictive value of each biomarker was low, the negative predictive value was higher for all biomarkers to diagnose ICH.
   Conclusions: S100 and IL6 are potential biomarkers for further study and validation. Newer biomarkers with higher discriminatory ability are required in the future for diagnostic use.

KW  - BIFURCATION
AB  - Background and Introduction: Presence of multiple aneurysms, especially a combination of anterior and posterior circulation aneurysm in the same patient, is rare. Surgical clipping of both the aneurysms in the same sitting, although ideal, may be surgically challenging and requires a good preoperative planning.
   Objective: In this video abstract, we present a case of a ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm with a simultaneous occurrence of an unruptured basilar top aneurysm.
   Surgical Technique: A 45-year-old female presented with modified Hunt and Hess grade II subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CT scan showed diffuse SAH with a dense bleed in the left sylvian cistern and mild hydrocephalus. Angiography showed a left MCA aneurysm (34 mm size) with a bleb and also an un-ruptured basilar bifurcation/right posterior cerebral artery aneurysm (20 mm). The patient underwent a left frontotemporal craniotomy, zygomatic osteotomy, and clipping of both aneurysms. No temporary clips were applied. The extended craniotomy allowed the surgeon to reach to the base of the aneurysm.
   Results: The patient had an uneventful recovery.
   Conclusions: Simultaneous occurrence of both anterior and posterior circulation aneurysms are rare, but maybe tackled surgically with proper planning.

KW  - CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019
KW  - NEUROSURGERY
AB  - Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV 2) has inexplicably and irreversibly changed the way of neurosurgery practice. There has been a substantial reduction in neurosurgical operations during the period of lockdown. The lockdown might be the most effective measure to curtail viral transmission. Once we return to the normalization of the lifestyle, there will be a backlog of unoperated pending cases along with the possibility of further spread of the coronavirus. Methods: We reviewed the available literature and protocols for neurosurgical practice in different geographic locations. We drafted a consensus statement based on the literature and protocols suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and various professional societies to prevent the spread of SARS-COV2 while streamlining the neurosurgical practice. Results: The consensus statement suggests the patient triage, workflow, resource distribution, and operational efficacy for care providers at different stages of management. The priority is set at personal protection while ensuring patients' safety, timely management, and capacity building. We performed a detailed subsection analysis for the management of trauma and set up for COVID-free hospitals for simultaneous management of routine neurosurgical indications. In this time of medicolegal upheaval, special consent from the patients should be taken in view of the chances of delay in management and the added risk of corona infection. The consensus statements are applicable to neurosurgical setups of all capacities. Conclusion: Along with the glaring problem of infection, there is another threat of neurosurgery emergency building up. This wave may overwhelm the already stretched systems to the hilt. We need to flatten this curve while avoiding contagion. These measures may guide neurosurgery practitioners to effectively manage patients ensuring the safety of caregivers and care seekers both.

AB  - Background Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the presence of tingling, burning, itching, and unpleasant sensations in hands and feet due to nerve damage by chemotherapy. Exercise rehabilitation has potential to prevent or alleviate CIPN. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of muscle strengthening and balancing exercises on CIPN pain and quality of life (QOL) among cancer patients. Methods The randomized controlled trial included 45 cancer patients from a tertiary care hospital in India receiving chemotherapeutic drugs paclitaxel and carboplatin and found to have CIPN. Subjects were randomly allocated to exercise (n(1)= 22) and usual care (n(2)= 23) groups. The exercise group received home-based muscle strengthening and balancing exercise for 10 weeks. Data regarding demographic, clinical characteristics, CIPN, neuropathic pain, and QOL were collected by structured questionnaires Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment Tool, nerve conduction velocity, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale, and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Results The 2 groups were homogenous regarding demographic variables. In clinical characteristics, the exercise group had larger body surface area and received a higher dose of paclitaxel. Significant reduction in neuropathic pain scores (P< .0001) and improvement in Functional QOL (P= .0002), Symptom QOL (P= .0003), Global Health Status QOL (P= .004) scores were observed after intervention in the exercise group than the usual-care group. Conclusion Muscle strengthening and balancing exercises are effective in reducing CIPN pain and improving QOL among cancer patients. Implications for Practice Muscle strengthening and balancing exercises can be used as a complementary therapy for effective management of CIPN.

AB  - Normal-sized ventricles and absence of papilledema do not rule out shunt failure and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Raised ICP can present with false localizing signs which may be cranial nerve palsies or extensive polyradiculopathy. Our patient with a history of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt presented with rapidly progressive vision loss without papilledema, as well as multiple cranial nerve palsies and radiculopathy. Imaging did not reveal hydrocephalus, however, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) manometry revealed high CSF opening pressure. After lumbar thecoperitoneal shunting, vision did not improve, but the rest of cranial nerve palsies and radiculopathy improved. In a patient in whom VP shunt is in situ, headache and vomiting should prompt evaluation for raised ICP though there is no ventriculomegaly of papilledema. Vision can be saved if raised ICP is suspected, CSF opening pressure measured at presentation and prompt surgery is performed.

AB  - The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has several implications relevant to neuroanesthesiologists, including neurological manifestations of the disease, impact of anesthesia provision for specific neurosurgical procedures and electroconvulsive therapy, and health care provider wellness. The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care appointed a task force to provide timely, consensus-based expert guidance for neuroanesthesiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this document is to provide a focused overview of COVID-19 disease relevant to neuroanesthesia practice. This consensus statement provides information on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, advice for neuroanesthesia clinical practice during emergent neurosurgery, interventional radiology (excluding endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke), transnasal neurosurgery, awake craniotomy and electroconvulsive therapy, as well as information about health care provider wellness. Institutions and health care providers are encouraged to adapt these recommendations to best suit local needs, considering existing practice standards and resource availability to ensure safety of patients and providers.

AB  - Chronic myeloid leukemia is a rare malignancy in children, predominantly seen in adolescence, with relatively aggressive disease biology compared with adults. Despite practical constraints like poor treatment adherence and financial unaffordability of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as major challenges in management, a 5-year overall survival rate and an event-free survival of 92% and 64%, respectively, were achieved in our study cohort with imatinib as frontline therapy. Dose augmentation of imatinib is a reasonable option in those with a suboptimal response.
   Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an uncommon malignancy in children in which tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved outcome in recent years. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of CML patients (<= 18 years old) presenting to our center between January 2005 and December 2018 with respect to baseline demographics, response to imatinib, and real-world management of those with a suboptimal response. Results: A total of 124 patients were diagnosed with CML with 99 (80%) in the chronic phase. There was a male preponderance (males:females = 3.1:1) with a median age of 13 years. The common presenting clinical features were splenomegaly (90.9%) and fever (51.5%) with a median leukocyte count of 165 x 10(3)/mL. The proportion of patients attaining a complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months, and a major molecular response at 12 months were 79.7%, 54.1%, and 50.9%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 67.4 months, the 5-year overall survival rate and the event-free survival (EFS) rate were 92% +/- 3% and 64% +/- 6%, respectively. Failure to achieve CCyR at 12 months was associated with poor EFS beyond 1 year (hazard ratio= 2.865, P=.044). Among 15 patients not achieving CHR at 3 months, dose escalation of imatinib resulted in the attainment of CHR in 13 (87%) patients. Seven patients in the cohort had a loss of the established response to imatinib because of documented poor compliance. Conclusion: Imatinib remains the frontline treatment of choice in CML with a reasonable outcome in children, especially when financial affordability, availability of second-generation TKIs, and poor compliance still remain major challenges in management. Dose escalation of imatinib remains an option in patients with a suboptimal response. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - EFFICACY
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in Asia, East and North Africa, South America, and Southern Europe, and is a major public health problem in the Indian subcontinent. Miltefosine received approval in 2002 to treat VL in India, and the Indian National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme later adopted a single dose (10 mg/kg) of liposomal amphotericin B. We report results of a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of combination therapy with an Indian preparation of liposomal amphotericin B (single dose of 7.5 mg/kg) and short-course miltefosine (2.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days; n = 66) in comparison to miltefosine monotherapy (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days; n = 78). Nine patients in the miltefosine group and three in the combination therapy group had to discontinue therapy because of serious adverse events. At the end of the therapy, the clinical and parasitological cure rate was 100% in both groups. By per-protocol analysis, by 6 months after completion of treatment, 12 of 69 patients in the miltefosine monotherapy arm (17.4%, 95% CI: 10.24-28%) and none in the combination therapy arm had relapse. Over 5 years of follow-up, 10 patients in the miltefosine monotherapy arm (all within 0.5-2 years after completing therapy) and none in the combination therapy arm experienced post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Combination therapy offered benefits over miltefosine monotherapy for VL in India.

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We present the international consensus guidelines for surveillance of pancreatic cancer in CP.
   Methods: The international group evaluated 10 statements generated from evidence on 5 questions relating to pancreatic cancer in CP. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the level of evidence available per statement. The working group voted on each statement for strength of agreement, using a nine-point Likert scale in order to calculate Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient.
   Results: In the following domains there was strong consensus: (1) the risk of pancreatic cancer in affected individuals with hereditary pancreatitis due to inherited PRSS1 mutations is high enough to justify surveillance; (2) the risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with CP associated with SPINK1 p. N34S is not high enough to justify surveillance; (3) surveillance should be undertaken in pancreatic specialist centers; (4) surveillance should only be introduced after the age of 40 years and stopped when the patient would no longer be suitable for surgical intervention. All patients with CP should be advised to lead a healthy lifestyle aimed at avoiding risk factors for progression of CP and pancreatic cancer. There was only moderate or weak agreement on the best methods of screening and surveillance in other types of environmental, familial and genetic forms of CP.
   Conclusions: Patients with inherited PRSS1 mutations should undergo surveillance for pancreatic cancer, but the best methods for cancer detection need further investigation. (C) 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a complete shut-down of the entire world and almost all the countries are presently in a "lockdown" mode. While the lockdown strategy is an essential step to curb the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases, the impact of the same on mental health is not well known.
   Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic on the general public with an objective to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, well-being, and other psychological issues.
   Materials and Methods: It was an online survey conducted under the aegis of the Indian Psychiatry Society. Using the Survey Monkey platform, a survey link was circulated using the Whatsapp. The survey questionnaire included perceived stress scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale to assess perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and mental well-being, respectively. The survey link was circulated starting from April 6, 2020 and was closed on April 24, 2020.
   Results: During the survey, a total of 1871 responses were collected, of which 1685 (90.05%) responses were analyzed. About two-fifth (38.2%) had anxiety and 10.5% of the participants had depression. Overall, 40.5% of the participants had either anxiety or depression. Moderate level of stress was reported by about three-fourth (74.1%) of the participants and 71.7% reported poor well-being.
   Conclusions: The present survey suggests that more than two-fifths of the people are experiencing common mental disorders, due to lockdown and the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that there is a need for expanding mental health services to everyone in the society during this pandemic situation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to determine the pattern of prescription of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in a cohort of patients with epilepsy (PWE) attending a tertiary care center of North India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic variables including age, gender, age at onset, type and frequency of seizures, and prescription of all AEDs (dose and duration) were noted. Descriptive analysis of the use of AEDs was done, and their different combinations were studied. RESULTS: A total of 1187 prescriptions were evaluated. Demography showed 65.7% of males; mean age of 21.9 years (range: 2-77 years), generalized seizures (53%), and focal seizures (47%). Only 21.8% of the patients were seizure free with no seizure in 1 year of treatment. The five most frequently prescribed AEDs out of 12 AEDs were sodium valproate (VPA) (49.6%), clobazam (CLB) (39.3%), levetiracetam (LEV) (28.4%), carbamazepine (CBZ) (27.3%), and phenytoin (PHT) (26.5%). Monotherapy was effective in 36.6% of the patients. Sodium VPA (39.4%), PHT (25.6%), and CBZ (20.1%) were commonly used as monotherapy. Polytherapy was required in 63.4% of the patients, and most commonly prescribed combinations were PHT + CLB (n = 53), sodium VPA + CLB (n = 62), CBZ + CLB (n = 45), PHT + sodium VPA + CLB (n = 28), and CBZ + sodium VPA + CLB (n = 31). CONCLUSIONS: Polytherapy is a very common practice in our tertiary care center. Sodium VPA, a highly prescribed AED, results in good control of generalized seizures, whereas focal seizures are well controlled by CBZ alone as well as in combination. The present study highlights the commonly prescribed combinations of AEDs resulting in control of different types of seizures.

AB  - Background Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer with a median overall survival of less than 6 months. We aimed to assess the response to single -agent selinexor, an oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export, in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who had no therapeutic options of potential clinical benefit. Methods SADAL was a multicentre, multinational, open -label, phase 2b study done in 59 sites in 19 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with pathologically confirmed diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, who had received two to five lines of previous therapies, and progressed after or were not candidates for autologous stem -cell transplantation were enrolled. Germinal centre B -cell or non -germinal centre B -cell tumour subtype and double or triple expressor status were determined by immunohistochemistry and double or triple hit status was determined by cytogenetics. Patients received 60 mg selinexor orally on days 1 and 3 weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The study was initially designed to evaluate both 60 mg and 100 mg twice -weekly doses of selinexor; however, the 100 mg dose was discontinued in the protocol (version 7.0) on March 29, 2017, when an improved therapeutic window was observed at 60 mg. Primary outcome was overall response rate. The primary outcome and safety were assessed in all patients who received 60 mg selinexor under protocol version 6.0, or enrolled under protocol versions 7.0 or higher and received at least one dose of selinexor. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02227251 (active but not enrolling). Findings Between Oct 21, 2015, and Nov 2, 2019, 267 patients were randomly assigned, with 175 allocated to the 60 mg group and 92 to the discontinued 100 mg group. 48 patients assigned to the 60 mg group were excluded due to enrolment before version 6.0 of the protocol; the remaining 127 patients received selinexor 60 mg and were included in analyses of primary outcome and safety. The overall response rate was 28% (36/127; 95% CI 20?7-37?0); 15 (12%) achieved a complete response and 21 (17%) a partial response. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (n=58), neutropenia (n=31), anaemia (n=28), fatigue (n=14), hyponatraemia (n=10), and nausea (n=8). The most common serious adverse events were pyrexia (n=9), pneumonia (n=6), and sepsis (n=6). There were no deaths judged as related to treatment with selinexor. Interpretation Single -drug oral selinexor induced durable responses and had a manageable adverse events profile in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who received at least two lines of previous chemoimmunotherapy. Selinexor could be considered a new oral, non-cytotoxic treatment option in this setting.

AB  - Background: During HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) 2017 round, the sampling strategy to recruit female sex workers (FSWs) was changed from consecutive to random sampling. This may affect the participation and HIV positivity rates among FSWs. Objective: The objective of this study is to estimate the nonparticipation rates among FSWs and its effect on the observed HIV prevalence rate during HSS-2017. Methods: The data were collected from FSW sentinel sites located in the states of Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand (Central Zone). The HIV positivity rate among FSWs who participated in HSS-2017 was compared with the HIV positivity rate of those who did not participate. HIV status of the participants was obtained from HSS-2017 data. The master list of participating targeted intervention sites was accessed to obtain the last known HIV status of the eligible nonparticipants. Results: Nonparticipation rate of FSWs from the central zone during HSS2017 was 10.8%. The HIV positivity rate among nonparticipant FSW was four times and six times higher in Delhi and UP, respectively. Conclusion: Selective nonparticipation of eligible FSWs might have led to the underestimation of the HIV positivity rate in the central zone during the HSS-2017 round.

AB  - Background Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a neglected disease affecting 33 million people, mainly in low and middle income countries. Yet very few large trials or registries have been conducted in this population. The INVICTUS program of research in RHD consists of a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of 4500 patients comparing rivaroxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with RHD and atrial fibrillation (AF), a registry of 17,000 patients to document the contemporary clinical course of patients with RHD, including a focused sub-study on pregnant women with RHD within the registry. This paper describes the rationale, design, organization and baseline characteristics of the RCT and a summary of the design of the registry and its sub-study. Patients with RHD and AF are considered to be at high risk of embolic strokes, and oral anticoagulation with VKAs is recommended for stroke prevention. But the quality of anticoagulation with VKA is poor in developing countries. A drug which does not require monitoring, and which is safe and effective for preventing stroke in patients with valvular AF, would fulfill a major unmet need.
   Methods The INVestlgation of rheumatiC AF Treatment Using VKAs, rivaroxaban or aspirin Studies (INVICTUS-VKA) trial is an international, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, testing whether rivaroxaban 20 mg given once daily is non-inferior (or superior) to VKA in patients with RHD, AF, and an elevated risk of stroke (mitral stenosis with valve area <= 2 cm(2) , left atrial spontaneous echo-contrast or thrombus, or a CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score >= 2). The primary efficacy outcome is a composite of stroke or systemic embolism and the primary safety outcome is the occurrence of major bleeding. The trial has enrolled 4565 patients from 138 sites in 23 countries from Africa, Asia and South America. The Registry plans to enroll an additional 17,000 patients with RHD and document their treatments, and their clinical course for at least 2 years. The pregnancy sub-study will document the clinical course of pregnant women with RHD.
   Conclusion INVICTUS is the largest program of clinical research focused on a neglected cardiovascular disease and will provide new information on the clinical course of patients with RHD, and approaches to anticoagulation in those with concomitant AF.

AB  - Background: Certain types of cancer pain have remained hard to control even by highly skilled pain experts. Uncontrolled cancer pain can have severe effects on quality of life, physical functioning, and leads to psychological distress. From this perspective, nonpharmacologic modalities of treatment are important. Neuromodulatory techniques, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and scrambler therapy (ST), have gained popularity in recent times. ST is a relatively new therapy that has been used for the management of cancer pain resistant to pharmacologic management. Several studies have shown that ST is an effective therapy for this type of pain.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to detect possible gaps in the literature regarding the efficacy of ST for cancer pain and formulate recommendations for research through a systematic review of the literature.
   Study Design: A systematic review of the literaturewas performed following the recommendations of the PRISMA Statement.
   Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria using a predetermined search strategy. Reference list of retrieved studies and Google Scholar were used to verify that no relevant studies had been omitted. Data were extracted from the studies with a data extraction sheet. A qualitative analyses of the extracted data was undertaken.
   Results: Twenty-seven studies were retrieved. Ten were articles that were categorized as literature reviews, including 7 general literature reviews not following a specific review methodology, 1 editorial, and 2 systematic reviews. Seventeen were original studies, including 2 single-arm trials, 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 pilot trials, 4 case reports, 2 retrospective studies, and 4 prospective studies. By and large, the available literature supports the use of ST as an effective therapy for the management of refractory cancer pain. However, the level of evidence for its application to cancer pain is not particularly strong, and improvement in pain with ST may even be owing to a placebo effect.
   Limitations: This study was not a meta-review. Because of the limited number of clinical trials on ST in cancer pain, such a meta-review could not meaningfully be performed.
   Conclusions: Methodologically sound, large randomized control trials are needed in this area. However at this stage, ST may be considered a good option for cancer patients suffering from pain that does not respond to pharmacologic treatment.

TI  - Burden of falls among elderly persons in India: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - OLDER-ADULTS
KW  - RISK-FACTORS
KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - Background. Falls are one of the leading causes of death and disability among elderly persons. In India, there is paucity of data on the prevalence of falls, particularly among community-dwelling elderly persons. To estimate healthcare costs related to falls and formulation of fall prevention strategies, there is a need of reliable estimates of magnitude of falls. We aimed to provide a community-based pooled estimate of the burden of falls among elderly persons in India.
   Methods. A systematic literature search was done manually as well as electronically through PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane library, IndMed, Embase and WHO databases. Community-based original studies conducted in India were included. No restriction for the date was used. Meta-analysis was done using the random effects model.
   Results. Sixteen studies were included in the review and meta-analysis. These studies included a total of 14 844 elderly persons, of which 2707 reported falling. The pooled prevalence of falls was found to be 31% (95% CI 23%-39%). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I-2 =98.08%, p <0.01).
   Conclusion. There is a high prevalence of falls among elderly persons in India. However, the available studies have considerable methodological variations and are of limited quality. Realistic estimates are required for designing programmes for prevention of falls and for rehabilitation.

AB  - Background & objectives: In this study we describe the epidemiological data, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, severity of illness and early outcome of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi, India.
   Methods: In this preliminary analysis of a prospective observational study, all adult patients admitted to the screening intensive care unit (ICU) of the institute who fulfilled the WHO case definition of COVID-19 and confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were included. Demographics, clinical data and 24 h outcome were assessed.
   Results: The preliminary analysis of 235 patients revealed that the mean age was 50.7 +/- 15.1 yr and 68.1 per cent were male. Fever (68.1%), cough (59.6%) and shortness of breath (71.9%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Hypertension (28.1%) and diabetes mellitus (23.3%) were the most common associated comorbid illnesses. Patients with mild, moderate, severe and critical illness were 18.3, 32.3, 31.1 and 18.3 per cent, respectively, at the time of ICU admission. The proportions (95% confidence interval) of patients requiring any form of oxygen therapy, oxygen therapy by high-flow nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation were 77, 21.7 and 25.5 per cent, respectively, within 24 h of hospital admission. The 24 h ICU mortality was 8.5 per cent, and non-survivors had higher respiratory rate (P<0.01, n=198) and lower baseline oxyhaemoglobin saturation (P<0.001, n=198) at presentation and higher baseline serum lactate (P<0.01, n=122), total leucocyte count (P<0.001, n=186), absolute neutrophil count (P<0.001, n=132), prothrombin time (P<0.05, n=54) and INR (P<0.05, n=54) compared to survivors.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Nearly half of the patients presented with severe and critical disease and required high-flow nasal oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation at admission. Severity of the presenting respiratory illness, haematological parameters and lactate rather than age or presence of comorbidity predicted early death within 24 h.

AB  - Submacular hemorrhage (SMH) following ruptured retinal artery macro aneurysm ( RRAM) has better prognosis as compared to other etiologies. Timely intervention from as early as 24 h to less than 7 days is known to provide better visual outcomes in such cases. A variety of surgical techniques have been described in the treatment of RRAM. In this case report, we describe the advantages of intraoperative optical coherence tomography-guided sub-retinal injection of a cocktail mixture consisting of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, bevacizumab, and air. Faster visual recovery with an immediate displacement of sub-macular bleed can be achieved with this technique in cases of RRAM-associated SMH.

AB  - Objectives: The amount of Iodine-131 to treat young patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has not been established so far. The purpose of this study was to perform and compare blood dosimetry by "Hanscheid's approach"and lesion dosimetry by "Maxon's approach".
   Methods: Seventy-one DTC patients <= 21 years were given diagnostic activity of 74 MBq I-131 followed by whole-body scan (WBS) at 2 h (pre-void), 24 h, 48 h, and >= 72 h. Pre-therapy blood and lesion dosimetry were conducted to determine the absorbed doses to blood and lesions and to predict the therapeutic activity. The administered activities were varied from 1.11-5.55 GBq of I-131 depending on disease extent. Post therapy dosimetries were again performed by acquiring WBS data at 24 h, 48 h, and >= 72 h.
   Results: In blood dosimetry, the difference between predicted therapy activity (PTA) and actual therapeutic activity (ATA) was statistically significant in remnant and lung lesions but insignificant in nodal metastases (p=0.287). In lesion dosimetry, the difference between PTA and ATA was statistically significant for lung metastasis patients; however, not significant in remnant (p=0.163) and nodal metastases (p=0.054). The difference between predicted and observed absorbed dose was insignificant in blood dosimetry whereas, significant in lesion dosimetry.
   Conclusions: The PTA based on 0.3 Gy recommendations of Hanscheid et al. may be adequate for patients with remnant or nodal metastases but inadequate for lung metastases. Lesion dosimetry demonstrated that there is scope to decrease the I-131 empiric ATA for remnant and nodal metastases; at the same time, there is scope to increase in lung metastasis patients.

AB  - Workplace violence is a major occupational issue concerning doctors that has a significant impact on their physical and psychological well-being. This ultimately affects the health care services of the country. Patient-led episodes of verbal violence are more prevalent in Asian countries, especially in the emergency department, psychiatric wards, and intensive care units, mostly faced by junior doctors and residents. Some common precursors of violence against doctors are patients and their attendants' dissatisfaction and low impulse control, poor administration, miscommunication, infrastructural issues especially differences in services between private and public hospitals, and negative media portrayal of doctors. The assessment of risk factors, development and implementation of workplace violence programs, and addressing underreporting of violent episodes have been suggested as some successful organizational mitigation strategies. Recommendations on the management of workplace violence include the development of participative, gender-based, culture-based, nondiscriminatory, and systematic strategies to deal with issues related to violence. This article aims to present a comprehensive review of workplace violence against doctors, discussing the prevalence, degree of violence, predictors, impact on physical and psychological health and intervention strategies to devise practical actions against workplace violence.

AB  - Despite the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there are limited data emerging in children. This review provides an update on clinical features, diagnosis, epidemiology, management and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. Specific characteristics noted in children and their implications in disease management as well as transmission control are highlighted. Besides respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal and atypical features such as chilblains, neurological symptoms and multisystem inflammation are also reported. Younger infants and those with comorbidity were found to be at risk of severe illness. Infected pregnant women and neonates were reported to have good prognosis. It is possible to manage the children with mild disease at home, with strict infection prevention control measures; severely affected require respiratory support and intensive care management. There are anecdotal reports of using antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs, benefit of which needs to be confirmed in clinical trials. A significant percentage of asymptomatic infection in children has epidemiological implication as these may act as links in transmission chain in the community. There is a need for systematic data on extra-pulmonary manifestations and atypical features, risk factors of severity, role of imaging and biomarkers, testing and management strategies and trials with antivirals and immunomodulatory drugs in children. The psychosocial effects of quarantine, closure of schools, lack of play activities and impact of lockdown need to be addressed. Understanding the biological basis for the profound age-dependent differential outcome of COVID-19 infection is important. Elucidating the protective mechanisms in children may aid in developing novel treatment strategies.

TI  - #EBUSTwitter Novel Use of Social Media for Conception, Coordination, and Completion of an International, Multicenter Pathology Study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
KW  - TWITTER
AB  - Context.-Social media sites are increasingly used for education, networking, and rapid dissemination of medical information, but their utility for facilitating research has remained largely untapped.
   Objective.-To describe in detail our experience using a social media platform (Twitter) for the successful initiation, coordination, and completion of an international, multi-institution pathology research study.
   Design.-Following a tweet describing a hitherto-unreported biopsy-related histologic finding in a mediastinal lymph node following endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, a tweet was posted to invite pathologists to participate in a validation study. Twitter's direct messaging feature was used to create a group to facilitate communication among participating pathologists. Contributing pathologists reviewed consecutive cases of mediastinal lymph node resection following endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration and examined them specifically for biopsy site changes. Data spreadsheets containing deidentified data and digital photomicrographs of suspected biopsy site changes were submitted via an online file hosting service for central review by 5 pathologists from different institutions.
   Results.-A total of 24 pathologists from 14 institutions in 5 countries participated in the study within 143 days of study conception, and a total of 297 cases were collected and analyzed. The time interval between study conception and acceptance of the manuscript for publication was 346 days.
   Conclusions.-To our knowledge, this is the first time that a social media platform has been used to generate a research idea based on a tweet, recruit coinvestigators publicly, communicate with collaborating pathologists, and successfully complete a pathology study.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have emerged as vital molecules governing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancers. Translation regulatory RNA 1 (TRERNA1) is one such lncRNA known to enhance the transcriptional activity of the EMT-transcription factor, Snail. We have previously demonstrated differential upregulation of EMT-transcription factors and cadherin switching across various clinico-pathologic-molecular subclasses of ependymomas (EPN). With an aim to analyze the correlation between the expression ofTRERNA1in EPNs, we performed gene expression analysis forTRERNA1on 75 Grade II/III EPNs and correlated with tumor site,C11orf95-RELAfusions, age, MIB-1 proliferative indices, and outcome wherever available. Upregulation of gene expression levels ofTRERNA1was seen in intracranial EPNs, with highest expression levels in pediatric posterior fossa EPNs. HighTRERNA1expression was found associated with higher proliferative indices (p = 0.034) and shorter progression free survival (p = 0.002). Our study, for the first time, demonstrates an association betweenTRERNA1expressions and pediatric posterior fossa EPNs. Further in-vivo and in-vitro studies are required to confirm these findings and evaluateTRERNA1as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target in childhood PF-EPNs.

AB  - Background: Early and accurate laboratory diagnosis and appropriate management of infection improves the survival rate in sepsis. In this study we evaluated broad range 16S rRNA and 16 S-23 S intergenic spacer region (ISR) PCR assays followed by nucleotide sequencing directly from patients' serum and automated blood culture for laboratory diagnosis in admitted sepsis patients.
   Methods: A broad range 16S rRNA PCR and 16 S-23 S ISR PCR assay followed by nucleotide sequencing was used directly from patients' serum in hospital admitted patients in 62 sepsis and 16 suspected blood stream infection (sBSI) patients. Automated blood culture was also used in the same patients. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed against NCBI Genbank database and organisms were identified using CLSI MM18A guidelines.
   Results: Bacterial culture were positive in 10/62 (16.12%) sepsis and 3/16 (18.75%) suspected BSI patients along with 3 detected fungi (2 in sepsis and 1 in suspected BSI group). PCR assay was positive in 36/62 (58.06%) sepsis and 6/16 (37.5%) suspected BSI patients respectively. All but 2 bacteria (both from culture negative patients) detected by PCR assay could be identified from nucleotide sequencing. Survival in sepsis patients was 77%. PCR assay could detect bacteria in 9/14 (64.28%) of sepsis patients with death.
   Conclusion: Broad range PCR assay was far superior for early diagnosis of infection. The bacteria which could not be detected by culture and were not commonly reported from this centre, were detected by the broad range PCR assays. Detection of these rare bacteria/fungi had significant clinical correlation with patient's underlying clinical conditions, immune status and prognosis. The tests could provide definitive diagnosis of infection in >58% of sepsis patients, which helped in patient management and better survival. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

KW  - SAMPLES
AB  - Background & objectives: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab (NPS and OPS) collection is widely accepted as the preferred method for obtaining respiratory samples. However, it has certain disadvantages which may be overcome by gargling. The primary objective of this study was to assess agreement between gargle lavage and swab as an appropriate respiratory sample for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective was to assess the patient acceptability of the two sampling methods.
   Methods: It was a cross-sectional study done at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India, on 50 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Paired swab (NPS and OPS) and gargle samples were taken within 72 h of their diagnosis. Samples were processed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Post-sample collection, a 10-point scale was administered to assess the level of discomfort with either of the collection methods.
   Results: All gargle samples were positive and comparable to their corresponding swab samples irrespective of the symptoms and duration of illness. The cycle threshold (C-t) values for gargle samples were slightly higher but comparable to those of swabs. Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the two methods. Majority (72%) of the patients reported moderate-to-severe discomfort with swab collection in comparison to 24 per cent reporting only mild discomfort with gargle collection.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our preliminary results show that the gargle lavage may be a viable alternative to swabs for sample collection for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Adoption of gargle lavage for sample collection will have a significant impact as it will enable easy self-collection, relieve healthcare workers and also lead to substantial cost savings by reducing the need for swabs and personal protective equipment.

AB  - Background & objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread globally including India. The characteristic clinical observations and outcomes of this disease (COVID-19) have been reported from different countries. The present study was aimed to describe the clinico-demographic characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of a group of COVID-19 patients in north India.
   Methods: This was a prospective, single-centre collection of data regarding epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters, management and outcome of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care facility in north India. Patient outcomes were recorded as death, discharge and still admitted.
   Results: Data of 144 patients with COVID-19 were recorded and analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 40.1 +/- 13.1 yr, with 93.1 per cent males, and included 10 (6.9%) foreign nationals. Domestic travel to or from affected States (77.1%) and close contact with COVID-19 patients in congregations (82.6%) constituted the most commonly documented exposure. Nine (6.3%) patients were smokers, with a median smoking index of 200. Comorbidities were present in 23 (15.9%) patients, of which diabetes mellitus (n=16; 11.1%) was the most common. A significant proportion of patients had no symptoms (n=64; 44.4%); among the symptomatic, cough (34.7%) was the most common symptom followed by fever (17.4%) and nasal symptoms (2.15%). Majority of the patients were managed with supportive treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin given on a case-to-case basis. Only five (3.5%) patients required oxygen supplementation, four (2.8%) patients had severe disease requiring intensive care, one required mechanical ventilation and mortality occurred in two (1.4%) patients. The time to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity was 16-18 days.
   Interpretation & conclusions: In this single-centre study of 144 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in north India, the characteristic findings included younger age, high proportion of asymptomatic patients, long time to PCR negativity and low need for intensive care unit care.

AB  - Objective To characterise types of corneal diseases and resulting visual impairment (VI) in a rural North Indian population. Design Cross-sectional, population-based study. Methods The Corneal Opacity Rural Epidemiological study included 12 899 participants from 25 random clusters of rural Gurgaon, Haryana, India to determine the prevalence of the corneal disease in the general population. Sociodemographic details, presence and type of corneal morbidity, laterality, VI (presenting visual acuity (PVA) <6/18 in the better eye) and characteristics of corneal opacities were noted. Results Overall, 12 113 participants of all ages underwent detailed ophthalmic examination and prevalence of corneal opacity was found to be 3.7% (n=452) with bilateral involvement in 140 participants (31%) during the house-to-house visits. Of the total 571 eyes of 435 patients presenting with corneal opacity at the central clinic, PVA was <3/60 in 166 (29.1%), 3/60 to <6/60 in 14 (2.5%), 6/60 to <6/18 in 164 (28.7%), 6/18 to <= 6/12 in 85 (14.9%) and 6/9 to 6/6 in 142 eyes (24.9%), respectively. Further, there were a total of 115 eyes (20.1%) with nebular corneal opacity, 263 (46.1%) with macular, 162 (28.4%) with leucomatous and 31 (5.4%) with an adherent leucoma. The odds of having VI due to corneal disease were greater for the illiterate (OR:4.26; 95% CI: 2.88 to 6.31; p<0.001) and elderly (OR:11.05; 95% CI: 7.76 to 15.74; p<0.001). Conclusion The data from this study give an insight into the characteristics of various corneal pathologies and resulting VI in the general population. This is a pioneer study involving all age groups on the burden of VI due to corneal diseases.

AB  - Background & objectives: Population-based seroepidemiological studies measure the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a country. We report the findings of the first round of a national serosurvey, conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult population of India.
   Methods: From May 11 to June 4, 2020, a randomly sampled, community-based survey was conducted in 700 villages/wards, selected from the 70 districts of the 21 States of India, categorized into four strata based on the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases. Four hundred adults per district were enrolled from 10 clusters with one adult per household. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies using COVID Kavach ELISA kit. All positive serum samples were re-tested using Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Adjusting for survey design and serial test performance, weighted seroprevalence, number of infections, infection to case ratio (ICR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with IgG positivity.
   Results: Total of 30,283 households were visited and 28,000 individuals were enrolled. Population-weighted seroprevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-1.13]. Males, living in urban slums and occupation with high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity. A cumulative 6,468,388 adult infections (95% CI: 3,829,029-11,199,423) were estimated in India by the early May. The overall ICR was between 81.6 (95% CI: 48.3-141.4) and 130.1 (95% CI: 77.0-225.2) with May 11 and May 3, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported cases. The IFR in the surveyed districts from high stratum, where death reporting was more robust, was 11.72 (95% CI: 7.21-19.19) to 15.04 (9.26-24.62) per 10,000 adults, using May 24 and June 1, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported deaths.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was low among the adult population in India around the beginning of May 2020. Further national and local serosurveys are recommended to better inform the public health strategy for containment and mitigation of the epidemic in various parts of the country.

AB  - Purpose: The microRNAs expression has emerged as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. This study investigated the expression of miRNA-182 and miRNA-187 in prostate cancer patients and established a correlation between miRNA expression and staging of prostate cancer.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study involved patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy for suspicion of prostate cancer. Pre-biopsy urine samples and prostatic core tissue samples of the patients were preserved and the miRNA-182 and miRNA-187 were studied.
   Results: Sixty-three patients were included in this study, thirty-three patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and thirty patients having benign histopathology were considered as controls. The expression of miRNA-182 was significantly increased (p=0.002) and miRNA-187 significantly decreased (p<0.001) in prostate cancer tissue specimens. However, the expression of these miRNAs did not significantly differ in the urine of prostate cancer patients as compared to controls. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) inversely correlated with the median expression of miR-187 in prostatic tissue (p=0.002). Further, the expression of miRNA-187 in prostate cancer tissue was significantly decreased in metastatic prostate cancer (p=0.037). Using ROC analysis, miRNA-187 expression was able to distinguish the presence or absence of bone metastasis [area under ROC (AUROC) (+/- SD) was 0.873 +/- 0.061, p<0.001].
   Conclusion: The miRNA-182 and miRNA-187 appear to be promising biomarkers in prostate cancer and miRNA-187 can serve as an important diagnostic marker of metastatic prostate cancer.

AB  - We evaluated the incidence and risk factors of Staphylococcus aureus colonisation in 300 treatment-naive HIV patients. Swabs from anterior nares and pharynx were cultured. Eighty-eight patients (29.3%) were colonised with S. aureus (47.7% nasal, 23.8% pharyngeal and 28.5% at both sites), which yielded 112 isolates. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was detected in 25.9% (29/112) of isolates. Panton-Valentine leucocidin gene was present in 18.8% (21/112) of isolates. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified CD4 count <200 cells/mm3, public bath use, alcohol intake and other sexually transmitted infections as independent predictors for S. aureus colonisation. On follow-up, 22.7% of patients with S. aureus colonisation developed skin- and soft-tissue infections. Strategies for behavioural changes would be helpful in controlling S. aureus colonisation and subsequent infection.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the epidemiology, management and outcome of individuals with mucormycosis; and to evaluate the risk factors associated with mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study involving consecutive individuals with proven mucormycosis across 12 centres from India. The demographic pro file, microbiology, predisposing factors, management and 90 -day mortality were recorded; risk factors for mortality were analysed. Results: We included 465 patients. Rhino -orbital mucormycosis was the most common (315/465, 67.7%) presentation followed by pulmonary (62/465, 13.3%), cutaneous (49/465, 10.5%), and others. The pre- disposing factors included diabetes mellitus (342/465, 73.5%), malignancy (42/465, 9.0%), transplant (36/ 465, 7.7%), and others. Rhizopus species (231/290, 79.7%) were the most common followed by Apophy- somyces variabilis (23/290, 7.9%), and several rare Mucorales . Surgical treatment was performed in 62.2% (289/465) of the participants. Amphotericin B was the primary therapy in 81.9% (381/465), and pos- aconazole was used as combination therapy in 53 (11.4%) individuals. Antifungal therapy was inappro- priate in 7.6% (30/394) of the individuals. The 90 -day mortality rate was 52% (242/465). On multivariate analysis, disseminated and rhino -orbital (with cerebral extension) mucormycosis, shorter duration of symptoms, shorter duration of antifungal therapy, and treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate (versus liposomal) were independent risk factors of mortality. A combined medical and surgical man- agement was associated with a better survival. Conclusions: Diabetes mellitus was the dominant predisposing factor in all forms of mucormycosis. Combined surgical and medical management was associated with better outcomes. Several gaps surfaced in the management of mucormycosis. The rarer Mucorales identi fied in the study warrant further eval- uation. A.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of antivirals for Covid-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has led to a severe medical, social and economic crisis globally. Use of antivirals has given inconsistent results; thus systematic summaries of available evidence are required for any recommendations for treatment. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of antivirals for Covid-19.
   Methods. The databases we searched were-Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening and data abstraction were carried out in duplicate by two researchers. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method of random effects for meta-analysis.
   Results. Twenty studies were found eligible for inclusion: 6 randomized controlled trials, 9 cohort studies and 5 case series. Moderate-quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit from the use of remdesivir in improving the number of recoveries (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07-1.31; I-2 =0%) and time to recovery in days (median -3.02; 95% CI -4.98 to -1.07;I-2 = 97%). A possibility of lower mortality is suggested by low-quality evidence with remdesivir (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37, I-2 =58%). Moderate-quality evidence suggests no certain benefit of using lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19 compared to arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with arbidol or other medications used as controls.
   Conclusion. Further evidence from randomized controlled trials is required for all antivirals to treat Covid-19. At present, remdesivir seems more promising than other antivirals.

AB  - Medical training programs are witnessing immense disruptions worldwide due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping in mind the trainees' future prospects, it is important to provide continuity of teaching and timely certification assessments. Overcoming the obstacles to routine functioning presented by SARS-CoV-2 spread, we recently conducted the DM Neurology exit examination in a hybrid virtual format. We created a curated case repository with history and clinical examination findings followed by structured questions that could be built upon for case discussions. The external examiners assessed the candidates virtually through a video conferencing platform. The end results were well accepted by all key stake holders. The concerns, logistics and experience of conducting the DM Neurology exit exam in a virtual format are summarized here.

AB  - Timely treatment is essential for optimal outcomes after burn injury, but the method of resource distribution to ensure access to proper care in developing countries remains unclear. We therefore sought to examine access to burn care and the presence/absence of resources for burn care in India. We surveyed all eligible burn centers (n = 67) in India to evaluate burn care resources at each facility. We then performed a cross-sectional geospatial analysis using geocoding software (ArcGIS 10.3) and publicly available hospital-level data (WorldStreetMap, WorldPop database) to predict the time required to access care at the nearest burn center. Our primary outcome was the time required to reach a burn facility within India. Descriptive statistics were used to present our results. Of the 67 burn centers that completed the survey, 45% were government funded. More than 1 billion (75.1%) Indian citizens live within 2 hours of a burn center, but only 221.9 million (15.9%) live within 2 hours of a burn center with both an intensive care unit (ICU) and a skin bank. Burn units are staffed primarily by plastic surgeons (n = 62, 93%) with an average of 5.8 physicians per unit. Most burn units (n = 53, 79%) have access to hemodialysis. While many Indian citizens live within 2 hours of a burn center, most centers do not offer ICU and skin bank services that are essential for modern burn care. Reallocation of resources to improve transportation and availability of ICU and skin bank services is necessary to improve burn care in India.

AB  - Cataract is the second leading cause of preventable blindness on the globe. Several programs across the country have been running efficiently to increase the cataract surgical rates and decrease blindness due to cataract. The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a complete halt of these programs and thus accumulating all the elective cataract procedures. At present with the better understanding of the safety precautions among the health care workers and general population the Government of India (GoI) has given clearance for functioning of eye care facilities. In order to facilitate smooth functioning of every clinic, in this paper, we prepared preferred practice pattern based on consensus discussions between leading ophthalmologists in India including representatives from major governmental and private institutions as well as the All India Ophthalmological Society leadership. These guidelines will be applicable to all practice settings including tertiary institutions, corporate and group practices and individual eye clinics. The guidelines include triage, use of personal protective equipment, precautions to be taken in the OPD and operating room as well for elective cataract screening and surgery. These guidelines have been prepared based on current situation but are expected to evolve over a period of time based on the ongoing pandemic and guidelines from GoI.

AB  - Question When considering patients who have obstructive coronary artery disease and ischemia on stress testing, are there sex differences in severity of coronary artery disease, ischemia, and/or symptoms? Findings In this secondary analysis of the ISCHEMIA randomized clinical trial of 5179 patients, women had more frequent angina, less extensive coronary artery disease, and less severe ischemia than men. On multivariate analysis, female sex was independently associated with greater angina frequency. Meaning There may be inherent sex differences in the complex relationships between angina, ischemia, and atherosclerosis that may have implications for testing and treatment of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.
   Importance While many features of stable ischemic heart disease vary by sex, differences in ischemia, coronary anatomy, and symptoms by sex have not been investigated among patients with moderate or severe ischemia. The enrolled ISCHEMIA trial cohort that underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) was required to have obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) for randomization. Objective To describe sex differences in stress testing, CCTA findings, and symptoms in ISCHEMIA trial participants. Design, Setting, and Participants This secondary analysis of the multicenter ISCHEMIA randomized clinical trial analyzed baseline characteristics of patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Individuals were enrolled from July 2012 to January 2018 based on local reading of moderate or severe ischemia on a stress test, after which blinded CCTA was performed in most. Core laboratories reviewed stress tests and CCTAs. Participants with no obstructive CAD or with left main CAD of 50% or greater were excluded. Those who met eligibility criteria including CCTA (if performed) were randomized to a routine invasive or a conservative management strategy (N = 5179). Angina was assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Analysis began October 1, 2018. Interventions CCTA and angina assessment. Main Outcomes and Measures Sex differences in stress test, CCTA findings, and symptom severity. Results Of 8518 patients enrolled, 6256 (77%) were men. Women were more likely to have no obstructive CAD (<50% stenosis in all vessels on CCTA) (353 of 1022 [34.4%] vs 378 of 3353 [11.3%]). Of individuals who were randomized, women had more angina at baseline than men (median [interquartile range] Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency score: 80 [70-100] vs 90 [70-100]). Women had less severe ischemia on stress imaging (383 of 919 [41.7%] vs 1361 of 2972 [45.9%] with severe ischemia; 386 of 919 [42.0%] vs 1215 of 2972 [40.9%] with moderate ischemia; and 150 of 919 [16.4%] vs 394 of 2972 [13.3%] with mild or no ischemia). Ischemia was similar by sex on exercise tolerance testing. Women had less extensive CAD on CCTA (205 of 568 women [36%] vs 1142 of 2418 men [47%] with 3-vessel disease; 184 of 568 women [32%] vs 754 of 2418 men [31%] with 2-vessel disease; and 178 of 568 women [31%] vs 519 of 2418 men [22%] with 1-vessel disease). Female sex was independently associated with greater angina frequency (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.76). Conclusions and Relevance Women in the ISCHEMIA trial had more frequent angina, independent of less extensive CAD, and less severe ischemia than men. These findings reflect inherent sex differences in the complex relationships between angina, atherosclerosis, and ischemia that may have implications for testing and treatment of patients with suspected stable ischemic heart disease.
   This secondary analysis of the ISCHEMIA randomized clinical trial describes sex differences in stress testing, coronary computed tomographic angiography findings, and symptoms in patients with stable ischemic heart disease.

AB  - Background: We have recently reported that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is involved in ischemic preconditioning-mediated cardioprotection by promoting nitric oxide (NO) release into diabetic rat heart (DRH). The upregulation of HO-1 decreases the endothelin-1 (ET-1) production, which is a negative regulator of NO. In diabetes, the level of HO-1 is reduced while the level of ET-1 gets elevated. Thus, the present analysis was aimed to explore the concept of HO-1 and ET-1 in the abrogated cardioprotective role of ischemic post conditioning (IPOC) in the DRH. Materials and Methods: To explore the concept, a selective HO-1 inducer hemin, 18 hrs prior and a selective ETA receptor antagonist BQ123, one week prior, were administered to DRH before isolation. DRH was removed and then mounted on Langendorff's apparatus, subjected to 10 min stabilization followed by 30 min ischemia. IPOC had been induced by four cycles of 5 min reperfusion along with 5 min ischemia followed by further 120 min of reperfusion. The extent of the infarct was measured and the coronary effluent was tested for the LDH, CK-MB and NO release. Results: In DRH, cardioprotection mediated by the IPOC was significantly attenuated. Hemin and BQ-123 reinstated the impact of IPOC in DRH and also increased the release of NO. In BQ-123 pre-treated diabetic rat, the administration of hemin was unable to produce the additive cardioprotective effect of IPOC. Conclusion: Thus, it is suggested that hemin and BQ-123 restore the attenuated cardioprotective effect of IPOC in the DRH, which may be due to increased NO release.

The purpose was to investigate which interpositional fat grafting technique is superior in the operative management of TMJA. The specific aim was to compare the volumetric change and maximal mouth opening (MIO) when pedicled buccal fat or abdominal fat is interposed in patients being treated for TMJA.
   Patients and Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on TMJA patients divided into 2 groups: Pedicled buccal fat pad was used for interposition in group A, whereas abdominal fat was used in group B. At the end of 1 year, the volumetric change in fat was analyzed by comparing immediate postoperative and 1-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MIO and re-ankylosis were recorded. Categorical variables were analyzed by the chi(2) test or Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were compared using the t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Linear regression analysis was performed.
   Results: A total of 36 patients (51 joints [15 bilateral and 21 unilateral]) were included, comprising 18 in group A and 18 in group B. The mean preoperative MIO measured 6.8 mm in group A and 4.2 mm in group B. The mean immediate postoperative MRI fat volume was 4.3 cm(3) in group A and 10.8 cm(3) in group B. One-year follow-up MRI showed a fat retention rate of 32.44% in group A and 58.17% in group B. The rate of volumetric shrinkage was 67.5% in group A and 41.9% in group B (P <.001). Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference between volumetric shrinkage and both treatment groups (P <.001). MIO improved to 30.6 mm in the pedicled buccal fat pad group (group A) and 41.9 mm in the abdominal fat group (group B) (P <.001). No re-ankylosis occurred in either group at 1-year follow-up.
   Conclusions: Our study results suggest that the percentage of retention of interposed abdominal fat at 1 year is more than that of pedicled buccal fat pad. Volumetric shrinkage is greater with buccal fat pad, which is a paradox considering the pedicled blood supply. Abdominal fat is better than pedicled buccal fat pad when used for interposition in TMJA treatment. (C) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - In spite of advances in medical science, Rh alloimmunisation remains one of the leading causes of preventable neuro-morbidities and significant neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in lower-middle income countries. Despite availability of effective antenatal preventive strategy (Anti-D), its uptake in antenatal period is low due to ignorance. Further, once diagnosed, there is lack of adequate antenatal follow up in health care facility. Some of these cases even remain undiagnosed in antenatal period only to present as a case of severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in late neonatal period. Thus, there is an urgent need for creating awareness and educating health care professionals for early detection and timely management in both antenatal and postnatal period. Following two doses of anti-D prophylaxis (one in antenatal period and one in immediate postnatal period) the incidence of Rh alloimmunisation can reduce to <1%. It is recommended to follow all Rh alloimmunised pregnancies antenatally with serial indirect Coombs test titre (till critical titre is reached) followed by serial Doppler velocimetry of middle cerebral artery in a perinatal centre where facility for intrauterine transfusion as well as advanced neonatal care is available. Postnatal management of these infants comprises of confirmation of diagnosis, aggressive phototherapy and in selective cases, double volume exchange transfusion. With appropriate antenatal and postnatal management, the prognosis of Rh alloimmunised pregnancy remains favourable and long term outcome of Rh alloimmunised infants remain comparable with their normal counterparts.

AB  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed universally in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA). As contrast enhancement of postoperative scar is common with contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI), diagnosis of residual/recurrent JNA remains perplexing. Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET targets only the neovasculature and may aid in resolving this dilemma. Positive contrast enhancement on CEMRI was noted in a patient after 30 years of initial surgery, simulating recurrence. However, there was no abnormal uptake in PSMA scan, which was confirmed by biopsy as postoperative fibrosis.Ga-68-PSMA PET/MRI fusion may be an easy and novel technique to aid in differentiating residual/recurrent disease from surgical site reparative tissue.

AB  - Context: Endovascular therapy is currently the most common treatment approach for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF), followed by microsurgery. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) is usually reserved as the last modality of treatment of intracranial DAVF. Aim: To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcome of GKS in the treatment of DAVF without CVD. Subjects and Methods: This series includes patients who underwent GKS for intracranial DAVF without CVD over 10 years (Jan 2007 to Dec 2016) in All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Their demographic profile, clinical presentation, imaging details, GKS details, and follow-up clinical status were obtained retrospectively. Clinical follow-up, along with radiological assessment using MRI every 6 months was done after GKS. DSA was performed once MRI strongly suggested obliteration of DAVF. Patients who had a clinical follow-up of less than 1 year were excluded from the study. Results: 5 patients (4 males and 1 female) who had DAVF without CVD were included the study. The mean age was 44.8 years. All patients had complete obliteration of fistula on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at a mean duration of 24 months post GKS. All patients had complete resolution of symptoms at the last follow-up. Conclusions: Gamma Knife surgery is the most effective and the safest treatment modality for dealing with DAVFs without CVD. Instead of reserving it as the last resort for patients with DAVF without CVD, it should be considered as the gold standard treatment for DAVFs without CVD.

AB  - Background Anaemia is a serious public health concern in India. However, national estimates for its prevalence are not available for the 5-14 years age group, nor are estimates available for the types of anaemia among children and adolescents (1-19 years). We aimed to assess the prevalence of anaemia among children and adolescents in India and to categorise types of anaemia on the basis of micronutrient deficiencies. Methods We assessed the prevalence of anaemia among children (1-4 years and 5-9 years) and adolescents (10-19 years) using nationally representative data from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey. Anaemia was classified on the basis of age and sex-specific WHO cutoffs and serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, folate, cyanocobalamin, and C-reactive protein concentrations as iron deficiency anaemia, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, dimorphic anaemia (iron deficiency anaemia and folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia), anaemia of other causes (anaemia not classified as iron deficiency anaemia and folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia), and anaemia of inflammation. Findings We included 26 765 children (11 624 aged 1-4 years and 15 141 aged 5-9 years) and 14 669 adolescents. In the weighted sample, anaemia prevalence was 40?5% (4553 of 11 233) among 1-4 year-olds, 23?4% (3439 of 14 664) among 5-9 year-olds, and 28?4% (4064 of 14 300) among adolescents. Among 2862 children aged 1-4 years, iron deficiency anaemia (1045 [36?5%]) was the most prevalent type, followed by anaemia of other causes (702 [24?5%]), folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia (542 [18?9%]), dimorphic anaemia (387 [13?5%]), and anaemia of inflammation (186 [6?5%]). Among 2261 children aged 5-9 years, anaemia of other causes was the most common (986 [43?6%]), followed by folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia (558 [24?6%]), iron deficiency anaemia (353 [15?6%]), dimorphic anaemia (242 [10?7%]), and anaemia of inflammation (122 [5?4%]). 861 (31?4%) of 2740 adolescents had anaemia of other causes, 703 (25?6%) had folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, 584 (21?3%) had iron deficiency anaemia, 498 (18?2%) and dimorphic anaemia, and 94 (3?4%) had anaemia of inflammation. Interpretation Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common form of anaemia among younger children and anaemia of other causes among 5-9-year-old children and adolescents. Folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia accounts for more than a third of anaemia prevalence. Anaemia prevention efforts should focus on strengthening the existing iron and folate supplementation programmes and prevention of folate or vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia.

KW  - STATEMENT
AB  - The COVID-19 Pandemic has prompted substantial changes in the way ophthalmology is practiced globally. General guidelines on safe ophthalmic practice have been issued by various bodies across the globe including the All India Ophthalmological Society. While these are suitable to ophthalmology overall, they are not entirely suitable to a subspecialty practice, particularly pediatric ophthalmology, strabismus and neuro-ophthalmology, which entails dealing with children, surgery under general anesthesia and managing possible life threatening situations. A group of sub-specialists and anesthetists met virtually and arrived at a consensus with regard to practice and general anesthesia protocols pertaining to these subspecialties of ophthalmology. The recommendations made by the expert group are specific yet can be universally followed to ensure the best and safest outcome for the practitioner and patient alike. The recommendations pertain to listing conditions which need emergency or urgent care in the fields of pediatric ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmology, precautions and technique of pediatric and neuro-ophthalmic eye examination and a protocol for delivering a safe general anesthesia for a pediatriceye surgery.

AB  - People living with visual disabilities/impairment are more likely vulnerable to get contracted from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV 2) than people without visual impairment. This means more than 253 million people globally will be at higher risk of affecting by the COVID-19. The current pandemic, followed by a nationwide emergency lockdown to slow the unprecedented spread of the virus, will have a serious impact on people living with visual disabilities and even endangers their lives in the long run. Many restrictive and control measures, including the adoption of new behavioural changes (for example, social distance during outdoor movement, limiting touch or tactile contact) recommended by the government will pose immense challenges to individuals with a visual loss. This serious impact, including challenges in healthcare access, can be minimized through inclusive service approaches, involving persons with visual disabilities, caregivers, family members, and healthcare providers, along with the community to a large extent, and finally, support to improve the overall outcomes. The government, along with profit or non-profit private sectors, should consider initiating such inclusive approaches while planning responses to the pandemic. Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for health care planners and decision-makers of various organizations across India for a reformation of disabilities care. Impacts due to the pandemic and lockdown can be reduced substantially if planning and policy are in place before any emergency happened in the future.

TI  - Convalescent plasma therapy for Covid-19: A systematic review
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - ANTIBODY
KW  - INFECTION
AB  - Background. Covid-19 has emerged as a pandemic affecting more than 20 million people till date with few, if any, proven therapy. Convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies against the virus has been used with some success. We did a systematic review to synthesize the available data on CP therapy for treatment of Covid-19 to study the efficacy and safety outcomes.
   Methods. Two reviewers searched the published and pre-published literature between 1 January 2019 and 23 June 2020 for studies comparing the use of CP with standard therapy for Covid-19 patients. Data from the selected studies were abstracted and analysed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the quality of evidence was graded as per GRADE.
   Results. We found 13 case series and 1 randomized trial that fulfilled our search criteria. Of the 12 case series with a total of 264 patients that reported the efficacy outcomes, 11 studies showed favourable results with survival benefit. The only RCT with 103 patients did not show any mortality benefit but was terminated early prior to complete enrolment. A single large study of 5000 patients reported safety outcomes and showed no major adverse events in patient streated with CP.
   Conclusion. There is very low-quality evidence to suggest efficacy and safety of CP in patients with Covid-19 infection. Well-designed randomized trials are urgently needed to provide robust data.

AB  - Background: Infant and child feeding practices are a prevalent challenge in Haryana. Objectives: The present study aimed to determine factors associated with non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and no continued breastfeeding in Haryana. Methods: National Family Health Survey-4 data for the state of Haryana was used for analysis. The outcomes were non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no EBF, and no continued breastfeeding. Independent variables were categorized as sociodemographic, maternal, and child level factors. Each category of factors was added step-by-step to the logistic regression model for multivariable analysis. Results: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding was higher among poorer wealth quintiles. Home deliveries (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]-1.27-2.84), cesarean section (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI-1.46-3.40), body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2 (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI-1.13-2.33), and not receiving postnatal check-up (AOR 1.36, 95% CI-1.40-1.78) increases likelihood of delayed initiation of breastfeeding beyond 1 h of birth. Increased risk of non-EBF was associated with no postnatal check-ups and BMI >25 kg/m2. Risk of discontinuation of breastfeeding was significantly high with birth interval of <2 years (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI-1.08-2.14) and if babies did not receive postnatal check-up (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI-1.04-2.27). Conclusion: The study highlighted need for focused approach to counsel overweight/obese mothers, cesarean section, and home delivered mothers. Community awareness, adequate birth spacing, and postnatal visits are vital for improving exclusive and continued breastfeeding practices. Communities and health-care providers should provide adequate support to mothers for breastfeeding during the antenatal and postnatal periods.

AB  - Telemedicine and tele-ophthalmology have been in existence since many years, but have recently gained more importance in the present scenario of pandemic COVID-19. The attitude and perception of the doctors and patients has been changing gradually. Telemedicine has many advantages including providing care in inaccesible areas.In the present scenario, tele-ophthalmology gives an oppurtunity to patient for seeking consultation while also protecting against the contagion. There are many barriers faced by the patients and doctors that have restricted use of this technology in the past. However, with a systematic approach to designing the best suited technology, these barriers can be overcome and user friendly platforms can be created. Furthermore, the demand and use of teleconsulation had increased presently in this area of pandemic. Recent survey conducted by the All India Ophthalmological Society also reveals that many ophthalmologists who have not used tele-ophthalmology in the past are more keen to use it presently. In this article, we have reviewed telemedicine and tele-ophthalmology literature on Google and PubMed to get a holistic idea towards teleconsultation, its advantages, increased importance and prefrence during COVID-19 pandemic and various barriers faced so that the known challenges can be understood, which can pave way for better understanding and future incorporation into practice.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it the huge burden of mortality and morbidity across the world and the added effects of the mandatory lockdown measures to try and control the spread. A number of aspects of healthcare including eye donation and eye collection require adequate safety precautions in place to keep both the involved healthcare workers and patients safe. This paper highlights the consensus-based guidelines by an expert panel on how to restart eye banking and eye collection services and carry out emergency corneal surgeries during this COVID-19 time. These guidelines will be applicable to all eye banks across the country and should help ophthalmologists and eye banking staff to restart eye banking while safeguarding themselves and their patients.

AB  - Aim Patients with severe mitral stenosis (MS) and their clinicians typically choose percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) over surgical commissurotomy (SC). However, the durability of PTMC relative to SC is uncertain. We compared the efficacy, safety and durability of PTMC with SC for the treatment of MS.
   Methods We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and WHO ICTRP registers for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PTMC, and open and/or closed mitral commissurotomy. The principal outcomes were rate of re-intervention and symptomatic improvement as inferred from the surrogate measures of immediate postprocedural mitral valve area (MVA), MVA at >= 6month follow-up, incidence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and restenosis. We calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes, relative risks (RR) for binary outcomes and pooled outcomes using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
   Results Seven RCTs with 553 patients proved eligible. Pooled estimates showed no convincing difference in the risk of restenosis or re-intervention (15/100 fewer with PTMC, 95%CI (-20 to +8); quality of evidence: moderate) or in symptoms as inferred from immediate MVA (WMD 0.15, 95%CI (-0.18 to 0.48): very low), from the incidence of postprocedural severe MR (3/100 more with PTMC, 95%CI (-1 to +10): moderate) or from MVA at 30 months.
   Conclusion Until data demonstrating convincing superiority of SC over PTMC become available, our results support the current practice of recommending PTMC to young patients with MS and favourable valve morphology, as it is associated with lower peri-procedural morbidity.

AB  - Purpose Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular cancer with a high mortality rate that requires new research in the field of prevention and treatment. c-REL is a member of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) transcription factor family and an emerging regulator of tumorigenesis. Therefore, the objective of the study is to evaluate the constitutive expression of c-REL in uveal melanoma patients and its prognostic significance. Methods Detection of c-REL expression was carried out by immunohistochemistry in all 75 patients, and qRT-PCR performed on 58 fresh cases of uveal melanoma along with IL-6 status. Immunoblot was performed to validate immunohistochemistry results. Expression of c-REL protein correlated with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival of patients. Results Immunohistochemistry results revealed nuclear expression of the c-REL protein (56%) in our cases. Out of 75 cases, 31 cases showed nuclear expression, and 11 cases had cytoplasmic expression. qRT-PCR showed upregulation of theRELgene in 56.89% cases at the transcriptional level. There was a statistically significant difference in the overall survival of patients with c-REL nuclear immunopositivity (p = 0.0048). On multivariate analysis, scleral invasion and c-REL nuclear expression found to be an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05) Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study reporting the expression of the c-REL protein in uveal melanoma. Strong nuclear immunoexpression of c-Rel suggests NF kappa B pathway activation which might be involved in the progression of the disease. Differential expression of c-REL protein may be used as an attractive target for the development of anticancer strategies.

AB  - Purpose: To quantitatively assess anterior chamber and angle parameters by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in myopic eyes undergoing Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL V4c) implantation. Methods: Prospective noncomparative observational case series. Pre and postoperative (1st and 3rd month) AS-OCT angle parameters (anterior chamber depth [ACD], anterior chamber angle [ACA], Angle opening distance [AOD], trabecular iris space area [TISA], scleral spur angle [SSA]) were evaluated in 32 eyes (16 patients). SPSS version 20 with paired t-test for intragroup and Mann-Whitney U value test for intergroup comparisons. Results: It included 6 (37.5%) males and 10 (62.5%) females. Preoperative ACA of 34.6 +/- 2.3 degrees reduced to 32.2 +/- 2.4 degrees, 31.9 +/- 2.5 degrees at 1 and 3 months postoperatively (P = 0.001). Preoperative mean AOD500, AOD750, TISA500, TISA750, SSA of 0.34 +/- 0.06 mm, 0.52 +/- 0.15 mm, 0.09 +/- 0.02 mm(2), 0.20 +/- 0.04 mm(2), 34.27 +/- 4.6 degrees decreased to 0.32 +/- 0.06 mm, 0.48 +/- 0.15 mm, 0.08 +/- 0.02 mm(2), 0.17 +/- 0.05 mm(2), 32.5 +/- 4.3 degrees at 1-month (P = 0.001); 0.32 +/- 0.06 mm, 0.47 +/- 0.13 mm, 0.08 +/- 0.02 mm(2), 0.17 +/- 0.05 mm(2) and 32.4 +/- 4.6 degrees (P = 0.001) at 3-months, respectively. Correlation analysis between preoperative ACD/intraocular pressure (IOP) was - 0.62 (P = 0.0002) [1st month], -0.40 (0.024) [third month]; between IOP/postoperative ACA, AOD500, AOD750, TISA500, TISA750, SSA was - 0.04 (0.81), -0.03 (0.85), -0.08 (0.64), -0.12 (0.48), -0.10 (0.57), -0.06 (0.73) at 1 month; -0.09 (0.58), 0.04 (0.78), 0.12 (0.48), -0.02 (0.9), -0.04 (0.79), 0.02 (0.88) at 3 months; between ICL vault/ACA, AOD500, AOD750, TISA500, TISA750, SSA was 0.38 (0.02), 0.24 (0.17), 0.21 (0.25), 0.05 (0.75), 0.15 (0.41), 0.27 (0.13) at 1st month; 0.19 (0.28), 0.06 (0.71), -0.03 (0.85), 0.005 (0.97), 0.05 (0.78), 0.07 (0.68) at 3rd month. Conclusion: Postoperatively significant angle narrowing was noted. There was a negative correlation between IOP and preoperative ACD. There was no significant correlation between IOP and ICL vault with postoperative AS-OCT angle parameters.

AB  - Objective To test the ability and to identify unique criteria in a Modified Integrated Algorithm developed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to detect HIV infection among sick children 0 to 14 years, seeking care in a health care facility. Design Facility based cross-sectional survey. Setting Four talukas of Belgaum District, Karnataka, India during 2013-2014. Patients Sick children 0-14 years seeking care at healthcare facilities in the study area. Procedure A total of 10 health care facilities were selected using specific criteria. Trained health care providers in these facilities used the WHO generic Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses screening algorithm for HIV, applicable for children to 0-5 years and ICMR modified integrated algorithm for >5-14 years, to screen and test children for HIV, when they sought care in these facilities. Main Outcome measure Prevalence of HIV in children screened positive by the Modified Integrated Algorithm. Results Of the total 33342 children who visited the 10 health care facilities, 24342 were screened by the physician. Of the 527 screened positive sick children with suspected signs/symptoms, 509 consented and were tested with age appropriate HIV testing. 97 children tested positive (HIV prevalence 19.1%: 5% in <5yrs and 28% in >= 5-14 years). The result of Classification and Regression Tree and logistics regression consistently identified parents with HIV and orphan child, as important predictor of HIV infection. Conclusion ICMR Modified integrated algorithm may be used as a screening tool in the public and private health care facilities to increase case detection of pediatric HIV.

AB  - Background: Nutritional anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in India. The average diet in India is low in iron and mostly of vegetable origin. This can be improved by increasing awareness of foodstuffs that are rich in iron and ensuring their availability. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the quality of information available on iron-rich foods and to assess their production and consumption in India. Methods: This was a review of common textbooks for medical, nursing, and home science students; related policy and program documents; and government publications on production and consumption of various foodstuffs in India. Results: Details of specific foods that are rich in iron have not been provided. Instead, food groups such as pulses, cereals, nuts, and green leafy vegetables (GLVs) have been mentioned that are good sources of non-heme iron. This is in spite of the fact that all the foodstuffs in these groups are not uniformly iron rich. Among cereals and pulses, rice and red gram dal (arhar) are the most commonly produced and consumed, though they have the lowest iron content. Spinach and mustard leaves believed to be iron rich and commonly consumed are among those GLVs having lowest iron content. Conclusion: Details of 5-10 foodstuffs which have the highest iron content within each food group should be available in relevant books and documents meant for education, production, and consumption data.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the humanity at a global level to a large extent by the burden of the disease with significant mortality and to a certain extent as a byproduct of the necessary efforts to contain the same. There is a significant impact on the health care system, as we not only have to contain pandemic, but continue to treat our non-COVID-19 patients in a safe and responsible manner. Ophthalmology practice in general and glaucoma in particular needs certain modifications and additional precautions while examining as well as managing these patients keeping their and our safety in mind. As the lockdown relaxations are in vogue we need to learn how to deal with our regular patients as well in addition to emergency care. This paper presents the consensus-based guidelines by an expert panel on how to restart glaucoma practice during this COVID-19 time. These guidelines will be applicable across the country and should help ophthalmologists and glaucoma specialist to restart their practices while safeguarding the patients and their own selves from getting infected.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted our society on an unprecedented scale since its inception in December 2019. As the health-care system is finally re-organizing to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, it was necessary to re-structure primary eye care (PEC) activities as well on the same lines. A consensus meeting was held with leading eye-care experts on 2nd May 2020 to prepare a roadmap for PEC in the days to come. Guidelines are needed for PEC activities like vision testing, refraction, optical dispensing, counseling, etc., Some of the activities at vision centers (VCs) may be postponed or modified in light of the current pandemic situation. PEC workers need to strictly follow social distancing norms (minimum 3 feet) for minimizing risk of exposure and need access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), like gloves, masks and shields while examining beneficiaries. For optometrists, sterilization of instruments and encouraging the people to remain silent during the examination is recommended. Because conjunctivitis may be an early sign which can present at VCs, extra precautions in the form of PPE has to be ensured while examining such patients. This is also an opportunity to start running telemedicine clinics for all emergent cases that cannot be managed at the primary level. The guidelines also need to be updated based on the context of the working environment and changes in government directives from time to time.

AB  - Background and Introduction: Donning and doffing of personal protective equipments (PPE) has become relevant especially during COVID-19 pandemic and neurosurgeons operating upon COVID-19 positive or suspect patients should be aware of proper technique of donning and doffing of PPE.[1] Surgeries involving direct exposure of anterior nasal spaces/paranasal sinuses carry significantly more risk of infection and it may be prudent to use PPE while operating all such cases.[2] Objective: In this video, we present our extensive protocol of donning and doffing of PPE which we have devised for our operating room. Technique: Donning consists of wearing of the PPE in a proper sequence so as to afford maximal protection from viral infection while conducting the surgical procedure. Various components of PPE and procedure of donning is shown followed by doffing, the sequential and safe removal of the PPE. Results: A meticulous method of donning and doffing PPE for neurosurgeons handling COVID-19 positive / suspect cases has been shown . Conclusion: Proper sequence of donning and doffing of PPE gear is of crucial importance during the COVID pandemic to prevent infection to the health care workers while handling COVID-19 positive/suspect cases and this video demonstrates the protocol we use at our institute.

AB  - Objectives: Acinetobacter baumannii emerged as a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for infections. In this study, we report the molecular characterization, association of insertion sequences and sequence types of clinical isolates of carbapenem resistant A. baumannii.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 763 non-duplicate isolates of A. baumannii received from 8 centres across India during January 2014 to December 2017 were studied. Susceptibility testing was done by Kirby-Bauer method. PCR was performed for detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases, metallo beta-lactamases, oxacillinases and ISAba1. Mapping PCR was performed to identify the position of ISAba1 with respect to bla(OXA-23) like and bla(OXA-51) like gene. MLST was performed to identify the sequence type. Whole genome sequencing was done to decipher the genetic arrangement of ISAba1 with bla(OXA-23) like and with bla(OXA-51) like.
   Results: All the isolates were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. bla(OXA-23) like was the predominant carbapenemase. All isolates were positive for ISAba1. The common sequence types were ST848, ST451 and ST1305 which belongs to International clone II. Whole genome sequencing showed considerable variation in the insertion site location.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, high prevalence of bla(OXA-23) like in A. baumannii and its association with ISAba1 and sequence types belonging to IC-II facilitates the successful dissemination of these extremely drug resistant strains.

AB  - Simultaneous and direct recording of temperature from the body, hypothalamus, and cortex in animals exposed to acute thermal challenges lack evidence. This study was conducted to assess the usual concept, that brain temperature is rather stable when animals are exposed to different ambient temperatures. In this study, we report the characteristic changes in the body, hypothalamic, and cortical temperature, when the rats were acutely exposed to cold (6 degrees C) and hot (36 degrees C) ambient temperature. The results of our study show that the body temperature is robustly regulated while hypothalamic and cortical temperatures vary on challenges to ambient cold (6 degrees C) and warm (36 degrees C) exposure in awake rats. The onset of response was observed quickest in the cortex, indicating that the cortical thermal sensing may relay intracranial thermal input to the hypothalamus for the regulation of body temperature within narrow limits. The present findings contradict earlier evidence, which stated that the brain does not participate in thermal sensing.

AB  - Background: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a complex inflammatory disease with variable presentations and outcomes. This statement is part of the international consensus guidelines on CP, specifically on the diagnostic role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).
   Methods: An international working group with experts on the role of diagnostic EUS in the management of CP from the major pancreas societies (IAP, APA, JPS, and EPC) evaluated two key statements generated from evidence on two questions deemed to be the most clinically relevant. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the level of evidence available for each statement. To determine the level of agreement, the working group voted on each statement for strength of agreement, using a nine-point Likert scale in order to calculate Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient.
   Results: Strong consensus was obtained for both of the following statements [1]. The ideal threshold number of EUS criteria necessary to diagnose CP has not been firmly established, but the presence of 5 or more and 2 or less strongly suggests or refutes the diagnosis, respectively. The Rosemont scoring system standardizes the reporting of EUS signs indicative of chronic pancreatitis, but further studies are needed to demonstrate an overall improvement of its diagnostic accuracy over conventional scoring [2]. Specificity, inter- and intra-observer variability and pre-test probability limit the reliability and utility of EUS to help diagnose CP especially early stages of the disease.
   Conclusions: The presence of 5 or more and 2 or less EUS criteria strongly suggests or refutes the diagnosis of CP, respectively. Intra-observer variability still limits the role of EUS in diagnosing CP especially early stage disease. (c) 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pelvis is a rare site for the origin of soft tissue sarcomas, and leiomyosarcoma remains the most common soft tissue sarcoma arising in the pelvis. Pelvic leiomyosarcomas are frequently aggressive tumors, and metastatic recurrence rates are high, with the lung, peritoneum, bone, and liver being the most frequent sites. We describe the findings of serial(18)F-FDG PET/CT in a 53-year-old woman having pelvic leiomyosarcoma with uncommon site of metastasis, emphasizing the role of(18)F-FDG PET/CT in response assessment.

AB  - Oral inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is extremely rare and its manifestation as generalized gingival enlargement (GGE) has never been reported. We are reporting the case of 50-year-old female patient presenting with recurrent GGE for 4 years. Panoramic radiograph revealed severe bone loss in posterior sextants and root resorption in some teeth. Initial incisional biopsy was suggestive of chronic inflammatory infiltrate with fibrocollagenous tissue. Definitive treatment comprised of surgical excision of the enlarged gingiva with a tapering dose of steroid therapy. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination from a repeat biopsy of deeper tissues was suggestive IMT. No recurrence was found at 2 years follow up. Recurrent GGE with advanced bone loss and external root resorption should raise the suspicion of a locally aggressive lesion. Dentists should be aware of oral IMT and include it in differential diagnosis of gingival enlargements for comprehensive management to avoid recurrence of the lesion.

AB  - Introduction The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the novel beta coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Within a short span, COVID-19 was declared a global public health emergency affecting 214 countries with 5,939,234 confirmed cases and 3,67,255 deaths as of 30 May 2020. With limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, no approved treatment or vaccine is available till date. Areas covered We performed a review of literature on PubMed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness including trials of preventive and therapeutic measures. This review presents the basic biology of coronaviruses, epidemiology of COVID-19, clinical presentations, investigational therapies and vaccines, infection prevention and control measures and the lessons from the present pandemic. Expert opinion The scale of the outbreak has brought the governments, health-care professionals, and scientists around the world under tremendous pressure to devise control strategies and develop novel prevention measures. While availability of vaccine for COVID-19 may take time, the disease may be contained through hand hygiene, physical distancing, travel restriction, and aggressive steps such as 'lockdown.' Clinical trials at different phases are ongoing across different countries to expedite the development of effective drugs and vaccine to overcome the pandemic.

AB  - Background Quality of life in Parkinson's disease (PD) is affected by motor and nonmotor symptoms, necessitating an integrated care approach. Existing care models vary considerably in numerous domains. The objectives of this study were to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of PD integrated care models and develop recommendations for a representative model. Methods We conducted a systematic review of published integrated care models and a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials examining integrated care versus standard care. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life using a validated PD scale. We evaluated levels of care integration using the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care. Results Forty-eight publications were identified, including 8 randomized, controlled trials with health-related quality of life data (n = 1,149 total PD patients). Qualitative evaluation of individual care model integration guided by the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care revealed frequent clinical and professional integration, but infrequent organizational and population-based integration elements. Meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials revealed significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 90%,P< 0.0001). Subgroup analysis including only outpatient care models (n = 5) indicated homogeneity of effects (I-2 = 0%,P= 0.52) and improved health-related quality of life favoring integrated care, with a small effect size (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.17; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.03;P= 0.02). Conclusions Outpatient integrated PD care models may improve patient-reported health-related quality of life compared with standard care; however, because of variable methodological approaches and a high risk of bias related to inherent difficulties in study design (eg, blinding of participants and interventionists), generalizability of these results are difficult to establish. The Rainbow Model of Integrated Care is a promising method of evaluating elements and levels of integration from individual patient care to population health in a PD context.

AB  - Background Various patch materials to close large atrial septal defects (ASDs) are autologous pericardium or a large of prosthetic patches which may be associated with infrequent but definite problems. We describe our experience with the use of the right atrial free wall patch over the last two decades. Methods and Results Between July 1998 and December 2017, 157 patients (mean age 14.7 +/- 13.9 years), underwent ASD closure using the right atrial free wall patch. Associated lesions were severe mitral regurgitation (n = 24), partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (n = 15), ASD closure occurring after myxoma excision (n = 12) total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (n = 2) and tricuspid regurgitation (n = 2). Surgery was uneventful in all patients. All patients underwent serial electrocardiography and echocardiography. Follow-up in 140 of 155 survivors was 103.6 +/- 0.6 months. One hundred forty of one hundred fifty-five survivors are in sinus rhythm and three have persistent atrial fibrillation. Twenty-four hours of Holter monitoring (n = 19) revealed normal sinus rhythm in all but three patients, with occasional atrial ectopics in one patient; four were lost to follow-op. Electrophysiological studies in seven consenting patients, 9 to 16 months following ASD closure showed normal atrial potentials from the site of the patch. Conclusions The autologous right atrial free wall is a safe patch material for ASD closure. Its advantages are that it is autologous, endothelialized, probably viable, and carries a low risk of thromboembolism. Studies with a larger number of patients with longer follow are needed to further confirm these findings.

AB  - Objectives Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS), is a chronic pain disorder with poorly understood pathophysiology. In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been recommended for pain relief in various chronic pain disorders. The objective of the present research was to study the effect of low frequency rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on pain status in FMS. Methods Ninety diagnosed cases of FMS were randomized into Sham-rTMS and Real-rTMS groups. Real rTMS (1 Hz/1200 pulses/8 trains/90% resting motor threshold) was delivered over the right DLPFC for 5 consecutive days/week for 4 weeks. Pain was assessed by subjective and objective methods along with oxidative stress markers. Patients were followed up for 6 months (post-rTMS;15 days, 3 months and 6 months). Results In Real-rTMS group, average pain ratings and associated symptoms showed significant improvement post rTMS. The beneficial effects of rTMS lasted up to 6 months in the follow-up phase. In Sham-rTMS group, no significant change in pain ratings was observed. Conclusion Right DLPFC rTMS can significantly reduce pain and associated symptoms of FMS probably through targeting spinal pain circuits and top-down pain modulation .

AB  - Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) comprises a group of disorders characterized by low capacity for net acid excretion and persistent hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, despite preserved glomerular filtration rate. RTA are classified into chiefly three types (1, 2 and 4) based on pathophysiology and clinical and laboratory characteristics. Most patients have primary RTA that presents in infancy with polyuria, growth retardation, rickets and/or hypotonia. Diagnosis requires careful evaluation, including exclusion of other entities that can cause acidosis. A variety of tests, administered stepwise, are useful for the diagnosis and characterization of RTA. A genetic or acquired basis can be determined in majority of patients through focused evaluation. Management involves correction of acidosis and dyselectrolytemia; patients with proximal RTA with Fanconi syndrome and rickets require additional supplements of phosphate and vitamin D.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that results in adverse functional and biochemical changes in the brain. Although normal ageing significantly affects the brain of a person structurally as well as functionally, the functional activation pattern in the brain of a schizophrenia patient may change differentially with age. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind fMRI-based study to find the functional changes in the brain of schizophrenia patients associated with ageing. In this study, we aim to compare the age-related variations in the functional activation pattern in the brain of schizophrenia patients vis a vis the healthy controls. For this study, we have used 1.5T fMRI data of 60 subjects and 3T fMRI data of 50 subjects, having an equal number of schizophrenia and healthy subjects. We have split this dataset into multiple age-groups. We applied a three-stage methodology comprising the application of the general linear model, followed by statistical hypothesis testing, and a finally bi-objective NSGA-II algorithm for selection of relevant voxels. The proposed methodology yielded a set of relevant voxels in the brain that demonstrate the age related variations in activation patterns. Specifically, it revealed increased functional activations in elderly patients suffering from schizophrenia in multiple brain regions, mostly located in areas like frontal lobe, temporal lobe and parietal lobe as compared to the young schizophrenic patients. These findings may help in making decisions for differential clinical management of younger patients as compared to the elderly ones.

AB  - Soft tissues are complex anisotropic composite systems comprising of multiple differently oriented layers of fiber embedded within a soft matrix. To date, soft tissues have been mainly characterized using simplified linear elastic material models, isotropic viscoelastic and hyperelastic models, and transversely isotropic models. In such models, the effect of fiber volume fraction (FVF), fiber orientation, and fiber-matrix interactions are missing, inhibiting accurate characterization of anisotropic tissue properties. The current work addresses this literature gap with the development of a novel soft composite based material framework to model tissue anisotropy. In this model, the fiber and matrix are considered as separate hyperelastic materials, and fiber-matrix interaction is modeled using multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. The effect of the individual contribution of the fibers and matrix are introduced into the numerical framework for a single soft composite layer, and fiber orientation effects are incorporated into the strain energy functions. Also, strain energy formulations are developed for multiple soft composite layers with varying fiber orientations and contributions, describing the biomechanical behavior of an entire anisotropic tissue block. Stress-strain relationships were derived from the strain energy equations for a uniaxial mechanical test condition. To validate the model parameters, experimental models of soft composites tested under uniaxial tension were characterized using the novel anisotropic hyperelastic model (R-2 = 0.983). To date, such a robust anisotropic hyperelastic composite framework has not been developed, which would be indispensable for experimental characterization of tissues and for improving the fidelity of computational biological models in future.

AB  - Introduction Traditional telepathology techniques like whole slide imaging require expensive equipment and are currently out of reach of the developing countries. However, the improvements in smartphone camera resolution and availability of faster internet have made smartphone-assisted telepathology possible. Methods A total of 186 cases pertaining to gynecologic pathology reported by single consultant (NT) were retrieved from the records of the histopathology department. A trained histopathologist then photographed representative areas of each case by using the smartphone camera. After a wash off period of 6 months, the images along with the clinical details were sent by Whatsapp Messenger to the same reporting pathologist. The reporting pathologist replied with the diagnosis of each case by using Whatsapp. Results The smartphone diagnosis was concordant in 179/186 (96.2%) cases. The intraobserver concordance rates varied with the organ involved - it was highest for endometrial and myometrial pathology (123/126, 97.6%) lowest for ovarian lesions (08/10, 80%). For cervical pathology, it was 97.2% (35/36) and for fallopian tube pathology it was 92.9% (13/14). Conclusion Although the initial results of this pilot study are encouraging, there is a long way to go before smartphone-assisted telepathology can be put to routine use for the second opinion. More experience of the pathologists with this technique and faster internet and better smartphone cameras will further improve the concordance of smartphone-assisted telepathology diagnosis with conventional microscopy diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major public health problem, affecting about one in every six pregnancies globally. The guidelines provided by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) on diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in pregnancy are widely followed. We aim to provide a critical appraisal of the recently published ADA guidance document, highlighting its strength and limitations with regard to the diagnosis of GDM. Methods and Results We reviewed the recent ADA recommendations for the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. A periodic update in keeping with the emerging evidence, an inclusive diagnostic approach which increases generalizability, and a clear proposed approach for prenatal testing and postpartum follow-up are strengths of the ADA guidance document. On the other hand, its limitations are a lack of clarity on the applicability of diagnosis of GDM during early pregnancy, use of scientifically inaccurate terms such as "prediabetes" in the context of pregnancy and "overt diabetes prior to gestation" in the definition of GDM, and inconsistent use of terminology between successive publications. Certain issues which merit attention in future publications include a need for uniform global definition of GDM, demarcation of overt diabetes in pregnancy as a distinct entity, clarity on the diagnosis of GDM during early pregnancy, and clear delineation of timelines and appropriate testing strategy for the first prenatal visit. Conclusions This article provides a critical appraisal of the recently published ADA guidance document with regard to the diagnosis of GDM. We also share our perspective on issues warranting attention in the future publications. Experts from various professional organizations should aim for a consensus document which can resolve existing controversies in this field, and help clinicians and researchers achieve better health for women in their care.

AB  - Background Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required to safely work with biological agents of bacterial (i.e.Mycobacterium tuberculosis)or viral origin (Ebola and SARS). COVID-19 pandemic especially has created unforeseen public health challenges including a global shortage of PPE needed for the safety of health care workers (HCWs). Although sufficient stocks of PPE are currently available, their critical shortage may develop soon due to increase in demand and depletion of existing supply lines. To empower our HCWs and ensure their continued protection, proactive measures are urgently required to develop procedures to safely decontaminate the PPEs to allow their "selective reuse" during contingency situations. Methods Herein, we have successfully developed a decontamination method based on vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). We have used a range of concentration of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect PPE (coveralls, face-shields, and N-95 masks). To ensure a proper disinfection, we have evaluated three biological indicators namelyEscherichia coli,Mycobacterium smegmatisand spores ofBacillus stearothermophilus, considered as the gold standard for disinfection processes. We next evaluated the impact of repeated VHP treatment on physical features, permeability, and fabric integrity of coveralls and N-95 masks. Next, we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate microscopic changes in fiber thickness of N-95 masks, melt blown layer or coverall body suits. Considering the fact that any disinfection procedure should be able to meet local requirements, our study included various regionally procured N-95 masks and coveralls available at our institute All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Lastly, the practical utility of VHP method developed herein was ascertained by operationalizing a dedicated research facility disinfecting used PPE during COVID-19. Results Our prototype studies show that a single VHP cycle (7-8% Hydrogen peroxide) could disinfect PPE and PPE housing room of about 1200 cubic feet (length10 ft x breadth 10 ft x height 12 ft) in less than 10 min, as noted by a complete loss ofB. stearothermophilusspore revival. The results are consistent and reproducible as tested in over 10 cycles in our settings. Further, repeated VHP treatment did not result in any physical tear, deformity or other appreciable change in the coverall and N-95 masks. Our permeation tests evaluating droplet penetration did not reveal any change in permeability post-VHP treatments. Also, SEM analysis indeed revealed no significant change in fiber thickness or damage to fibers of coveralls or melt blown layer of N-95 masks essential for filtration. There was no change in user comfort and experience following VHP treatment of PPE. Based on results of these studies, and parameters developed and optimized, an institutional research facility to disinfect COVID-19 PPE is successfully established and operationalized with more than 80% recovery rate for used PPE post-disinfection. Conclusions Our study, therefore, successfully establishes the utility of VHP to effectively disinfect PPE for a possible reuse as per the requirements. VHP treatment did not damage coveralls, cause physical deformity and also did not alter fabric architecture of melt blown layer. We observed that disinfection process was successful consistently and therefore believe that the VHP-based decontamination model will have a universal applicability and utility.
   This process can be easily and economically scaled up and can be instrumental in easing global PPE shortages in any biosafety facility or in health care settings during pandemic situation such as COVID-19.

AB  - Over the past two decades, our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been gleaned from the discoveries made in familial and/or sporadic forms of PD in the Caucasian population. The transferability and the clinical utility of genetic discoveries to other ethnically diverse populations are unknown. The Indian population has been under-represented in PD research. The Genetic Architecture of PD in India (GAP-India) project aims to develop one of the largest clinical/genomic bio-bank for PD in India. Specifically, GAP-India project aims to: (1) develop a pan-Indian deeply phenotyped clinical repository of Indian PD patients; (2) perform whole-genome sequencing in 500 PD samples to catalog Indian genetic variability and to develop an Indian PD map for the scientific community; (3) perform a genome-wide association study to identify novel loci for PD and (4) develop a user-friendly web-portal to disseminate results for the scientific community. Our "hub-spoke" model follows an integrative approach to develop a pan-Indian outreach to develop a comprehensive cohort for PD research in India. The alignment of standard operating procedures for recruiting patients and collecting biospecimens with international standards ensures harmonization of data/bio-specimen collection at the beginning and also ensures stringent quality control parameters for sample processing. Data sharing and protection policies follow the guidelines established by local and national authorities.We are currently in the recruitment phase targeting recruitment of 10,200 PD patients and 10,200 healthy volunteers by the end of 2020. GAP-India project after its completion will fill a critical gap that exists in PD research and will contribute a comprehensive genetic catalog of the Indian PD population to identify novel targets for PD.

AB  - The 143 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of the world constitute 80% of the world's population or roughly 5.86 billion people with much variation in geography, culture, literacy, financial resources, access to health care, insurance penetration, and healthcare regulation. Unfortunately, their burden of cardiovascular disease in general and acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in particular is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Compounding the problem, outcomes remain suboptimal because of a lack of awareness and a severe paucity of resources. Guideline-based treatment has dramatically improved the outcomes of STEMI in high-income countries. However, no such focused recommendations exist for LMICs, and the unique challenges in LMICs make directly implementing Western guidelines unfeasible. Thus, structured solutions tailored to their individual, local needs, and resources are a vital need. With this in mind, a multicountry collaboration of investigators interested in LMIC STEMI care have tried to create a consensus document that extracts transferable elements from Western guidelines and couples them with local realities gathered from expert experience. It outlines general operating principles for LMICs focused best practices and is intended to create the broad outlines of implementable, resource-appropriate paradigms for management of STEMI in LMICs. Although this document is focused primarily on governments and organizations involved with improvement in STEMI care in LMICs, it also provides some specific targeted information for the frontline clinicians to allow standardized care pathways and improved outcomes.

AB  - Anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs, while being highly potent in vitro, require prolonged treatment to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections in vivo. We report here that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) shelter Mtb to help tolerate anti-TB drugs. MSCs readily take up Mtb and allow unabated mycobacterial growth despite having a functional innate pathway of phagosome maturation. Unlike macrophage-resident ones, MSC-resident Mtb tolerates anti-TB drugs remarkably well, a phenomenon requiring proteins ABCC1, ABCG2 and vacuolar-type H(+)ATPases. Additionally, the classic pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN gamma and TNF alpha aid mycobacterial growth within MSCs. Mechanistically, evading drugs and inflammatory cytokines by MSC-resident Mtb is dependent on elevated PGE2 signaling, which we verify in vivo analyzing sorted CD45(-)Sca1(+)CD73(+)-MSCs from lungs of infected mice. Moreover, MSCs are observed in and around human tuberculosis granulomas, harboring Mtb bacilli. We therefore propose, targeting the unique immune-privileged niche, provided by MSCs to Mtb, can have a major impact on tuberculosis prevention and cure.

AB  - Background Growth factors are considered to play an important role in the process of bone healing. This study assessed serum levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients undergoing intramedullary nailing for isolated fracture of femur shaft operated at various time lag from injury. Patients and methods All patients between 18 and 60 years of age group operated for isolated femoral shaft fractures (AO/OTA32 A, B, C) were included. The serum levels of VEGF and TGF-beta 1 were compared at various intervals amongst the study group divided into two groups based on the time lag between injury and surgery along with a health control cohort. Results 31 patients were operated within the first 48 h while 28 patients were operated within 2-12 days after injury. Highest VEGF levels were observed on postop day 3, followed by a subsequent decline thereafter. TGF-beta 1 level also showed increasing trend after surgery, but the levels reached dual peaks after 2 weeks and 12 weeks after surgery. Both groups revealed similar trends of temporal expression of serum VEGF and TGF-beta 1. There was no statistical difference between the two groups at any point of time during the observation period. There was also no statistical difference in clinico-radiological healing of fractures among the groups. Conclusion There is a definite and specific trend of serum levels of growth factors in the fracture healing process. There is no effect of time lag from injury to surgery on the healing outcome of isolated femoral shaft fractures both at the molecular level and also at the clinical level.

AB  - Allylmethylsulfide (AMS) is a novel sulfur metabolite found in the garlic-fed serum of humans and animals. In the present study, we have observed that AMS is safe on chronic administration and has a potential antihypertrophic effect. Chronic administration of AMS for 30 days did not cause any significant differences in the body weight, electrocardiogram, food intake, serum biochemical parameters, and histopathology of vital organs. Single-dose pharmacokinetics of AMS suggests that AMS is rapidly metabolized into Allylmethylsulfoxide (AMSO) and Allylmethylsulfone (AMSO(2)). To evaluate the efficacy of AMS, cardiac hypertrophy was induced by subcutaneous implantation of ALZET (R) osmotic minipump containing isoproterenol (similar to 5 mg/kg/day), cotreated with AMS (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) and enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. AMS and enalapril significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy as studied by the heart weight to body weight ratio and mRNA expression of fetal genes (ANP and beta-MHC). We have observed that TBARS, a parameter of lipid peroxidation, was reduced and the antioxidant enzymes (glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) were improved in the AMS and enalapril-cotreated hypertrophic hearts. The extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9) were significantly upregulated in the diseased hearts; however, with the AMS and enalapril, it was preserved. Similarly, caspases 3, 7, and 9 were upregulated in hypertrophic hearts, and with the AMS and enalapril treatment, they were reduced. Further to corroborate this finding with in vitro data, we have checked the nuclear expression of caspase 3/7 in the H9c2 cells treated with isoproterenol and observed that AMS cotreatment reduced it significantly. Histopathological investigation of myocardium suggests AMS and enalapril treatment reduced fibrosis in hypertrophied hearts. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that AMS, an active metabolite of garlic, could reduce isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy by reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and stabilizing ECM components.

AB  - An anomalous common trunk giving rise to bilateral intercostal arteries at multiple levels is exceedingly rare and its association with spinal filar AVF and low-lying cord has not been reported so far. Here, we report this uncommon anatomical variation in a 60-year-old male who presented with paraplegia and on imaging found to have low-lying spinal cord with filar AVF and venous congestive myelopathy and discuss its embryological basis and associated malformations. Although rare, interventional radiologists should be aware of this entity, as these trunks may be a major source of bleeding in patients with hemoptysis, and also may be involved in vital spinal cord supply.

AB  - Background Mild Behavioural Impairment (MBI), an "at risk" state for incident cognitive declin, is characterized by late onset, sustained neuropsychiatric symptoms of any severity which cannot be accounted for by other formal medical and psychiatric nosology. There is no study related to MBI from India. Methods and findings In this cross-sectional observational study 124 subjects 60 years and above were recruited between March 2017 to October 2018, from memory clinic of department of Geriatric medicine with memory or behavioural complains. Subjects with major neurocognitive impairment (CDR score of 1 or more), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and impaired activities of daily living (ADL) were excluded. Subjects with Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) (CDR- 0.5), and Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (CDR- 0) were included. Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to identify the presence of NPS. The ISTAART-MBI (International Society of Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment-Alzheimer's Association) diagnostic criteria was used to diagnose MBI. All the participants underwent a geriatric assessment using standardised screening. The objectives of this study was to determine the frequency of mild behavioural impairment (MBI), and its domains, in MCI or SCI and its association with comorbidities and geriatric syndromes. The mean age of the participants was 69.21, 71.77% (89) were male and 28.23% (35) were female. 41.13% (51) of these individuals were diagnosed with MBI. The MBI and non MBI group differed significantly in marital status, cognitive status and MCI subtype. The proportion of domains involved are as follows: decreased motivation 60.78%(31), emotional dysregulation 54.90% (28), impulse dyscontrol 68.63% (35), social inappropriateness 21.57%(11), abnormal perception 2 (3.93%). Presence of multi-morbidity, and diabetes, were statistically significant between the groups. Conclusion This study presents the first clinic-based prevalence estimates of MBI from Asia. Findings indicate a relatively high prevalence of MBI in predementia clinical states, impulse dyscontrol was the most commonly involved MBI domain. Multimorbidity, diabetes, urinary incontinence were other determinants of MBI.

AB  - Stroke has a debilitating effect on the human body and a serious negative effect on society, with a global incidence of one in every six people. According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Motor and cognitive deficits like hemiparesis, paralysis, chronic pain, and psychomotor and behavioral symptoms can persist long term and prevent the patient from fully reintegrating into society, therefore continuing to add to the costly healthcare burden of stroke. Regenerative medicine using stem cells seems to be a panacea for sequelae after stroke. Stem cell-based therapy aids neuro-regeneration and neuroprotection for neurological recovery in patients. However, the use of stem cells as a therapy in stroke patients still needs a lot of research at both basic and translational levels. As well as the mode of action of stem cells in reversing the symptoms not being clear, there are several clinical parameters that need to be addressed before establishing stem cell therapy in stroke, such as the type of stem cells to be administered, the number of stem cells, the timing of dosage, whether dose-boosters are required, the route of administration, etc. There are upcoming prospects of cell-free therapy also by using exosomes derived from stem cells. There are several ongoing pre-clinical studies aiming to answer these questions. Despite still being in the development stage, stem cell therapy holds great potential for neurological rehabilitation in patients suffering from stroke.

AB  - A diabetic microenvironment primes neutrophils for NETosis, a process of formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that further degrades the neutrophils and makes them unavailable for the early-stage inflammatory processes. Mechanistically, simple modification of arginine residues of histones to citrulline by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD4) enzyme is considered to be a prerequisite for NETosis. In fact, under diabetic conditions, an increase in PAD4-mediated NET formation is considered as one of the reasons for impaired wound healing. Therefore, in the present work, an alginate-GelMa (generally recognized as safe category by FDA, USA) based hydrogel scaffold containing a tripeptide (Thr-Asp-F-amidine) that inhibits PAD4 is developed, based on the hypothesis that inhibiting PAD4 enzyme might offer a way to enhance wound healing under diabetic conditions. The scaffolds are thoroughly characterized for their physicochemical and biological properties. Furthermore, neutrophil-scaffold interactions in terms of NETosis ability and release of other related biomarkers are studied. The wound healing ability is evaluated by a cell migration assay. In vivo wound healing efficacy of the developed scaffolds is demonstrated using a diabetic rat model. The results suggest a reduction in NETosis in the presence of a PAD4 inhibitor. Thus, the study demonstrates a novel scaffold system to deliver the PAD4 inhibitor that can be used to modulate NETosis and improve wound healing.

AB  - High-grade neuroendocrine tumors (HGNET) have distinctive tumor biology/behaviour. Newer modalities of treatment (immunotherapy) for them have been included in recent NCCN guidelines. Detection of programmed death receptor-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry have made easy identification of patients eligible for immunotherapy. We aimed to ascertain expression of PD-L1 on small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of lung and review existing literature. Eighty-five cases of HGNET lung (primary/metastatic), were retrieved and reviewed. Immunostaining for PD-L1 using clone SP263 was done. Any amount/intensity of membranous staining of > = 1% tumor cells was cut-off for positivity. Previously published studies using Google and/Pubmed search engines were reviewed. Of 85 cases, 70 were small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), 11 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and 4 combined SCLC. Median age was 46.5 years with male preponderance. No PD-L1 expression was seen in 91.6% cases. The 7 positive cases were 4 LCNEC, 2 SCLC and 1 combined SCLC. The percentage positivity varied from 1-100%; lower percentage positivity was seen in SCLC. PD-L1 expression on immune cells was seen in 31.3% cases. Sixteen studies evaluating 1992 NET were found; E1L3N PD-L1 clone was commonly used clone. PD-L1 positivity was associated with better prognosis in most studies. There are only a few studies available in literature related to PDL1 expression in high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of lung. In general, PD-L1 positivity is highly variable and seen in lower percentage of these tumors. With the recent approval of immunotherapy, biomarkers other than PD-L1 should also be investigated in these tumors.

AB  - The current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is known to cause severe infection (COVID-19) in patients with comorbidities, particularly cancer or an immunosuppressed state. Most healthcare systems in the country are likely to be overwhelmed soon if the pandemic moves to a stage of community transmission. Currently, limited evidence is available for managing patients with hematological disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current review summarises the possible challenges clinicians are likely to face, key considerations to guide decision making, and possible solutions to the anticipated challenges. Disease specific recommendations and possible guidance for decision making have been suggested for most hematologic diseases that are feasible in our health setup. It is not meant to replace individual clinical judgment, but to provide a template to formulate local policies.

AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder, occurs due to mutations in CFTR gene resulting in impaired cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel function in various epithelia. In addition to the well-known pulmonary and pancreatic morbidities, CF is characterized by electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities- hypochloremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. These are collectively known as Pseudo-Bartter syndrome, as similar abnormalities are seen in Bartter syndrome- an inherited tubulopathy affecting thick ascending limb of loop of Henle. There may be a significant clinical overlap between the Classic Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome and CF presenting as Pseudo-Bartter syndrome, especially in early childhood. This review focuses on Pseudo-Bartter syndrome in CF, its pathogenesis and differentiation from Bartter/Gitelman syndrome. Other causes of metabolic abnormalities resembling Bartter syndrome are also highlighted.

AB  - Aim The aim of this article is to understand the pros and cons of various methods involved in first-in-human (FIH) dose calculation and act decisively in dose escalations when calculating the maximum tolerated dose. Subjects and methods We reviewed early phase clinical trials for methods of FIH dose and dose-escalation steps and discuss them in line with existing guidelines. We also reviewed the clinical trial registry to recognize trends in trial registration in recent years and after a massive failure in a few trials. Results Phase 1 trials of TGN 1412 and BIA10-2474 would always be remembered as catastrophes for pharmaceutical development plans. Quite often than not, healthy human volunteers are the guinea pigs in this stage of drug development. And, the most important aspect of designing an early phase study is deciding upon the dose to be started with, apart from the selection of cohort and escalation steps. The common principles used for FIH dose calculation include no observed adverse effect level, minimum anticipated biological effect level, pharmacologically active dose, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach, and similar drug comparison approach. Conclusion Early phase clinical trials are basically foundation stones on which lies the entire onus of the later stages of development. Deciding FIH dose is a crucial step that necessitates the incorporation of detailed data from the preclinical stages and application of the most conservative approach for the safety/benefit of the volunteers in these studies.

AB  - Efficacy and outcomes of osteosynthesis depend on various factors including types of injury and repair, host factors, characteristics of implant materials and type of implantation. One of the most important host factors appears to be the extent of bone damage due to the mechanical force and thermal injury which are produced at cutting site during bone drilling. The temperature above the critical temperature (47 degrees C) produces thermal osteonecrosis in the bones. In the present work, experimental investigations were performed to determine the effect of drilling parameters (rotational speed, feed rate and drill diameter) and techniques (conventional surgical bone drilling and rotary ultrasonic bone drilling) on cutting force and temperature generated during bone drilling. The drilling experiments were performed by a newly developed bone drilling machine on different types of human bones (femur, tibia and fibula) having different biological structure and mechanical behaviour. The bone samples were procured from male cadavers with the age of second to fourth decades. The results revealed that there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in cutting force and temperature rise for rotary ultrasonic bone drilling and conventional surgical bone drilling. The cutting force obtained in rotary ultrasonic bone drilling was 30%-40%, whereas temperature generated was 50%-55% lesser than conventional surgical bone drilling process for drilling in all types of bones. It was also found that the cutting force increased with increasing feed rate, drill diameter and decrease in rotational speed, whereas increasing rotational speed, drill diameter and feed rate resulted in higher heat generation during bone drilling. Both the techniques revealed that the axial cutting force and the temperature rise were significantly higher in femur and tibia compared with the fibula for all combinations of process parameters.

AB  - Rheumatic heart disease (RHD), an autoinflammatory heart disease, was recently declared a global health priority by the World Health Organization. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of RHD susceptibility in 1,163 South Asians (672 cases; 491 controls) recruited in India and Fiji. We analysed directly obtained and imputed genotypes, and followed-up associated loci in 1,459 Europeans (150 cases; 1,309 controls) from the UK Biobank study. We identify a novel susceptibility signal in the class III region of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex in the South Asian dataset that clearly replicates in the Europeans (rs201026476; combined odds ratio 1.81, 95% confidence intervals 1.51-2.18, P=3.48x10(-10)). Importantly, this signal remains despite conditioning on the lead class I and class II variants (P=0.00033). These findings suggest the class III region is a key determinant of RHD susceptibility offering important new insight into pathogenesis while partly explaining the inconsistency of earlier reports.

AB  - Indigenous food systems of traditional communities are potentially sustainable, have nutrient rich food sources and can enhance dietary diversity. Sauria Paharias, are one of the particularly vulnerable tribal groups of Jharkhand India, who despite residing in rich biodiverse environment and possessing traditional ecological knowledge, lag behind various health, and nutritional indicators. Our study explored their traditional ecological knowledge around indigenous foods (IFs), their routine consumption, access, and nutritive values. A cross-sectional mixed methods study was carried out in 18 villages of Godda district, Jharkhand. Free list of all IFs known to the community was developed using focus group discussions. This was followed by enumerating commonly consumed as well as little or historically used IFs. Following the taxonomic classification of these foods, their nutritive values were searched in literature or food samples were analyzed in accredited laboratories. Reasons for consumption and non-consumption of specific IFs were explored. The community was aware of a large number of IFs (n= 193) but only 50% of these were routinely consumed. Rest were either little used or historically consumed. About 47.6% IFs (n= 92) were identified using taxonomic classification; of which 87 IFs were classified based on their common names in secondary literature and five food items were collected, herbariums were prepared and identified. Nutritive values were documented for 84 IFs (this included both routinely consumed as well as little used); out of which 55 foods were found to have nutritive values in existing literature and 29 foods were analyzed in laboratory. Many of these IFs were rich in micronutrients like calcium, iron, zinc, folic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Common reasons for preferences or non-consumption of specific IFs included taste, availability, access seasonality, opportunity cost of access and processing time. Promoting adequate intake of commonly accessed nutrient rich IFs and revival of little used IFs while addressing the causes of non-consumption and mainstreaming them into the daily diets could be an effective strategy to increase the intake of micronutrients. Policies focusing on incorporation of nutrient rich IFs into dietary diversification strategies and ongoing supplementary feeding programs can help address malnutrition in the community.

AB  - Aging influences the susceptibility and prognosis to various infectious diseases including tuberculosis (TB). Despite the impairment of T-cell function and immunity in older individuals, the mechanism for the higher incidence of TB in the elderly remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the age-associated immune alterations, particularly in effector and Treg responses in pulmonary TB patients. We also evaluated the impact of redox status and its modulation with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in elderly TB. Higher frequency of Treg cells and reduced IFN-gamma positive T cells were observed among older TB patients. The elevated number of Treg cells correlated tightly with bacillary load (i.e. disease severity); which declined significantly in response to successful anti-tubercular treatment. We could rescue Myobacterium tuberculosis-specific effector T cell (Th1) responses through various in vitro approaches, for example, Treg cell depletion and co-culture experiments, blocking experiments using antibodies against IL-10, TGF-beta, and programmed death-1 (PD-1) as well as NAC supplementation. We report old age-associated enrichment of Treg cells and suppression of M. tuberculosis-specific effector T (Th1) cell immune responses. Monitoring these immune imbalances in older patients may assist in immune potentiation through selectively targeting Treg cells and/or optimizing redox status by NAC supplementation.

AB  - Introduction Anterior Intrapelvic (AIP) approach has emerged, in the last two decades, as a promising approach for fixation of anterior acetabular fractures. This prospective study was conducted to analyze our results with this approach and suggest the indications for its rationale usages in a developing country. Materials and Methods All patients with acetabular fractures, which required anterior fixation, were operated by AIP approach and prospectively evaluated between October 2013 and January 2018. Mechanism of injury, fracture type, operative time, blood loss, complications, radiographic, and functional outcomes were analyzed in all patients. Modified Merle D'Aubigne system was used for clinical grading, while Matta's grading was utilized for radiographic outcome. Results Fifty eight [90.62%] patients out of the total 64 patients had good to excellent outcome on functional and radiographic results. About 93.75% patients were able to resume pre-injury activities including socially demanding tasks like ability to sit cross legged and squat. Patients operated early had better articular reductions as compared to those operated late. Conclusions This approach can be considered as a safe, effective and feasible alternative to traditional ilioinguinal approach for acetabulum fractures which require anterior approach. Cases which present late may have difficulty through this approach as scarring or granulation tissue may lead to inadequate visualization.

AB  - When the same type of event is experienced by a subject more than once it is called recurrent event, which possess two important characteristics, namely "within-subject correlation" and "time-varying covariate." As a result, the traditional statistical methods do not work well on recurrent event data. Over the past few decades, many alternatives methods have been proposed for the analysis of recurrent event data. In this article, the six most prominent methods for recurrent event analysis have been compared on pediatric asthma data. Three variance corrected models (viz "Anderson and Gill [AG] model," "Prentice, William, and Peterson-Counting Process [PWP-CP] model," and "Prentice, William, and Peterson-Gap Time [PWP-GT] model") and three corresponding frailty variants (AG-frailty, PWP-CP-frailty, and PWP-GT-frailty) were compared using three mathematical criterion (AIC, BIC, and log-likelihood) and one graphical criteria (Cox-Snell goodness of fit, visual test). All model comparison indices showed the PWP-GT model as the most appropriate model on asthma data over other models. By using PWP-GT model, seven predictors of asthma exacerbation (viz "abdominal pain at previous visit," "Z5 (%) at previous visit," "diagnosis of asthma at previous visit," "calendar month of exacerbation," "history of maternal asthma," "monthly per capita income," and "emotional stress") were identified. The PWP-GT model was identified as the most appropriate model over other models on pediatrics asthma data.

AB  - Background: There is paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of facemask use in COVID-19 in community settings. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of facemask use alone or along with hand hygiene in community settings in reducing the transmission of viral respiratory illness. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials on facemask use in community settings to prevent viral respiratory illnesses published up to April 25, 2020. Two independent reviewers were involved in synthesis of data. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were done in a standard format from the selected studies. Outcome data for clinically diagnosed or self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) was recorded from individual studies. Pooled effect size was estimated by random-effects model for "facemask only versus control" and "facemask plus hand hygiene versus control." Results: Of the 465 studies from PubMed and 437 studies from Embase identified from our search, 9 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 8 studies in quantitative synthesis. Risk of bias was assessed as low (n = 4), medium (n = 3), or high (n = 1) risk. Interventions included using a triple-layered mask alone or in combination with hand hygiene. Publication bias was not significant. There was no significant reduction in ILI either with facemask alone (n = 5, pooled effect size: -0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.43-0.10; P = 0.23; I2 = 10.9%) or facemask with handwash (n = 6, pooled effect size: (n=6, pooled effect size: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.58 to 0.40; P = 0.71, I2 = 69.4%). Conclusion: Existing data pooled from randomized controlled trials do not reveal a reduction in occurrence of ILI with the use of facemask alone in community settings.

AB  - Oculoplastic surgeries encompass both emergency surgeries for traumatic conditions and infectious disorders as well as elective aesthetic procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a drastic change in this practice. Given the highly infectious nature of the disease as well as the global scarcity of medical resources; it is only prudent to treat only emergent conditions during the pandemic as we incorporate evidence-based screening and protective measures into our practices. This manuscript is a compilation of evidence-based guidelines for surgical procedures that oculoplastic surgeons can employ during the COVID-19 pandemic. These guidelines also serve as the basic framework upon which further recommendations may be based on in the future, as elective surgeries start being performed on a regular basis.

AB  - Background: The uncertainty about the impact of the lockdown in wake of COVID-19 on their future academic and carrier prospects, besides other concerns; makes college students, particularly vulnerable to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaming has been recognized as a coping mechanism against stress in the previously published literature. Objectives: The current study aimed to assess the gaming behavior of college students during the lockdown following COVID-19. Methods: Data were collected from a cohort of students that constituted the sampling frame of an ongoing project. A total of 393 college students were enrolled. All the eligible students were subsequently contacted through E-mail and WhatsApp messenger and invited to share the details. Results: About half (50.8%) of the participants reported that their gaming behavior had increased, whereas 14.6% reported a decrease in their gaming during the lockdown period. In binary logistic regression analysis, hours of gaming per day (odds ratio [OR] 1.75 [1.29-2.36]), increase in gaming due to examination related stress (OR 4.96 [1.12-21.98]), and belief that gaming helps managing stress (OR 4.27 [1.65-11.04]), were found to be independently associated with gaming behavior during lockdown period.Conclusion: In the lockdown period following COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in gaming behavior was associated with examination-related stress and the belief that gaming helps combat stress. These observations highlight the need to focus on the coping style of the students to ascertain the likelihood of them engaging in gaming behavior as a coping mechanism against stress.

AB  - Background The clinical and epidemiological significance of HIV-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis bloodstream infection (BSI) is incompletely understood. We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI.
   Methods We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022.
   Findings We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 96.2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per mu L (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38-52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63-87), increasing to 89% (80-94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio2.48, 95% CI 2.05-3.08) but not after 30 days (1.25, 0.84-2.49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 3.15, 95% CI 1.16-8.84).
   Interpretation In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients.

AB  - Background
   Vimentin is an intermediate-sized filament which is highly expressed in mesenchymal cells and is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT markers ZEB2 and Slug lead to Vimentin overexpression and E-cadherin loss, resulting in invasion and metastasis. However, the status of Vimentin remains unexplored in eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC). The study aims to determine status of Vimentin in SGC and its association with EMT markers E-cadherin, ZEB2 and Slug.
   Methods
   Vimentin protein expression was undertaken in 66 cases with SGC by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was determined in 42 fresh tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. Association of Vimentin with E-cadherin, ZEB2 and Slug was also analysed. Patients were followed up for 17-69 months (mean 34.02 +/- 14.73 months).
   Results
   IHC revealed Vimentin overexpression in 37/66 (56%) cases. This overexpression showed significant association with lymph node metastasis (p=0.004) and pagetoid spread (p=0.05). Patients with high Vimentin expression also had poor disease-free survival (p=0.033). Univariate Cox regression model indicated that high Vimentin expression (p=0.043) and advanced tumour stage (p=0.002) were independent adverse prognostic factors. High Vimentin mRNA expression was seen in 16/42 (38%) cases and correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis (p=0.027), advanced tumour stage (p=0.002) and large tumour size (p=0.023). Vimentin expression overall showed a significant inverse association with E-cadherin and direct association with ZEB2 expression.
   Conclusions
   Vimentin overexpression in SGC is associated with EMT and leads to poor clinical outcome. It also emerged as a novel predictor for lymph node metastasis and poor survival.

AB  - Background/Aims Lacerations of the oral mucosa and fractures of alveolar processes commonly occur in traumatic dental injuries (TDIs). Impaired wound healing and tissue regeneration have severe consequences on the quality of life. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) possess the ability of self-renewal and multipotential differentiation. Treatment with low-level sodium fluoride (NaF) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance wound repair. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of low-level NaF on soft tissue healing and on the proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix synthesis of BMMSCs.
   Material and Methods BMMSCs derived from mice were treated with 50 mu M, 500 mu M, or 5 mM NaF for 12, 24, and 48 hours, and cell proliferation was assessed by the MTS assay. Cell motility was detected at 12 and 24 hours by a wound healing assay, and osteoblastic differentiation for 21 days by 1% Alizarin Red S staining in 50 mu M NaF-treated BMMSCs. Gene expression of Runx2 and Osteocalcin was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. An experimental rat skin wound model was employed, and levels of c-Myc, Ki67, fibronectin, and vimentin were assessed by immunohistochemistry.
   Results There was a significant induction in the proliferation and migration of BMMSCs treated with 50 mu M NaF. The expression of Ki67 and c-Myc protein was increased in tissues treated with 50 mu M NaF, and the expression of fibronectin and vimentin in the 50 mu M NaF-treated tissues was stimulated. Alizarin Red staining revealed enhanced mineralization in 50 mu M NaF-treated BMMSCs with increased expression of Runx2 and Osteocalcin, indicating their upregulated osteogenic differentiation.
   Conclusion Low-level NaF could promote soft tissue healing and hard tissue regeneration.

AB  - Aim
   To classify unrelated patients with juvenile onset primary open angle glaucoma (JOAG) into clinically useful phenotypes using cluster analysis.
   Methods
   Out of the 527 unrelated patients with JOAG, the study included 414 patients who had all the phenotypic characteristics required for the study. A cluster analysis was performed to classify the patients based on their iris and angle morphology, age of onset, highest untreated intraocular pressure (IOP), worst mean deviation and greatest vertical cup disc ratio of the worst eye. The iris features were broadly classified into three groups: those with normal iris crypts (NIC), those with prominent iris crypts (PIC) and those with absence of iris crypts. The gonio photographs were graded as normal appearing angle or those with angle dysgenesis in the form of a featureless angle, one with a high iris insertion and an angle with prominent iris processes. Using a hierarchical clustering model and a two-way cluster analysis, the distribution of clusters of JOAG was analysed to obtain a classification of JOAG subtypes.
   Results
   The four major clusters identified were: Cluster 1 with NIC and normal angles had the lowest untreated IOP and higher age of onset among all clusters. Cluster 2 with NIC and featureless angle was found to be associated with earliest age of onset. Cluster 3 had NIC and either a high iris insertion or prominent iris processes. Cluster 4 was a heterogeneous cluster with maximum number of patients in a group comprising of those with PIC and high iris insertion.
   Conclusions
   Cluster analysis extracted four subgroups of the JOAG phenotype that have clinical and prognostic significance and can potentially be helpful while evaluating these patients in the clinics.

AB  - Author summary Dengue virus (DENV) infection is an increasingly significant threat to global health, with a yearly estimate of 390 million infections and an expected increasing burden with the rise of climate change and globalization. DENV is caused by one of the four serotypes (DENV-1-4), each of which have been associated with different immune responses and clinical manifestations. We developed a method to detect DENV serotypes by targeting the nonstructural 1 (NS1) antigen through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate that our high throughput mouse-derived antibody screening method selected for optimal test performance. The antibodies were integrated into an ELISA assay that can distinguish between the four different dengue serotypes by serotype-specific pairing. In addition, we provide a dengue universal antibody combination that enables pan-virus detection independently of the serotype. We use the ELISA in three different countries and calculate overall and site-specific sensitivities and specificities. The assay performs optimally when levels of viremia are high during the first five days of fever.
   Background Dengue virus (DENV) infections pose one of the largest global barriers to human health. The four serotypes (DENV 1-4) present different symptoms and influence immune response to subsequent DENV infections, rendering surveillance, risk assessments, and disease control particularly challenging. Early diagnosis and appropriate clinical management is critical and can be achieved by detecting DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) in serum during the acute phase. However, few NS1-based tests have been developed that are capable of differentiating DENV serotypes and none are currently commercially available. Methodology/Principle findings We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to distinguish DENV-1-4 NS1 using serotype-specific pairs of monoclonal antibodies. A total of 1,046 antibodies were harvested from DENV-immunized mice and screened for antigen binding affinity. ELISA clinical performance was evaluated using 408 polymerase chain reaction-confirmed dengue samples obtained from patients in Brazil, Honduras, and India. The overall sensitivity of the test for pan-DENV was 79.66% (325/408), and the sensitivities for DENV-1-4 serotyping were 79.1% (38/48), 80.41% (78/97), 100% (45/45), and 79.6% (98/123), respectively. Specificity reached 94.07-100%. Significance Our study demonstrates a robust antibody screening strategy that enabled the development of a serotype NS1-based ELISA with maximized specific and sensitive antigen binding. This sensitive and specific assay also utilized the most expansive cohort to date, and of which about half are from Latin America, a geographic region severely underrepresented in previous similar studies. This ELISA test offers potential enhanced diagnostics during the acute phase of infection to help guide patient care and disease control. These results indicate that this ELISA is a promising aid in early DENV-1-4 diagnosis and surveillance in regions of endemicity in addition to offer convenient monitoring for future vaccine interventions.

AB  - Justification During the current rapidly evolving pandemic of COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants form a special vulnerable group that needs immediate attention. Unlike other elective medical and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths continue. Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. Process The GRADE approach recommended by the World Health Organization was used to develop the guideline. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted. The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care. An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize. Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed. For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles. The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations. Objectives To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. Recommendations A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal care; 3) prevention and infection control; 4) diagnosis; 5) general questions.

AB  - Objective: To compare photoreceptor cone characteristics using adaptive optics (AO) technology between congenital colour blind patients and healthy age-matched controls.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Participants: 21 eyes (21 cases) with congenital red-green colour blindness and 21 eyes of age-matched controls (21 controls), all having a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 and normal ophthalmological examination, were recruited.
   Methods: Colour vision testing was done using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test and Nagel anomaloscope. Imaging of fovea was done using rtx1 AO retinal camera with a sampling window size of 4 degrees x 4 degrees. Peak cone density, intercone spacing, cone regularity, and cone dispersion were determined using AOdetect Mosaic software.
   Results: Overall, mean cone characteristics at 2 degrees off fixation in cases and controls, respectively, were density 26 587 +/- 1328/26 448 +/- 687 cells/mm(2) (p = 0.67), spacing 6.69 +/- 0.17/6.75 +/- 0.11 mm (p = 0.19), regularity 94.36 +/- 2.56/94.83 +/- 1.28% (p = 0.46), dispersion 10.22 +/- 1.21/11.68 +/- 0.79% (p = 0.0001), and hexagonality 50.62 +/- 4.21/49.52 +/- 2.45% (p = 0.31). No significant difference was noted in various cone metrics except dispersion, which was markedly decreased in colour-deficient individuals. At 4 degrees off fixation, the cone characteristics were not significantly different between cases and controls: density 16 521 +/- 1230/16 930 +/- 678 cells/mm(2) (p = 0.37), spacing 8.60 +/- 0.29/8.46 +/- 0.17 mm (p = 0.19), regularity 92.68 +/- 2.83/92.6 +/- 3.05% (p = 0.95), dispersion 13.43 +/- 3.48/13.65 +/- 2.38% (p = 0.87), and hexagonality 45.22 +/- 3.8/45.21 +/- 5.5% (p = 0.99). A significant reduction in cone density, regularity, and hexagonality was associated with corresponding increase in spacing and dispersion as we moved from 2 degrees to 4 degrees off fixation in both cases and controls.
   Conclusion: Cone photoreceptor characteristics are anatomically well preserved in young colour-deficient individuals except cone dispersion.

AB  - Background: The development of various targeted therapies against Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has been a major step in therapeutic advancements in lung cancer. However, the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy in a real-world setting has not been well elucidated.
   Methods: As part of a retrospective analysis, patients with EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer at 4 tertiary care Institutions in North India between December 2007 and August 2018 were evaluated. The overall response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and factors affecting PFS were analyzed.
   Results: A total of 483 patients were included, including 52.4% males, with mean (+/- SD) age of 56.7 (+/- 12.4) years. Majority (63.8%) had good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 or 1) and 77.4% were nonsmokers. Among the EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletion was the most common mutation detected (68.1%), followed by L858R mutation in exon 21 (26.9%). Extra-thoracic metastasis was present in 69.5% patients and majority of them had <= 2 metastatic sites (85.1%). TKIs were used as the first-line therapy in 64.8% patients, and gefitinib was the most frequently used TKI (67.3%), followed by erlotinib (26.7%). The overall response rate and disease control rate were 65.9% and 90.7% respectively. The median PFS was 9.3 months and brain was the exclusive site of progression in 18.0% patients. On univariate analysis, the factors that significantly affected PFS were, the number of metastatic sites and the type of EGFR mutation. On multivariate analysis, the number of metastatic sites was the only factor that affected the PFS [HR (95% CI): 2.5 (1.7-3.6); Pvalue <0.001]. Skin toxicity was the most common adverse event (32.3%), followed by involvement of the gastro-intestinal tract (22.5%). Conclusion: In this one of the largest multicentric Indian study of treatment outcomes in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer in a real-world setting, we found that increased tumor burden (number of metastatic sites > 2) was the only significant factor associated with a worse PFS.

AB  - Objectives Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide with limited therapeutic interventions. The current study explored proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR)-based metabolomic approach to elucidate the effect of lercanidipine on neurometabolic alterations in transient model of ischaemic stroke in rats.
   Methods In the present investigation, male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 2 h followed by reperfusion using intraluminal filament method. Rats were randomly divided into three groups as vehicle-treated sham control, vehicle-treated MCAo control and lercanidipine-treated MCAo. Vehicle or lercanidipine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 120 min post-reperfusion. The rat brain cortex tissues were isolated 24 h post-MCAo and were investigated by H-1 NMR spectroscopy through perchloric extraction method.
   Key findings A total of 23 metabolites were altered significantly after cerebral ischaemic-reperfusion injury in MCAo control as compared to sham control rats. Lercanidipine significantly reduced the levels of valine, alanine, lactate, acetate and tyrosine, while N-acetylaspartate, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, creatine/phosphocreatine, choline, glycerophosphorylcholine, taurine, myo-inositol and adenosine di-phosphate were elevated as compared to MCAo control.
   Conclusions Present study illustrates effect of lercanidipine on neurometabolic alterations which might be mediated through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory and anti-apoptotic property in MCAo model of stroke.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Diagnosis of Parkinson's with higher accuracy is always desirable to slow down the progression of the disease and improved quality of life. There are evidences of inherent neurological differences between male and females as well as between elderly and adults. However, the potential of such gender and age infomration have not been exploited yet for Parkinson's identification.
   Methods: In this paper, we develop a sex-specific and age-dependent classification method to diagnose the Parkinson's disease using the online handwriting recorded from individuals with Parkinson's (n = 37; m/f-19/18;age-69.3 +/- 10.9yrs) and healthy controls (n = 38; m/f-20/18;age-62.4 +/- 11.3yrs). A support vector machine ranking method is used to present the features specific to their dominance in sex and age group for Parkinson's diagnosis.
   Results: The sex-specific and age-dependent classifier was observed significantly outperforming the generalized classifier. An improved accuracy of 83.75% (SD = 1.63) with the female-specific classifier, and 79.55% (SD = 1.58) with the old-age dependent classifier was observed in comparison to 75.76% (SD = 1.17) accuracy with the generalized classifier.
   Conclusions: Combining the age and sex information proved to be encouraging in classification. A distinct set of features were observed to be dominating for higher classification accuracy in a different category of classification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges to the health care community. Many of the super-speciality practices are planning to re-open after the lockdown is lifted. However there is lot of apprehension in everyone's mind about conforming practices that would safeguard the patients, ophthalmologists, healthcare workers as well as taking adequate care of the equipment to minimize the damage. The aim of this article is to develop preferred practice patterns, by developing a consensus amongst the lead experts, that would help the institutes as well as individual vitreo-retina and uveitis experts to restart their practices with confidence. As the situation remains volatile, we would like to mention that these suggestions are evolving and likely to change as our understanding and experience gets better. Further, the suggestions are for routine patients as COVID-19 positive patients may be managed in designated hospitals as per local protocols. Also these suggestions have to be implemented keeping in compliance with local rules and regulations.

AB  - Fluoropemvskites are an important class of thermoluminescence (TL)/optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) materials known for their high sensitivity and other good characteristics particularly when doped with a suitable impurity. Fluoroperovskites have not yet been explored for heavy charged particle irradiation like carbon which is commonly used for cancer treatment. In the current work, TL and OSL properties of 85 MeV carbon ion beam irradiated NaMgF3:Tb samples have been investigated in detail at different fluences. Undoped and Tb3+ (0.5 mol %) doped NaMgF3 samples have been synthesized by the melting method. The formation of the material is confirmed using the XRD technique. The crystallite size of undoped and Tb3+ doped NaMgF3 samples are estimated to be 100 nm and 89 nm respectively. TL studies reveal that undoped NaMgF3 shows a well-isolated TL glow peak centered at 412 K while Tb3+ doped NaMgF3 shows more intense TL glow peak at 416 K with a small shoulder peak at 481 K along with a new peak at 647 K. Further, TL glow curves have been analyzed for 85 MeV carbon ion irradiated samples of NaMgF3 for low fluences (1 x 10(5 )1 x 10(7) ions/cm(2)) and high fluences (2 x 10(9)-5 x 10(12) ions/cm(2)) to study the dose-response. CW-OSL decay curves of 85 MeV carbon ion irradiated undoped and Tb3+ doped NaMgF3 samples show high OSL intensity under blue light stimulation. The OSL doseresponse has been recorded at high (1 x 10(8)-1 x 10(10) ions/cm(2)) and low (1 x 10(5)-1 x 10(2) ions/cm(2)) fluences. Linear TL and OSL behaviour in the range 1 x 10(8)-5 x 10(6) ions/cm(2) has been observed. Also, other properties like batch homogeneity and fading studies have been carried out. The related TL/OSL kinetic parameters were determined. Analysis of TL/OSL properties of NaMgF3:Tb suggests that it exhibits appropriate properties for carbon ion beam dosimetry for its utilization in medical applications.

AB  - Introduction Delayed cortical transit time (CTT) has been recently studied and proposed as a parameter that can predict the need for surgery in children with pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUJO). Aim The aim of this study was to study the change in CTT, after surgery, in children with PUJO and to correlate CTT with intrapelvic pressure of the kidney. Material and methods A prospective study was performed, and all children who underwent pyeloplasty from January 2016 to December 2017 were included. Pre-operative and postoperative renal ultrasonography and Technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycerine Tc-MAG3 renal scintigraphy were performed. Cortical transit time was measured by a visual method by two different observers. The renal intrapelvic pressure of the kidney was also measured during surgery after giving a diuretic to replicate the diuresis induced during the renal scan. The correlation was studied between the pre-operative CTT and intrapelvic pressures and between the pre-operative CTT and the renal function of the affected kidney. Results Thirty-one children were included in the study. The median age of children who underwent surgery was 50 months (2-168). In 71% of patients, the CTT was prolonged before surgery, whereas only 22.5% had delayed CTT after surgery. The mean CTT before surgery was 226.1 +/- 74.8 s and decreased to 165.4 +/- 55.9 s after surgery (p= <0.001). The mean intrapelvic pressure was 21 +/- 7.5 cm H2O. There was no correlation noted between the intrapelvic pressure and the CTT. A significant negative correlation was noted between the CTT and the different renal function of the kidney. Discussion This is the first prospective study that studies the changes in CTT after surgery. Only retrospective studies had been conducted to date which concluded that CTT was delayed in most of the patients who had been operated. It has been proposed that the prolonged CTT is due to raised pressure in the kidney secondary to obstruction. This study did not find any correlation between the pressure and CTT. The significant negative correlation between CTT and renal function also emphasizes the need to take the renal function into consideration before interpreting and using the absolute value of CTT for guiding treatment. Conclusion Cortical transit time assessment by the visual method is a useful parameter in the management of children with PUJO. There is a significant improvement in CTT after surgery.

AB  - Background: Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is recommended as the standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its benefit is limited to patients with performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. However, it is not clear whether these benefits apply to patients with poor performance status (PS 2 and above) and there are no predictors of outcome to suggest whom to treat. The patients with poor performance status (PS 2 and above) accounts for a significant portion (up to 30%) of patients of our practice. In this retrospective analysis, we have analyzed our experience of chemotherapy in patients with poor performance status. Method: A retrospective analysis of patients of advanced NSCLC with poor PS (ECOG PS 2 or more), treated with chemotherapy from October, 2016 to June, 2018 was done. Patients with driver mutations who were treated with first line tyrosine kinase inhibitors were excluded. Hospital case records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details, and outcome data. Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn to estimate progression free survival. Log-rank test was used to assess factors affecting survival. Data was analyzed using STATA ver 11 (StataCorp. 2009. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). P value <0.05 was taken as significant. Result: A total of 96 patients were included in the analysis. The median age of the patients was 62 years (range 30-84 years). Majority (67.7%) was males and 65% patients were smokers (current or former). Patients with ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status) of 2 constituted 64.5% of this cohort and 34 patients (33.5%) had an ECOG PS of 3 or 4. The most common chemotherapy regimen used was combination of weekly paclitaxel (60 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC2) in 57.8%. Most patients (64%) could complete 4 or more cycles of chemotherapy, however, 15 patients (15.7%) could receive only 1 cycle. Grade 3/4 toxicities were observed in 22 (23%) % patients, which were hematological in most cases (anemia and thrombocytopenia). At least one point improvement in ECOG PS from baseline during chemotherapy was observed in 43 patients (45%) after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Objective response and disease control rates were 20% and 48.42%, respectively. After a median follows-up of 11.2 months, median progression free survival was 6.3 months (95% confidence interval 5-10.63). On univariate analysis, we found that male sex and use of weekly paclitaxel-carboplatin were associated with better progression-free survival PFS. Conclusion: Systemic chemotherapy in modified doses and schedules in advanced NSCLC patients with PS 2 and above is feasible and may be associated with better symptom palliation with clinical benefit and improved survival.

AB  - Purpose: The costochondral graft (CCG) is considered the reference standard for pediatric temporomandibular joint reconstruction. It has the disadvantages of unpredictable growth, donor site morbidity, and the need for intermaxillary fixation. It has been reported that transport disk distraction osteogenesis (TDDO) can result in the formation of a neocondyle and disc. We performed a randomized trial to measure and compare clinically relevant outcomes of ramus-condyle unit (RCU) reconstruction using CCG and TDDO for pediatric temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA).
   Materials and Methods: In the present randomized controlled trial (block randomization with a variable block size), pediatric patients with unilateral, nonrecurrent TMJA aged 3 to 16 years who had presented to our unit from December 2015 to June 2017 were enrolled. Instead of temporalis myofascial flap interposition, a buccal fat pad was used to fill the gap created by osteoarthrectomy. The primary outcome parameter was mouth opening. A mouth opening of at least 25 mm at the median follow-up point was considered success. The secondary outcome parameters were occlusion, laterotrusion, protrusion, reankylosis, neocondyle, chin deviation, facial asymmetry, midline shift, and neo-disc formation. Data were analyzed using the independent t test and rank sum test.
   Results: A total of 24 patients were enrolled in the CCG and TDDO groups (n = 12 in each group). Trauma (40.9%) was the most common etiology with a slight male preponderance (59.09%). The mean age was 10.32 +/- 2.85 years. The average distraction achieved in the TDDO group was 10.42 mm. The median follow-up duration was 31.5 months (range, 24 to 39 months). The mean preoperative maximal incisal opening had improved from 8.5 +/- 4.1 and 9.5 +/- 7.1 mm in the CCG and TDDO groups preoperatively to 35.7 +/- 2.7 and 34.4 +/- 8.9 mm, respectively, at the median follow-up point (P < .005). RCU reconstruction with both modalities resulted in improvement in all the parameters; however, the intergroup comparison showed statistically non-significant differences. No reankylosis or open bite was found. The 3-hour delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan showed successful neo-disc formation.
   Conclusions: Similar success can be achieved in RCU reconstruction using either CCG or TDDO for pediatric TMJA. Both techniques have some advantages and disadvantages. RCU reconstruction using CCG or TDDO results in formation of a neocondyle, maintenance of occlusion, and correction of facial asymmetry.

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM), has been associated with increased fracture risk. However, there are no data pertaining to the prevalence of fractures for patients with DM in India. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of fractures in Asian Indians with and without diabetes.
   Methods: The study used the data of Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study, a community- based cross sectional survey conceived with the aim of obtaining the prevalence rates of diabetes in India as a whole. A community-based sample of 57,117 individuals aged >= 20 years was obtained. Diabetes was diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test using capillary blood (except in self-reported diabetes). Fractures were self-reported.
   Results: Fracture data were available in 54,093 subjects. Out of these, 1416 (2.6%) had fractures. Overall prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was 7.1% and 10.5% respectively. Prevalence of fractures was significantly higher in diabetes group (4%) compared with non-diabetes group (2.5%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetes was associated with an increased risk (1) of any fracture (OR =1.28, 95% CI: 1.07-1.5) and (2) of low trauma fracture (hip and spine combined) (OR = 1.8, 95% CI:1.1-2.8). After gender stratification, diabetes was a risk factor for fracture only in women. Age ( > 40 years) in women, high waist circumference ( > 90 cm) in men, alcohol consumption and urban residence in both men and women were other significant contributors to fracture risk.
   Conclusion: Increased prevalence of self-reported fractures was seen in individuals with diabetes in this population-based study from India.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Objective: It is unclear whether the institution of gluten-free diet (GFD) is beneficial in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and subclinical celiac disease (CD). Our primary objective was to evaluate the effect of GFD on the frequency of hypoglycemia, in patients with T1DM and subclinical CD. Our secondary objective was to investigate the effect of GFD on height, weight, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), insulin dose requirement, and bone mineral homeostasis.
   Methods: We carried out a prospective open label randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with T1DM and subclinical CD were randomized to receive GFD or a normal diet for 1 year. The primary outcome was the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose <70 mg/dL) measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMUG) at the sixth month of the study in the 2 groups.
   Results: Screening for CD was carried out in 320 T1DM patients. Thirty eligible patients were randomized to receive GFD (n = 15) or a normal diet (n = 15). The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month recorded by SMUG and the mean time spent in hypoglycemia measured by CGM (minutes) in the GFD group versus the non-GFD group at six months was 23 minutes versus 3.4 minutes (P = .5) and 124.1 minutes versus 356.9 minutes (P = .1), respectively. The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month significantly declined in the GFD group (3.5 episodes at baseline versus 2.3 episodes at the sixth month; P = .03). The mean HbA 1c declined by 0.73% in the GFD group and rose by 0.99% in non-GFD group at study completion.
   Conclusion: This is the first RCT to assess the effect of GFD in T1DM and subclinical CD. A trend towards a decrease in hypoglycemic episodes and better glycemic control was seen in patients receiving GFD.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents with significant morbidity and poor prognosis. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) plays a crucial role in diagnosis and prognosis of this malignant disease by capturing cellular changes in tumor tissue early in the course of treatment without any contrast injection. Segmentation of tumor in DWI is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio, partial-volume effects, intensity inhomogeneities and irregular shape of osteosarcoma. The purpose of this study was to segment osteosarcoma solely utilizing DWI and identify effective and robust technique(s) for tumor segmentation. DWI dataset of fifty-five (N = 55; male:female = 41:14; Age = 17.8 +/- 7.4 years) patients with osteosarcoma was acquired before treatment. Total nine automated and semi-automated segmentation algorithms based on (1) Otsu thresholding (OT), (2) Otsu threshold-based region growing (OT-RG), (3) Active contour (AC), (4) Simple linear iterative clustering Superpixels (SLIC-S), (5) Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), (6) Graph cut (GC), (7) Logistic regression (LR) (8) Linear support vector machines (L-SVM) and (9) Deep feed-forward neural network (DNN) were implemented. Segmentation accuracy was estimated by Dice coefficient (DC), Jaccard Index (JI), precision (P) and recall (R) using manually demarcated ground-truth tumor mask by a radiologist. Evaluated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in segmented tumor mask and ground-truth tumor mask was compared using paired t test for statistical significance (p < 0.05) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Automated SLIC-S and FCM showed quantitatively and qualitatively superior segmentation with DC: ~ 79-82%; JI: ~ 67-71%; P: ~ 81-83%; R: ~ 80-86% and PCC = 0.89, 0.88 among all methods. Among semi-automated methods, AC was quantitatively more accurate (DC: ~ 77%; JI: ~ 65%; P: ~ 72%; R: ~ 88%; PCC = 0.85) than OT-RG and GC (DC: ~ 74-75%; JI: ~ 60-61%; P: ~ 67-72%; R: ~ 84-89%; PCC = 0.78, 0.73). Among machine learning algorithms, DNN showed the highest accuracy (DC: ~ 73%; JI: ~ 62%; P: ~ 77%; R: ~ 86%; PCC = 0.79) than LR and L-SVM (DC: ~ 70-71%; JI: ~ 58-63%; P: ~ 73%; R: ~ 74-85%; PCC = 0.69, 0.71). Execution times were instantaneous for SLIC-S, FCM and machine learning methods, while OT-RG, AC and GC took comparable ~ 1-6 s/slice image. Automated SLIC-S, FCM and semi-automated AC methods produced promising tumor segmentation results using DWI of the osteosarcoma dataset.

T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
KW  - Choroiditis
KW  - Scleritis
AB  - We here hypothesize the scleral origin of 'Solitary Idiopathic Choroiditis', a yellowish, nodular lesion that resembles other choroidal tumors. Systemic investigations were done to rule out causes like tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Multimodal imaging was done for better characterization and to distinguish it from other choroidal lesions. Fundus imaging revealed a yellowish-orange, well-defined nodular lesion resembling solitary idiopathic choroiditis inferotemporal to the disc. Swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) showed a nodular lesion arising from the sclera with compression of overlying choroid. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) showed hypofluorescence in all phases of angiogram with displacement of major choroidal vessels along the walls of the mass and loss of overlying choriocapillaries. The same was evident on Swept Source optical coherence tomography angiography (SSOCTA) as well. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) showed central hypofluoresence with surrounding hyperfluorescence. Ultrasound (USG) B scan revealed a high reflective echo at the apex of the mass with moderate internal reflectivity without any evidence of calcification. Enhanced Infrared (IR) Reflectance imaging revealed a central intense hyerreflective area suggestive of a fibrotic mass. Magnetic reasonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal hypointense nodular lesion on T2-weighted image. The central white area at the apex with corresponding hypoautofluorescence, a high spike on ultrasound, intense hyperreflectivity on enhanced Infrared reflectance, lack of vascularity and displacement of choroidal vessels is suggestive of a scleral origin of the mass and likely fibrotic nature.

AB  - The number of secondary cases from each primary case determines how fast an epidemic grows. It is known that all cases do not spread the infection equally; super spreaders play an important role as they contribute disproportionately to a much larger number of cases including in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Super spreaders have been reported for more than a century, but limited information is available in scientific literature. An epidemic containment strategy needs to include early identification of super spreaders to limit an explosive growth. Super spreaders tend to get stigmatized, resulting in late reporting and hiding of cases. It is important for program managers to be sensitive to the manner in which related information is shared with media and general public.

AB  - Background: Immune check point inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the treatment paradigm of driver mutation negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and they are increasingly incorporated in first-line treatment. Real-world experience of use of these drugs is limited. We aim to evaluate the real-world experience of use of ICIs in patients with advanced NSCLC.
   Patients and methods: Medical records of patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs at 4 major academic cancer centers in India between January 2016 and December 2018 were analyzed. The type of ICI taken, response rates, survival, and toxicity profiles were analyzed.
   Results: The median age at presentation was 60 years (range: 27-79 years). Nivolumab was the most commonly used ICI drug [80%, n =70] followed by pembrolizumab [10%, n= 9], and atezolizumab [10%, n=9]. The median number of ICIs cycles received were 4 (range 2-65). Among the evaluable responses in 74 patients, the objective response rates was 25.6% and clinical benefit rate was 46%. Immune related toxicity occurred in 39.9% of patients but, severe toxicity of Grade III and Grade IV occurred in 5 (5.6%) patients. After a median follow-up time of 8.86 months (95%CI 5.2-11.1) the progression-free survival was 4.73 months (95%CI 3.7-8.9), and overall survival was 11.6 months (95%CI 7.33-NR). ECOG PS at the time of start of ICIs was found to be significant determinant of Progression-free survival and overall survival.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of usage of ICIs in advanced NSCLC in Indian setting with acceptable safety profile and comparable responses with the published studies. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to organic pollutants increases the risk of low birth weight (LBW) offspring. Women involved in the plucking of tea leaves can be exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during pregnancy through inhalation and diet. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the association of maternal socio-demographic features and blood PAH concentration with LBW; also to develop a model for predicting LBW risk. The study was performed by recruiting 55 women who delivered LBW and 120 women with NBW (normal birth weight) babies from Assam Medical College. The placental tissue, maternal and cord blood samples were collected. A total of sixteen PAHs and cotinine were analysed by HPLC and GC-MS. Association of PAH concentration with weight was determined using correlation and multiple logistic regression analyses. Predictive model was developed using SVMlight and Weka software. Maternal features such as age, education, food habits, occupation, etc. were found to be associated with LBW deliveries (p-value <0.05). Overall, 9 PAHs and cotinine were detected in the samples. A multiple logistic regression depicted an increased likelihood of LBW by exposure to PAHs (pyrene, di-benzo (a,h) anthracene, fluorene and fluoranthene) and cotinine.

AB  - A vast majority of the patients with lung cancer in India present as advanced stage disease and a significant number among them have nonmetastatic locally advanced tumors which require multimodality management with curative intent. We analyzed the treatment outcome of the patients treated with of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery approach. This was a retrospective analysis of institutional database of all non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative intent surgery with/without adjuvant therapy from 2012 to 2018. Patients included were those with N2 disease; T4 or T3 disease requiring pneumonectomy or extensive adjacent structures resection. Mediastinal staging was done by PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography) along with Endobronchial ultrasound in most cases. All the patients received platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for 3-6 cycles before surgery. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and survival were analyzed. A total of 44 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Majority were males (81.8%) and smokers (75%). Squamous cell carcinoma (50%) was the most common subtype. Total 43.2% patients had either T3 or T4 tumors. N2 disease (either single station or multistation) was observed in 67.2% cases. A complete pathologic response was observed in 22.7% cases. In addition, 6.8% patients had <= 10% viable tumor in the resected specimen. Residual disease in N2 nodes were found in 25% cases. Median follow-up was 35.9 months. Patients with residual N2 disease showed a trend toward inferior survival. In multivariate analysis smoking, pretreatment tumor category and final pathologic stage were significant factors for disease free but not for overall survival. This study shows that neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a feasible and effective modality for downstaging locally advanced cases of non-small cell lung cancer among the Indian patients. Patients with less than 10% residual tumor burden had a better survival. The role of surgery in those with persistently N2 needs further evaluation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) may be a risk factor for poorly controlled asthma in children. The studies regarding prevalence and risk factors of ABPA in children with poorly controlled asthma are limited in number.
   Objectives: To determine prevalence and risk factors of ABPA and aspergillus sensitization (AS) in children with poorly controlled asthma.
   Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study from a tertiary care center in India, we enrolled asthmatic children 5-15 years of age with poorly controlled asthma. We did the following investigations: spirometry, skin prick test, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), aspergillus-specific IgE and immunoglobulin G, serum precipitin for Aspergillus, absolute eosinophil count, chest X-ray and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest. ABPA and AS were diagnosed as per the recently proposed criteria.
   Results: We enrolled 106 children [boys 72 (67.9%); mean age of 10.2 +/- 2.6 years] with poorly controlled asthma. The prevalence of ABPA and AS were 11.3% (95% CI, 5.2-17.5%) and 61.3% (95% CI, 52.0-70.7%), respectively. The presence of brownish sputum was significantly more in ABPA compared with non-ABPA patients (33.3 vs. 4.2%, p = 0.002). The age, gender, allergic rhinitis and gastroesophageal reflux were not significantly different in ABPA compared with non-ABPA patients.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of ABPA and AS was 11.3 and 61.3%, respectively in children with poorly controlled asthma. We could not find any risk factors for ABPA except that the presence of brownish sputum was more in children with ABPA. Spirometry parameters were not significantly different in ABPA compared with non-ABPA patients.

AB  - Background: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a localized cortical malformation and considerable morphological overlap exists between FCD IIB and neurological lesions associated with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Abnormal mTOR pathway secondary to somatic mTOR mutation and TSC gene mutation linked to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway have supported the hypothesis of common pathogenesis involved. Role of converging pathway, viz. Wnt/beta-Catenin and mTOR is unknown in FCD. We aimed to analyse FCD IIB for TSC1/TSC2 mutations, immunoreactivity of hamartin, tuberin, mTOR and Wnt signalling cascades, and stem cell markers.
   Materials and methods: Sixteen FCD IIB cases were retrieved along with 16 FCD IIA cases for comparison. Immunohistochemistry was performed for tuberin, hamartin, mTOR pathway markers, markers of stem cell phenotype, and Wnt pathway markers. Mutation analysis for TSC1 and TSC2 was performed by sequencing in 9 FCD cases.
   Results: All FCD cases showed preserved hamartin and tuberin immunoreactivity. Aberrant immunoreactivity of phospho-P70S6 kinase, S6 ribosomal, phospho-S6 ribosomal and Stat3 was noted in FCD IIB, with variable phospho-4E-BP1 (45%) and absent phospho-Stat3 expression. Immunoreactivity for phospho-P70S6 kinase (100%), S6 ribosomal protein (100%) and Stat3 (100%) was noted in FCD IIA, but not for phospho-S6 ribosomal, phospho-4E-BP1 and phospho-Stat3. c-Myc immunoreactivity was noted in all FCD cases. Nestin (81%) and Sox 2 (88%) stained balloon cells in FCD IIB (44%), while in FCD IIA cases were negative. All FCD cases were immunopositive for Wnt, but were negative for beta-Catenin and cyclin-D1. TSC mutations were detected in two cases of FCD IIB.
   Conclusion: Abnormal mTOR pathway activation exists in FCD IIB and IIA, however, shows differential immunoreactivity profile, indicating varying degrees of dysregulation. Labelling of neuronal stem cell markers in balloon cells suggests they are phenotypically immature. TSC1/2 mutation play role in the pathogenesis of FCD. Deep targeted sequencing is preferred diagnostic technique since conventional sanger sequencing often fails to detect low-allele frequency variants involved in mTOR/TSC pathway genes, commonly found in FCD.

AB  - Regulated fear and extinction memory is essential for balanced behavioral response. Limbic brain regions are susceptible to hypobaric hypoxia (HH) and are putative target for fear extinction deficit and dysregulation. The present study aimed to examine the effect of HH and Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on fear and extinction memory with the underlying mechanism. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated for fear extinction and anxious behavior following GBE administration during HH exposure. Blood and tissue (PFC, hippocampus and amygdala) samples were collected for biochemical, morphological and molecular studies.
   Results revealed deficit in contextual and cued fear extinction following 3 days of HH exposure. Increased corticosterone, glutamate with decreased GABA level was found with marked pyknosis, decrease in apical dendritic length and number of functional spines. Decline in mRNA expression level of synaptic plasticity genes and immunoreactivity of BDNF, synaptophysin, PSD95, spinophilin was observed following HH exposure. GBE administration during HH exposure improved fear and extinction memory along with decline in anxious behavior. It restored corticosterone, glutamate and GABA levels with an increase in apical dendritic length and number of functional spines with a reduction in pyknosis. It also improved mRNA expression level and immunoreactivity of neurotrophic and synaptic proteins.
   The present study is the first which demonstrates fear extinction deficit and anxious behavior following HH exposure. GBE administration ameliorated fear and extinction memory dysregulation by restoration of neurotransmitter levels, neuronal pyknosis and synaptic connections along with improved neurotrophic and synaptic protein expressions.

AB  - Background: One of the complications of arthroscopic reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) using hamstring autograft is injury to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve (IPBSN) leading to loss of sensation around the knee. Its incidence varies according to the orientation of incision for hamstring graft harvest, with oblique incision having the lowest chance of this injury. Aim of this study was to assess dinically and electrophysiologically injury to IPBSN after ACL reconstruction using oblique incision for hamstring graft harvest.
   Methods: Fifty patients that were scheduled to undergo arthroscopic ACL reconstruction were included. All the patients were evaluated both clinically and electrophysiologically preoperatively and at three weeks and six months postoperatively to determine injury to IPBSN. Patient satisfaction after surgery was also compared.
   Results: IPBSN injury was found to be present in 12 out of 50 patients (24%). Both clinical and electrophysiological data correlated completely. The difference in the length of the skin incisions between IPBSN injured and IPBSN intact patients was found to be statistically significant (P = .0043). The difference in the satisfaction score between patients with injured and intact IPBSN was also found to be statistically significant (P = .02).
   Conclusions: Oblique incision for hamstring graft harvest results in lower incidence of IPBSN injury and subsequent sensory loss when compared with similar studies with different skin incisions carried out in the past. Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction should be counseled preoperatively regarding this potential complication, and if this complication occurs, improvement can be expected with time.

AB  - Objectives To assess the effect of a mobile phone application for prehospital notification on resuscitation and patient outcomes.
   Design Longitudinal prospective cohort study with preintervention and postintervention cohorts.
   Setting Major trauma centre in India.
   Participants Injured patients being transported by ambulance and allocated to red (highest) and yellow (medium) triage categories.
   Intervention A prehospital notification application for use by ambulance and emergency clinicians to notify emergency departments (EDs) of an impending arrival of a patient requiring advanced lifesaving care.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the proportion of eligible patients arriving at the hospital for which prehospital notification occurred. Secondary outcomes were the availability of a trauma cubicle, presence of a trauma team on patient arrival, time to first chest X-ray, and ED and in-hospital mortality.
   Results Data from January 2017 to January 2018 were collected with 208 patients in the preintervention and 263 patients in the postintervention period. The proportion of patients arriving after prehospital notification improved from 0% to 11% (p<0.001). After the intervention, more patients were managed with a trauma call-out (relative risk (RR) 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.52); a trauma bay was ready for more patients (RR 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.05) and a trauma team leader present for more patients (RR 1.50; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.10). There was no difference in time to the initial chest X-ray (p=0.45). There was no association with mortality at hospital discharge (RR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.23), but the intervention was associated with significantly less risk of patients dying in the ED (RR 0.11; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.39).
   Conclusions The prehospital notification application for severely injured patients had limited uptake but implementation was associated with improved trauma reception and reduction in early deaths. Quality improvement efforts with ongoing data collection using the trauma registry are indicated to drive improvements in trauma outcomes in India.

AB  - The presence of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in adenocarcinomas of lung confers sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. The prevalence of EGFR mutations varies among different ethnicities and demographic profile. This multi-institutional data was compiled to determine the EGFR mutation status in Indians patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Cohorts represented by 4 tertiary care hospitals participated in data discussion at a national conference entitled as 'Lung Cancer Management in Indian Context'. The clinicopathologic data and EGFR mutation rate in the patients of lung adenocarcinoma screened in these cohorts were collected and analyzed. The sample types included both surgical and cytological specimens. A variety of methods were used including immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing. A total of 3436 cases of treatment naive lung adenocarcinoma were tested for EGFR mutations. The overall frequency of EGFR mutations observed was 30.03%. The most common baseline mutation detected was exon 19 deletion followed by L858R point mutation in exon 21. Dual mutations were observed in 6.5% of cases and were predominantly combinations of exon 19 deletion and T790M point mutation in exon 20. Incidence of EGFR mutations was higher among females and non-smokers diagnosed with lung adenocarcinomas. The most common histology in EGFR mutant cases was acinar predominant adenocarcinomas. With nearly one-third of Indian patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutations, routine testing for these mutations is important to get the benefit of targeted therapy.

We aimed to quantify influenza-associated mortality for India utilizing 2010-2013 nationally representative data sources for influenza virus circulation and deaths.
   Methods Virological data were obtained from the influenza surveillance network of 10 laboratories led by National Institute of Virology, Pune covering eight states from 2010-2013. Death data were obtained from the nationally representative Sample Registration System for the same time period. Generalized linear regression with negative binomial distribution was used to model weekly respiratory and circulatory deaths by age group and proportion of specimens positive for influenza by subtype; excess deaths above the seasonal baseline were taken as an estimate of influenza-associated mortality counts and rates. Annual excess death rates and the 2011 India Census data were used to estimate national influenza-associated deaths.
   Results Estimated annual influenza-associated respiratory mortality rates were highest for those >= 65 years (51.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.2-93.0 deaths/100 000 population) followed by those <5 years (9.8, 95% CI = 0-21.8/100 000). Influenza-associated circulatory death rates were also higher among those >= 65 years (71.8, 95% CI = 7.9-135.8/100 000) as compared to those aged <65 years (1.9, 95% CI =0-4.6/100 000). Across all age groups, a mean of 127 092 (95% CI =64 046-190,139) annual influenza-assodated respiratory and circulatory deaths may occur in India.
   Conclusions Estimated influenza-associated mortality in India was high among children <5 years and adults >= 65 years. These estimates may inform strategies for influenza prevention and control in India, such as possible vaccine introduction.

AB  - Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts have been known to be present in both ruptured and intact human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and although their relevant histology and immunochemistry have been studied in the past, ultrastructural features of these cells are largely lacking. Therefore, we aim to characterise the ultrastructural details of these cells with the help of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and to study the changes and their significance with duration of injury. Samples from 60 ruptured human ACL undergoing surgery were obtained and categorised according to duration of injury and observed under TEM with main focus on the following ultrastructural features: cellular morphology, presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lamina, myofilaments, and presence of myofibroblasts. These features were further correlated with the duration of injury and association, if any, determined using appropriate statistical analysis. A total of 54 male and 6 female patients with mean duration of the injury of 23.01 +/- 26.09 weeks (2-108 weeks) were included in the study and categorised into five groups based on duration of injury as follows: I (< 6 weeks), II (7-12 weeks), III (13-20 weeks), IV (21-50 weeks) and V (> 50 weeks). There was a significant association between the above-mentioned ultrastructural features and the duration of injury (p < 0.05) except for the presence of ovoid fibroblast cells (p = 0.53). Furthermore, number of myofibroblasts and cells with Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum was seen to peak at 13-20 weeks following injury. We describe ultrastructural features of fibroblast of different morphology along with myofibroblasts in the ligaments following injury, the changes in which might have a potential bearing on ligament healing.

AB  - While risk of tuberculosis (TB) is high among household contacts (HHCs) of pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) TB and XDR-TB, data on yield of systematic longitudinal screening are lacking. We aim to describe the yield of systematic longitudinal TB contact tracing among HHCs of patients with pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB. At the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) clinic, Mumbai, India a cohort comprising 518 HHCs of 109 pre-XDR and XDR index cases was enrolled between January 2016 and June 2018. Regular HHC follow-ups were done till one year post treatment of index cases. Of 518 HHCs, 23 had TB (21 on TB treatment and two newly diagnosed) at the time of first visit. Of the rest, 19% HHCs had no follow-ups. Fourteen (3.5%) TB cases were identified among 400 HHCs; incidence rate: 2072/100,000 person-years (95% CI: 1227-3499). The overall yield of household contact tracing was 3% (16/518). Of 14 who were diagnosed with TB during follow-up, six had drug susceptible TB (DSTB); six had pre-XDR-TB and one had XDR-TB. Five of fourteen cases had resistance patterns concordant with their index case. In view of the high incidence of TB among HHCs of pre-XDR and XDR-TB cases, follow-up of HHCs for at least the duration of index cases' treatment should be considered.

AB  - Background: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises 5%-7% of all lung cancer and carries a good prognosis with available ALK-inhibitors. Majority of registration trials in ALK-inhibitors did not include Indian patients. Hence, this study was planned to analyze the outcome of Indian patients treated with ALK-inhibitors and associated challenges. Methods: This is a multi-center study in 5 major tertiary care cancer centers across India treating ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients from April 2013 to April 2019. ALK rearrangement was determined by Ventana immunohistochemistry with D5F3 clone and/or by break-apart FISH. Patients treated with ALK-inhibitors in any lines of treatment were included in this study. Patients were evaluated for clinicopathologic features, patterns of ALK-inhibitors use and outcome. Progression free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated and data were censored on April 30, 2019. Results: A total of 274 patients were studied, out of which 250 patients received ALK inhibitor and were analyzed further for outcome. The median age was 50 years (range: 24-82) and male to female ratio of 1.17:1. ALK was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in majority of patients (97%), 3 patients by FISH and 3 more patients were evaluated by both methods. Sixty-five percent (n = 162) of the patients received ALK-inhibitor as first line therapy, 51 patients received ALK-inhibitor as switch maintenance therapy after initial chemotherapy. Crizotinib and Ceritinib were used in 88% and 12%, respectively. One patient received Alectinib. Forty-one percent of patients had CNS progression. After median follow up of 27 months (1-72 months), the median OS was 24.7 months with OS rate of 72%, 51%, and 18% at 1, 2, and 4-years respectively. Median OS was 21.2, 26, and 38 months in the first line ALK-inhibitors use (n =162), switch maintenance group (n = 51) and second line ALK-inhibitors use (postchemotherapy progression) (n = 33), respectively. No baseline variable predicted PFS. Presence of brain metastasis (P=0.039) and first line ALK-inhibitors use (P=0.032) emerged as poor prognostic factor for OS on multivariate analysis. PFS rate was 70%, 47%, and 31% at 6, 12, and 18 months respectively. Conclusion: This is one of the largest real-world data on outcome of ALK inhibitors in ALK-rearranged NSCLC from Asia. In absence of second line ALK inhibitor, initial chemotherapy followed by ALK-inhibitors (switch maintenance) had better outcome. This fact may be studied in individual patient data meta-analysis. Poor performance status and brain metastases at presentation are poor prognostic factors for overall survival. Second-line ALK inhibitor use crucial for better outcome and access to clinical trials are much needed in Indian patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To determine the event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and predictors of outcome in pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma treated with a uniform protocol. Method This hospital record review was done between June, 2016 to March, 2019 and data was extracted from January, 2003 to May, 2016 for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in patients aged 1 to 18 years (n=27). EFS and OS were calculated by the Kaplan Meier method. Cox proportional model and the Cox regression model were used for univariate analysis and multivariate analysis respectively. Results EFS and OS at three years was 70.4% (CI: 0.49-0.84) and 77.2% (CI: 0.56 -0.89), respectively. On univariate analysis stage III and IV, hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL and presence of pleural effusion predicted lower survival. On multivariate analysis, pleural effusion was a significant predictor of low EFS and OS. Conclusion Pleural effusion is a potential clinical marker of poor outcome among children with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

AB  - Objectives We compared Vascular Endothelial Growth factor (VEGF) and Thrombospondin-1 between patients with progressive paediatric malignancies randomized to metronomic chemotherapyversusplacebo to determine their role as biomarker. Methods In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized study of 108 progressive pediatric malignancies, serum VEGF and thrombospondin-1 levels were evaluated using ELISA at baseline, A2 (week-9 or earlier if progressed) and A3 (week-18 or earlier if progressed). Results Mean VEGF and thrombospondin-1 at baseline, A2 and A3 and the change from baseline to A2 were not different between two groups. In metronomic arm, responders (those completing 3 cycles) had significantly lower mean (SD) baseline VEGF levels [659.7(362.1)vs1143.9 (622.0) mu g/mL] (P=0.002) and significant decrease in thrombospondin-1 from baseline to A2 [-4.43(8.0) mu g/mLvs1.7(11.3) mu g/mL] (P=0.04), as compared to non-responders. Similar changes were not observed in responders on placebo arm. No consistent trend of these biomarkers was observed. Conclusions VEGF and thrombospondin-1 are not reliable biomarkers for response to metronomic chemotherapy.

AB  - Maintenance chemotherapy (MC) with pemetrexed is a commonly used strategy in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. However, most of the available evidence is from subjects with good performance status (PS), while data on the real-world utility and safety of this strategy in subjects with various categories of PS is limited. We performed a retrospective analysis of multicentric data of 3 centers from India. All patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer who received MC with pemetrexed after induction chemotherapy were included. Subjects were divided into 2 groups based on baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score before initiation of induction chemotherapy as good PS (<2) and poor PS (>= 2). Progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity were assessed in the study population. A total of 290 subjects were included in the study, of whom a significant proportion (n=104, 35.9%) had poor PS. Survival was better in subjects with good PS as compared to those with poor PS (1-year progression-free survival: 43.5% vs 29.8%, P=0.021; 1-year overall survival: 61.8% vs 48.1%, P=0.023). Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 14.5% of subjects during MC and was not different between both groups (P=0.287). Renal dysfunction was more common in subjects who received >= 10 cycles of MC (10.7% vs 4.2%, P=0.040). MC with pemetrexed appeared to be beneficial and safe in the real-world setting regardless of the baseline PS. However, survival benefit was more pronounced in subjects with good PS at baseline. Renal dysfunction was more frequently encountered in subjects who received prolonged MC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic provides unique challenges for health system. While on the one hand, the government has to struggle with the strategies for control of COVID-19, on the other hand, other routine health services also need to be managed. Second, the infrastructure needs to be augmented to meet the potential epidemic surge of cases. Third, economic welfare and household income need to be guaranteed. All of these have complicated the routine ways in which the governments have dealt with various trade-offs to determine the health and public policies. In this paper, we outline key economic principles for the government to consider for policymaking, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic rightfully places long due attention of policymakers for investing in health sector. The policy entrepreneurs and public health community should not miss this once-in-a-lifetime "policy window" to raise the level of advocacy for appropriate investment in health sector.

AB  - Purpose: To study the morphology of posterior polar cataracts and posterior lens capsules using modified posterior segment optical coherence tomography (m-OCT).
   Setting: Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Design: A prospective observational case series.
   Methods: Patients with clinically diagnosed posterior polar cataracts were included. The routine posterior segment OCT was modified by placing an aspheric +20.00 diopter lens along its aperture, enabling it to visualize the anterior segment structures. Cases of posterior polar cataract were assessed preoperatively using this method to study the morphology of posterior lens cortex and the posterior capsule. All m-OCT observations were performed by 2 observers, and findings were recorded.
   Results: A total of 26 eyes of 17 patients were included. The mean age of patients was 53 years. The morphology of the cataract appeared as hyperreflective opacity just anterior to the posterior capsule, subsequently involving it, and with variable hyporeflective spaces. An intact posterior capsule showed a regularly convex contour, whereas a loss in the tracing of posterior capsule at the paracentral region and disturbance in contour with a localized protrusion of lens matter (the conical sign) depicted a possible posterior capsule dehiscence. Four (15.38%) of 26 eyes showed the conical sign, and this posterior capsule defect was confirmed intraoperatively in all cases.
   Conclusions: In posterior polar cataracts, the conical sign could be a valuable clue to predict preexisting posterior capsule dehiscence and could be identified on a m-OCT. Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Wolters Kluwer on behalf of ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Objective In this review, we have summarized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and adverse effects of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib and radotinib with focus on pharmacogenomic studies with clinical end points. We have discussed the key phase 3 trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) comparing with each other, treatment free remission (TFR) and selection of TKI. Upcoming concepts and related trials in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) along with future directions have been touched upon. Evidence acquisition PubMed, Embase, Google, Cochrane library and Medline were searched to identify relevant literature for the review. was searched for upcoming data and trials. Results There are lot of gap in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TKI. Imatinib appears to be the safest TKI. Newer TKI's achieve better achievement of therapeutic milestones, deeper molecular response and less chances of progression of CML compared to imatinib. Newer TKI appears to be better choice for achieving TFR. When the objective is survival, imatinib is still the TKI of choice. Primary prophylaxis with antiplatelet drugs for TKI having cardiovascular and thromboembolic side effects should be considered. Conclusion Pharmacogenetic data of TKI is still immature to guide in therapeutic decision making in clinical practice. There is need for further research in pharmacology and pharmacogenomics of newer TKI's. Randomized controlled trials are required to decide the optimum TKI for TFR. Safe and effective TKI for targeting T315I mutation, CML accelerated phase and blast crisis are an active area of research.

AB  - Purpose A preliminary survey of pediatric neurosurgeons working at different centers around the world suggested differences in clinical practice resulting in variation in the risk of pediatric cerebellar mutism (CM) and cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) after posterior fossa (PF) tumor resection. The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the incidence and severity of CM and CMS after midline PF tumor resection in children treated at these centers and (2) to identify potentially modifiable factors related to surgical management (rather than tumor biology) that correlate with the incidence of CM/CMS. Methods Attending pediatric neurosurgeons at British Columbia's Children's Hospital (BCCH) and neurosurgeons who completed a pediatric neurosurgery fellowship at BCCH were invited to provide data from the center where they currently practiced. Children aged from birth to less than 18 years who underwent initial midline PF tumor resection within a contemporary, center-selected 2-year period were included. Data was obtained by retrospective chart and imaging review. Modifiable surgical factors that were assessed included pre-resection surgical hydrocephalus treatment, surgical positioning, ultrasonic aspirator use, intraoperative external ventricular drain (EVD) use, surgical access route to the tumor, and extent of resection. CM was defined as decreased or absent speech output postoperatively and CMS as CM plus new or worsened irritability. Results There were 263 patients from 11 centers in 6 countries (Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, India, Indonesia, and the USA). Median age at surgery was 6 years (range < 1 to 17 years). The overall incidence of postoperative CM was 23.5% (range 14.7-47.6% for centers with data on >= 20 patients). The overall incidence of CMS was 6.5% (range 0-10.3% for centers contributing data on >= 20 patients). A multivariate logistic regression on the full data set showed no significant association between pre-resection surgical hydrocephalus treatment, prone position, ultrasonic aspirator use, EVD use, telovelar approach, complete or near total resection, or treating center and either postoperative CM or CMS. Conclusions While there was variation in surgical management of midline PF tumors among centers participating in this study, the factors in management that were examined did not predict postoperative CM or CMS.

AB  - The SugABC is an ABC transporter in Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is proposed to be involved in the process of Trehalose import, but till date the proteins of this transporter complex have not been functionally characterized. This transport process is driven by the nucleotide binding domain SugC of SugABC transporter. To understand the functional role of SugC, we expressed and purified the protein in E.coli. Our purification result shows, Mtb SugC exists as a monomer in solution but forms dimers upon binding to ATP. It is stable at pH 7.5 as analyzed by CD spectroscopy and showed maximum activity at this pH as estimated by Michaelis-Menten's kinetics for Mg-ATP at a K-M of 0.15 mM. The SugC(H193A) mutant was observed to have a reduced catalytic activity implying that H193 is one of the residues involved in the hydrolysis of ATP. The molecular modeling further revealed that, like E.coli MalK, MtbSugC also has an ATPase domain and a regulatory domain. Despite having low sequence homology with other nucleotide binding domains of ABC transporters, the structure and functional motifs of MtbSugC are conserved. Thus, we show that SugC is a functional ATPase domain of SugABC transporter in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite advancement in medical care, Rh alloimmunisation remains a major cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, neuro-morbidity, and late-onset anaemia. Delayed cord clamping (DCC), a standard care now-a-days, is yet not performed in Rh-alloimmunised infants due to paucity of evidence. Hence, we randomised these infants of 28- to 41-week gestation to delayed cord clamping (N = 36) or early cord clamping (N = 34) groups. The primary outcome variable was venous packed cell volume (PCV) at 2 h of birth. The secondary outcomes were incidence of double volume exchange transfusion (DVET) and partial exchange transfusion (PET), duration of phototherapy (PT), functional echocardiography (parameters measured: superior vena cava flow, M-mode fractional shortening, left ventricular output, myocardial perfusion index, and inferior vena cava collapsibility) during hospital stay, and blood transfusion (BT) until 14 weeks of life. Neonates were managed as per unit protocol. The baseline characteristics of enrolled infants were comparable between the groups. The median (IQR) gestation and mean (SD) birth weight of enrolled infants were 35 (33-37) weeks and 2440 (542) g, respectively. The DCC group had a higher mean PCV at 2 h of life (48.4 +/- 9.2 vs. 43.5 +/- 8.7, mean difference 4.9% (95% CI 0.6-9.1), p = 0.03). However, incidence of DVET and PET, duration of PT, echocardiography parameters, and BT until 14 weeks of postnatal age were similar between the groups. Conclusion: DCC in Rh-alloimmunised infants improved PCV at 2 h of age without significant adverse effects. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), Ref/2016/11/012572 , date of trial registration 19.12.2016, date of first patient enrolment 1 January 2017.What is Known:center dot Delayed cord clamping improves haematocrit, results in better haemodynamic stability, and decreases the need of transfusion in early infancy.center dot However, due to lack of evidence, potential risk of hyperbilirubinaemia, and exacerbation of anaemia (following delayed cord clamping), early cord clamping is the usual norm in Rh-alloimmunised infantsinfants.What is New:center dot Delayed cord clamping in Rh-alloimmunised infants improves haematocrit at 2 h of life without any increase in incidence of serious adverse effects.

AB  - Lateral rectus transposition to the medial rectus muscle has recently generated interest in the management of oculomotor nerve palsy. We report 4 cases of complete oculomotor nerve palsy with a large-angle exotropia that were treated with a modified adjustable nasal transposition of the split lateral rectus muscle. Forced duction testing for the lateral rectus muscle showed good adduction in all 4 cases. Postoperative alignment within 10(Delta) in straight-ahead gaze was achieved in all 4 cases; adjustment was required in 2 cases.

T2  - OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE
KW  - TRAUMATIC CYCLODIALYSIS
KW  - HYPOTONY
KW  - CYCLOPEXY
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE Cyclodialysis clefts can potentially develop secondary to open globe injury. The swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-AS-OCT) may be a valuable diagnostic tool for the identification and estimation of the circumferential extent of cyclodialysis clefts. It could be considered an alternative when ultrasound biomicroscopy cannot be performed successfully. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to report a case of open-globe injury associated with cyclodialysis cleft and the utility of SS-AS-OCT in its diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old boy presented to the clinic because of penetrating ocular trauma to his left eye with a projectile stone. He was diagnosed with limbal perforation with uveal tissue prolapse and cataract. He underwent limbal repair with cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. However, even at the 6 weeks' post-operative period, he did not gain vision and had persistent hypotony with hypotonic maculopathy. Gonioscopy showed a 2-clock-hour superonasal cyclodialysis cleft. However, on SS-AS-OCT, it was discovered that the cleft extended along 5 clock hours, involving both superonasal and inferonasal quadrants. Recognizing the large extent of the cleft, endocyclopexy by modified sewing-machine technique was planned and performed. An IOP spike and improvement in vision were noted on the next post-operative day. The SS-AS-OCT confirmed cleft closure. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, cyclodialysis can occur in cases of open globe injury. The SS-AS-OCT is a useful diagnostic tool to study the circumferential extent of cyclodialysis and may unravel detachments hidden behind intact anterior ciliary body face.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
KW  - MYOFASCIAL PAIN
KW  - MUSCLE SPASMS
AB  - Purpose: The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) into the masticatory muscles on the physiotherapy pain and mouth opening outcomes after surgical intervention of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis and to verify the effects using electromyographic studies.
   Patients and Methods: The study included 20 patients with TMJ ankylosis. The patients were further subdivided into control and interventional groups. The interventional group was given intramuscular injections of BTX-A in the masticator muscles before surgery Only saline injections were given to the control group. All 20 patients were evaluated for pain and ease of active physiotherapy at the 1-week and 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up visits using a questionnaire. Intergroup comparisons were performed for both groups. Electromyographic (EMG) studies were also performed in the intervention group for each patient. EMG recordings were performed of the individual masticator muscle in each patient before injection and at 1 and 3 months after injection.
   Results: The intervention group showed better results with respect to pain during the mouth opening exercises and improvements in mouth opening. All the interventional group patients showed a transient decrease in the microvolt value on the EMG studies of their masticator muscles on injection of BTX-A.
   Conclusions: BTX-A injection can be a straightforward and useful adjunct to surgical treatment of TMJ ankylosis for the reduction of pain during postoperative physiotherapy. (C) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Background. In this study, the authors aimed to assess the association of loneliness and disability with oral health in 2 groups older adults (>= 60 years) in central India.
   Methods. A total of 421 older adults participated in the study; 316 (75.1%) attended outpatient services at the Department of Dentistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India, and 105 (24.9%) were from old age homes. The authors used the Patients Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System's social isolation 8a short form to assess loneliness. Disability was assessed using the 12-item version of the self-administered World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale. The authors conducted regression analyses to establish the association of loneliness and disability with the decayed, missing, and filled tooth index; periodontal disease; and edentulousness.
   Results. Poor oral health findings were noted in both groups. Eighty-eight (20.9%) participants had never visited a dentist, and 201 (88.5%) had unmet dental prosthetic needs. Loneliness and disability were associated with decayed, missing, and filled tooth index scores; periodontal disease; and edentulousness, with odds ratios of 1.86, 1.29, 2.37 and 4.63, 3.85, 3.63 respectively (P < .001). Age, sex, socioeconomic status, type of residence, tobacco use, and use of oral health care were also independent variables associated with oral health (P < .001).
   Conclusions. Loneliness and disability were found to be significantly associated with oral health. The study results found poor oral health, low use of oral health care, and high unmet need for dental prosthetics in the 2 groups of older adults.
   Practical Implications. Practicing dentists need to understand the significance of loneliness and social isolation on oral health. Interventions to reduce isolation and disability can be beneficial in improving the oral health of older adults.
