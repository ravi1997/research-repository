AB  - The implications of altered coagulation-fibrinolytic system in the pathophysiology of several vascular disorders, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, have been well researched upon and established. However, its role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy has not been explored much. Since a decade, it is known that hyperglycemia is associated with a hypercoagulated state and the various impairments it causes are well acknowledged as independent risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases. But recent studies suggest that the hypercoagulative state and diminished fibrinolytic responses might also alter retinal homeostasis and induce several deleterious molecular changes in retinal cells which aggravate the already existing hyperglycemia-induced pathological conditions and thereby lead to the progression of diabetic retinopathy. The major mediators of coagulation-fibrinolytic system whose concentration or activity get altered during hyperglycemia include fibrinogen, antithrombin-III (AT-III), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Inhibiting the pathways by which these altered mediators get involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy can serve as potential targets for the development of an adjuvant novel alternative therapy for diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - This case report describes the concurrent development of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease in a 39 year old male patient of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The patient being reported was a known case of CML in remission with history of painless sudden loss of vision in both eyes. Cases of leukemia can present with visual loss due to multiple ocular manifestations of leukemia itself or side effects of modern drugs used for its treatment. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging of our patient were suggestive of concurrent development of VKH. The patient was started on oral steroids, to which he showed a good response. Thus, the cases of CML may rarely develop concurrent ocular disorders not related to leukemia. These associated ocular disorders need to be distinguished from the ocular manifestations of leukemia itself. Our case highlights the concurrent development of VKH as the etiology of visual loss in a case of CML.

AB  - Background/Aims: The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of non-anesthesia provider (NAPP) administered propofol sedation in patients undergoing non-advanced gastrointestinal (Cl) endoscopic procedures.
   Materials and Methods: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for prospective observational trials involving non-advanced endoscopic procedures. From a total of 608 publications, 25 [colonoscopy (9), upper GI endoscopy (5), and combined procedures (11)1 were identified to meet inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Data was analyzed for hypoxia rates, airway intervention rates, and airway complication rates.
   Results: A total of 137,087 patients were involved. A total of 2931 hypoxia episodes (defined as an oxygen saturation below 9096) were reported with a pooled hypoxia rate of 0.014 (9596 CI being 0.008-0.023). Similarly, pooled airway intervention rates and pooled airway complication rates were 0.002 (9596 CI being 0.006-0.001) and 0.001 (9596 Cl being 0.000-0.001), respectively.
   Conclusions: The rates of adverse events in patients undergoing non-advanced GI endoscopic procedures with NAPP sedation are extremely small. Similar data for anesthesia providers is not available. It is prudent for anesthesia providers to demonstrate their superiority in prospective randomized controlled trials, if they like to retain exclusive ownership over propofol sedation in patients undergoing GI endoscopy.

AB  - Retroaortic course of coronary artery is a relative contraindication for device closure of an atrial septal defect. In this brief report, we demonstrate, for the first time, inferior aortic recess mimicking retroaortic left circumflex coronary artery in a patient with atrial septal defect. This distinction is important to avoid spurious diagnosis of anomalous coronary artery denying patient a chance of nonsurgical closure of atrial septal defect.

AB  - Background Evidence on the optimal time to initiation of complementary feeding in preterm infants is scarce. We examined the effect of initiation of complementary feeding at 4 months versus 6 months of corrected age on weight for age at 12 months corrected age in preterm infants less than 34 weeks of gestation.
   Methods In this open-label, randomised trial, we enrolled infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestation with no major malformation from three public health facilities in India. Eligible infants were tracked from birth and randomly assigned (1:1) at 4 months corrected age to receive complementary feeding at 4 months corrected age (4 month group), or continuation of milk feeding and initiation of complementary feeding at 6 months corrected age (6 month group), using computer generated randomisation schedule of variable block size, stratified by gestation (30 weeks or less, and 31-33 weeks). Iron supplementation was provided as standard. Participants and the implementation team could not be masked to group assignment, but outcome assessors were masked. Primary outcome was weight for age Z-score at 12 months corrected age (WAZ(12)) based on WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study growth standards. Analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry of India, number CTRI/2012/11/003149.
   Findings Between March 20, 2013, and April 24, 2015, 403 infants were randomly assigned:206 to receive complementary feeding from 4 months and 197 to receive complementary feeding from 6 months. 22 infants in the 4 month group (four deaths, two withdrawals, 16 lost to follow-up) and eight infants in the 6 month group (two deaths, six lost to follow-up) were excluded from analysis of primary outcome. There was no difference in WAZ12 between two groups: -1.6 (SD 1.2) in the 4 month group versus -1.6 (SD 1.3) in the 6 month group (mean difference 0.005, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.25; p=0.965). There were more hospital admissions in the 4 month group compared with the 6 month group: 2.5 episodes per 100 infant-months in the 4 month group versus 1.4 episodes per 100 infant-months in the 6 month group (incidence rate ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.1, p=0.03). 34 (18%) of 188 infants in the 4 month group required hospital admission, compared with 18 (9%) of 192 infants in the 6 month group.
   Interpretation Although there was no evidence of effect for the primary endpoint of WAZ(12), the higher rate of hospital admission in the 4 month group suggests a recommendation to initiate complementary feeding at 6 months over 4 months of corrected age in infants less than 34 weeks of gestation.

AB  - Testicular maturation arrest is characterized by interruption of germ cell development and differentiation. Genetic factors play important role in the causation of human disease, including male infertility. The objective was to study copy number variations in testicular maturation arrest using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray technique. Conventional cytogenetics, targeted fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH) and sequence-tagged site (STS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to confirm some of the SNP microarray findings. SNP microarray on 68 cases of testicular maturation arrest detected copy number variations (CNVs) mostly on sex chromosomes involving pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) 1, 2 and 3 as well as azoospermic factors (AZFs) besides three cases of chromosomal abnormalities (two Klinefelter syndromes and one case of dicentric Y). The AZF deletion was observed in 14 (20.6%) cases and the AZFc gain was observed in 6 (8.8%) cases. PAR 1 and 2 CNVs was observed in 5 (7.3%) cases. PAR 3 CNVs was detected in 19 cases and 2 controls. The TSPY2 gene gain (within PAR 3 CNVs) was observed in 16 cases and 1 control. CNV containing autosomal genes possibly associated with male infertility in this study was SPATA31A2-A5 (9p12) in five cases. In this study, SNP microarray identified possible underlying aetiology in 55.9% (38/68) cases besides identifying minimal critical region of AZFc deletion as 0.51mb (Y:24356128-24873665) involving TTY5, RBMY2FP, RBMY1F, RBMY1J, TTY6 and PRY genes. SNP microarray seems superior, sensitive, specific as well as cost-effective method and has potential to be the first tier investigations to explore underlying genomic factors of testicular maturation arrest. The present study is an attempt to find out probable genomic factors with idiopathic testicular maturation arrest.

AB  - Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) is a multifunctional Ser/Thr kinase, associated with cerebral hypoxia, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of seven pyrimidine-substituted novel inhibitors of CAMKIV. We successfully synthesized and extensively characterized (ESI-MS, H-1 NMR, and C-13 NMR studies) seven compounds that are showing appreciable binding affinity to the CAMKIV. Molecular docking and fluorescence binding studies revealed that compound 1 is showing very high binding free energy (G=-11.52kcal/mol) and binding affinity (K=9.2x10(10) m(-1)) to the CAMKIV. We further performed MTT assay to check the cytotoxicity and anticancer activity of these compounds. An appreciable IC50 (39m) value of compound 1 was observed on human hepatoma cell line and nontoxic till the 400m on human embryonic kidney cells. To ensure anticancer activity of all these compounds, we further performed propidium iodide assay to evaluate cell viability and DNA content during the cell cycle. We found that compound 1 is again showing a better anticancer activity on both human hepatoma and human embryonic kidney cell lines.

AB  - Primary malignant melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract is extremely rare. A 35-year-old man presented with complaints of abdominal pain and weight loss. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed a large mass involving the duodenum and the superior mesenteric vessels. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated a large, friable mass along the duodenal wall and biopsy was suggestive of malignant melanoma. A detailed physical examination and whole body imaging (positron emission tomography and computed tomography) did not reveal any other lesion.
   The patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy with segmental resection and anastomosis of the superior mesenteric vein as well as a segmental colectomy. His postoperative recovery was uneventful. The histopathology of the operative specimen showed a malignant amelanotic melanoma arising from the duodenum with lymph nodal involvement. He received oral temozolomide. However, he developed liver metastasis at six months and again at ten months, which was managed with radiofrequency ablation both times. He is doing well at 32 months of follow-up review. Multimodality treatment including surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and salvage therapy appears to be a promising tool for achieving long-term survival in such patients.

AB  - Background: Household coverage with iodized salt was assessed in 10 countries that implemented Universal Salt Iodization (USI).
   Objective: The objective of this paper was to summarize household coverage data for iodized salt, including the relation between coverage and residence type and socioeconomic status (SES).
   Methods: A review was conducted of results from cross-sectional multistage household cluster surveys with the use of stratified probability proportional to size design in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Niger, the Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. Salt iodine content was assessed with quantitative methods in all cases. The primary indicator of coverage was percentage of households that used adequately iodized salt, with an additional indicator for salt with some added iodine. Indicators of risk were SES and residence type. We used 95% CIs to determine significant differences in coverage.
   Results: National household coverage of adequately iodized salt varied from 6.2% in Niger to 97.0% in Uganda. For salt with some added iodine, coverage varied from 52.4% in the Philippines to 99.5% in Uganda. Coverage with adequately iodized salt was significantly higher in urban than in rural households in Bangladesh (68.9% compared with 44.3%, respectively), India (86.4% compared with 69.8%, respectively), Indonesia (59.3% compared with 51.4%, respectively), the Philippines (31.5% compared with 20.2%, respectively), Senegal (53.3% compared with 19.0%, respectively), and Tanzania (89.2% compared with 57.6%, respectively). In 7 of 8 countries with data, household coverage of adequately iodized salt was significantly higher in high-than in low-SES households in Bangladesh (58.8% compared with 39.7%, respectively), Ghana (36.2% compared with 21.5%, respectively), India (80.6% compared with 70.5%, respectively), Indonesia (59.9% compared with 45.6%, respectively), the Philippines (39.4% compared with 17.3%, respectively), Senegal (50.7% compared with 27.6%, respectively) and Tanzania (80.9% compared with 51.3%, respectively).
   Conclusions: Uganda has achieved USI. In other countries, access to iodized salt is inequitable. Quality control and regulatory enforcement of salt iodization remain challenging. Notable progress toward USI has been made in Ethiopia and India. Assessing progress toward USI only through household salt does not account for potentially iodized salt consumed through processed foods.

AB  - Bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) therapy has emerged as a potential therapy for the treatment of stroke. We performed a systematic review of published studies using BM-MNC therapy in patients with ischaemic stroke (IS). Literature was searched using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Trip Database, Cochrane library and clinicaltrial.gov to identify studies on BM-MNC therapy in IS till June, 2016. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. STATA version 13 was used for carrying out meta-analysis. We included non-randomized open-label, single-arm and non-randomized comparative studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) if BM-MNCs were used to treat patients with IS in any phase after the index stroke. One randomized trial, two non-randomized comparative trials and four single-arm open-label trials (total seven studies) involving 227 subjects (137 patients and 90 controls) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled proportion for favourable clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score <= 2) in six studies involving 122 subjects was 29% (95% CI 0.16-0.43) who were exposed to BM-MNCs and pooled proportion for favourable clinical outcome of 69 subjects (taken from two trials) who did not receive BM-MNCs was 20% (95% CI 0.12-0.32). The pooled difference in the safety outcomes was not significant between both the groups. Our systematic review suggests that BM-MNC therapy is safe up to 1 year post-intervention and is feasible; however, its efficacy in the case of IS patients is debatable. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are required to provide more information on the efficacy of BM-MNC transplantation in patients with IS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autonomic dysfunction is common in children with Rett syndrome. They usually manifest with agitation, persistent screaming, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, aerophagia, hyperventilation, and breath holding episodes. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may result in fatal a arrhythmia. Many of these events are mistaken for seizures and treated with antiepileptics. METHODS: The present study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India for more than a six month period. MeCP2 mutation positive, 24 cases with Rett syndrome and 24 age-matched healthy girls were evaluated for cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (heart rate variability, head-up tilt test, and cold pressor test). RESULTS: The mean age was 9.06 years (+/- 3.4) and 9.75 years (+/- 3.13) for patients and control subjects, respectively. The heart rate variability contributed independently by parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system was significantly reduced in cases compared with control subjects (P = 0.033 and P = 0.001, respectively). There was significant sympathovagal imbalance with sympathetic overactivity in cases compared with control subjects (P = 0.001). The mean longest QT(c) interval was significantly prolonged in cases compared with control subjects (P = 0.001). Cold pressor test and head-up tilt test could be done in 16 Rett syndrome patients (because of poor cooperation) and in all 24 control subjects. The change in blood pressure during cold pressor test and head-up tilt test was not significantly different in cases and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Children with Rett syndrome exhibited significant cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in the form of sympathetic overactivity, parasympathetic underactivity, and sympathovagal imbalance. These findings have potentially important therapeutic-and outcome-related implications.

AB  - Objectives: Sternotomy for cardiac surgeries causes significant postoperative pain and when not properly managed may cause significant morbidity. As neuropathic pain is a significant component here, gabapentin and pregabalin may be effective in these patients and may reduce postoperative opioid consumption. The purpose of this systematic review was to find out efficacy of gabapentin and pregabalin in acute postoperative pain after cardiac surgery.
   Methods: Published prospective human randomized clinical trials, which compared pre-operative and/or postoperative gabapentin/pregabalin with placebo or no treatment for postoperative pain management after cardiac surgery has been included in this review.
   Results: Four RCTs each for gabapentin and pregabalin have been included in this systematic review. Three gabapentin and two pregabalin studies reported decrease in opioid consumption in cardiac surgical patients while one gabapentin and two pregabalin studies did not. Three RCTs each for gabapentin and pregabalin reported lower pain scores both during activity and rest. The drugs are not associated with any significant complications.
   Conclusion: Despite lower pain scores in the postoperative period, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of gabapentin and pregabalin to reduce opioid consumption in the cardiac surgical patients.

AB  - In this study, we explored the effect of aqueous extract of leaves of Aegle marmelos (AM) on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and insulin downstream signalling in rats given fructose (15%) in drinking water from weaning to adulthood. Wistar albino rats (4 weeks old) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), fructose control (FC), and treatment (AMT) groups and were fed for a period of 8 weeks the following diets: chow + water, chow + fructose (15%), and chow + fructose (15%) + AM (500 mg/kg per day, p.o.), respectively. Compared with the NC group, the FC group was found to have significantly (p < 0.05) raised levels of fasting blood glucose, lipid, visceral mass, plasma insulin and leptin, glycogen, and gluconeogenesis enzyme but decreased glycolytic enzyme activity. Raised levels of glucose transporter 2 protein but decreased activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) and Janus kinase -signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (JAK-STAT3) in hepatic tissue indicate a state of insulin and leptin resistance in the FC group. A significant (p < 0.05) lowering of physical and glycemic parameters, strengthening of the hepatic glycolytic pathway over the gluconeogenic pathway, and upregulation of the PI3K/Akt and JAK-STAT3 pathways was observed in the AMT group, as compared with the FC group. For the first time, the mechanism underlying the development of insulin resistance syndrome is delineated here, along with the potential of A. marmelos to impede it.

AB  - Background & objectives: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized by qualitative or quantitative deficiency of integrin aIIb beta 3 [ glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb)/IIIa, CD41/CD61] diagnosed by absent or reduced platelet aggregation to physiological agonists, namely, collagen, adenosine-di-phosphate, epinephrine and arachidonic acid. The objective of this study was to quantitate platelet surface GPs, classify GT patients and relate the results with the severity of bleeding and platelet aggregation studies.
   Methods: Fifty one patients of GT diagnosed by platelet aggregation studies were evaluated for the expression of CD41, CD61, CD42a and CD42b on platelet surface by flow cytometry. The association between the clinical phenotype based on bleeding score and GT subtype on flow cytometric evaluation was assessed.
   Results: Twenty four (47%) patients of GT were classified as type I (as CD41/CD61 were virtually absent, < 5%), six (11.8%) patients as type II (5-20% CD41/CD61) and 21 (41.2%) as type III or GT variants as they had near normal levels of CD41 and CD61. Type III GT patients had significantly lower numbers of severe bleeders (P= 0.034), but the severity of bleeding did not vary significantly in type I and II GT patients. In all GT patients, mean CD41 expression was found to be lower than mean CD61 expression (P= 0.002).
   Interpretation & conclusions: Type I GT was found most common in our patients and with lowered mean CD41 expression in comparison with CD61. Type III GT patients had significantly lower numbers of severe bleeders, but the severity of bleeding did not vary significantly in type I and II GT patients.

AB  - Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly malignant tumor which is thought to originate from the pluripotent mesenchyme. It is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood. This review article summarizes the recent and older published literature and gives an overview of management of RMS in children. RMS can arise in a wide variety of primary sites, some of which are associated with specific patterns of local invasion, regional lymph nodal spread, therapeutic response and long term outcome, hence requiring physicians to be familiar with site-specific staging and treatment details. Most common primary sites include the head and neck region, genitourinary tract, and extremities. Prognosis for children and adolescents with RMS has recently improved substantially, especially for patients with local or locally extensive disease because of the development of multi-modal therapy incorporating surgery, dose-intensive combination chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Despite aggressive approaches the outcome for patients who present with metastatic disease remains unsatisfactory. Clinical trials are ongoing to reduce toxicity and improve outcomes of such patients; newer agents in combination are being investigated.

AB  - Penis is an extremely uncommon site for metastases to occur and is often associated with very grave prognosis. Most of the secondary tumors originating in the penis have primaries from prostate, urinary bladder, and gastrointestinal tract. We hereby report a 65-year-old man, known case of carcinoma urinary bladder, who came for FDG PET/CT for metastatic workup. PET/CT study revealed FDG-avid mass lesion in the root and shaft of the penis, making it suggestive of metastases, which was confirmed later by MRI correlation.

AB  - IntroductionPosterior midline laminectomy is associated with risks of postoperative instability, spinal deformity, extensive bilateral subperiosteal muscle stripping, partial or total facetectomy especially in foraminal tumor extension, increased cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and wound infection. Minimally invasive approaches with the help of a microscope or endoscope using hemilaminectomy have been found to be safe and effective. We report our initial experience of 18 patients using the endoscopic technique.
   Material and MethodsA retrospective study of intradural extramedullary tumors extending up to two vertebral levels was studied. Pre- and postoperative clinical status, magnetic resonance imaging was done in all patients. The Destandau technique was used, and resection of ipsilateral lamina, medial part of the facet joint, base of the spinous process, and undercutting of the opposite lamina was performed. Dura repair was done using an endoscopic technique. Fibrin glue was used to reinforce repair in the later part of the study.
   ResultsThe sagittal and axial diameter of tumor ranged from 21 to 41mm and 12 to 18mm, respectively. There were four cervical, two cervicothoracic, five thoracic, three thoracolumbar, and four lumbar tumors, respectively. All 18 patients improved after total excision of tumor. Average duration of surgery and blood loss was 140 minutes and 60 mL, respectively. Postoperative stay and follow-up ranged from 3 to 7 days and 9 to 24 months, respectively.
   ConclusionAlthough the study is limited by the small number of patients with a short follow-up and is a technically demanding procedure, endoscopic management of intradural extramedullary tumors was an effective and safe alternative technique to microsurgery in such patients.

AB  - Mobile phones emit electromagnetic radiations that are classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans. Evidence for increased risk for brain tumours accumulated in parallel by epidemiologic investigations remains controversial. This paper aims to investigate whether methodological quality of studies and source of funding can explain the variation in results. PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL searches were conducted from 1966 to December 2016, which was supplemented with relevant articles identified in the references. Twenty-two case control studies were included for systematic review. Meta-analysis of 14 case-control studies showed practically no increase in risk of brain tumour [OR 1.03 (95% CI 0.92-1.14)]. However, for mobile phone use of 10 years or longer (or > 1640 h), the overall result of the meta-analysis showed a significant 1.33 times increase in risk. The summary estimate of government funded as well as phone industry funded studies showed 1.07 times increase in odds which was not significant, while mixed funded studies did not show any increase in risk of brain tumour. Metaregression analysis indicated that the association was significantly associated with methodological study quality (p < 0.019, 95% CI 0.009-0.09). Relationship between source of funding and log OR for each study was not statistically significant (p < 0.32, 95% CI 0.036-0.010). We found evidence linking mobile phone use and risk of brain tumours especially in long-term users (ae<yen>10 years). Studies with higher quality showed a trend towards high risk of brain tumour, while lower quality showed a trend towards lower risk/protection.

AB  - Pediatric Hodgkins lymphoma is a highly curable disease even in the developing world. Current treatment paradigms follow a risk and response based approach. The goal is to minimise treatment related short and long-term toxicity while maintaining excellent survival. A confirmed histopathological diagnosis and full staging work-up are essential prior to embarking on treatment and guidelines for these are provided in the text. All patients require combination chemotherapy while radiotherapy is usually reserved for a select subgroup depending on the protocol used. It is important to follow these patients for relapse in the first five years and life-long for late effects as most of them will be cured.

AB  - Sestrins are highly conserved stress-inducible proteins capable of suppressing the production of ROS and signalling through mTORC1. Here we report a study of human sestrin1 (sesn1) and sestrin2 (sesn2) proteins produced in a pET28(+) vector based prokaryotic system. Mass spectrometry analysis, western blot and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of affinity purified sesn1 and sesn2 proteins confirmed their identity; biophysical characteristics were observed using circular dichroism (CD) showing that sesn1 and sesn2 have a predominant alpha-helical structure. Here we describe a simple, one step purification process to purify a large amount of sestrin proteins with significant yield. Further study of recombinant human sestrins may further facilitate the understanding of their roles in eukaryotic cells.

AB  - Glioma accounts for the majority of human brain tumors. With prevailing treatment regimens, the patients have poor survival rates. In spite of current development in mainstream glioma therapy, a cure for glioma appears to be out of reach. The infiltrative nature of glioma and acquired resistance substancially restrict the therapeutic options. Better elucidation of the complicated pathobiology of glioma and proteogenomic characterization might eventually open novel avenues for the design of more sophisticated and effective combination regimens. This could be accomplished by individually tailoring progressive neuroimaging techniques, terminating DNA synthesis with prodrug-activating genes, silencing gliomagenesis genes (gene therapy), targeting miRNA oncogenic activity (miRNA-mRNA interaction), combining Hedgehog-Gli/Akt inhibitors with stem cell therapy, employing tumor lysates as antigen sources for efficient depletion of tumor-specific cancer stem cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (dendritic cell vaccination), adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells, and combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional therapeutic modalities. Thus, the present review captures the latest trends associated with the molecular mechanisms involved in glial tumorigenesis as well as the limitations of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In this article we also critically discuss the next generation molecular therapeutic strategies and their mechanisms for the successful treatment of glioma.

AB  - The Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR; NR1I2) is a ligand-modulated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is expressed at higher levels primarily in liver and intestine as compared to the levels in several other organs. It is activated by a broad spectrum of xenobiotics and endobiotics. The primary function of PXR is to regulate the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and prevent the accumulation of toxic chemicals in the body, thereby maintaining body's homeostasis. In this study, we identified a C/T single nucleotide polymorphism at position -831 from the transcriptional start site of the PXR gene promoter and examined the functional significance of this variant using both the luciferase reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Transient transfection experiments showed that the T-allele was associated with significantly greater transcriptional activity than the C-allele of SNP rs3814055. These results indicate that the -831C/T polymorphism has a direct effect on transcriptional regulation of PXR gene. This allelic variation may be a potential genetic marker that can help identify individuals at higher risk for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

AB  - Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma (SNTCS) is a rare malignancy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Histologically, this tumor consists of mature and immature components of epithelial, mesenchymal and neuroectodermal origin, which may be present in varying proportions. This morphological heterogeneity often leads to misdiagnosis, particularly in biopsies. These patients have dismal prognosis, with frequent recurrences and short mean survival periods. Due to its rarity, clinical characteristics and optimal therapy are not well-characterized. We report a case of SNTCS with intracranial extension, which was treated with surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy. Knowledge of this entity is necessary for accurate diagnosis and proper management.

AB  - Background: Sepsis is a major reason for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, also in resource-poor settings. ICUs in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) face many challenges that could affect patient outcome.
   Aim: To describe differences between resource-poor and resource-rich settings regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, economics and research aspects of sepsis. We restricted this manuscript to the ICU setting even knowing that many sepsis patients in LMICs are treated outside an ICU.
   Findings: Although many bacterial pathogens causing sepsis in LMICs are similar to those in high-income countries, resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs can be very different; in addition, causes of sepsis in LMICs often include tropical diseases in which direct damaging effects of pathogens and their products can sometimes be more important than the response of the host. There are substantial and persisting differences in ICU capacities around the world; not surprisingly the lowest capacities are found in LMICs, but with important heterogeneity within individual LMICs. Although many aspects of sepsis management developed in rich countries are applicable in LMICs, implementation requires strong consideration of cost implications and the important differences in resources.
   Conclusions: Addressing both disease-specific and setting-specific factors is important to improve performance of ICUs in LMICs. Although critical care for severe sepsis is likely cost-effective in LMIC setting, more detailed evaluation at both at a macro-and micro-economy level is necessary. Sepsis management in resource-limited settings is a largely unexplored frontier with important opportunities for research, training, and other initiatives for improvement.

AB  - Limited access to tertiary-level health care, limited trained pediatric nephrologists and transplant physicians, lack of facilities for dialysis, lack of an effective deceased donor program, non-affordability, and non-adherence to immunosuppressant drugs poses a major challenge to universal availability of pediatric transplantation in developing countries. We present the results of a survey which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first such published attempt at understanding the current state of pediatric renal transplantation in India. A designed questionnaire formulated by a group of pediatric nephrologists with the aim of understanding the current practice of pediatric renal transplantation was circulated to all adult and pediatric nephrologists of the country. Of 26 adult nephrologists who responded, 16 (61.5%) were involved in pediatric transplantation, and 10 of 15 (66.6%) pediatric nephrologists were involved in pediatric transplantation. Most of the centers doing transplants were private/trust institution with only three government institutions undertaking it. Induction therapy was varied among pediatric and adult nephrologists. There were only a few centers (n=5) in the country routinely doing >5 transplants per year. Preemptive transplants and protocol biopsies were a rarity. The results demonstrate lower incidence of undertaking pediatric transplants in children below 6 years, paucity of active cadaveric programs and lack of availability of trained pediatric nephrologists and staff. In contrast to these dissimilarities, the immunosuppressant use seems to be quite similar to Western registry data with majority favoring induction agent and triple immunosuppressant (steroid, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus) for maintenance. The survey also identifies major concerns in availability of this service to all regions of India as well as to all economic segments.

AB  - Until 2014, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin was the recommended standard of care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in India. This open-label phase 3b study, conducted across 14 sites in India between 31 March 2014 and 30 November 2015, evaluated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy among treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype 1 or 3 HCV infection. A total of 117 patients with genotype 1 or 3 HCV infection were randomized 1:1 to receive sofosbuvir 400mg and weight-based ribavirin (1000 or 1200mg) daily for 16 or 24weeks. Among those with genotype 1 infection, the primary efficacy endpoint of sustained virologic response at 12weeks post-treatment (SVR12) was reported in 90% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 73-98) and 96% (95% CI, 82-100) of patients following 16 and 24weeks of treatment, respectively. For patients with genotype 3 infection, SVR12 rates were 100% (95% CI, 88-100) and 93% (95% CI, 78-99) after 16 and 24weeks of therapy, respectively. Adverse events, most of which were mild or moderate in severity, occurred in 69% and 57% of patients receiving 16 and 24weeks of treatment, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were asthenia, headache and cough. Only one patient in the 24-week group discontinued treatment with sofosbuvir during this study. Overall, sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy achieved SVR12 rates 90% and was well tolerated among treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype 1 or 3 HCV infection in India.

AB  - Background & objectives: The emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in enteric fever despite the pathogen being susceptible by in vitro laboratory results, led to repeated changes in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines for this class of antibiotics to have specific and sensitive interpretative criteria. In 2015, CLSI added pefloxacin disk diffusion criteria as a surrogate marker for fluoroquinolone susceptibility. This study was carried out to evaluate the use of pefloxacin as a surrogate marker for ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin susceptibility in clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi A.
   Methods: A total of 412 strains of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A were studied for pefloxacin disk diffusion test as a surrogate marker for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin as per CLSI and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. Molecular mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones were also determined and correlated with pefloxacin susceptibility breakpoints.
   Results: Of the total 412 strains, 34 were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 33 each to levofloxacin and ofloxacin using CLSI minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. There was a positive correlation between MICs with correlation coefficients 0.917, 0.896 and 0.958 for the association between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and ofloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively (P< 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of pefloxacin as a surrogate marker using ciprofloxacin MIC as a gold standard were 100, 99.5 and 94.4 per cent, while 100, 99.2 and 91.7 per cent taking ofloxacin and levofloxacin MIC as gold standard. Mutations in target genes correlated with the pefloxacin susceptibility results.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our results showed that pefloxacin served as a good surrogate marker for the detection of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Introduction: Hemifacial spasm (HS) is a rare disorder caused by the compression of facial nerve root exit zone (REZ) at the brainstem by a vascular loop. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is a popular treatment modality for HS.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of MVD for HS by assessing the effect of the procedure from the literature published over the last 25 years.
   Materials and Methods: A systematic data review from 1992 to 2015 using specific eligibility criteria yielded 27 studies on MVD for HS, the data of which were pooled and subjected to a meta-analysis.
   Results: The pooled odds ratio (OR) revealed by the meta-analysis showed that anterior inferior cerebellar artery was the most common offending vessel in 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.8-47.7%) of the patients. Complete resolution of HS was seen in 88.5% (95% CI: 86.7-90.4%) of the patients after a long-term follow up. The complication rate was low following MVD, the most common being temporary facial paresis in 5.9% (95% CI: 4.3-7.5%) of patients.
   Conclusions: MVD is a safe and effective treatment for HS with long-term benefits and a low complication rate.

AB  - Purpose Surgical techniques for esophageal replacement (ER) in children include colon interposition, gastric tube, gastric transposition, and jejunal interposition. This review evaluates the merits and demerits of each.
   Method Surgical techniques, complications, and outcome of ER are reviewed over last seven decades.
   Resutl Colon interposition is the time-tested procedure with minimal and less serious complications. Long-term complications include reflux, halitosis, colonic segment dilatation, and anastomotic stricture, sometimes requiring surgical interventions especially for dilatation and reflux. Gastric tube is technically more risky, and associated with early serious complications like prolonged leak in neck or mediastinum, graft necrosis, and ischemia leading to stricture of the tube. Long-term results are good. Gastric transposition is much simpler, can be performed in emergency and in newborns. It involves a single anastomosis in the neck. Post-operative complications include gastric stasis, bile reflux, restricted growth, and decreased pulmonary functional capacity. Jejunal interposition has not been used extensively due to short mesentery but long-term results are good in expert hands.
   Conclusion Colon is the most preferred and safest organ for ER. Stomach is a vascular and muscular organ with lower risk of ischemia. Gastric tube is a demanding technique. Jejunum or ileum is alternative for redo cases.

AB  - Background & objectives: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can cause adverse perinatal outcome if not treated. Although insulin therapy has been the main treatment modality over decades but considering its cost and parenteral mode of administration, it does not seem to be appropriate, especially in low-resource settings. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of metformin in GDM and know its efficacy as well as adverse effect on foetus and mother.
   Methods: All pregnant women with GDM who were not controlled on medical nutrition therapy and required metformin therapy were included in the study. Careful monitoring of blood sugar was done. Development of any maternal or foetal complications and adverse effect were recorded.
   Results: A total of 2797 pregnant women were screened, of whom 233 (8.3%) were found to have GDM. Of the 64 women with GDM (28.7%) who required metformin therapy, majority (93.8%) achieved blood sugar control, whereas three (4.7%) women failed. Caesarean section rate was 54 per cent, and 15.6 per cent neonates were large for gestational age. Only two (3.1%) women had gastrointestinal side effects which were minor and got resolved with time. No case of hypoglycaemia or perinatal mortality was reported.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings indicate that metformin may be used as a safe and effective oral hypoglycaemic agent in GDM, especially in low-resource settings where cost, storage and compliance are logistic issues. However, long-term follow up studies are needed to solve issues related to its safety in pregnancy.

AB  - Background and Aims: Intestinal permeability (IP) has been shown to be increased in acute pancreatitis (AP) and is considered to be responsible for development of septic complications. However, the mechanism of increase in IP is not well studied. We studied whether alteration in tight junction proteins (TJP) has any role in altered IP in patients with AP.
   Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study conducted at a tertiary care referral center. Twenty consecutive moderate and severe AP patients fulfilling the study criteria were included along with 20 controls that underwent gastroduodenoscopy for dyspepsia. IP was measured with lactulose mannitol (LM) ratio and TJP were studied by measuring expression of claudin-2 and claudin-4 in duodenal biopsy samples. Statistical analysis was done with STATA 13.0.
   Results: IP as depicted by LM ratio was significantly higher in AP patients as compared with controls (4.659+/-10.4 vs. 0.101+/-0.297; P<0.001). Claudin-4 expression was reduced in duodenal biopsies in AP patients (P<0.001 for crypt intercellular junction and P=0.007 for crypt cytoplasm). However, LM ratio was not associated with either mortality (P=0.12) or development of infected pancreatic necrosis (P=0.3).
   Conclusions: IP is increased in AP. Alteration in TJP in the form of reduced claudin-4 expressions could be the possible mechanism for increased IP.

AB  - There is growing evidence that chronic hyperglycemia leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which exerts its effect via interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). AGE-RAGE activation results in oxidative stress and inflammation. It is well known that this mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in diabetes. Kaempferol, a dietary flavonoid, is known to possess antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, little is known about the effect of kaempferol on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats using streptozotocin (70 mg/kg; i.p.), and rats with glucose level > 250 mg/dL were considered as diabetic. Diabetic rats were treated with vehicle (2 mL/kg; i.p.) and kaempferol (20 mg/kg; i.p.) daily for a period of 28 days and on the 28th day, ischemia was produced by one-stage ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min. After completion of surgery, rats were sacrificed and the heart tissue was processed for biochemical, morphological, and molecular studies. Kaempferol pretreatment significantly reduced hyperglycemia, maintained hemodynamic function, suppressed AGE-RAGE axis activation, normalized oxidative stress, and preserved morphological alterations. In addition, there was decreased level of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and NF-kappa B), inhibition of active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 proteins, and activation of Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) a prosurvival kinase. Furthermore, it also attenuated apoptosis by reducing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3), Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells, and increasing the level of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2). In conclusion, kaempferol attenuated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats by reducing AGE-RAGE/ mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the intraoperative and early results of the bidirectional Glenn (BDG) procedure performed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using three different techniques.
   Methods: Between September 2013 and June 2015, 75 consecutive patients (mean age 42 +/- 34.4 months) undergoing BDG were randomly assigned to either technique I: open anastomosis or technique II: superior vena cava (SVC) cannulation or technique III: intermittent SVC clamping. We monitored the cerebral near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS), SVC pressure, CPB time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and neurocognitive function.
   Results: Patients in technique III had abnormal lower NIRS values during the procedure (57 +/- 7.4) compared to techniques I and II (64 +/- 7.5 and 61 +/- 8.0, P = 0.01). Postoperative SVC pressure in technique III was higher than other two groups (17.6 +/- 3.7 mmHg vs. 14.2 +/- 3.5 mmHg and 15.3 +/- 2.0 mmHg in techniques I and II, respectively = 0.0008). CPB time was highest in technique II (44 +/- 18 min) compared to techniques I and III (29 +/- 14 min and 38 +/- 16 min, P = 0.006), respectively. ICU stay was longer in technique III (30 +/- 15 h) compared to the other two techniques (22 +/- 8.5 h and 27 +/- 8.3 h in techniques I and II, respectively = 0.04). No patient experienced significant neurocognitive dysfunction.
   Conclusion: All techniques of BDG provided acceptable results. The open technique was faster and its use in smaller children merits consideration. The technique of intermittent clamping should be used as a last resort.

AB  - Hitherto poor outcomes, paucity of data and heterogeneity in International approach to Pediatric NHL (Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) prompted the need for guidelines for Indian population with vast variability in access, affordability and infrastructure across the country. These guidelines are based on consensus among the experts and best available evidence applicable to Indian setting. Evaluation of NHL should consist of easily doable and rapid tissue diagnosis (biopsy or flow cytometry of peripheral blood/malignant effusions), St Jude/IPNHLSS (International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Staging System) and risk grouping with CSF (Cerebro-spinal fluid), bone marrow, whole body imaging [CECT (Contrast enhanced computerized tomography) +/- MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging)] and blood investigations for LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase), TLS (Tumor lysis syndrome) and organ functions. Life threatening complications like SVCS (Superior vena cava syndrome)/Mediastinal syndrome and TLS need to pre-empted and promptly managed. All children with poor general condition, co-morbidities, metabolic or obstructive complications should receive a steroid or chemotherapy pro-phase first. For mature B-NHL (B cell -Non-Hodgkin lymphoma), in centres with good infrastructure and methotrexate levels, FAB-LMB-96 (French-American-British/Lymphomes Malins B) or BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster)-NHL-95 protocols may be used. In centres with limited infrastructure and/or no methotrexate levels; CHOP (Cyclophosphamide-hydroxydaunomycin-oncovin-prednisolone) (early stage) or MCP (Multi-centre protocol)-842 [all stages except CNS (Central nervous system) disease] may be used. Patients with poor early response should have escalated therapy. High-Risk B-NHL will benefit with addition of Rituximab to standard chemotherapy. Radiotherapy (RT) is not warranted. For lymphoblastic lymphoma, in centres with good infrastructure and methotrexate levels, BFM-95 protocol may be used. In centres with limited infrastructure and/or no methotrexate levels; modified MCP-841 with cytarabine, modified BFM-90 protocol with reduced-dose methotrexate or I-BFM 2009 protocol using Capizzi methotrexate may be considered. For ALCL (Anaplastic large cell lymphoma), in centres with good infrastructure and methotrexate levels, ALCL-99 protocol may be considered. In centres with limited infrastructure and/ or no methotrexate levels; CHOP (limited-stage only), modified MCP-842 protocol or APO (Adriamycin-prednisolone-oncovin) regimen may be used.

TI  - AS-OCT as a Rescue Tool During Difficult Lenticule Extraction in SMILE
T2  - JOURNAL OF REFRACTIVE SURGERY
AB  - PURPOSE: To report a case of lenticule adherent to the anterior cap during small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and its subsequent management aided by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT).
   METHODS: Case report.
   RESULTS: A 24-year-old woman presented with high myopia of -8.00 -0.50 @ 180 degrees in the right eye and -8.00 -0.25 @ 180 degrees in the left eye and underwent SMILE. In the right eye, difficulty was experienced in separating the lenticule from adjacent stroma. AS-OCT examination confirmed the presence of the lenticule adherent to the anterior stromal cap with the plane of dissection visible posterior to the lenticule. A Sinskey hook was used to lift off the peripheral edge of the lenticule from the anterior cap and the stripping of the lenticule was continued in a centripetal fashion until a small edge of the lenticule was rolled over. The lenticule was then completely separated from the overlying stromal cap and extracted through the side cut using forceps. Postoperative AS-OCT confirmed complete removal of the lenticule. Postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/40 on day 1 and 20/20 on day 30 with a clear interface.
   CONCLUSIONS: AS-OCT-guided identification of the retained lenticule followed by Sinskey hook-assisted lenticule extraction aids in completion of the surgical procedure in the same sitting with optimal visual and anatomical outcomes.

AB  - Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel is a non-selective cation channel and its role in cutaneous thermosensation is emerging. It is expressed in many areas of the brain including the preoptic area (POA)/anterior hypothalamus which is the key neural site for thermoregulation. The present study was conducted to find out the role of TRPV4 ion channel in the POA in thermoregulation. Rats preimplanted with guide cannulae with indwelling styli 2.0 mm above the POA received TRPV4 agonist/antagonist/isotonic saline injections bilaterally in the POA using an injector cannula in three separate groups of six rats each. Body temperature (Tb) was recorded telemetrically by preimplanted radio transmitter in the peritoneal cavity. The injection of TRPV4 agonist (GSK1016790A) in the POA decreased Tb while its antagonist (R191734) increased Tb. Immunohistochemical localization showed presence of TRPV4 ion channel in the POA. The results of the present study suggest that TRPV4 ion channels in the POA may play an important role in thermoregulation.

AB  - Background We comparatively assessed the performance of six simple obesity indices to identify adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in a diverse and contemporary South Asian population.
   Methods 8,892 participants aged 20-60 years in 2010-2011 were analyzed. Six obesity indices were examined: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-height ratio (WHtR), waist-hip ratio (WHR), log of the sum of triceps and subscapular skin fold thickness (LTS), and percent body fat derived from bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). We estimated models with obesity indices specified as deciles and as continuous linear variables to predict prevalent hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol and report associations (prevalence ratios, PRs), discrimination (area-under-the-curve, AUCs), and calibration (index chi 2). We also examined a composite unhealthy cardiovascular profile score summarizing glucose, lipids, and blood pressure.
   Results No single obesity index consistently performed statistically significantly better than the others across the outcome models. Based on point estimates, WHtR trended towards best performance in classifying diabetes (PR = 1.58 [1.45-1.72], AUC = 0.77, men; PR = 1.59 [1.47-1.71], AUC = 0.80, women) and hypertension (PR = 1.34 [1.26,1.42], AUC = 0.70, men; PR = 1.41 [1.33,1.50], AUC = 0.78, women). WC (mean difference = 0.24 SD [0.21- 0.27]) and WHtR (mean difference = 0.24 SD [0.21,0.28]) had the strongest associations with the composite unhealthy cardiovascular profile score in women but not in men.
   Conclusions WC and WHtR were the most useful indices for identifying South Asian adults with prevalent diabetes and hypertension. Collection of waist circumference data in South Asian health surveys will be informative for population-based CVD surveillance efforts.

AB  - HIV-1 evades host defense through mutations and recombination events, generating numerous variants in an infected patient. These variants with an undiminished virulence can multiply rapidly in order to progress to AIDS. One of the targets to intervene in HIV-1 replication is the trans-activator of transcription (Tat), a major regulatory protein that transactivates the long terminal repeat promoter through its interaction with transactivation response (TAR) RNA. In this study, HIV-1 infected patients (n = 120) from North India revealed Ser46Phe (20%) and Ser61Arg (2%) mutations in the Tat variants with a strong interaction toward TAR leading to enhanced transactivation activities. Molecular dynamics simulation data verified that the variants with this mutation had a higher binding affinity for TAR than both the wild-type Tat and other variants that lacked Ser46Phe and Ser61Arg. Other mutations in Tat conferred varying affinities for TAR interaction leading to differential transactivation abilities. This is the first report from North India with a clinical validation of CD4 counts to demonstrate the influence of Tat genetic variations affecting the stability of Tat and its interaction with TAR. This study highlights the co-evolution pattern of Tat and predominant nucleotides for Tat activity, facilitating the identification of genetic determinants for the attenuation of viral gene expression.

AB  - Mucinous adenocarcinoma represents a rare subtype of adenocarcinoma of the lung, which is frequently invasive and has a poorer prognosis. Of its wide range of imaging appearances, air-space consolidation is the most frequent pattern while cavitary form has only rarely been reported. Despite imaging advancements, the differentiation of benign and malignant cavitary lung lesions sometimes remains imperfect. We propose "Tambourine" sign on computed tomography to raise the suspicion of mucinous adenocarcinoma in a lung cavity, under appropriate clinical settings. The sign indicates an irregular cavity with undistorted prominent thick walled bronchioles within the wall and draping along thereby resembling the musical instrument "tambourine". Adjacent ground glass and internal septations may also be seen.

AB  - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a common retinal degeneration disease caused by mutation in any gene of the photo transduction cascade and results in photoreceptor dystrophy. Over decades, several animal models have been used to address the need for the elucidation of effective therapeutics and factors regulating retinal degeneration to prohibit or renew the damaged retina. However, controversies over the immune privilege of retina during cell transplantation and the role of immune modulation during RP still remain largely uninvestigated because of the lack of suitable animal models. Here, we have developed an immunocompromised mouse model, NOD. SCID-rd1, for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) by crossing CBA/J and NOD SCID mice and selecting homozygous double mutant animals for further breeding. Characterization of the newly developed RP model indicates a similar retinal degeneration pattern as CBA/J, with a decreased apoptosis rate and rhodopsin loss. It also exhibits loss of T cells, B cells and NK cells. The NOD. SCID-rd1 model is extremely useful for allogenic and xenogenic cell-based therapeutics, as indicated by the higher cell integration capacity post transplantation. We dissect the underlying role of the immune system in the progression of RP and the effect of immune deficiency on immune privilege of the eye using comparative qPCR studies of this model and the immune-competent RP model.

AB  - Interaction of nanoparticles with biological systems is a key factor influencing their efficacy as a drug delivery vehicle. The inconsistency in defining the optimal design parameters across different nanoparticle types suggests that information gained from one model system need not apply to other systems. Therefore, selection of a versatile model system is critical for such studies. Cubosomes are one of the potential drug delivery vehicles due to their biocompatibility, stability, ability to carry hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and amphiphilic drugs, and ease of surface modification. Here we report the importance of surface architecture of cubosomes by comparing their cellular uptake mechanism with poly-epsilon-lysine (P epsilon L)-coated cubosomes. Uncoated cubosomes entered cells by an energy-independent, cholesterol-dependent mechanism, whereas P epsilon L-coated cubosomes relied on energy-dependent mechanisms to enter the endosomes. As endosomal entrapment was evaded by uncoated cubosomes, they can be preferably used for cytosolic delivery of therapeutic agents.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular diseases are more prevalent and severe in Asian Indians. Simple diet-based strategies are important for prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of oats consumption on lipid parameters in mildly hypercholesterolemic Asian Indians living in India.
   Methods: A short-term, prospective, open-labeled, randomized controlled, parallel group study was conducted. Mildly hypercholesterolemic (total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL and < 240 mg/dL) subjects (n = 80) were randomized into two groups: intervention (n = 40) and usual diet (n = 40). Sample size was calculated for a two-group parallel superiority randomized control trial. Out of 80 enrolled subjects 69 subjects completed the study; 33 in the control group and 36 in the intervention group. In the intervention group, patients were served 70 g of oats twice a day in the form of porridge and upma (A thick porridge from oats with seasonings and vegetables) under observation at the study site. Lipid parameters were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention.
   Results: There was a reduction of 3.1% in total cholesterol levels in the control group as against 8.1% reduction in the intervention group (p < 0.02). Greater reductions were also seen in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention group (11.6%) as compared to control group (4.1%, p < 0.04) over a period of 28 days.
   Conclusion: Daily consumption of 3 g of soluble fiber from 70 g of oats leads to beneficial effects on the lipid parameters, specifically total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic Asian Indians. Large scale studies over a longer period of intervention are required to further establish the cholesterollowering effect of oat fiber.

AB  - Background: Pre-diagnosis attrition needs to be addressed urgently if we are to make progress in improving MDR-TB case detection and achieve universal access to MDR-TB care. We report the pre-diagnosis attrition, along with factors associated, and turnaround times related to the diagnostic pathway among patient with presumptive MDR-TB in Bhopal district, central India (2014).
   Methods: Study was conducted under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme setting. It was a retrospective cohort study involving record review of all registered TB cases in Bhopal district that met the presumptive MDR-TB criteria (eligible for DST) in 2014. In quarter 1, Line Probe Assay (LPA) was used if sample was smear/culture positive. Quarter 2 onwards, LPA and Cartridge-based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CbNAAT) was used for smear positive and smear negative samples respectively. Pre-diagnosis attrition was defined as failure to undergo DST among patients with presumptive MDR-TB (as defined by the programme).
   Results: Of 770 patients eligible for DST, 311 underwent DST and 20 patients were diagnosed as having MDR-TB. Pre-diagnosis attrition was 60% (459/770). Among those with pre-diagnosis attrition, 91% (417/459) were not identified as 'presumptive MDR-TB' by the programme. TAT [median (IQR)] to undergo DST after eligibility was 4 (0, 10) days. Attrition was more than 40% across all subgroups. Age more than 64 years; those from a medical college; those eligible in quarter 1; patients with presumptive criteria ` previously treated -recurrent TB', ` treatment after loss-to-follow-up' and ` previously treated-others'; and patients with extra-pulmonary TB were independent risk factors for not undergoing DST.
   Conclusion: High pre-diagnosis attrition was contributed by failure to identify and refer patients. Attrition reduced modestly with time and one factor that might have contributed to this was introduction of CbNAAT in quarter 2 of 2014. General health system strengthening which includes improvement in identification/referral and patient tracking with focus on those with higher risk for not undergoing DST is urgently required.

AB  - Background: Development of tolerance to analgesic effect, on chronic administration of morphine, limits its clinical usefulness in pain management. S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) used for arthritis and approved as a supplement in many countries including United States was evaluated for reducing morphine tolerance.
   Methods: Male Wistar rats were used. The analgesic activity was determined using tail flick analgesiometer (Columbus Instruments, USA). Rats given morphine (7 mg/kg), intraperitoneally (i.p.), once daily for 5 days developed tolerance to analgesic effect. To evaluate the effect of SAM on morphine tolerance, SAM 800 mg/kg was administered orally (p.o.), 45 min prior to each dose of morphine. The analgesic activity of SAM and opioidergic component in its activity was also evaluated.
   Results: Co-administration of morphine and SAM reversed morphine tolerance. SAM exhibited analgesic effect after repeated administration which was reversed by naloxone administration.
   Conclusion: Since safety of SAM on chronic use is documented it can be a good option in morphine tolerance. Role in drug addiction and withdrawal should also be evaluated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Malaria is major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The highest incidence of malaria in the world is South East Asia. India is most affected country followed by Indonesia and Myanmar. The prevalence of malaria varies according to geographical region. Diagnosis of malaria infection has been underestimated. Here, we report a case of under-diagnosed complicated vivax malaria in one-yr-old child in 2016. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can reduce both morbidity and mortality in complicated malaria infection.

AB  - To study the effect of primary and delayed primary closure of skin incision on wound outcome in patients with non-traumatic ileal perforation, 68 patients of ileal perforation were studied in a prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were divided into ileostomy and non-ileostomy groups, both of which were then randomized into two subgroups each depending on whether skin was closed primarily or in a delayed primary manner. Wound infection and dehiscence were the main outcome parameters studied. The data collected was analyzed using appropriate statistical tools taking significant p value at 5 %. Most patients were 21-30 years of age. Male:female ratio was 3.2:1. The overall incidence of wound infection was 63 %. Wound infection was strongly associated with the incidence of superficial wound dehiscence and total wound dehiscence that were 11.76 and 47 %, respectively. Mortality was 10.3 %. Methodology of wound closure has no significant impact on incidence of wound infection, wound dehiscence, and mortality, although the onset of wound complications is significantly delayed with delayed primary closure of the skin.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to comparatively evaluate the pharmaceutical characteristics of various marketed generic formulations of prostaglandin analogue latanoprost in the Indian market. Three generics of latanoprost and one branded (Xalatan) formulation (five vials each) were obtained from authorized agents from the respective commercial sourcing having the same batch number. These formulations were coded, and the labels were removed. At a standardized room temperature of 25 A degrees C, the concentration, osmolarity, drop size, pH, and total drops per vial were determined for Xalatan and all the generics of latanoprost. The concentration of various brands varied between 50.49 +/- 0.36 and 58.90 +/- 0.52 A mu g/ml as compared to the standard labeled concentration of 50 A mu g/ml on the latanoprost vials. The concentration of drugs in individual drop varied from 1.30 +/- 0.05 to 1.78 +/- 0.04 A mu g/drop. The volume of drug formulation per bottle varied from 2.4 +/- 0.12 to 2.6 +/- 0.09 ml/bottle. The number of drops per bottle varied from minimum of 88.60 +/- 0.10 drops to maximum of 102.0 +/- 4.3 drops across all the formulations, while the drop size varied from 25.72 +/- 2.70 to 29.97 +/- 1.38 A mu l. The osmolarity of 2/4 drugs was within 300 mOs M (+/- 10 %). The specific gravity varied between 0.98 +/- 0.01 and 1.007 +/- 0.01, while pH was between 7.05 +/- 0.004 and 7.13 +/- 0.005. Two of the generic brands were outside the United States pharmacopoeia limits (+/- 10%) for ophthalmic formulation, with concentration exceeding the limits by 3 % (p = 0.151) and 8 % (p = 0.008), respectively. This pilot study highlights that there are significant variations in the drug concentrations and physical properties of generic latanoprost formulations. Although none of the brands had concentrations below the recommended level, two of the brands had concentrations exceeding the limits by 3 and 8 %, respectively.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most lethal communicable disease globally. As per the WHO Global TB Report (2015), 9.6 million cases were reported in year 2014 alone. The receptor-like protein kinase, PknB is crucial for sustained mycobacterial growth. Therefore, PknB can be a potential target to develop anti-tuberculosis drugs. In present study, we performed a comparative study to investigate binding efficacies of three phytomolecules namely, Demethylcalabaxanthone, Cryptolepine hydrochloride and Ermanin. 3D structures of PknB and phytomolecules were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2FUM) and PubChem Chemical Compound Database, respectively. PknB was set to be rigid and phytochemicals were kept free to rotate. All computational simulations were carried out using Autodock 4.0 on Windows platform. In-silico study demonstrated a strong complex formation (large binding constants and low Delta G) between phytomolecules and target protein PknB of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, Demethylcalabaxanthone was able to bind PknB more strongly (Kb = 6.8 x 10(5)M(-1), Delta G =-8.06 kcal/mol) than Cryptolepine hydrochloride (Kb =3.06 x 10(5) M-1, Delta G =-7.58 kcal/mol) and Ermanin (Kb = 9.8 x 10(4)M(-1), Delta G =-6.9 kcal/mol). These in silico analysis indicate that phytomolecules are capable to target PknB protein efficiently which is vital for mycobacterial survival and therefore can be excellent alternatives to conventional anti-tuberculosis drugs.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To respond to the situation of high prevalence and need for effective treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in low-resource settings, syndromic diagnostic approach was recommended by the World Health Organization and was adopted by National AIDS Control Organization at the primary health centre level. A retrospective study was undertaken in symptomatic patients attending an STI clinic to validate the syndromic approach for genitourinary discharge syndrome. For aetiological diagnosis, culture and/or polymerase chain reaction was used. An infective aetiology could be established in only 20% (106 of 530) patients. The present data call for an early appraisal and review of the diagnostic policy by national authorities on syndromic case management.

AB  - Background: Extragenital sites are believed to serve as hidden reservoirs for ongoing transmission of infection. In addition, treatment for rectal Chlamydia infection is different from that of genital Chlamydia infection. Many cases may be missed if only genital testing is performed.
   Methods: Between September 2015 and August 2016, all male and female attendees at an STI clinic of a tertiary care hospital with genital and or extragenital discharge were screened for CT infection. Samples included endocervical swabs in women, urethral swabs and urine samples in men. Rectal and pharyngeal samples were collected wherever indicated.
   Results: Of total of 439 samples collected from 417 patients (245 women and 172 men), samples from women had a high positivity rate than men. (13.6% and 11%). High rates of rectal CT was detected nearly 30.43%. All rectal positive cases except one had no concomitant genital infection.
   Conclusions: Prevalence of extragenital Chlamydia is increasing in men as well as women. What needs to be stressed on is the sexual behaviour of an individual and not the sexual identity. Further studies are needed to help formulate guidelines and recommendations for extragenital screening in a population. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Data about the significance of F-18-FOG PET at interim assessment and end of treatment in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are limited. Methods: Patients (<= 18 y) with HL were prospectively evaluated with contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) and PET combined with low-dose CT (PET/CT) at baseline, after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and after completion of treatment. Revised International Working Group (RIW) criteria and Deauville 5 point-scale for response assessment by PET/CT were used. All patients received doxorubicin (Adriamycin), bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine chemotherapy along with involved-field radiotherapy (25 Gy) for early stage (IA, IB, and IIA) and advanced stage (IIB-IV) with bulky disease. Results: Of the 57 enrolled patients, median follow-up was 81.6 mo (range, 11-97.5 mo). Treatment decisions were based on CECT. At baseline, PET/CT versus CECT identified 67 more disease sites; 23 patients (40.3%) were upstaged and of them in 9 patients (39%) upstaging would have affected treatment decision; notably none of these patients relapsed. The specificity of interim PET/CT based on RIW criteria (61.5%) and Deauville criteria (91.4%) for predicting relapse was higher than CECT (40.3%) (P = 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Event-free survival based on interim PET/CT (RIW) response was 93.3 +/- 4.1 versus 89.6 +/- 3.8 (positive vs. negative scan, respectively; P = 0.44). The specificity of posttreatment PET/CT (Deauville) was 95.7% versus 76.4% by CECT (P = 0.006). Posttreatment PET/CT (Deauville) showed significantly inferior overall survival in patients with positive scan versus negative scan results (66.4 +/- 22.5 vs. 94.5 +/- 2.0, P = 0.029). Conclusion: Interim PET/CT has better specificity, and use of Deauville criteria further improves it. Escalation of therapy based on interim PET in pediatric HL needs further conclusive evidence to justify its use. Posttreatment PET/CT (Deauville) predicts overall survival and has better specificity in comparison to conventional imaging.

AB  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disease, caused by mutation of the AAT gene. Accumulation of mutated AAT protein aggregates in hepatocytes leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in impairment of liver functions and, in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas decline of AAT levels in sera is responsible for pulmonary emphysema. In advanced liver disease, the only option for treatment is liver transplantation, whereas AAT replacement therapy is therapeutic for emphysema. Given that hepatocytes are the primary affected cells in AATD, we investigated whether transplantation of bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells in transgenic mice expressing human AATZ ( the Z variant of AAT) confers any competitive advantages compared to host cells that could lead to pathological improvement. Mouse BM progenitors and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) appeared to contribute in replacement of 40% and 13% host hepatocytes, respectively. Transplantation of cells resulted in decline of globule-containing hepatocytes, improvement in proliferation of globuledevoid hepatocytes from the host-derived hepatocytes, and apparently, donor-derived cells. Further analyses revealed that transplantation partially improves liver pathology as reflected by inflammatory response, fibrosis, and apoptotic death of hepatocytes. Cell therapy was also found to improve liver glycogen storage and sera glucose level in mice expressing human AATZ mice. These overall improvements in liver pathology were not restricted to transplantation of mouse BM cells. Preliminary results also showed that following transplantation of human BM-derived MSCs, globule-containing hepatocytes declined and donorderived cells expressed human AAT protein. Conclusion: These results suggest that BM stem cell transplantation may be a promising therapy for AATD-related liver disease.

AB  - Hemispherectomy is a complex multistep procedure with a steep learning curve. Several surgical approaches have been developed, but each requires considerable practice to master. Four experienced pediatric neurosurgeons, who participated in the 2014 Gothenburg Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Meeting, provided succinct technical summaries of four hemispherectomy approaches: modified functional hemispherectomy, peri-insular hemispherotomy, parasagittal hemispherotomy, and endoscopic-assisted hemispherotomy. No clinical or outcome data are included. Our intention is to reduce the slope and length of the learning curve for surgeons and to improve the understanding of the technical details of hemispherectomy surgery by nonsurgeonmembers of epilepsy teams.

AB  - Background & objectives: Breathing exercises are believed to modulate the cardiovascular oscillations in the body. To assess the validity of the assumption and understand the underlying mechanism, the key autonomic regulatory parameters such as heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were recorded during controlled slow yogic breathing. Alternate nostril breathing (ANB) was selected as the yogic manoeuvre.
   Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (age 30 +/- 3.8 yr) participated in the study. ANB was performed at a breathing frequency of 5 breaths per minute (bpm). In each participant, the electrocardiogram, respiratory movements, beat-to-beat BP and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded for five minutes each: before, during and after ANB. The records were analyzed for HRV, BPV and BRS.
   Results: During ANB, HRV analysis showed significant increase in the standard deviation of all NN intervals, low-frequency (LF) component, LF/HF (low frequency/high frequency) ratio and significant decrease in the HF component. BPV analysis showed a significant increase in total power in systolic BPV (SBPV), diastolic BPV (DBPV) and mean BPV. BRS analysis showed a significant increase in the total number of sequences in SBPV and DBPV and significant augmentation of alpha-LF and reduction in alpha-HF. The power spectrum showed a dominant peak in HRV at 0.08 Hz (LF component) similar to the respiratory frequency. The acute short-term change in circulatory control system declined immediately after the cessation of slow yogic breathing (ANB) and remained elevated in post-ANB stage as compared to the pre-ANB.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Significant increase in cardiovascular oscillations and baroreflex recruitments during-ANB suggested a dynamic interaction between respiratory and cardiovascular system. Enhanced phasic relationship with some delay indicated the complexity of the system. It indicated that respiratory and cardiovascular oscillations were coupled through multiple regulatory mechanisms, such as mechanical coupling, baroreflex and central cardiovascular control.

AB  - Background MicroRNA (miRNA)-200c and miRNA-141 are tumour suppressors, which regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to tumour invasion and metastasis in various malignancies. miRNA200c and miRNA-141 maintain the epithelial phenotype by post-transcriptionally inhibiting the E-cadherin repressors, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB) 1 and ZEB2. The present study was performed to determine the prognostic significance of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141, and their association with EMT markers ZEB1, ZEB2 and E-cadherin in eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC).
   Methods Expression levels of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 were determined in 42 eyelid SGC cases by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Their association with ZEB1, ZEB2 and E-cadherin was determined by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier plots and Spearman's rank correlation tests were applied to analyse the data. Patients were followed up for 7-44 months.
   Results Low expression levels of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 were seen in 36/42 (86%) and 28/42 (67%) cases, respectively. Low miRNA-200c correlated significantly with large tumour size (p=0.03) and poor differentiation (p= 0.03). Low miRNA-141 correlated significantly with large tumour size (p=0.02) and lymph node metastasis (p= 0.04). Survival analysis revealed that patients with low miRNA-200c (p<0.05) and miRNA-141 expression (p= 0.07) had shorter disease-free survival. There was a significant association of both miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 with E-cadherin and ZEB2 expression.
   Conclusions Low levels of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 in patients with eyelid SGC facilitates tumour progression by promoting EMT and miRNA-200c has emerged as a novel potential predictor of survival.

AB  - Background The increased risk of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis is well known. The risk of sporadic colorectal cancer in Asian populations is considered low and risk estimates of colorectal cancer related to ulcerative colitis from Asia vary. This meta-analysis is an Asian perspective on the risk of colorectal cancer related to ulcerative colitis.
   Methods We searched PubMed and Embase for terms related to colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis from inception to July 1, 2016. The search for published articles was done by country for all countries in Asia. We included studies with information on the prevalence and cumulative risk of colorectal cancer at various timepoints. A random-effects meta-analysis was done to calculate the pooled prevalence as well as a cumulative risk at 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years of disease.
   Findings Our search identified 2575 articles; of which 44 were eligible for inclusion. Our analysis included a total of 31 287 patients with ulcerative colitis with a total of 293 reported colorectal cancers. Using pooled prevalence estimates from various studies, the overall prevalence was 0.85% (95% CI0.65-1.04). The risks for colorectal cancer were 0.02% (95% CI0.00-0.04) at 10 years, 4.81% (3.26-6.36) at 20 years, and 13.91% (7.09-20.72) at 30 years. Subgroup analysis by stratifying the studies according to region or period of the study did not reveal any significant differences.
   Interpretation We found the risk of colorectal cancer in Asian patients with ulcerative colitis was similar to recent estimates in Europe and North America. Adherence to screening is therefore necessary. Larger population-based, prospective studies are required for better estimates of the risk.

AB  - Leptospirosis has been recognised as an emerging global public health problem. The aim of our study was to explore the epidemiological and clinical pattern of disease occurrence in suspected cases and to search for any existing co-infections. Ours was a retrospective study in patients with acute febrile illness in north India over a period of three years (April 2011 to June 2014). Serological diagnosis of leptospirosis was made using the PanBio IgM ELISA kit. Using modified Faine's criteria, presumptive and possible diagnosis was made in 57% and 34% cases, respectively. Most of the affected population was resident in north and central India. Nineteen patients showed co-infection with other common pathogens prevailing locally. There is a need to increase awareness and understand the local sero-epidemiological pattern of leptospirosis so that timely preventive and curative action may be taken by healthcare authorities.

AB  - Context: Cryptosporidium spp. is a zoonotic infection, now being recognized as a significant cause of diarrhea in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. However, there still exist significant knowledge gaps in its estimated global burden, epidemiology, diagnosis and management.
   Evidence acquisition: A semi-systematic search was performed across PubMed to select studies on epidemiological burden of cryptosporidium diarrhea using the following keywords- ['crytosporidiosis' OR 'cryptosporidium']AND ['diarrhea' OR 'diarrhoea']. Articles were included if participants were 'Humans', belonged to pediatric (0-18 y) age group, and were published after 1990. The results were compiled separately for acute and persistent diarrhea.
   Results: Cryptosporidium spp is commonly detected in stools of both cases (acute/persistent diarrhea) and asymptomatic controls. The prevalence is higher in children with diarrhea than non-diarrheal controls (1.7-35% vs 0.3-15%); varying widely across different studies. The positivity rate is higher in younger children (<2 years) suffering from diarrhea. The main symptoms associated with cryptosporidiosis include fever, vomiting and abdominal pain with propensity for prolonged duration of diarrhea. It predisposes to malnutrition, which is also a risk factor for cryptosporidiosis. The prevalence is higher in HIV positive patients; certain socio-demographic factors play a more important role than mere geographical distribution for infection.
   Conclusions: The high positivity rates during both acute and persistent diarrhea highlights the need to suspect this infection even in immunocompetent children.

AB  - Cryptococcosis in HIV-seronegative patients is rarely reported from India. This prospective study was conducted to look for cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-seronegative individuals and compare their laboratory features to cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-seropositive patients. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected from 153 suspected cases of meningitis and subjected to India ink preparation, antigen detection, and culture. Nineteen samples tested positive for Cryptococcus neoformans infection. Seventeen and two patients were HIV reactive and nonreactive, respectively. In vitro susceptibility of C. neoformans isolates to fl uconazole and amphotericin B was performed using standard broth microdilution method and E-test. Eighteen strains were susceptible to amphotericin B, while fl uconazole was reported susceptible in 15 strains. Hence, index of suspicion of C. neoformans infection as possible cause of meningitis must be maintained even in HIV-negative patients. Use of amphotericin B for treating C. neoformans meningitis should be restricted to prevent any increase in resistance.

AB  - While proctitis is caused both by infectious and noninfectious causes, infectious causes are acquired typically sexually. Chlamydia trachomatis, which is the most frequent bacterial pathogen causing sexually transmitted infections worldwide, is one of the causative agents of proctitis. We report a case history of a bisexual male who presented to us with rectal bleeding. The colonoscopy showed a nodular ulcerated lesion in the rectum suggestive of rectal malignancy, but biopsies from rectal mass did not reveal malignancy. A rectal biopsy was positive for C. trachomatis by polymerase chain reaction assay, and a diagnosis of C. trachomatis proctitis was made. Considering the invasive anorectal disease and patient's sexual history, he was treated with prolonged doxycycline therapy as per Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's treatment recommendation for lymphogranuloma venereum. A high index of clinical suspicion along with appropriate microbiological testing can clinch the diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection.

AB  - Purpose: Identifying factors involved in the development of drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) remains a challenge. Candidate gene studies have shown modulation of resistance to drugs by various multidrug resistance proteins in DRE. However the resistance to drugs in DRE could be more complex and multifactorial involving molecules in different pharmacokinetic processes. In this study for the first time we have analyzed the relative expression of four molecules with different drug resistance mechanisms in two most common DRE pathologies, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) with respect to each other and also with different non-epileptic controls.
   Methods: Brain tissues resected from MTLE (n = 16) and FCD type I and II (n=12) patients who had undergone surgery were analysed for mRNA levels of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1(MRP1), major vault protein (MVP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and one drug metabolising enzyme (UGT1A4) as compared to non-epileptic controls which were tissues resected from tumor periphery (n=6) and autopsy tissues (n=4) by quantitative PCR.
   Results: We found significant upregulation of MVP and BCRP whereas MRP1 and UGT1A4 were unaltered in both pathologies. While upregulation of BCRP was significantly higher in MTLE (9.34 +/- 0.45; p < 0.05), upregulation of MVP was significantly higher in FCD (2.94 +/- 0.65; p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: We propose that upregulation of BCRP and MVP is associated with MTLE and FCD and these molecules not only may have the potential to predict pathology specific phenotypes but may also have therapeutic potential as adjunct treatment in these pathologies.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results.
   FINDINGS In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globallywas prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancerwas the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancerwas breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancerwas also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs forwomen (523000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1%[95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of hiatal hernia repair (HHR) on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in morbidly obese patients with hiatus hernia undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a retrospective study involving ten morbidly obese patients with large hiatus hernia diagnosed on pre-operative endoscopy who underwent LSG and simultaneous HHR. The patients were assessed for symptoms of GERD using a Severity symptom score (SS) questionnaire and anti-reflux medications. RESULTS: Of the ten patients, five patients had GERD preoperatively. At the mean follow-up of 11.70 +/- 6.07 months after surgery, four patients (80%) showed complete resolution while one patient complained of persistence of symptoms. Endoscopy in this patient revealed resolution of esophagitis indicating that the persistent symptoms were not attributable to reflux. The other five patients without GERD remained free of any symptom attributable to GERD. Thus, in all ten patients, repair of hiatal hernia (HH) during LSG led to either resolution of GERD or prevented any new onset symptom related to GER. CONCLUSION: In morbidly obese patients with HH with or without GERD undergoing LSG, repair of the hiatus hernia helps in amelioration of GERD and prevents any new onset GER. Thus, the presence of HH should not be considered as a contraindication for LSG.

AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the temporal changes in vascular function during pregnancy in healthy women and in those with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Assessment of vascular function was done at three time points, 11-13(+6) weeks(+days), 20-22(+6) weeks(+days) and 30-32(+6) weeks(+days), by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), augmentation index (AIx) and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) in women (n=100) with singleton pregnancies. Out of the 100 women, 20 developed GDM, who were compared with 20 healthy, age-matched pregnant women in a nested case-control design. Women with GDM had lower FMD% in the third compared to the first trimester (6.77 (4.36-9.96) vs 9.76 (6.66-16.61)%; p = 0.026); however, FMD% was similar on inter-group comparison between GDM and healthy pregnancies. AIx was significantly higher in GDM than healthy pregnancies at both first (15.35 +/- 10.57 vs 6.45 +/- 9.81%; p<0.05) and second trimesters (15.00 +/- 8.44 vs 2.50 +/- 9.01%; p<0.05). A higher AIx in early pregnancy differentiates women with GDM from those with healthy pregnancies.

AB  - Rising cancer incidence and mortality in India emphasize the need to address the increasing burden of this disease and the stark inequities in access to radiotherapy and other essential medical treatments. State-of-the-art technology is available within the private sector and a few hospitals in the public sector, but 75% of patients in the public sector in India do not have access to timely radiotherapy. This inequity in access to radiotherapy in the public sector is amplified in rural areas, where most of India's population lives. A long-term government commitment to machine purchase and human resource development in the public sector is needed to improve access. A number of innovative initiatives to improve cancer treatment and access have emerged that could support such an investment. These include local production of equipment, twinning programs between institutions in high- and low-income countries to exchange knowledge and expertise, and nongovernmental and state-sponsored schemes to sponsor and support patients in their cancer journey. Strengthening of cancer registries and regulatory bodies with authority to enforce minimum standards is also required to improve care. The more uniform and frequent availability of high-quality radiotherapy can improve cancer outcomes and may be regarded as a marker of a comprehensive and equitable system of health care delivery.

AB  - Objective To assess the prevalence of vitamin B-12 and folate deficiencies among children residing at high altitude regions of Himachal Pradesh, India.
   Methods A total of 215 school children in the age group of 6-18 y were included. Biochemical estimation of serum vitamin B-12 and folate levels was undertaken using chemiluminescence immunoassay method. The consumption pattern of foods high in dietary vitamin B-12 and folate was recorded using Food Frequency Questionnaire.
   Results The median levels (interquartile range) of serum vitamin B-12 and folate were 326 (259-395) pg/ml and 7.7 (6-10) ng/ml respectively. The prevalence of vitamin B-12 and folate deficiency amongst school age children was found as 7.4% and 1.5% respectively.
   Conclusions A low prevalence of vitamin B-12 and folate deficiencies was found amongst children aged 6-18 y living at high altitude regions in India. This is possibly due to high frequency of consumption of foods rich in vitamin B-12 and folate.

AB  - We describe a unique case of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) in a 19-year-old male presenting with the chief complaint of seizures. On radiology, the tumor was located in the temporal lobe. It was cortically based and solid cystic in nature. Light microscopy showed pleomorphic large polygonal cells with inclusions, nuclear clustering, lipidization, and foamy cytoplasm intermingled with spindle cells arranged in sweeping pattern and focally containing cytoplasmic brownish black pigment. The pigment stained black with Fontana Masson stain and bleached with potassium permanganate. Gomori silver stain showed reticulin fibers surrounding individual tumor cells as well as groups of cells. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were positive for GFAP, S-100 and focally for synaptophysin and CD34 but negative for HMB-45. CD34 revealed a specific membranous pattern around individual cells as well as groups of cells along the fibers replicating a reticulin pattern. The ultrastructural examination showed supporting melanosomes, thus confirming the melanin pigment. Sequencing for BRAF V600E showed a heterozygous mutation. To our knowledge only five cases of PXA with melanin pigment have been reported and none of which described BRAF V600E mutation analysis. This case provides further insight into the origin and pathogenesis of pigmented astrocytic tumor, additionally highlighting the characteristic CD34 staining pattern.

AB  - Background: There is little information available on the type, pattern, trend, and demographic differentials of psychiatric cases attending a subdistrict level facility in India. Our objectives were to describe the sociodemographic profile of the patients availing the psychiatric outpatient department services and document the diagnosis.
   Materials and Methods: This study is based on a retrospective analysis of routinely recorded administrative data collected during psychiatry consultations that took place between January 2010 and June 2014, at the subdistrict level hospital, Ballabgarh, Faridabad district, Haryana, Northern India. The data were abstracted in Microsoft Excel, scrutinized for duplicates, and cleaned in terms of the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision coding. Descriptive analysis was done for dependent variables and continuous variables were compared using independent t-test.
   Results: A total of 2806 people (new registrations) were provided psychiatric consultations between January 2010 and June 2014. The mean age of males was 33.7 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.9, 34.5) and of females was 35.6 years (95% CI, 34.9, 36.3). Neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) comprised the major category of diagnoses with 661 cases (24%), followed by unspecified mental disorders (F99) with 528 cases (19%), mood (affective) disorders (F30-F39) with 448 cases (16%), and episodic and paroxysmal disorders (G40-G47) with 334 cases (12%).
   Conclusions: We reported an increase in level and trend in the monthly attendance of patients who required psychiatric at a secondary care hospital in Northern India. We suggest that setting up of mental health units only at district hospital might not be a sufficient health system's approach as has been envisaged under the District Mental Health Program.

AB  - Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection, relatively rare in the absence of impaired immunity. Lung or brain may be involved. Cryptococcal dissemination is rare in absence of impaired immunity, and documentation of alone adrenal involvement without central nervous system involvement is rare. Here, we present a case of an immunocompetent patient presented with bilateral adrenal cryptococcosis with adrenal insufficiency, without central nervous system involvement and 18F-FDG PET/CT correctly identified the residual disease.

AB  - Background: Despite an increasing emphasis on workplace-based assessment (WPBA) during medical training, the existing assessment system largely relies on summative assessment while formative assessment is less valued. Various tools have been described for WPBA, mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) being one of them. Mini-CEX is well accepted in Western countries, however, reports of its use in India are scarce. We conducted this study to assess acceptability and feasibility of mini-CEX as a formative assessment tool for WPBA of surgical postgraduate students in an Indian setting. Methods: Faculty members and 2(nd) year surgical residents were sensitized toward mini-CEX and requisite numbers of exercises were conducted. The difficulties during conduction of these exercises were identified, recorded, and appropriate measures were taken to address them. At the conclusion, the opinion of residents and faculty members regarding their experience with mini-CEX was taken using a questionnaire. The results were analyzed using simple statistical tools. Results: Nine faculty members out of 11 approached participated in the study (81.8%). All 16 2(nd) year postgraduate surgical residents participated (100%). Sixty mini-CEX were conducted over 7 months. Each resident underwent 3u5 encounters. The mean time taken by the assessor for observation was 12.3 min (8u30 min) while the mean feedback time was 4.2 min (3u10 min). The faculty reported good overall satisfaction with mini-CEX and found it acceptable as a formative assessment tool. Three faculty members (33.3%) reported mini-CEX as more time-consuming while 2 (22.2%) found it difficult to carry the exercises often. All residents accepted mini-CEX and most of them reported good to high satisfaction with the exercises conducted. Conclusions: Mini-CEX is well accepted by residents and faculty as a formative assessment tool. It is feasible to utilize mini-CEX for WPBA of postgraduate students of surgery.

AB  - Objective: Direct microscopic visualization is the most specific method for detecting intestinal parasites and is commonly achieved by stool examination or mucosal biopsy. However, postfixation, the intestinal biopsy fragment is often curled, and the entire surface of the biopsied mucosa is seldom viewed microscopically. Tissue processing further distorts morphology of the organisms and causes diagnostic difficulties. Examining multiple sections for parasite detection is time-consuming and often requires aid of special stains and/or immunohistochemistry. To overcome these disadvantages, we hypothesized that the fixative in which biopsies are transferred may provide a valid representation of the biopsied mucosal surface and therefore aid in the identification of mucosal surface parasites. Materials and Methods: Formalin in which biopsies were transferred was retained, stored at 4 degrees C and processed with a cytocentrifuge. Totally, 120 consequent duodenal biopsy fixatives were processed in this way and the cytocentrifuged smears visualized after May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining. Findings of these smears were correlated with their corresponding formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. Results: Cytocentrifuged formalin preparations were found to be representative of the mucosal surface contents. Giardia trophozoites were visualized in 10/120 preparations with distinct morphological characteristics which were seldom appreciable in tissue sections, eliminating the need for special stains. Furthermore, two of the corresponding histology sections did not demonstrate the parasites despite step sections, while in one case few parasites could be identified in the step sections. Conclusions: Cytocentrifuged fixative preparation is a simple and cost-effective technique which can be routinely employed for intestinal parasite characterization.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that, in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) would result in less downstream testing than coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA).
   In this international, randomized trial, mildly symptomatic patients with an intermediate likelihood of having CAD, and asymptomatic patients at intermediate risk of cardiac events, underwent either initial stress-rest MPI or CCTA. The primary outcome was downstream noninvasive or invasive testing at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included cumulative effective radiation dose (ERD) and costs at 12 months.
   We recruited 303 patients (151 MPI and 152 CTA) from 6 centers in 6 countries. The initial MPI was abnormal in 29% (41/143) and CCTA in 56% (79/141) of patients. Fewer patients undergoing initial stress-rest MPI had further downstream testing at 6 months (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.91, P = 0.023). There was a small increase in the median cumulative ERD with MPI (9.6 vs. 8.8 mSv, P = 0.04), but no difference in costs between the two strategies at 12 months.
   In the management of patients with suspected CAD, a strategy of initial stress MPI is substantially less likely to require further downstream testing than initial testing with CCTA.

AB  - Background: Depression is one of the roost researched emotional responses after stroke and shows that the emotional impact of aphasia can have a marked negative impact on recovery, response to rehabilitation, and psychosocial adjustment. There is an evident dearth of validated instruments to assess depression in people with aphasia including Hindi, the national language of the country. Aims: The aim of this study was to translate and adapt the original English version of widely used hospital version of Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire (SADQ- I 0) to Hindi. Subjects and Methods: English version of SADQ-10 was translated and adapted for the use in Hindi-speaking population in concordance to the WHO guidelines. Statistical Analysis Used: The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis oldie data was performed using SPSS, version 16. to compute the test retest reliability. Results: The Hindi version of SADQ-10 yielded an overa Thigh test retest reliability (ICC =0.91) as well as internal consistency (alpha = 0.98), which in turn were comparable to the original instrument in English. Conclusions: SADQ10-Hindi may assist the identification of depressed mood in patients with speech and language impairment in an Indian population as well. It is an easy to administer and quick test which can he used by health-care professionals in a hospital- or community-based settings.

AB  - Aim of the studies to synthesized chitosan nanoparticles by an ionic interaction procedure. The nanoparticles were characterized by physicochemical Methods like, DLS, TEM, Surface potential measurements, FT-IR and DSC. The average particle size of chitosan and carboplatin nanoparticles was found to be 277.25 +/- 11.37 nm and 289.30 +/- 8.15 nm and zeta potential was found to be 31 +/- 3.14 mV and 33 +/- 2.15 mV respectively with low polydispersity index. The maximum entrapment of carboplatin in nanoparticles was a spherical shape with a positive charge. The maximum encapsulation and loading efficiencies of carboplatin (5 mg/ml) were obtained to be 58.43% and 13.27% respectively. The nanocarboplatin was better blood compatibility as compared to chitosan nanoparticles. Finally, the cytotoxic effects of the carboplatin loaded chitosan nanoparticles were tested in-vitro against breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. Our studies showed that the chitosan nanoparticles could be used as a promising candidate for drug delivery for the therapeutic treatment of breast cancer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drug-induced photosensitivity occurs when a drug is capable of absorbing radiation from the sun (usually ultraviolet A) leading to chemical reactions that cause cellular damage (phototoxicity) or, more rarely, form photoallergens (photoallergy). The manifestation varies considerably in presentation and severity from mild pain to severe blistering. Despite screening strategies and guidelines in place to predict photoreactive drugs during development there are still new drugs coming onto the market that cause photosensitivity. Thus, there is a continuing need for dermatologists to be aware of the different forms of presentation and the culprit drugs. Management usually involves photoprotection and cessation of drug treatment. However, there are always cases where the culprit drug is indispensable. The reason why some patients are susceptible while others remain asymptomatic is not known. A potential mechanism for the phototoxic reactions is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and there are a number of reasons why some patients might be less able to cope with enhanced levels of ROS.

AB  - Histological diagnosis of biliary cystadenoma is based on the type of epithelial cells lining the cyst and radiological features. The cyst-lining cells are not usually ciliated. We herein report a very rare example of an intrahepatic biliary cystadenoma with ciliated epithelial lining, which had taken us away from this diagnosis toward an intrahepatic foregut duplication cyst. Radiologically, also the lesion was deceptive, and a possibility of hydatid cyst was considered. However, immunohistochemical workup finally led us to this diagnosis. This report would document this rare morphological variant, which may pose diagnostic difficulty.

AB  - Paragangliomas are tumors that originate from the extra-adrenal chromaffin and nonchromaffin cells of neural crest origin. Lymph node metastases are common, while distant metastases to lung, liver, and bone are rare events and usually occur in the presence of a long standing clinically evident primary tumor. Primary diagnosis of paraganglioma at a metastatic site without a known primary is a diagnostic challenge. We report a case of an adult woman with incidentally detected metastasis to bilateral lungs from an occult carotid body paraganglioma, which presented a cytopathological diagnostic dilemma on EBUS-TBNA from paratracheal lymph nodes.

AB  - Urothelial cancer patients are prone to recurrence, and there is no marker to predict which cases become refractory to the immunotherapy given to these patients. Tumour behaviour is decided by the dynamics between the pro-and anti-tumorigenic cytokines. In this study, 27 cytokines were estimated in serum and urine of 72 urothelial cancer patients and 42 healthy volunteer controls. Serum cytokines IL-1RA, IL-4 and RANTES were in significantly higher concentration in serum of patients compared to controls, while IL-2 was significantly less in concentration. Patients were found to have significantly high concentrations of 12 urinary cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IP-10, MIP-1a, PDGF, MIP-1b, RANTES and VEGF) in comparison to healthy controls. Serum VEGF and urinary IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-10, GM-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1a and MIP-1b concentrations were found significantly higher in concentration in high-grade tumours compared to low-grade tumours. There was no difference in either the serum or urinary cytokines between non-invasive and muscle-invasive cases. Serum IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and VEGF and urinary IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1a, PDGF, MIP-1b and VEGF were found to be significantly higher in recurrent patients compared to non-recurrent patients. Of these, high concentrations of urinary IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-10, IP-10, PDGF and VEGF and serum IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, VEGF and TNF-alpha were associated with poor recurrence-free survival. Poor recurrence-free survival was also seen with increasing number of cytokines showing high concentrations. The study shows that the estimation of a combination of these cytokines in minimally or non-invasive samples may act as a prognostic indicator.

AB  - We substantiated the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) activation in the protective effect of apigenin against the myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). The study groups included diabetic rats receiving vehicle, apigenin (75 mg/kg/day, orally), GW9662 (1 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), and a combination of apigenin and GW9662 for 14 days. The MI was induced in all the study groups except the diabetic control group by subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg/day of isoproterenol on the two terminal days. The diabetes and isoproterenol-induced MI was evident as a reduction in the maximal positive and negative rate of developed left ventricular pressure and an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The activities of creatine kinase on myocardial bundle (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also reduced. Apigenin treatment prevented the hemodynamic perturbations, restored the left ventricular function and reinstated a balanced redox status. It protected rats against an MI by attenuating myonecrosis, edema, cell death, and oxidative stress. GW9662, a PPAR-gamma antagonist reversed the myocardial protection conferred by apigenin. Further, an increase in the PPAR-gamma expression in the myocardium of the rats receiving apigenin reinforces the role of PPAR-gamma pathway activation in the cardioprotective effects of apigenin.

AB  - Dysregulated expression of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling, a characteristic of several cardiovascular diseases. However, the information regarding the role of cysteine cathepsin L (CTSL) and cathepsin B (CTSB) in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is limited. The present study was aimed to investigate the expression of CTSL and CTSB in animal model of doxorubicin (doxo)-induced cardiomyopathy as well as in peripheral blood samples of DCM patients. Cardiac tissue sections from doxo-treated and control rats were used to study the expression of CTSL and CTSB by enzyme assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from DCM patients (n = 29) along with age-matched healthy controls (n = 28) were used to assay enzymatic activity of these cathepsins. Activities of these proteases were further correlated with echocardiographic parameters of DCM patients. A significant increase in CTSL activity and protein expression was observed with no changes in CTSB levels in doxo-treated rats as compared to controls. We also observed a drastic increase in the functional activity of cathepsin L+cathepsin B (CTSL+B), CTSL, and CTSB in DCM patients compared to controls (p <= 0.001). Increased levels of these proteases exhibited a statistically significant correlation with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in DCM patients (rho = -0.58, p = 0.01). For the first time, this study demonstrates a correlation between increased expression of CTSL and CTSB in PBMCs with severity of left ventricular dysfunction in DCM patients. Thus, these proteases may serve as blood-based biomarker of DCM and prove useful in its management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is frequent in lung cancer and is measured using various tools, including the novel bioelectric impedance technique for measuring body composition. However, the validation of this technique for assessing body composition in advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is untested. METHODS: Forty-one treatment naive patients (all males) and an equal number of age-and sex-matched controls were evaluated by anthropometric measurements of skinfold thicknesses and body composition parameters such as body fat%, fat mass, fat-free mass (FFM), and total body water (TBW). RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the patient group was 55.7 (7.5) years, median pack-years was 20 (range, 0-80), and mean (SD) duration of symptoms was 152.6 (153.7) days. Median Karnofsky Performance Scale was 70 (range, 50-90). Majority of our patients (68.3%) were Stage IV followed by Stage III (31.7%). The percentage of patients with low, normal, and high body mass index (BMI) was 31.7%, 61%, and 7.3%, respectively. All components of body composition, i.e., body fat%, FFM, and TBW were significantly lower in patients compared to controls. However, the body composition in patients and controls with normal BMI was similar. The phenomenon of sarcopenia as a cause of cancer cachexia may explain these findings, whereas the combination of loss of body fat and lean body mass may lead to weight loss and reduced BMI. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that body composition is markedly altered in Indian patients with advanced SCLC. The impact of these parameters on clinically relevant outcomes needs further evaluation.

AB  - Background: This paper examines the current status of radiation exposure to patients in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in Asia.
   Methods and Results: Laboratories voluntarily provided information on MPI performed over a 1-week period. Eight best practice criteria regarding MPI were predefined by an expert panel. Implementation of >= 6 best practices (quality index [QI] >= 6) was pre-specified as a desirable goal for keeping radiation exposure at a low level. Radiation effective dose (ED) in 1,469 patients and QI of 69 laboratories in Asia were compared against data from 239 laboratories in the rest of the world (RoW). Mean ED was significantly higher in Asia (11.4 vs. 9.6 mSv; P<0.0001), with significantly lower doses in South-East vs. East Asia (9.7 vs. 12.7 mSv; P<0.0001). QI in Asia was lower than in RoW. In comparison with RoW, Asian laboratories used thallium more frequently, used weight-based technetium dosing less frequently, and trended towards a lower rate of stress-only imaging.
   Conclusions: MPI radiation dose in Asia is higher than that in the RoW and linked to less consistent use of laboratory best practices such as avoidance of thallium, weight-based dosing, and use of stress-only imaging. Given that MPI is performed in Asia within a diverse array of medical contexts, laboratory-specific adoption of best practices offers numerous opportunities to improve quality of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Local control of disease is one of the main goals of osteosarcoma management. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 95 operated cases of osteosarcoma over 7 years to know about the factors associated with local recurrence in resource-challenged environment of the developing world.
   METHODS: The factors which were evaluated and compared between local recurrence and non-local recurrence groups included demographic profile, site of tumor, whether biopsy done outside, type of surgery (limb salvage or amputation), presence of pathological fracture, vicinity of neurovascular bundle, tumor volume, histological subtype, chemotherapy induced necrosis, surgical margins, and delay in surgery. The time to local recurrence after surgery was also noted in the local recurrence group.
   RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 2.8 years, biopsy done from outside the treating center and delay in surgery after completion of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy emerged as significant risk factors for local recurrence. Most of the local recurrences (80%) occurred within 12 months of the primary surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lack of financial resources and availability of few tertiary care centers dealing with musculoskeletal oncology in the developing countries, lead to overburden with a long waiting list for tumor surgery making the scenario different from the Western world.

AB  - Physical examination of any swelling is the first step in making a diagnosis. Many a times we see a patient with a spherical swelling, which is usually a cyst. The interpretation of physical signs should be based on sound principles of physics. In the present paper, we explain physical characteristics of a swelling (cyst) using principles of fluid mechanics.

AB  - Long-term outcome and natural history of steroid response in adult ulcerative colitis patients based on short-term response is largely unknown.
   To evaluate whether short-term clinical response at 30 days after steroid initiation for moderate to severe disease can predict long-term outcome.
   This prospective observational study recruited 161 patients who received oral/intravenous steroid therapy at our institution from April 2005 to July 2009. Short-term response at 30 days and long-term response at the end of first and third years were measured. Risk factors for long-term outcome at 1 and 3 years were analyzed by multivariate regression model.
   At the end of 30 days, 90 patients (55.9%) had complete response, 47 (29.2%) partial response, and 24 (14.9%) did not respond at all. At the end of first year, 53/90 (60%) complete responders (at 30 days) maintained steroid-free remission when compared to 17/71 (23.9%, p < 0.001) partial/no responders. Similar result was observed at the end of third year (74.7 vs 55.1%, p = 0.017). On multivariable analysis, short-term outcome at 30 days was a predictor of outcome at the end of one year (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.2-8.5) and 3 years (RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.02-4.5).
   Short-term response to steroids is a strong predictor of long-term outcome at 1 and 3 years in active ulcerative colitis patients.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of Parkinson's disease (PD) using structural magnetic resonance imaging is an emerging research field for the pattern recognition community. The existing research works have utilized gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid tissues individually for diagnosis of PD and have ignored the intercorrelation among the three tissues. Thus, there is a need to define a fused feature descriptor (FFD) which can capture information and intercorrelation of all the three tissues simultaneously, and to further enhance the performance of CAD. The present study proposes a simple and efficient FFD, in terms of all the three tissues, for CAD of PD, Each brain volume is represented in terms of the FFD. Then each fused volume is segmented into 118 brain regions. Thereafter, features extraction is carried out from each brain region using 3D local binary pattern. Then, a set of discriminating and uncorrelated features are identified using t-test in conjunction with minimum,redundancy maximum, relevance feature selection method. Finally, support vector machine is utilized to build a decision model. Volumetric 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging dataset (age & gender matched 30 PD and 30 healthy subjects) is acquired using 1.5T machine and is utilized to investigate the efficacy of the proposed method. The classification accuracy of 95% is achieved using leave-one-out cross-validation scheme which is superior to the existing methods. Regions namely Hippocampus.R, Cingulum_Mid_L, Frontal_Inf_Tra, Precentral_R, Precentral_L, Frontal_Mid_L, Frontal_Mid_Orb_L, Cingulum_Ant_L and Hippocampus_L, are observed to be the most discriminative regions for diagnosis of PD. The notable performance of the proposed method suggests that instead of studying the three tissues independently, their intercorrelation should also be considered. Further, the proposed method may be employed as a diagnostic tool for diagnosis of PD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of dementia worldwide. Edaravone, a potent free radical scavenger, is reported to be neuroprotective. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of chronic edaravone administration on intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) induced cognitive impairment in male Wistar rats. Cognitive impairment was developed by single ICV-STZ (3 mg/kg) injection bilaterally on day 1. Edaravone (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, orally, once daily) was administered for 28 days. Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests were used to assess cognitive functions at baseline and on days 14 and 28. ICV-STZ caused cognitive impairment as evidenced by increased escape latency and decreased time spent in target quadrant in the Morris water maze test and reduced retention latency in the passive avoidance test. STZ caused increase in oxidative stress, cholinesterases, inflammatory cytokines and protein expression of ROCK-II and decrease in protein expression of ChAT. Edaravone ameliorated the STZ-induced cognitive impairment. STZ-induced increase in oxidative stress and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta) were mitigated by edaravone. Edaravone also prevented STZ-induced increased protein expression of ROCK-II. Moreover, edaravone significantly prevented STZ-induced increased activity of cholinesterases in the cortex and hippocampus. The decreased expression of ChAT caused by STZ was brought towards normal by edaravone in the hippocampus. The results thus show that edaravone is protective against STZ-induced cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction and altered protein expressions. This study thus suggests the potential of edaravone as an adjuvant in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Leprosy is an ancient disease caused by gram positive, rod shaped bacilli called Mycobacterium leprae. Patients present with varied clinico-pathological disease depending on the host immune response to Mycobacterium leprae. Thus tuberculoid (TT) and lepromatous (LL) patients represent two ends of a spectrum where the former shows limited disease, high T cell mediate immune (CMI) response and low antibody (HI) levels in serum. In contrast the latter has low T cell and high humoral immune response i.e antibody levels. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been investigated intensely; however, there is no consensus on the primary immunological basis. Over three decades, Th1 and Th2 paradigm were thought to underling tuberculoid and lepromatous disease respectively. However many patients were shown to have mixed Th1/Th2 pattern of (IFN-gamma/IL-4) cytokines. The present review was undertaken with a view to understand the T cells and cytokine dysregulation in leprosy. In recent years the sub classes of T cells that are Regulatory in nature (Treg) have been implicated in immune diseases where they were shown to suppress T cell functions. Additionally Th17 cells secreting IL-17A, IL17F, were implicated in immune inflammation. Taken together these regulatory cells may play a part in influencing immune responses in leprosy.

AB  - CONTEXT: To evaluate the quality of life (QOL) outcome measures in disease-free survivors of pathological T1/T2 tongue cancers and to compare QOL in patients treated with only surgery and with adjuvant treatment. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All pathological T1/T2 anterior tongue cancer cases with follow-up from January 2011 till December 2015, who had locoregionally controlled disease with a minimum disease-free survival period of 1 year, were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients, 28 are males and 8 are females with an age range of 24-66 years (median age of 43) were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into two groups with (n = 26) and without adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (RT) (n = 10) and the University of Washington-QOL questionnaire version 4 for physical and social domains, global questions and three important domains were analyzed. On the physical and social domain scores, the surgery-alone group outscored the combined modality group on all scales and the differences were statistically significant for specific physical domains such as saliva (0.0001), taste (P = 0.0001), chewing (P = 0.0004), swallowing (P = 0.0026), and social domains such as mood (0.0001), pain (P = 0.0001), and shoulder function (P = 0.0061). The overall global QOL scores were also better for the surgical group compared with group which received adjuvant RT but was not statistically significant. All patients chose saliva as their top priority domain in the group which received radiation, and 60% chose "swallowing ability" as the preferred top priority domain in the only surgical group. CONCLUSIONS: Although locoregional control and disease-free survival are the major treatment-related endpoints for cancer management, QOL outcome measures have to assess to determine the impact of a treatment modality on patients well-being and for better rehabilitation of cancer-free patients.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the clinicomicrobiological profile of infectious agents and their antibiotic susceptibility in different type of endophthalmitis. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical and microbiological records from January 2001 to December 2010, was performed in 1110 patients diagnosed with different type of endophthalmitis (postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous and post keratitis) to record the demographic details, clinical presentations; microbiological agents isolated with their antimicrobial sensitivity pattern. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for various culture positive isolates (bacterial/fungal) was performed by the disc diffusion technique. Results: Out of the 1110 intra-ocular specimens processed, 384 (34.6%) were positive for bacteria. S epidermidis was the most predominant isolate accounting for 42.7% of all bacteria obtained, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.5%). Besides Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter spp. were the next common gram negative bacilli detected (8.3%) followed by Klebsiella, E. coli, Enterobacter and Alkaligenes in 2.6%, 0.8%, 0.8% and 0.5% cases respectively. The predominant fungal species were Aspergillus spp., in 36.1%, followed by Fusarium spp. in 26.4% cases. Overall susceptibility pattern in our study showed that gram positive bacteria were most susceptible to glycopeptides like vancomycin (80-100%) and fluoroquinolones (87-91%). The sensitivity pattern of gram negative organisms like Pseudomonas and Klebsiella towards fluoroquinolones ranged between 61%-82%. Conclusion: S epidermidis was the most common bacteria isolated in postoperative and posttraumatic endophthalmitis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacterial isolated in posttraumatic endophthalmitisAmongst fungi Aspergillus was the most common organism.

AB  - This study is a single center quality improvement (QI) initiative in a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit which was done with an objective to increase the proportion of neonates receiving mother's own milk (at postnatal age of 7 d) from the current rate of 12.5% to 30% over a period of six weeks. Additional objectives were to evaluate the proportion of mothers' expressing breast milk within 3 h of birth, on day one and three and the amount of expressed breast milk (EBM) on day one and day seven. A team was formulated to evaluate the reasons for inadequate breast milk expression and to plan the steps for promoting the same. Comprehensive postnatal breast feeding counseling (CPNC) to promote early breast milk expression was initiated soon after the birth of a preterm neonate. CPNC was done for next fifteen mothers and their breast feeding support was streamlined. The effect of CPNC and teamwork was discussed amongst the team members every day and adjustments incorporated (Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle). The proportion of neonates receiving mother's only milk (MOM) on day 7 increased to 80% (12/15) after 4 wk of QI. Thus, a simple and feasible CPNC package lead to improved breast milk output in mothers.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a global disease and an important cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the Indian subcontinent. The aim of this study was to assess the differences in the course of HEV-ALF as compared to other etiologies of ALF.
   We compared the clinical course, complications, and outcomes of HEV-ALF with other etiologies. We assessed the prognostic factors and compared existing prognostic scores in HEV-ALF patients.
   One thousand four hundred and sixty-two ALF patients were evaluated between January 1986 and December 2015. HEV was the etiology of ALF in 419 (28.7%) cases, whereas non-A non-E hepatitis, HBV and anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) were the etiologies in 527 (36.0%), 128 (8.8%), and 103 (7.0%) cases, respectively. The frequency of cerebral edema in HEV-ALF (41.3%) was lower than that in non-A non-E ALF (52.9%; P < 0.001) and HBV-ALF (52.8%; P = 0.024). Infection and seizures were significantly less in patients with HEV-ALF compared to non-A non-E and HBV-ALF (P = 0.038 and 0.022, respectively). The survival of HEV-ALF patients was significantly better (55.1%, P < 0.001) than patients of other etiologies-including ATT (30.0%), non-A non-E (38.1%) and HBV (35.9%). In HEV-ALF patients, age, female sex, cerebral edema, prothrombin time > 60 s, infection, and total bilirubin were observed as independent predictors of outcome on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Model for end-stage liver disease, acute liver failure study group model and King's College Hospital criteria had poor discriminative accuracy for outcome (area under receiver operator characteristic curve 0.63-0.64) in HEV-ALF.
   Hepatitis E virus-associated ALF has a better outcome than ALF of other etiologies.

AB  - Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is frequently a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is a common opportunistic infection in people living with HIV/AIDS and other immunocompromised states such as diabetes mellitus and malnutrition. There is a paucity of data from clinical trials in EPTB and most of the information regarding diagnosis and management is extrapolated from pulmonary TB. Further, there are no formal national or international guidelines on EPTB. To address these concerns, Indian EPTB guidelines were developed under the auspices of Central TB Division and Directorate of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The objective was to provide guidance on uniform, evidence-informed practices for suspecting, diagnosing and managing EPTB at all levels of healthcare delivery. The guidelines describe agreed principles relevant to 10 key areas of EPTB which are complementary to the existing country standards of TB care and technical operational guidelines for pulmonary TB. These guidelines provide recommendations on three priority areas for EPTB: (i) use of Xpert MTB/RIF in diagnosis, (ii) use of adjunct corticosteroids in treatment, and (iii) duration of treatment. The guidelines were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, which were evidence based, and due consideration was given to various healthcare settings across India. Further, for those forms of EPTB in which evidence regarding best practice was lacking, clinical practice points were developed by consensus on accumulated knowledge and experience of specialists who participated in the working groups. This would also reflect the needs of healthcare providers and develop a platform for future research.

AB  - Background:High-mobility group proteins A (HMGA) are more abundant in rapidly dividing and transformed cells. These are a group of proteins regulating tumorigenesis and tumor invasion. Increased expression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 has been reported in various benign and malignant tumors. The aim of the present study was to analyze expression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins in retinoblastoma.Methods:Protein expression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 in 80 formalin-fixed retinoblastoma tissues was performed by immunohistochemistry, and their mRNA expressions were analyzed on 40 fresh primary enucleated retinoblastoma samples by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results were then correlated with clinicopathologic parameters.Results:Immunohistochemical analysis of HMGA1 and HMGA2 was seen in 56.25% and 58.75% of retinoblastoma cases, respectively. mRNA expressions of HMGA1 and HMGA2 was found to be 57.55% and 62.5%, respectively. The mRNA results correlated well with immunostaining results. Expression of both HMGA1 and HMGA2 was significantly associated with choroidal invasion and poor tumor differentiation.Conclusions:HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins may contribute to tumorigenesis of Rb. Expression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 predicts poor prognosis and could serve as a therapeutic target in the management of RB. Further experiments are needed to determine the role of these proteins as therapeutic targets in tumorigenesis.

AB  - Background & objectives: Hearing impairment is a common and heterogeneous sensory disorder in humans. Among about 90 genes, which are known to be associated with hearing impairment, mutations in the GJB2 (gap junction protein beta 2) gene are the most prevalent in individuals with hereditary hearing loss. Contribution of the other deafness-causing genes is relatively poorly understood. Here, we present our findings on two families with transmembrane channel like 1 (TMC1) gene variants of the 47 families with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) studied.
   Methods: Forty seven families including 26 consanguineous families with at least two hearing impaired children and one normal hearing child and 21 non-consanguineous families having at least three hearing impaired children and one normal hearing child were enrolled for this study. Genetic linkage studies were carried out in 41 families that were GJB2 (Connexin 26) negative. Seven polymorphic short tandem repeat markers at the DFNB7/11 locus were studied employing fluorescently labelled markers.
   Results: A novel homozygous missense mutation c.1283C>A (p.Ala428Asp) was identified co-segregating with hearing loss. This change results in substitution of a highly conserved polar alanine to a charged aspartic acid and is predicted to be deleterious. In addition, a previously reported nonsense mutation, p.R34X in TMC1, was found.
   Interpretation & conclusions: While mutations in TMC1 are not as common a cause of NSHL as those in GJB2, TMC1 should be considered for diagnostic investigations in cases of NSHL in GJB2-negative families.

AB  - Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of skin cancer with rapidly increasing incidence rate. The disease is largely considered incurable and the patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma have a survival of not more than five years. Despite of the recent advances in anti-melanoma chemo- and immunotherapies, the available drugs are relatively toxic and responsive to only a limited subset of lesions. Currently, topical pharmacotherapy is demonstrated as an effective approach for the treatment of various skin cancers. Also, in vitro testing of melanoma cell lines and murine melanoma models has identified a number of relatively safe and effective phytochemicals. In this review, we described the use of topical pharmacotherapy for the treatment of skin cancers. Melanoma treatment by drugs targeting MAPK-pathway has also been discussed. Long non-coding RNAs and therapeutics targeting ER-associated pathways looks quite promising for the treatment of melanoma. Moreover, some natural anticancer compounds that have been reported to have anti-melanoma effects have also been described. At present a better understanding of genetics and epigenetics of initiation and progression of melanoma is needed for the identification of novel biomarkers and development of targeted therapeutics against melanoma.

KW  - Peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy
AB  - To report a case of peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy (PEHCR) associated with extramacular choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM). A 65-year-old female with BCVA of 3/60 in the RE was diagnosed to have PEHCR with peripheral CNVM. She had subretinal fluid in the macular region. The patient was treated successfully with a single dose of intravitreal bevacizumab followed by laser photocoagulation of the CNVM. BCVA was 6/24 after 3 months and subretinal fluid had resolved. PEHCR may be associated with extramacular CNVM and hence may cause visual loss. Such extramacular CNVMs respond well to combination therapy which offers a permanent cure.

AB  - Genitourinary Tuberculosis (GUTB) is the second most common extra-pulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis (Tb) and an isolated involvement of genital organs is reported in 5-30% of the cases. Genital involvement results from primary reactivation of latent bacilli either in the epididymis or the prostate or by secondary spread from the already infected urinary organs. The epididymis are the commonest involved organs affected primarily by a hematogenous mode of spread. Tb is characterized by extensive destruction and fibrosis, thus an early diagnosis may prevent function and organ loss. The gold standard for diagnosis is the isolation and culture of mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli and in the cases of suspected GUTB, it is commonly looked for in the urinary samples. All body fluid specimens from possible sites of infection and aspirates from nodules must also be subjected to examination. Radiologic investigations including ultrasonography and contrast imaging may provide supportive evidence. Anti-tubercular chemotherapy is the first line of management for all forms of genital Tb and a 6 months course is the standard of care. Most patients with tubercular epididymo-orchitis respond to antitubercular therapy but may require open or percutaneous drainage. Infertility resulting from the tubercular affliction of the genitalia is multifactorial in origin and may persist even after successful chemotherapy. Multiple organ involvement with obstruction at several sites is characteristic and most of these cases are not amenable to surgical reconstruction. Thus, assisted reproduction is usually required. Post treatment, regular annual follow up is recommended even though, with the current multi drug therapy, the chances of relapse are low.

AB  - Background: Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a diverse group of genodermatoses associated with extreme skin fragility. Despite several well-characterized genetic studies, molecular diagnosis of this heterogeneous group is still challenging. Recent advances in the field of genomics have seen the successful implementation of whole exome sequencing (WES) as a fast and efficient diagnostic strategy in several genodermatoses.
   Objective: In view of the scarcity and need of molecular studies for JEB in India, we sought to explore the potential of WES in understanding the mutational spectrum of this rare, in certain subtypes lethal, subgroup of EB.
   Methods: WES was performed using genomic DNA from each case of EB, followed by massively parallel sequencing. Resulting reads were mapped to the human reference genome hg19. Sanger sequencing subsequently confirmed the potentially pathogenic mutations.
   Results: Overall, four unrelated families (6 patients) of JEB with a highly variable clinical presentation including a rare case of LOC syndrome were studied. WES revealed 4 variations in 3 genes (LAMA3, LAMB3 and COL17A1) that are implicated in JEB. None of the variations were recurrent. In addition we proposed the probable molecular consequence of a missense mutation on the structure-function relationship of lamininI beta 3 protein through computational modeling studies.
   Conclusions: Being the first report documenting the phenotype-genotype correlations of JEB patients from India, our preliminary experience with WES is clearly encouraging and serves as a nidus for future large-scale molecular studies to actively identify and understand JEB patients in Indian population.

AB  - With a shift in focus from genes to cells, systems approach is not only revolutionizing cell biology, but is also providing impetus for clinical medicine to shift from a reductionistic to a holistic approach for efficient disease management. This inevitably brings into focus one of the longest unbroken healthcare systems in the world, namely ayurveda, the medical system indigenous to Indian subcontinent. A distinctive feature of ayurveda is its systems approach to health and disease. Through the theoretical framework of vata, pitta and kapha, ayurveda offers a new paradigm for understanding the human system as a networked functional entity wherein system properties are integral components. An open-minded dialogue between the cell-centric systems biology and organism-centric ayurveda can open new exciting vistas for research beneficial to both sciences, which could leave a major imprint on clinical practice.

AB  - Improved methods are required for the early and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially in the patients with smear-negative disease. Several biomarkers have been tried but most have shown poor sensitivity or specificity. In present study we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of five novel antigens identified earlier by us. This is an initial study conducted on 250 subjects. The five recombinant antigens, named as rSS1 Rv2145c), rSS2 Rv0164), rSS3 Rv1437), rSS4 Rv1827) and rSS5 Rv2970c), were expressed in pQE-30 expression vector, purified and their sero-diagnostic efficacy was evaluated in an unblinded manner using dot-blot and ELISA methods. The sensitivity and specificity of these novel antigens were compared with commercially available standard esat6 and 38 kDa antigens. Bacteriologically confirmed TB patients, non-TB disease controls and healthy individuals were included. which are based on novel antigen or novel technology, Area under curve AUC) of the selected antigens were 0.98 0.98-0.99) for rSS1, 0.88 0.84-0.92) for rSS2, 0.88 0.84-0.92) for rSS3, 0.95 0.93-0.98) for rSS4 and 0.99 0.98-1.0) for rSS5. Receiver operative characteristic ROC) curve showed highly significant difference between TB and healthy subjects p = < 0.001). These initial findings, show that the recombinant antigens rSS1, rSS4 and rSS5 could be used as highly potential biomarkers for the serological diagnosis of active TB.

AB  - Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the most common subset of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), is associated with large-scale network abnormalities, even under resting state. We studied the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded from pyramidal neurons in resected samples under resting conditions from the hippocampal and anterior temporal lobe (ATL) obtained from patients with HS (n = 14) undergoing resective surgery. We observed higher frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs in both the samples compared to non-seizure control samples. Application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) reduced the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs by 49.6 +/- 4.3% and 61.8 +/- 6.2% in the hippocampal and ATL samples, respectively. The magnitude of reduction caused by TTX with respect to non-seizure controls was significantly higher in the ATL samples than in the hippocampal samples. The magnitude of the change in the expression of the NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptors also varied in these two regions. Thus, the mechanism of hyperexcitabilty mediated by glutamatergic network reorganization in the hippocampal region is different from that in the ATL region of patients with HS, suggesting two independent resting-state networks at the cellular level. Taken together, these findings will improve the understanding of the broadly distributed resting-state networks in HS.

AB  - Background: Vitamin C (vit C) is an essential dietary nutrient, which is a potent antioxidant, a free radical scavenger and functions as a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions. Vit C is also considered to enhance the immune effector function of macrophages, which are regarded to be the first line of defence in response to any pathogen. The THP-1 cell line is widely used for studying macrophage functions and for analyzing host cell-pathogen interactions.
   Results: We performed a genome-wide temporal gene expression and functional enrichment analysis of THP-1 cells treated with 100 mu M of vit C, a physiologically relevant concentration of the vitamin. Modulatory effects of vitamin C on THP-1 cells were revealed by differential expression of genes starting from 8 h onwards. The number of differentially expressed genes peaked at the earliest time-point i.e. 8 h followed by temporal decline till 96 h. Further, functional enrichment analysis based on statistically stringent criteria revealed a gamut of functional responses, namely, 'Regulation of gene expression', 'Signal transduction', 'Cell cycle', 'Immune system process', 'cAMP metabolic process', 'Cholesterol transport' and 'Ion homeostasis'. A comparative analysis of vit C-mediated modulation of gene expression data in THP-1cells and human skin fibroblasts disclosed an overlap in certain functional processes such as 'Regulation of transcription', 'Cell cycle' and 'Extracellular matrix organization', and THP-1 specific responses, namely, 'Regulation of gene expression' and 'Ion homeostasis'. It was noteworthy that vit C modulated the 'Immune system' process throughout the time-course.
   Conclusions: This study reveals the genome-wide effects of physiological levels of vit C on THP-1 gene expression. The multitude of effects impacted by vit C in macrophages highlights its role in maintaining homeostasis of several cellular functions. This study provides a rational basis for the use of the Vitamin C-THP-1 cell model, to study biochemical and cellular responses to stresses, including infection with M. tuberculosis and other intracellular pathogens.

AB  - More than 50% of HIV-1 infection globally is caused by subtype_C viruses. Majority of the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting HIV-1 have been isolated from non-subtype_C infected donors. Mapping the epitope specificities of bnAbs provides useful information for vaccine design. Recombinant antibody technology enables generation of a large repertoire of monoclonals with diverse specificities. We constructed a phage recombinant single chain variable fragment (scFv) library with a diversity of 7.8 x 10(8) clones, using a novel strategy of pooling peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of six select HIV-1 chronically infected Indian donors whose plasma antibodies exhibited potent cross neutralization efficiency. The library was panned and screened by phage ELISA using trimeric recombinant proteins to identify viral envelope specific clones. Three scFv monoclonals D11, C11 and 1F6 selected from the library cross neutralized subtypes A, B and C viruses at concentrations ranging from 0.09 mu g/mL to 100 mu g/mL. The D11 and 1F6 scFvs competed with mAbs b12 and VRC01 demonstrating CD4bs specificity, while C11 demonstrated N332 specificity. This is the first study to identify cross neutralizing scFv monoclonals with CD4bs and N332 glycan specificities from India. Cross neutralizing anti-HIV-1 human scFv monoclonals can be potential candidates for passive immunotherapy and for guiding immunogen design.

AB  - Background and aim
   MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in regulating the gene expression of their target genes. SNP miR-196a-2 rs11614913 and miR-499 rs3746444 are reported to have association with the risk and prognosis of multiple-types of inflammatory diseases including IBD. This study was conducted to show if any association of SNP miR-196a- 2rs11614913 and miR-499 rs3746444 exists with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients of north Indian population and how these polymorphisms modulate the expression profile of the respective miRNAs.
   Methods
   A total of 638 participants including 197 UC patients and 441 controls were included in this study. Polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP and the miRNA expression was measured using qRT-PCR. Genotypes and allele frequencies were calculated using SPSS 16 software.
   Results
   MiR-196a-2 rs11614913 (C> T) and miR-499 rs3746444 (T> C) were found to be associated with UC. TT genotype of miR-196a-2 rs11614913 (p = 0.03) was negatively associated with UC whereas the heterozygous TC genotype of miR-499 rs3746444 (p = 0.003) was showing positive association with UC. Patients having a combination of both SNPs, developed disease at older age and they suffered from severe disease extent. Genotype that showed association with the disease also showed correlation with the changes in miRNA expression.
   Conclusion
   In this study we found miR-196a-2 rs11614913 and miR-499 rs3746444 were associated with UC in north Indian population. We found the genotype that showed association with UC also altered the expression of respective miRNA in the patient harboring the genotype. There was correlation between associated genotype and altered miRNA expression.

AB  - Background
   While data from the latter part of the twentieth century consistently showed that immigrants to high-income countries faced higher cardio-metabolic risk than their counterparts in low- and middle-income countries, urbanization and associated lifestyle changes may be changing these patterns, even for conditions considered to be advanced manifestations of cardio-metabolic disease (e.g., chronic kidney disease [CKD]).
   Methods and findings
   Using cross-sectional data from the Center for cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS, n = 5294) and Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA, n = 748) studies, we investigated whether prevalence of CKD is similar among Indians living in Indian and U.S. cities. We compared crude, age-, waist-to-height ratio-, and diabetes-adjusted CKD prevalence difference. Among participants identified to have CKD, we compared management of risk factors for its progression. Overall age-adjusted prevalence of CKD was similar in MASALA (14.0% [95% CI 11.8-16.3]) compared with CARRS (10.8% [95% CI 10.0-11.6]). Among men the prevalence difference was low (prevalence difference 1.8 [95% CI -1.6,5.3]) and remained low after adjustment for age, waist-to-height ratio, and diabetes status (-0.4 [-3.2,2.5]). Adjusted prevalence difference was higher among women (prevalence difference 8.9 [4.8,12.9]), but driven entirely by a higher prevalence of albuminuria among women in MASALA. Severity of CKD-i.e., degree of albuminuria and proportion of participants with reduced glomerular filtration fraction-was higher in CARRS for both men and women. Fewer participants with CKD in CARRS were effectively treated. 4% of CARRS versus 51% of MASALA participants with CKD had A1c < 7%; and 7% of CARRS versus 59% of MASALA participants blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg. Our analysis applies only to urban populations. Demographic-particularly educational attainment-differences among participants in the two studies are a potential source of bias.
   Conclusions
   Prevalence of CKD among Indians living in Indian and U.S. cities is similar. Persons with CKD living in Indian cities face higher likelihood of experiencing end-stage renal disease since they have more severe kidney disease and little evidence of risk factor management.

AB  - Polymorphisms located within the MHC have been linked to many disease outcomes by mechanisms not yet fully understood in most cases. Variants located within untranslated regions of HLA genes are involved in allele-specific expression and may therefore underlie some of these disease associations. We determined sequences extending nearly 2 kb upstream of the transcription start site for 68 alleles from 57 major lineages of classical HLA class I genes. The nucleotide diversity within this promoter segment roughly follows that seen within the coding regions, with HLA-B showing the highest (similar to 1.9%), followed by HLA-A (similar to 1.8%), and HLA-C showing the lowest diversity (similar to 0.9%). Despite its greater diversity, HLA-B mRNA expression levels determined in 178 European Americans do not vary in an allele-or lineage-specific manner, unlike the differential expression levels of HLA-A or HLA-C reported previously. Close proximity of promoter sequences in phylogenetic trees is roughly reflected by similarity of expression pattern for most HLA-A and -C loci. Although promoter sequence divergence might impact promoter activity, we observed no clear link between the phylogenetic structures as represented by pairwise nucleotide differences in the promoter regions with estimated differences in mRNA expression levels for the classical class I loci. Further, no pair of class I loci showed coordinated expression levels, suggesting that distinct mechanisms across loci determine their expression level under nonstimulated conditions. These data serve as a foundation for more in-depth analysis of the functional consequences of promoter region variation within the classical HLA class I loci.

AB  - Rationale: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a heterogeneous group of acute and chronic inflammatory and fibrotic lung diseases. Existing ILD registries have had variable findings. Little is known about the clinical profile of ILDs in India.
   Objectives: To characterize new-onset ILDs in India by creating a prospective ILD using multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) to validate diagnoses.
   Methods: Adult patients of Indian origin living in India with new-onset LLD (27 centers, 19 Indian cities, March 2012-June 2015) without malignancy or infection were included. All had connective tissue disease (CTD) serologies, spirometry, and high-resolution computed tomography chest. ILD pattern was definedby high-resolution computed tomography images. Three groups independently made diagnoses after review of clinical data including that from prompted case report forms: local site investigators, ILD experts at the National Data Coordinating Center (NDCC; Jaipur, India) with MDD, and experienced ILD experts at the Center for ILD (CILD; Seattle, WA) with MDD. Cohen's K was used to assess reliability of interobserver agreement. Measurements and Main
   Results: A total of 1,084 patients were recruited. Final diagnosis: hypersensitivity pneumonitis in 47.3% (n = 513; exposure, 48.1% air coolers), CTD-ILD in 13.9%, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 13.7%. Cohen's K: 0.351 site investigator/CILD, 0.519 site investigator/NDCC, and 0.618 NDCC/CILD.
   Conclusions: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis was the most common new-onset ILD in India, followed by CTD-ILD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; diagnoses varied between site investigators and CILD experts, emphasizing the value of MDD in ILD diagnosis. Prompted case report forms including environmental exposures in prospective registries will likely provide further insight into the etiology and management of ILD worldwide.

T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - TO-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION
KW  - PULMONARY-FIBROSIS
AB  - Introduction
   Duct ectasia (DE) and periductal mastitis (PDM) are the most common benign breast conditions seen in women. The etiopathogenesis of these entities is still not clear and most of the theories regarding the causation are based on the histological features as seen on light microscopy. The ultramicroscopic features associated with these conditions that may give more insight to the etiopathogenesis are unknown.
   Aim
   To study the ultrastructural changes occurring in mammary duct cones in patients with DE and PDM using Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM).
   Method
   Major ducts removed by radical duct excision from 21 patients with final histopathological diagnosis of DE and PDM were subjected to TEM study with 2 normal duct samples as controls.
   Results
   The TEM features of DE were denudation of the epithelial cells with focal loss of microvilli, widening of the inter-epithelial junctions with focal disruption of the T bars, periductal collagenisation without inflammation, and features suggestive of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). PDM features are intact epithelial lining with proliferative epithelium and periductal collagenisation with inflammation.
   Conclusions
   Based on the TEM findings, we suggest that DE and PDM are two different entities. EMT a novel finding observed in DE in this study.

AB  - Background: Breakthrough pain (BTP) arising due to rib metastasis is very distressing and often very difficult to manage by titration of traditional analgesics. This study is undertaken to determine the efficacy of radiofrequency (RF) treatment of intercostal nerves for the prevention of BTP.
   Methods: The RF treatment of the intercostal nerves was carried out in 25 patients with uncontrolled BTP arising out of the rib metastasis. The intensity and episode of BTP, background pain, opioid dose, functional status (Karnofky score), and quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]) were noted at baseline visit and subsequently after the RF treatment.
   Results: After the RF treatment, there was more than 50% decrease in both intensity and frequency of BTP in more than 50% of patients for 3 months, and there was more than 50% decrease in BTP opioid dose in more than 50% of patients throughout the study period. There was also significant improvement in background pain, functional status, and the quality of life after the RF. Interestingly, pain relief, lowering of opioid dose, and functional status improvement were found mostly in patients with mixed and neuropathic type of pain and in patients in whom the metastasis were confined to the ribs only.
   Conclusion: RF of the intercostal nerves is effective in preventing and deceasing the severity of BTP arising due to rib metastasis in selected group of patients with mixed and neuropathic type of pain and with the metastasis involving the ribs only.

AB  - Background & objectives: The reference radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) values established in the 1970s in the era of widespread iodine deficiency were relatively high. Now, after four decades of successful Universal Salt Iodization (USI) programme in India, there is a need to re-establish these reference ranges. The present study was aimed to quantify the two-hour and 24-h RAIU values in iodine sufficient euthyroid individuals and validate the results in Graves' and Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients.
   Methods: In this prospective study conducted from April 2012 to September 2013, euthyroid volunteers who consented for the investigations were enrolled in the study. Treatment-naive Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic. The investigations included neck ultrasonography, thyroid function tests, thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and urinary iodine concentration.
   Results: Three different groups comprising 110 euthyroid volunteers, 38 Graves' and 17 Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients were enrolled in the study. The mean 2-h RAIU values for the euthyroid group, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' patients were 3.83 +/- 2.77, 4.22 +/- 3.41 and 32.67 +/- 15.93 per cent, and mean 24-h RAIU values were 12.75 +/- 5.51, 11.66 +/- 9.55 and 61.85 +/- 12.9 per cent, respectively. The mean thyroid volumes were 7.63 +/- 2.72, 7.81 +/- 1.67 and 20.76 +/- 12.56 ml for the euthyroid, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease groups and the mean spot urinary iodine concentrations were 9.0, 7.8 and 13.9 mu g/dl in the three groups, respectively. The new reference range (95% confidence interval) for two-hour was 1-7 per cent and 24-h was 7-18 per cent.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Compared to the previous values, there was a considerable decrease in the RAIU values in euthyroid individuals. This was further corroborated with increase in the urinary iodine concentration and decrease in thyroid volume, attributed to successful USI programme. Further studies with a large sample from different parts of India need to be done to confirm these findings.

AB  - There is very scant literature on the impact of inguinal hernia mesh repair on testicular functions and sexual functions following open and laparoscopic repair. The present randomized study compares TAPP and TEP repairs in terms of testicular functions, sexual functions, quality of life and chronic groin pain.
   This study was conducted from April 2012 to October 2014. A total of 160 patients with uncomplicated groin hernia were randomized to either trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) repair or totally extra-peritoneal (TEP) repair. Testicular functions were assessed by measuring testicular volume, testicular hormone levels preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively. Sexual functions were assessed using BMSFI, and quality of life was assessed using WHO-QOL BREF scale preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Chronic groin pain was evaluated using the VAS scale at 3 months, 6 months and at 1 year.
   The median duration of follow-up was 13 months (range 6-18 months). The mean preoperative pain scores (p value 0.35) as well as the chronic groin pain were similar between TEP and TAPP repairs at 3 months (p value 0.06) and 6 months (p value 0.86). The testicular resistive index and testicular volume did not show any significant change at follow-up of 3 months (p value 0.9) in the study population. No significant difference was observed in testicular resistive index and testicular volume when comparing TEP and TAPP groups at at follow-up of 3 months (p value > 0.05). There was a statistically significant improvement in the sexual drive score, erectile function and overall satisfaction over the follow-up period following laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. However, sexual function improvement was similar in patients undergoing both TEP and TAPP repairs. All the domains of quality of life in the study population showed a significant improvement at a follow-up of 3 and 6 months. Subgroup analysis of all the domains of quality of life in both TAPP and TEP groups showed a similar increment as in the study population (p value < 0.001); however, the mean scores of all the domains were comparable between the two subgroups (p value > 0.05), preoperatively and 3 and 6 months follow-up.
   Laparoscopic groin hernia repair improves the testicular functions, sexual functions and quality of life, but TEP and TAPP repairs are comparable in terms of these long-term outcomes.

AB  - In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS), advanced immunosuppression is associated with atypical presentation of dermatological conditions. Our patient presented with a single crusted plaque over the lower lip and large tender cervical lymphadenopathy. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus was found to be positive, and his CD4+ lymphocyte cell count was 4 cells/mm(3). The presence of multiple histoplasma spores in the biopsies from the crusted plaque over lip and cervical lymph node helped in the confirmation of the diagnosis of histoplasmosis, and the patient showed significant improvement within two months of treatment with conventional injection amphotericin B initially followed by oral itraconazole.

AB  - The incidence of shoulder pain (SP) following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) varies between 21 and 80 %. A few randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis have shown lesser SP in LC performed under low-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (LPCP) than under standard-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (SPCP). However, the possible compromise in adequate exposure and effective working space during LPCP has negatively influenced its uniform adoption for LC.
   All consecutive patients undergoing elective LC for gallstone disease who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enroled. Fourty patients were randomised to SPCP group (pressure of 14 mmHg) and 40 to LPCP group (pressure of 9-10 mmHg). Primary outcome measured was incidence of SP and its severity on visual analogue scale (VAS) at 4, 8, 24 h and 7 days after LC. Secondary outcomes measured were procedural time, technical difficulty, surgeons' satisfaction score on exposure and working space, intra-operative changes in heart rate and blood pressure, abdominal pain and analgesic requirement. Analyses were performed using Stata software.
   There was no conversion to open surgery, bile duct injury or need to increase intra-abdominal pressure on either group. Twenty-three patients (57.5 %) in SPCP group and nine patients (22.5 %) in LPCP group had SP (p = 0.001). The severity of SP was significantly more in SPCP group at 8 and 24 h (p = 0.009 and 0.005, respectively). Both the groups had similar procedural time, surgeons' satisfaction score, intra-operative changes in heart rate and blood pressure.
   The incidence and severity of SP following LC performed at LPCP are significantly less compared to that in SPCP. The safety, efficacy and surgeons' satisfaction appear to be comparable in both the groups. Hence, a routine practice of low-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum may be recommended in selected group of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered using nasal masks with binasal prongs. We randomly allocated 72 neonates between 26 and 32 weeks gestation to receive bubble CPAP by either nasal mask (n = 37) or short binasal prongs (n = 35). Primary outcome was mean FiO(2) requirement at 6, 12 and 24 h of CPAP initiation and the area under curve (AUC) of FiO(2) against time during the first 24 h (FiO(2) AUC(0-24)). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of CPAP failure and nasal trauma. FiO(2) requirement at 6, 12 and 24 h (mean (SD); 25 (5.8) vs. 27.9 (8); 23.8 (4.5) vs. 25.4 (6.8) and 22.6 (6.8) vs. 22.7 (3.3)) as well as FiO(2) AUC(0-24) (584.0 (117.8) vs. 610.6 (123.6)) were similar between the groups. There was no difference in the incidence of CPAP failure (14 vs. 20%; relative risk 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.24-1.93). Incidence of severe nasal trauma was lower with the use of nasal masks (0 vs. 31%; p < .001).
   Conclusions: Nasal masks appear to be as efficacious as binasal prongs in providing CPAP. Masks are associated with lower risk of severe nasal trauma. Trial registration: CTRI2012/08/002868

AB  - Purpose: To describe unilateral periarterial plaque in a case of bilateral acute retinal necrosis (BARN) due to varicella zoster virus (VZV). Methods: Case report. Results: A 43-year-old diabetic male presented to us with dimness of vision in the left eye for three months. He was already on oral steroids and anti-viral therapy. Best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 OD and hand movements close to face OS. The right eye showed inferior and temporal retinal thinning and pigmentation and periarterial whitish focal Kyrieleis ' plaques, specifically along arterioles. Left eye had mild vitritis, optic disc pallor, arteriolar attenuation, with retinal whitening and areas of pigmentation involving 360 of peripheral retina along with some involvement of the posterior pole. Serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and cytomegalo virus (CMV) was negative. IgM for VZV was positive. Oral Valacyclovir 1 g thrice daily was continued and a slow taper of oral steroids was instituted. Conclusions: ARN should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases with Kyrieleis ' plaques and a peripheral retinal examination must be done to rule out patches of healed retinitis and vasculitis.

AB  - Molecular genetic testing for fragile X (FX) is complicated due to the large variation in the size of CGG expansion. The aim of this study was to apply this new technique using AmplideX FMR1 PCR assay, which is considered a better diagnostic tool for detecting expanded alleles in Indian population. The primary objective was to identify the carrier status of females and to correlate the instability of premutation alleles in females with the repeat sizes. 24 children with FX based on rapid PCR and 29 female relatives of these patients were included. Out of the 29 females screened, those whose child (or children) was affected by FX, were all premutation carriers confirming their role in transmission. The smallest PM allele that expanded into FM in the next generation was 78 repeats and the smallest PM allele detected was 63 repeats, and when transmitted from mother to offspring remained in the premutation range. In 4 families, the repeat size of the allele reduced from PM to normal repeat numbers in their daughters and in 1 case to borderline PM range. Thus, apart from the reduced turnaround time, this PCR based assay offers advantage by its sensitivity to detect CGG repeats in the intermediate region and lower range of premutation alleles. It also provides added information of AGG interruptions, which may have an impact on the counseling of women with intermediate and PM alleles.

AB  - The perioperative management of post-craniotomy pain is controversial. Although the concept of pain control in non-neurosurgical fields has grown substantially, the understanding of neurosurgical pain and its causative factors in such a population is inconclusive. In fact, the organ that is the center of pain and its related mechanisms receives little attention to alleviate distress during neurosurgical procedures. In contrast to the old belief that pain following intracranial surgery is minimal, recent data suggest the exact opposite. Despite the evolution of various multimodal analgesic techniques for optimal pain control, the concern of post-craniotomy pain remains. This paradox could be due to the lack of thorough understanding of different perioperative factors that can influence the incidence and intensity of pain in post-craniotomy population. Therefore, this review aims to give an in-depth insight into the various aspects of pain and its related factors in adult neurosurgical patients.

AB  - In the present study we report on genetic analysis in a patient with developmental delay, truncal obesity and vision problem, to find the causative mutation. Whole exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from whole blood of the patient which revealed a homozygous nonsense variant (c.2816T > A) in exon 8 of ALMS1 gene that results in a stop codon and premature truncation at codon 939 (p. L939Ter) of the protein. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Exome sequencing was helpful in establishing diagnosis of Alstrom syndrome in this patient. This case highlights the utility of exome sequencing in clinical practice. (C) 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Apheretic platelets are better quality blood components which reduce donor exposure and chances of TTIs to transfusion recipients when compared to the whole blood derived components. Though safe, these apheretic donations are associated with donor adverse events. We evaluated the incidence of such adverse events associated with the modern apheresis procedures that would provide an insight as well as help formulating preventive steps to avoid frequent occurrences of such events. This prospective audit-based observational study was conducted over 1 year. Donors for plateletpheresis were selected as per the standard operating procedure of the Apheresis Lab. The apheresis procedures were done on the MCS+ (Haemonetics Corp.), Trima Accel (Terumo BCT) and COM.TEC (Fresenius Kabi AG). 1740 apheresis procedures were performed, out of which 1708 were plateletpheresis and 32 therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) procedures for 7 patients. Atotal of 102 adverse events were noted; of which, 80 (78.43 %) events were associated with donors, 15 (14.71 %) were owed to equipment related problems and 7 (6.86 %) were technical aberrations. All the events associated with donors were mild. No adverse events were reported with any of the 32 TPEs. Apheresis procedures are associated with adverse events which can be reduced by meticulous donor-vigilance, superior training modules for the technical personnel and continued supervision of experienced transfusion medicine specialists. Continued efforts towards making the donor's experience with apheresis more pleasant give a forward thrust to the noble vision of preparing a voluntary apheresis donor pool in India.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate endothelial function and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without comorbidities.
   It is an observational case control study in which endothelial function was assessed using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), and carotid artery ultrasound was used to measure CIMT in study group subjects that included 20 normotensive, non-diabetic, treatment na < ve, and moderate to severe OSA patients, and 20 normotensive, non-diabetic, and non-OSA subjects served as a control group. Study was conducted in Polysomnography Laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Hospital, New Delhi.
   FMD was significantly lower in the moderate to severe OSA group compared to non-OSA group (mean +/- SD, 8.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 13.4 +/- 4.1 %; p = 0.0001). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) was also significantly lower in the OSA group (1.55 +/- 0.27 vs. 2.01 +/- 0.48, p = 0.0007). CIMT was observed to be significantly higher in the OSA group compared to the non-OSA group (0.54 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.08 mm; p = 0.049). In the OSA group, FMD, RHI, and CIMT did not show a significant correlation with OSA disease severity indices [apnea hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and minimum O-2 saturation].
   Endothelial function in macrovascular and microvascular circulation is significantly impaired in moderate to severe OSA patients without comorbidities. These patients also show evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis, in the form of increased CIMT.

AB  - Background To evaluate results of a technique for treating neglected epiphyseal injuries of the distal radius with ulnar impaction.
   Materials and methods This retrospective study involved six cases (four males; two females), all of whom sustained the primary injury during childhood (range 9-12 years of age). All presented with wrist deformity and ulnar-sided wrist pain. They were managed with osteotomy of the distal radius, osteotomy and shortening of the ulna, harvesting the bone grafts, and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) reduction performed simultaneously through a dorsal midline approach. Mean follow-up was 30 months (range 24-36).
   Results Deformity correction and pain relief was observed in all patients. Flexion arc increased from an average of 60 degrees to 102.5 degrees, supination from an average of 31.67 degrees to 67.50 degrees, and pronation from an average of 30.83 degrees to 61.67 degrees. The mean preoperative DASH score was 87.5, which improved to 18.72 postoperatively.
   Conclusion Neglected epiphyseal injuries of the distal radius are difficult to manage and many variations are described for handing each of the associated problems. Our technique provides an option for managing this injury with an easy surgical approach, single incision, and cost effectiveness. All the four components of the surgery, which include osteotomy of the distal radius, osteotomy of the ulna, harvesting the bone grafts, and DRUJ reduction were done through a single incision and in a single sitting.

AB  - Urban Asian Indians generally have low serum 25(OH) D. Information on serum bioavailable 25(OH) D and the effect of prolonged sun-exposure in them is not known. We assessed serum 25(OH) D and bioavailable 25(OH) D in males with varying durations of sun-exposure in Delhi during August-September. Serum 25(OH) D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), bioavailable 25(OH) D, free 25(OH) D index, iPTH, ionized calcium and sun-index were assessed in outdoor, mixed outdoor-indoor and indoor workers (n = 88, 32 and 74, respectively). The mean sun-index (12.0 +/- 6.25, 4.3 +/- 2.20 and 0.7 +/- 0.62, respectively; P < 0.001) was highest outdoors and lowest indoors. Serum 25(OH) D (29.0 +/- 8.61, 19.1 +/- 5.73 and 10.9 +/- 4.19 ng/ ml, respectively; P < 0.001), bioavailable 25(OH) D and free 25(OH) D index were maximum in outdoor workers followed by mixed-exposure and indoor workers. Their mean serum DBP levels (241.2 +/- 88.77, 239.3 +/- 83.40 and 216.6 +/- 63.93 mu g/ml, respectively; P = 0.12) were comparable. Mean serum iPTH was significantly lower in outdoor than indoor workers and showed inverse correlations with serum 25(OH) D, bioavailable 25(OH) D and free 25(OH) D index (r = -0.401, -0.269 and -0.236, respectively; P < 0.001 in all). Daily dietary-calorie intake was higher and calcium lower in outdoor than indoor workers. On regression analysis, sun-exposure was the only significant variable, increasing serum 25(OH) D by 2.03 ng/ml per hour of sun-exposure (95 % confidence interval 1.77-2.28; P < 0.001). Outdoor workers with prolonged sun-exposure were vitamin D-sufficient, with higher serum bioavailable 25(OH) D than the indoor workers during summer. Use of serum DBP levels did not affect the interpretation of their vitamin D status.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D)statistics have reached menacing proportions in India. Appropriate dietary intervention, as part of healthy lifestyle, is imperative to curb further spread of this disease.
   Objectives: This pre-post intervention study was conducted in New Delhi, India, to investigate the effects of daily consumption of almonds for 24 weeks in T2D subjects, specifically on measures of glycemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.
   Methods and Study Design: In this study, the 24-week intervention period was preceded by a control diet and exercise run-in period of 3 weeks. Raw almonds (20% of energy intake) were provided to the patients for consumption along with diet and physical activity counseling. Patients were assessed for anthropometry, blood pressure, measures of glycemia (fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin), lipids [ total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a)], surrogate marker of atherosclerosis (Pulse wave velocity), and marker of inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) at baseline and after the intervention period.
   Results: Statistically significant improvement in mean values for various parameters post intervention was as follows: waist circumference (P < 0.03), waist-to-height ratio (P <0.005), TC (P < 0.002), serum triglycerides (P < 0.004), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.01), glycosylated hemoglobin (P < 0.04), and hs-CRP (P < 0.01). A trend toward improvement in pulse wave velocity (P < 0.06) was also observed.
   Conclusion: The study findings illustrate that incorporation of almonds in a well-balanced healthy diet leads to multiple beneficial effects on glycemic and CVDs risk factors in Asian Indian patients with T2D.

AB  - The major brunt of scrub typhus is borne by developing countries like India but the disease remains neglected. The rapid progression of this infection to serious complications and associated mortality calls for improved diagnostics. The immunoglobulin (Ig)M immunofluorescence assay (IFA), with all of its limitations remains the gold standard. Of 218 suspected cases from patients enrolled in a 2-year study, 30 cases of scrub typhus were detected by IgM IFA, using a 1:64 dilution. The sensitivities of the IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, IgM rapid flow assay (RFA), and IgG RFA were found to be 97%, 87%, and 77%, respectively. Their respective specificities were 100%, 100%, and 92%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of a nested PCR assay targeting a gene encoding a 56-kDa protein were found to be 50% and 100%, respectively.

AB  - Critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to Buerger's disease is a major unmet medical need with a high incidence of morbidity. This phase II, prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, multicentric, dose-ranging study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of i.m. injection of adult human bone marrow-derived, cultured, pooled, allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSC) in CLI due to Buerger's disease. Patients were allocated to three groups: 1 and 2 million cells/kg body weight (36 patients each) and standard of care (SOC) (18 patients). BMMSCs were administered as 40-60 injections in the calf muscle and locally, around the ulcer. Most patients were young (age range, 38-42 years) and ex-smokers, and all patients had at least one ulcer. Both the primary endpoints-reduction in rest pain (0.3 units per month [SE, 0.13]) and healing of ulcers (11% decrease in size per month [SE, 0.05])-were significantly better in the group receiving 2 million cells/kg body weight than in the SOC arm. Improvement in secondary endpoints, such as ankle brachial pressure index (0.03 [SE, 0.01] unit increase per month) and total walking distance (1.03 [SE, 0.02] times higher per month), were also significant in the group receiving 2 million cells/kg as compared with the SOC arm. Adverse events reported were remotely related or unrelated to BMMSCs. In conclusion, i.m. administration of BMMSC at a dose of 2 million cells/kg showed clinical benefit and may be the best regimen in patients with CLI due to Buerger's disease. However, further randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the most appropriate dose.

AB  - Introduction: The high success rate in the management medulloblastoma achieved in the western world is not exactly mirrored in developing countries including India. Socio-demographic differences, health-care disparity, and lack in uniformity of care with resultant widespread variations in the clinical practice are some of the reasons that may partly explain this difference in outcomes. Patients with medulloblastoma require a multi-disciplinary team approach involving but not limited to neuro-radiology, neurosurgery; neuropathology, molecular biology, radiation oncology, pediatric medical oncology and rehabilitative services for optimizing outcomes.
   Methods: The Indian Society of Neuro-Oncology (ISNO) constituted an expert multi-disciplinary panel with adequate representation from all stakeholders to prepare national consensus guidelines for the contemporary management of medulloblastoma.
   Results: Minimum desirable, as well as preferable though optional recommendations (as appropriate), were developed and adopted for the pre-surgical work-up including neuroimaging; neurosurgical management including surgical principles, techniques, and complications; neuropathology reporting and molecular testing; contemporary risk-stratification in the molecular era; appropriate adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy); and follow-up schedule in medulloblastoma.
   Conclusions: The current document represents a broad consensus reached amongst various stakeholders within the neuro-oncology community involved in the contemporary curative-intent management of children with medulloblastoma. It provides both general as well as specific guidelines and recommendations to be adopted by physicians and health care providers across India to achieve uniformity of care, improve disease-related outcomes, and compare results between institutions within the country.

AB  - Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) plus beta blocker is the mainstay treatment after index bleed to prevent rebleed. Primary objective of this study was to compare EVL plus propranolol versus EVL plus carvedilol on reduction of HVPG after 1 month of therapy.
   Patients of cirrhosis presenting with index esophageal variceal bleed received standard treatment (Somatostatin therapy f/b EVL) following which HVPG was measured and patients were randomized to propranolol or carvedilol group if HVPG was > 12 mmHg. Standard endotherapy protocol was continued in both groups. HVPG was again measured at 1 month of treatment.
   Out of 129 patients of index esophageal variceal bleed, 59 patients were eligible and randomized into carvedilol (n = 30) and propranolol (n = 29). At 1 month of treatment, decrease in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and HVPG was significant within each group (p = 0.001). Percentage decrease in MAP was significantly more in carvedilol group as compared to propranolol group (p = 0.04). Number of HVPG responders (HVPG decrease > 20 % or below 12 mmHg) was significantly more in carvedilol group (22/29) as compared to propranolol group (14/28), p = 0.04.
   Carvedilol is more effective in reducing portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis with esophageal bleed. Though a larger study is required to substantiate this, the results in this study are promising for carvedilol. Clinical trials online government registry (CTRI/2013/10/004119).

AB  - Bone drilling is common in orthopedic procedures and the heat produced during conventional experimental drilling often exceeds critical temperature of 47 degrees C and induces thermal osteonecrosis. The osteonecrosis may be the reason for impaired healing, early loosening and implant failure. This study was undertaken to control the temperature rise by interrupted cutting and reduced friction effects at the interface of drill tool and the bone surface. In this work, rotary ultrasonic drilling technique with diamond abrasive particles coated on the hollow drill tool without any internal or external cooling assistance was used. Experiments were performed at room temperature on the mid-diaphysis sections of fresh pig bones, which were harvested immediately after sacrifice of the animal. Both rotary ultrasonic drilling on bone and conventional surgical drilling on bone were performed in a five set of experiments on each process using identical constant process parameters. The maximum temperature of each trial was recorded by K-type thermocouple device. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid decalcification was done for microscopic examination of bone. In this comparative procedure, rotary ultrasonic drilling on bone produced much lower temperature, that is, 40.2 degrees C +/- 60.4 degrees C and 40.3 degrees C +/- 60.2 degrees C as compared to that of conventional surgical drilling on bone, that is, 74.9 degrees C +/- 60.8 degrees C and 74.9 degrees C +/- 60.6 degrees C with respect to thermocouples fixed at first and second position, respectively. The conventional surgical drilling on bone specimens revealed gross tissue burn, microscopic evidence of thermal osteonecrosis and tissue injury in the form of cracks due to the generated force during drilling. But our novel technique showed no such features. Rotary ultrasonic drilling on bone technique is robust and superior to other methods for drilling as it induces no thermal osteonecrosis and does not damage the bone by generating undue forces during drilling.

AB  - Background. There is lack of reliable predictors of disease severity and mortality in dengue. The present study was carried out to identify these predictors during the 2015 outbreak in India.
   Methods. This prospective observational study included confirmed adult dengue patients hospitalized between August and November 2015 in a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India. Appropriate statistical tests were used to compare clinicolaboratory characteristics, derive predictors of severe disease and mortality, and compute a predictive score for mortality. Serotyping was done.
   Results. Data of 369 patients were analyzed (mean age, 30.9 years; 67% males). Of these, 198 (54%) patients had dengue fever, 125 (34%) had dengue hemorrhagic fever (grade 1 or 2), and 46 (12%) developed dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Twenty-two (6%) patients died. Late presentation to the hospital (>= 5 days after onset) and dyspnea at rest were identified as independent predictors of severe disease. Age >= 24 years, dyspnea at rest and altered sensorium were identified as independent predictors of mortality. A clinical risk score was developed (12(star) age + 14(star) sensorium + 10(star) dyspnea), which, if >= 22, predicted mortality with a high sensitivity (81.8%) and specificity (79.2%). The predominant serotypes in Delhi (2015) were dengue virus DENV2 and DENV4.
   Conclusion. Age >= 24 years, dyspnea at rest, and altered sensorium were identified as independent predictors of mortality. Platelet counts did not determine outcome in dengue patients. Timely referral/access to healthcare is important. The clinical risk score for mortality prediction that was developed in this study can be used in all healthcare settings, after validation in larger cohorts.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the outcomes of 400-m microkeratome head with 350-m microkeratome head Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) in a prospective comparative study.Methods:Twenty cases of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy were randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 underwent slow, single-pass 400-m microkeratome head, whereas group 2 underwent the standard technique of DSAEK using a 350-m microkeratome head. The primary outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 months.Results:Groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. The mean central graft thickness (GT) at 6 months in group 1 was significantly thinner than group 2 (90.4428.67 vs. 165.60 +/- 62.74 m; P=0.003). The BCVA and contrast sensitivity were significantly better in group 1 than in group 2 (BCVA: 0.34 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.19 logMAR units, P=0.02; contrast sensitivity: 1.48 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.22, P=0.001). A significant correlation was found between both postoperative BCVA and contrast sensitivity, with the postoperative GT using Spearman rho correlation analysis (R=0.534, P=0.01 for BCVA and R=-0.522, P=0.02 for contrast sensitivity). The percentage endothelial cell loss was comparable between the 2 groups at the last follow-up (P=0.3). No major complications were observed during the study period.Conclusions:The use of a 400-m microkeratome head instead of 350-m head can improve the visual outcomes in DSAEK without increasing the risk of complications. The thickness of the DSAEK graft can affect the visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.

AB  - Background & objectives: Although the need for a combination of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the treatment of epilepsy is well justified, but an associated increase in adverse effects (AEs) lends a restriction to polytherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate AEs and drug load (prescribed daily dose/defined daily doses) of AEDs in patients with epilepsy (PWE).
   Methods: Consecutive PWEs attending Epilepsy clinic in a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India, were enrolled in the study. Demographic variables, such as age, gender, diagnosis, age at onset of seizures, frequency of seizures, use of all AEDs and adverse event profile (AEP) score were noted. Routine laboratory tests including lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, haematological parameters and liver and kidney function tests were done.
   Results: A total of 697 consecutive patients were included in this study. Of them, 64.4 per cent were male; mean age was 29.6 +/- 10.6 yr. Generalized seizures and focal seizures were recorded in n=386 (55.4%) and n=311 (44.6%), respectively. Monotherapy and polytherapy with two and greater than or equal to three AEDs were prescribed in 264 (37.9%), 243 (34.9%) and 190 (27.2%) patients, respectively. The average AED load, duration of treatment as well as AEP score were found to be significantly higher in combination of greater than or equal to three AEDs as compared to both monotherapy and combination of two AEDs, whereas no significant difference was observed between monotherapy and combination of two AEDs. Patients on monotherapy were in good control of seizures as compared to polytherapy. There was no significant change in biochemical parameters between the groups.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Polytherapy with combination of greater than or equal to three AEDs was associated with higher AEs and lower seizure control as compared to both monotherapy and combination of two AEDs. AEs did not correlate with AED load, seizure type, gender and age of the patients but were associated with both numbers of AEDs as well as seizure frequency in PWE.

AB  - Purpose. Advanced cancer patients with disease progression develop cachexia. Nevertheless, cancer patients at nutritional risk have shown improved body weight and quality of life with oral nutritional supplements. Method. This was a randomized controlled trial in adult female cancer patients (n = 63) attending palliative clinics, with symptoms of cachexia. Eligible patients were randomly distributed into control (n = 33) and intervention (n = 30) groups. Both groups were provided with nutritional and physical activity counseling, but the intervention group received an additional 100 g of Improved Atta (IAtta) for 6 months daily consumption. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of IAtta (with counseling) in enhancing the health status of cachexic patients. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake, physical activity level and quality of life parameters were assessed at baseline, after 3 months, and at the end of 6 months. Results. Patients in the control group (n = 15) had significantly decreased body weight (P = .003), mid-upper-arm circumference (P = .002), and body fat (P = .002) by the end of intervention. A trend of body weight gain in the intervention group (n = 17; P = .08) and significant increase of body fat (P = .002) was observed; moreover, patients reported a significant improvement in fatigue (P = .002) and appetite scores (P = .006) under quality-of-life domains at the end of intervention. Conclusions. Embedding a nutrition-sensitive intervention ( IAtta ) within Indian palliative care therapy may improve quality of life and stabilize body weight in cancer cachexia patients.

AB  - Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic feature during the acute phase of engue infection and has been found to associate with vascular leakage in severe dengue. Although dengue antigens have been observed in platelets, there is no strong evidence to suggest a direct infection of platelets by dengue virus as a contributing factor for thrombocytopenia. We show that dengue virus can enter platelets but replicate viral ribonucleic acid to a minimal extent and, therefore, cannot produce infectious virus. Dengue antigen was undetectable in platelets isolated from dengue patients; however, we observed an increase in CD14(+)CD16(+) monocyte-platelet complexes, suggesting a mechanism for platelet clearance.

AB  - Background The increasing burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in low-and middle-income countries is largely driven by the increasing prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use. We hypothesize that the utilization of community health workers (CHWs) to screen for and manage these 3 determinants of CVD in an integrated manner would be an effective approach to favorably affecting public health.
   Methods We have designed and set up the infrastructure to implement a 2-year community-based cluster randomized controlled trial in an underserved region of West Bengal, India. Participants include around 1200 adults, aged between 35 and 70 years, with >= 1 cardiovascular risk factor. They are recruited through home-based screening into a total of 12 clusters, which are randomized to either a control or intervention arm before screening. After the screening, CHWs follow up with participants enrolled in the intervention arm for a period of 2 years through home visits. The control arm receives usual care in the community. The CHW arm follows a behavioral strategy focused on modifying the individual's lifestyle, increasing knowledge of CVD, promoting smoking cessation, increasing physician-seeking behavior, and promoting medication adherence. The main project office is based in Cleveland, OH, at University Hospitals/CWRU, and the local site office is located in Dalkhola, West Bengal, at a local nonprofit set up for the study. Institutional review board approval was obtained both in Cleveland as well as in India.
   Outcome evaluation The 2-year primary outcome of the study is the absolute reduction in systolic blood pressure among hypertensive participants, absolute reduction in fasting blood glucose among diabetic participants, and absolute reduction in average number of cigarettes smoked per day among smokers.
   Discussion We believe that this study infrastructure serves as a useful model for international collaboration. It builds on unique local resources, attends to important domestic requirements, and will ultimately provide an evidence-based approach that will help manage the increasing burden of CVD worldwide.

AB  - Advances in technology have made surgery in children safer and faster. The management of pediatric cataract has made rapid progress in the past decade with the availability of safer anesthesia, newer technique's, more predictable intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation, a better understanding of neurobiology, genetics, amblyopia management, improved IOL designs for preventing visual axis opacification, and adjuvant postoperative care. Modern vitrectomy machines with minimally invasive instruments, radiofrequency, diathermy, and plasma blades help immensely in complicated cases. Preoperative evaluation with ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows better planning of surgical procedure. The future holds good for stem cell research, customized OCT, and Zepto (precision pulse capsulotomy).

AB  - Objective: In the Re-NOVATE II study, oral dabigatran provided thromboprophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty and improved compliance postdischarge in a global population. This article aims to identify trends (if any) in the Indian population.
   Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, double-dummy study, patients scheduled for primary, unilateral, elective total hip arthroplasty were randomized to 220 mg oral dabigatran once daily, starting with a 110 mg half-dose, 1-4 hours after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, starting the evening before surgery. Each group received a placebo of the other study drug. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of total venous thromboembolism (VTE) and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome measures were composite of major VTE and VTE-related mortality during the treatment period. The major safety outcome was incidence of bleeding events.
   Results: Of the 179 Indian patients randomized, 91 received oral dabigatran and 88 received subcutaneous enoxaparin for 28-35 days. Total VTE and all-cause mortality occurred in 18.7% of patients in the dabigatran group and 13.7% in the enoxaparin group [odds ratio = 1.4 (95% confidence interval 0.6, 3.5)]. Major VTE and VTE-related mortality was numerically lower in the dabigatran group (7.9%) compared with the enoxaparin group (9.9%). Safety outcomes were comparable between both groups.
   Conclusion: Dabigatran is an effective oral alternative to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis as demonstrated by the RE-NOVATE II study global results. Data analyzed in Indian patients indicate comparable effects of dabigatran etexilate for major efficacy and safety outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To prepare percentile charts of lean body mass (LBM) among Indian urban children and adolescents; and to evaluate gender differences in LBM, and its relation with pubertal status.
   Design: Secondary data analysis.
   Setting: School in city of Delhi, India.
   Participants: 1403 apparently healthy children and adolescents (826 boys) with mean (SD) age 13.2 (2.7) years.
   Outcome measures: Lean body mass assessed by dual energy absorptiometry.
   Results: Total and regional lean mass were greater in older age groups in both sexes. LBM showed rising trends up to the age of 18 years in boys, whereas it plateaued after the age of 15 years in girls. The age-associated increase in LBM was significantly higher in boys (130%) compared to girls (83%) (P< 0.001). Total and regional lean mass increased with progression of pubertal staging in both genders. During pubertal development, LBM almost doubled (100% increase) from stage-2 to stage-5 in boys, as opposed to a 73% rise in girls (P< 0.001). Total and regional lean mass and Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) was positively correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), serum 25(OH)D, total fat mass, and bone mineral content (BMC). Relation between LBM and BMC remained significant even after adjusting for age, fat mass and various biochemical parameters.
   Conclusions: Total and regional LBM rise with age and pubertal maturation in both genders, but more so in boys when compared to girls. LBM has direct bearing on BMC even after adjusting for age, fat mass and biochemical parameters.

AB  - BackgroundMany studies reported for estimating serum YKL-40 using ELISA or RIA methods. This study introduces the plausible utilization of real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in investigating the expression of serum YKL-40 protein levels and ELISA method for serum IgE in bronchial asthma.
   MethodsA commercially available BIAcore 2000 instrument, based on SPR technology, was utilized for assessing serum YKL-40 levels in a control sample size of 45 and active sample size of 97. Antibody immobilization was optimized to obtain the best sensor performance and a sensitive analytic detection. A commercially available ELISA kit was utilized for detecting serum IgE to estimate allergic condition-associated asthma.
   ResultsThe results of SPR technology could distinctly classify with highly statistical significance, the asthma severities by estimating the elevated levels of YKL-40 in blood sera of minute quantities (up to 0.33 ng/ml), and thus differentiates superior utility in comparison with ELISA method. No statistically significant correlation of YKL-40 and IgE was observed.
   ConclusionsSerum YKL-40 may be used as a protein marker in classifying asthma severity by applying SPR technology as a reliable, label-free, highly sensitive, and cost-effective tool.

AB  - Biomarkers to predict the altering physiological conditions over the period leading toward the ocular disorders are of major importance in therapeutics. Isolation and validation of the biomarkers specific to ocular diseases are a challenging task. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the eye where the correlation of biomarkers in circulating fluid may be made specific for the eye. However, conditions such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR), circulating biomarkers might be having some degree of overlap with other conditions like cancer where a common factor such as angiogenesis is involved. Diabetes, a systemic disorder affecting the target organs such as eye, kidney, heart, and nervous system can be predicted using common circulating biomarkers. However, these markers need to be validated along with various stages of disease progression to enable the possibility of targeted pharmacological interventions apart from good glycemic control alone. This review compiles the attempts made to correlate such circulating biomarkers in the ocular conditions such as glaucoma, AMD, and DR in the search for a surrogate marker for diagnostic and prognostic value. To make biomarkers for the common convenience, genetic markers are excluded from this review.

AB  - Human calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV), a member of Ser/Thr kinase family, is associated with cancer, cerebral hypoxia and neurodegenerative diseases. beta-carotene is a colored organic compound, abundant in plants and fruits and is used in cancer prevention. Here, we report a strong binding affinity of beta-carotene with CAMKIV using molecular docking, fluorescence binding and isothermal titration calorimetry methods. Furthermore, beta-carotene also reduces the enzyme activity of CAMKIV moderately as observed during ATPase assay. To see the role of beta-carotene on cell proliferation and apoptosis, cancerous cells (HeLa, HuH7and MCF-7) and normal (HEK-293-T) cell lines were used. Admirable anticancer activity of beta-carotene was observed. We further performed propidium iodide and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) assays to understand the mechanism of anticancer activity of beta-carotene at molecular level. Our findings provide a newer insight into the use of beta-carotene in cancer prevention and protection via inhibition of CAMKIV by regulating the signaling pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Corneal thickness is an important parameter with diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Various studies have highlighted increase in corneal thickness in lowlanders on ascending to high altitude. However, there are no studies in the published literature pertaining to corneal thickness of the highlanders who are inhabitants of such altitudes. Hence, study was carried out with objective to determine the corneal thickness of highlanders living at heights of more than 11,000 feet and compare it with corneal thickness of lowlanders.
   Materials and Methods: The highlander participants of the study consisted of inhabitants of Ladakh region of India at an altitude of 11,000 feet or more and lowlander participants consisted of inhabitants at an altitude of 1500 feet. A total of 254 highlanders and 212 lowlanders participated. A mean of 25 measurements of central corneal thickness (CCT) of every participant was obtained for each eye using ultrasonic pachymeter.
   Results: The mean age of the participants was 41.8 (15.9) and 47.7 (17.7) years among lowlanders and highlanders, respectively. The highlanders had 11.95 mu m lower mean CCT reading compared to lowlanders after adjusting for age and sex (p value <0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in mean CCT readings of right eye and left eye in either lowlanders or highlanders. Age also had a significant effect after adjustment for location and gender (p = 0.001). CCT decreased by 0.31 mu m with every year increase in the age. Gender had no statistically significant effect.
   Conclusion: This study found statistically significant difference in CCT measurements between highlanders and lowlanders. The thinner corneas of highlanders may have a bearing on diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma, refractive surgery, contact lens fitting implantation of Intacs, and astigmatic keratectomy done on such patients. The study also opens the scope of further research in the area.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with that of multiphase computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of tumor response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Material and methods: Fifty patients (41 men, 9 women; mean age, 53 years +/- 12.5 [SD]) with a total of 70 HCCs (mean size, 5 cm +/- 3 [SD]) were evaluated. Post-TACE therapeutic assessment of HCC was done at 4 weeks. Patients with TACE done earlier and reporting with suspicion for recurrence were also included. Patients with hepatic masses seen on ultrasound were enrolled and subjected to CEUS, multiphase CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperenhancing area at the tumor site on arterial phase of CEUS/multiphase CT/MRI was termed as residual disease (RD), the patterns of which were described on CEUS. Diagnostic accuracies of CEUS and MPCT were compared to that of MRI that was used as the reference standard.
   Results: CEUS detected RD in 43/70 HCCs (61%). RD had a heterogeneous pattern in 22/43 HCCs (51%). Sensitivities of CEUS and multiphase CT were 94% (34/36; 95% CI: 81-99%) and 50% (18/36; 95% CI: 33-67%) respectively. Significant difference in sensitivity was found between CEUS and multiphase CT (P = 0.0001). CEUS and multiphase CT had 100% specificity (95% CI: 83-100%).
   Conclusion: CEUS is a useful technique for detecting RD in HCC after TACE. For long term surveillance, CEUS should be complemented with multiphase CT/MRI for a comprehensive evaluation. (C) 2016 Editions francaises de radiologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims (1) to evaluate ATRX expression in different grades and subtypes of gliomas and correlate with other hallmark genetic alterations, (2) to identify and characterize mosaic/heterogeneous staining in gliomas in terms of mutation status.
   One hundred seventy six cases of glioma were assessed for ATRX immunohistochemistry and subdivided into positive, negative and mosaic/heterogeneous staining patterns. Five cases with heterogeneous staining were further subjected to next generation sequencing.
   Higher frequency of ATRX immune-negativity was detected in grade II/III astrocytic, oligoastrocytic tumors and secondary glioblastomas (GBMs), while infrequent in primary GBMs and rare in oligodendrogliomas. Loss of expression was significantly associated with IDH1 and/or TP53 mutation, while mutually exclusive with 1p/19q codeletion. Mosaic/heterogeneous staining was detected exclusively in GBMs (21.2%). Two different types of mosaic staining were identified (1) Admixture of positive and negative nuclei or intermixed mosaic and (2) Separate fragments with positive and negative/intermixed mosaic staining. ATRX mutation was identified in 2/5 (40%) cases with mosaic staining while one case showed DAXX mutation. All these cases were characterized by distinctly separate immune-negative and positive/intermixed foci. Hence, it is suggested that cases with heterogeneous staining (especially those with distinctly negative fragments) should be subjected to mutation analysis.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effect of recorded maternal voice on child's cooperation during cardiac catheterization.
   Design: Randomized placebo controlled trial.
   Setting: Cardiac catheterization laboratory at a tertiary care hospital.
   Participants: 90 children with congenital heart disease scheduled for cardiac catheterization between July 2014 and Dec 2014 randomized to maternal voice group and control group.
   Intervention: During cardiac catheterization, children in maternal voice group listened to a 3-min audio-recording of their mother's voice, played in loop, using head-phones. Children in the other group wore headphones without auditory stimuli.
   Main outcome measures: Child's cooperation during cardiac catheterization as assessed by Child Emotional Manifestation Scale.
   Results: Children in the maternal voice group showed lower mean (SD) distress scores [13.2 (4.6) vs. 16 (5.6), P=0.01]. The requirement of sedative agents during the procedure was not different (P=0.09).
   Conclusions: Allowing children to listen to recorded voice of their mother is an effective strategy to improve cooperation during cardiac catheterization.

AB  - Objective To correlate the functional outcomes in children operated for anorectal malformations (ARM) using the Krickenbeck consensus and their quality of life (QOL).
   Methods Thirty-three children operated at a tertiary care Pediatric surgery centre were studied 2 y after completion of all the surgeries and if more than 3 y of age. The functional stooling outcomes, type of anomalies and surgical procedures were tabulated using the Krickenbeck classification. The QOL questionnaire consisted of five parameters (Social habit, school attendance, daily activity, relation to peers and feeling) and the scoring ranged between 0 and 12: Good (8-12), Fair (5-7) and Poor (0-4).
   Results Median age of the children at the time of study was 7 y (Range 4-14). Comparison of stooling outcomes and QOL showed no significant difference (p 0.48). QOL was not affected by the age at evaluation, type of anomaly and type of surgical procedure. Children with vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, radial and limb abnormalities (VACTERL) association had poorer QOL as compared to children without VACTERL association (p 0.02). Poor stooling outcomes were seen in children who underwent abdominoperineal pull through procedure (p 0.02).
   Conclusion QOL appears to be independent of the stooling outcomes in operated children of ARM with majority enjoying a good QOL (93.9%).

AB  - The study was aimed at evaluating adherence to treatment protocol and outcome in pediatric parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (PM-RMS). We analyzed the characteristics, treatment administered, outcomes and patterns of failure of pediatric PM-RMS, who were treated with multimodality therapy between January 2005 and December 2013. Univariate and multivariate analysis (MVA) was completed to evaluate the impact of various prognostic factors. Thirty-seven patients were treated at our institution. Majority of them had the primary disease in paranasal sinuses (n = 13). Majority of the patients belonged to group III (n = 30) and stage III (n = 24). The overall response rate to treatment was 52.5% (n = 21). At a mean follow-up of 19.1 months, 23 patients developed disease progression. The actuarial rates of failure-free survival and overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 40% and 67.5%, respectively. Patients who received > 20 weeks of intended chemotherapy schedule (P = 0.02) and had complete response to first-line treatment (P = 0.0004) were found to have superior failure-free survival on MVA. Complete response was the lone determinant of superior OS on MVA (P = 0.006). Majority of patients with PM-RMS present with advanced stage disease. Response to first-line treatment is a significant predictor of superior progression-free survival and OS in these patients.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of 6 patients presenting with tubo-ovarian mass or infertility with multi drug resistant (MDR) female genital tuberculosis (FGTB).
   Study design: It was an observational study in a tertiary referral centre, India on subjects with MDR FGTB on clinical examination and investigations. All patients were given category IV drugs using kanamycin (intramuscular), levofloxacin, pyrazinamide, cycloserine, ethionamide and ethambutol (or para aminosalicylic acid [PAS] for ethambutol resistant cases) for 6 months intensive phase followed by oral levofioxacin, cycloserine, ethionamide and ethambutol (or PAS for ethambutol resistant cases) for 18 months continuation phase.
   Patients were evaluated for primary end points (complete cure, partial response, no response, treatment completed) and secondary end points (recurrence rate, pregnancy rate) during treatment.
   Results: There were 2 (33.3%) primary MDR FGTB patients and 4 (66.6%) secondary MDR FGTB (three pulmonary MDR and one MDR lymphadenitis) patients. Mean age was 23.6 years. Presenting features were menstrual dysfunction in all patients (100%) especially oligomenorrhea in 3 (50%) patients, weight loss in all the patients (100%), cough with expectoration in three patients (50%), tubo-ovarian masses in five (833%) patients. Endometrial biopsy showed positive culture for AFB with rifampicin and isoniazid (INH) resistance in both primary MDR FGTB patients and in two secondary MDR FGTB patients who were sexually active. In secondary MDR FGTB, three pulmonary MDR patients had positive sputum AFB smear and culture, while the patient with MDR lymphadenitis had lymph node aspirate for AFB smear and culture positive with all showing resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid.
   Gene Xpert on endometrial biopsy or sputum was positive in 5 (83.3%) patients. Three (50%) patients (one primary and two secondary) have completed therapy while other 3 (50%) are in continuation phase. All patients are asymptomatic with one having 12 weeks ongoing successful pregnancy.
   Conclusion: MDR FGTB should be thought of in women of FGTB with tubo- ovarian masses who are not responding to first line drugs. Gene Xpert can be used in early diagnosis of MDR FGTB. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The authors report a rare case of ocular surface squamous neoplasia with intraocular involvement that had an initial masquerade presentation of recurrent anterior nodular scleritis. A 35-year-old male patient presented with right eye recurrent anterior nodular scleritis for which a lamellar patch graft was done. Two months later, the patient presented with recurrence of symptoms. Histopathology review revealed the presence of well-differentiated squamous cell malignancy. A high index of suspicion for malignancy is required in such cases when they do not respond to conventional therapy.

AB  - Strabismus is one of the most challenging subspecialties encountered in the field of ophthalmology. The concept of etiology of strabismus is being advanced with the development of newer imaging modalities and increased understanding of the genetics of strabismus. Imaging is also being used to aid in the planning of strabismus surgery. Newer horizons are being explored in the amblyopia management. The good old eye-pad is being replaced with the iPad. Early detection of loss of stereopsis is being used to decide the timing for strabismus surgery. Improvement of binocular summation has been discovered as a benefit of corrective strabismus surgery. Newer surgical techniques such as new transposition procedures are being developed to correct complex strabismus. Strabismus surgeries aided by adjustable sutures have increased the precision of a strabismologist. A new light has been thrown on the psychosocial impact of strabismus. A present-day strabismologist has advanced from the goal of ocular alignment to a bigger perspective "to regain the paradise lost: stereopsis."

AB  - Miliary tuberculosis (TB) results from a massive lymphohematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli and is characterized by tiny tubercles evident on gross pathology resembling millet seeds in size and appearance. The global HIV/AIDS pandemic and widespread use of immunosuppressive drugs and biologicals have altered the epidemiology of miliary TB. Considered to be predominantly a disease of infants and children in the pre-antibiotic era, miliary TB is increasingly being encountered in adults as well. The clinical manifestations of miliary TB are protean and nonspecific. Atypical clinical presentation often delays the diagnosis. Clinicians, therefore, should have a low threshold for suspecting miliary TB. Focused, systematic physical examination helps in identifying the organ system(s) involved, particularly early in TB meningitis, as this has therapeutic significance. Fundus examination for detecting choroid tubercles offers a valuable clinical clue for early diagnosis, as their presence is pathognomonic of miliary TB. Imaging modalities help in recognizing the miliary pattern, defining the extent of organ system involvement. Examination of sputum, body fluids, image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology or biopsy from various organ sites, needle biopsy of the liver, bone marrow aspiration, and biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Cytopathological, histopathological, and molecular testing (e. g., Xpert MTB/RIF and line probe assay), mycobacterial culture, and drug susceptibility testing must be carried out as appropriate and feasible. Miliary TB is uniformly fatal if untreated; therefore, early initiation of specific anti-TB treatment can be lifesaving. Monitoring for complications, such as acute kidney injury, air leak syndromes, acute respiratory distress syndrome, adverse drug reactions such as drug-induced liver injury, and drug-drug interactions (especially in patients coinfected with HIV/AIDS), is warranted.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate outcomes of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) in pediatric eyes with unilateral severe chemical injury which have undergone autologous simple limbal epithelial transplant (SLET). Settings and Design: The study design was a retrospective case series. Materials and Methods: This retrospective, case series of all children <16 years of age that have undergone DALK following autologous SLET procedure in unilateral severe chemical injury evaluates the outcomes and complications in the setting of a tertiary care center in North India. Statistical Analysis Used: Nonparametric data have been expressed as median (range), parametric qualitative data as percentage, and quantitative data as a mean +/- standard deviation. Spearman's correlation coefficient is used for finding a correlation between variables. Results: Eleven eyes of 11 children (5 male and 6 female) with a mean age of 8.9 +/- 4.7 years underwent DALK following ocular surface reconstruction with autologous SLET earlier for unilateral severe chemical injury with limbal stem cell deficiency. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 18 months (13.00 +/- 4.58 months) following DALK procedure. All patients with a minimal follow-up of 6 months were evaluated for visual outcomes. Visual acuity ranged from 0.3 to 3 logMAR units (0.6 +/- 0.2 logMAR units). Complications were encountered in three patients. Anatomical success was seen in 72.72% patients and visual success was noted in 54.54% patients. Conclusions: DALK is a feasible option in children with severe unilateral chemical injury who have undergone ocular surface reconstruction with autologous SLET procedures.

AB  - Antifungal peptides have gained interest as therapeutic agents in recent years because of increased multidrug resistance against present antifungal drugs. This study designed, synthesized and characterized antifungal activity of a small peptide analogue, DS6. This peptide was designed using the template from the N-terminal part of the antifungal protein, Aspergillus giganteous. DS6 inhibited Candida tropicalis (ATCC 13803), as well as its clinical isolates. DS6 was found to be a fungicidal, killing the fungus very rapidly. DS6 is also non-toxic to human cells. Synergistic interactions of DS6 with amphotericin B and fluconazole were also evident. DS6 is membrane lytic and exhibits antibiofilm activity against C. tropicalis. In conclusion, DS6 may have utility as an alternative antifungal therapy for C. tropicalis. Copyright (C) 2017 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a member of mammalian heme peroxidase superfamily whose other members are myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). In these enzymes, the heme moiety is linked to protein through two or three covalent bonds. In the mature LPO, the heme moiety is linked to protein through two ester bonds with highly conserved glutamate and aspartate residues. The previously reported structures of LPO have confirmed the formation of two covalent linkages involving Glu258 and Asp108 with 1-methyl and 5-methyl groups of pyrrole rings A and C respectively. We report here a new form of structure of LPO where the covalent bond between Glu258 and 1-methyl group of pyrrole ring A is present only in a fraction of protein molecules. In this case, the side chain of Glu258 occupies two distinct positions, each of which has a 0.5 occupancy. In one position, it forms a normal ester covalent linkage while in the second position, the side chain of Glu258 is located in the middle of the substrate binding site on the distal heme side. In this position, the atom of the side chain of Glu258 forms several contacts with atoms of other residues and heme moiety. Out of the two observed positions of the side chain of Glu258, the former contributes to the stabilization of heme position and improved catalytic action of LPO while the latter is responsible for the reduced stability of the heme position as well as it blocks the substrate binding site.

AB  - Background & Aims: Data on minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) in children is scarce. We aimed to study MHE in children with chronic liver disease (CLD) and to validate non-invasive objective tests which can assist in its diagnosis.
   Methods: We evaluated 67 children with CLD (38 boys; age 13 [7-18] years) and 37 healthy children to determine the prevalence of MHE. We also assessed the correlation of MHE with changes in brain metabolites by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HMRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived metrics, blood ammonia and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [ILE], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]). In addition, the accuracy of MR-based investigations for diagnosis of MHE in comparison to neuropsychological tests was analysed.
   Results: Thirty-four (50.7%) children with CLD had MHE on neuropsychological tests. MHE patients had higher BA (30.5 [6-74] vs. 14 [6-66] mu mol/L; p = 0.02), IL-6 (8.3 [4.7-28.7] vs. 7.6 [4.7-20.7] pg/ml; p = 0.4) and TNF-alpha (17.8 [7.8-65.5] vs. 12.8 [7.5-35] pg/ml; p = 0.06) than No-MHE.1HMRS showed higher glutamine (2.6 [2.1-3.3] vs. 2.4 [2.0-3.1]; p = 0.02), and lower choline (0.20 [0.14-0.25] vs. 0.22 [0.17-0.28]; p = 0.1) and myo-inositol (0.25 [0.14-0.41] vs. 0.29 [0.21-0.66]; p = 0.2) in MHE patients than those without MHE. Mean diffusivity (MD) on DTI was significantly higher in 6/11 brain areas in patients with MHE vs. no MHE. Brain glutamine had a significant positive correlation with blood ammonia, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MD of various brain regions. Neuropsycholog-ical tests showed a negative correlation with blood ammonia, IL6, TNF-alpha, glutamine and MD. Frontal white matter MD had a sensitivity and specificity of 73.5% and 100% for diagnosing MHE.
   Conclusions: In children with CLD, 50% have MHE. There is a significant positive correlation between markers of hyperammonemia, inflammation and brain edema and these correlate negatively with neuropsychological tests. MD on DTI is a reliable tool for diagnosing MHE.
   Lay summary: Fifty percent of children with chronic liver disease develop minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) and perform poorly on neuropsychological testing. These children have raised blood ammonia, inflammatory cytokines and mild cerebral edema on diffusion tensor imaging as compared to children without MHE. The higher the ammonia, inflammatory cytokines and cerebral edema levels the poorer the performance on neuropsychological assessment. The estimation of mean diffusivity on diffusion tensor imaging is an objective and reliable method for diagnosing MHE. (C) 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB  - Till date there are no randomized trials to suggest the superiority of intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging (IOMRI) guided trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection over two dimensional fluoroscopic (2D-F) guided resections. We conducted this trial to establish the superiority of IOMRI in pituitary surgery. Primary objective was to compare extent of tumor resection between the two study arms. It was a prospective, randomized, outcome assessor and statistician blinded, two arm (A: 10MRI, n = 25 and B: 2D-F, n = 25), parallel group clinical trial. 4 patients from IOMRI group cross-over to 2D-F group and were consequently analyzed in latter group, based on modified intent to treat method. A total of 50 patients were enrolled till completion of trial (n = 25 in each study arm). Demographic profile and baseline parameters were comparable among the two arms (p > 0.05) except for higher number of endoscopic procedures and experienced neurosurgeons (>10 years) in arm B (p = 0.02, 0.002 respectively). Extent of resection was similar in both study arms (A, 94.9% vs B, 93.6%; p = 0.78), despite adjusting for experience of operating surgeon and use of microscope/endoscope for surgical resection. We observed that use of IOMRI helped optimize the extent of resection in 5/20 patients (25%) for pituitary tumor resection in-group A. Present study failed to observe superiorty of IOMRI over conventional 2D-F guided resection in pituitary macroadenoma surgery. By use of this technology, younger surgeons could validate their results intra-operatively and hence could increase EOR without causing any increase in complications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The clinical forms of leprosy consist of a spectrum that reflects the host's immune response to the M. leprae; it provides an ideal model to study the host pathogen interaction and immunological dysregulation in humans. IL -10 and TGF-beta producing Tregs are high in leprosy patients and responsible for immune suppression and M. leprae specific T cells anergy. In leprosy, involvement of IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs remain unstudied.
   Objective: To study the role of IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs in the human leprosy.
   Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from leprosy patients were isolated and stimulated with M. leprae antigen (MLCwA) for 48 h. Intracellular cytokine IL-35 was evaluated in CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs, CD19(+) cells by FACS. Expression of PD-1 on CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs, CD19(+) cells and its ligand (PD-L1) on B cells, CD11c cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FACS). Serum IL-35 level was estimated by ELISA.
   Results: The frequency of IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs cells were found to be high in leprosy patients (p < 0.0001) as compared to healthy controls. These cells produced suppressive cytokine IL-35 which showed positive correlation with bacteriological index (BI) and TGF-beta producing Tregs, indicating its suppressive nature. We found higher expression of PD-1 on Tregs, B cell and its ligand (PD-L1) on antigen presenting cells in leprosy patients.
   Conclusion: This study point out a shift in our understanding of the immunological features that mediate and regulate the immune suppression and the disease progression in leprosy patients with a new paradigm (IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs) that is beyond TGF-beta and IL-10 producing Treg cells.

AB  - Leprosy is a bacterial disease caused by M. leprae. Its clinical spectrum reflects the host's immune response to the M. leprae and provide an ideal model to investigate the host pathogen interaction and immunological dysregulation. Tregs are high in leprosy patients and responsible for immune suppression of the host by producing IL-10 and TGF-beta cytokines. In leprosy, plasticity of Tregs remain unstudied. This is the first study describing the conversion of Tregs into Th1-like and Th17-like cells using in vitro cytokine therapy in leprosy patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from leprosy patients were isolated and stimulated with M. leprae antigen (MLCwA), rIL-12 and rIL-23 for 48 h. Expression of FoxP3 in CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs, intracellular cytokines IFN-gamma TGF-beta, IL-10 and IL-17 in Tregs cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FACS) after stimulation. rIL-12 treatment increases the levels of pStat4 in Tregs and IFN-gamma production. In the presence of rIL-23, pStat3(+) and IL-17A(+) cells increase. rIL-12 and r-IL-23 treatment downregulated the FoxP3 expression, IL-10 and TGF-beta production by Tregs and enhances the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86). In conclusion rIL-12 converts Tregs into IFN-gamma producing cells through STAT-4 signaling while rIL-23 converts Tregs into IL-17 producing cells through STAT-3 signaling in leprosy patients. This study may helpful to provide a new avenue to overcome the immunosuprression in leprosy patients using in vitro cytokine. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Cancer of the uterine cervix is the fourth most common cancer worldwide among women. However, there is limited data about elderly patients with cervical cancer and gross underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical trials. Hence, the optimal therapy of such patients is not well formulated.
   Methodology: We conducted this systematic review of evidence to assess patterns of care in elderly patients with cervical cancer.
   Results: A total of 17,338 publications are reported in PubMed until July, 2016 pertaining to cervical cancer. Out of these, only 24 publications (full length papers or meeting proceedings) reported about clinical outcomes of elderly patients with cervical carcinoma. These publications report data from as early as 1949 to the present In these publications, out of 14,479 patients aged >= 60 years of age, 11,279 (77.89%) received external beam radiation. Concurrent chemotherapy has been used in 11 publications. Brachytherapy usage has been reported in 19 publications. In a few studies, brachytherapy was not used because of fear of toxicity. Overall, low dose rate (LDR) was the most common modality, followed by high dose rate (HDR). The authors have showed technical reasons (48.7%), comorbidities (69.4%) and patient refusal (383%) as causes for not delivering brachytherapy. Five-year overall survival (OS) has been found to be inferior to the non-elderly cohort and ranges from 27%-69% for elderly patients compared to 58%-75% in the non-elderly population. An 11% 5 year OS has been reported for patients treated with suboptimal radiation dose compared to 74% in those treated with chemo radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy.
   Conclusion: Gross underrepresentation of patients above 65 years in clinical trials has resulted in treatment dilemmas in the elderly. Newer advances like immunotherapy, hypoxic modifiers, image guided radiation, image guided brachytherapy are promising approaches to reduce treatment complications and optimize outcome in elderly patients in cervical cancer.

AB  - Prior studies established constitutively active AP-1, NF-kappa B, and STAT3 signaling in oral cancer. Differential expression/activation of specific members of these transcription factors has been documented in HPV-positive oral lesions that respond better to therapy. We performed a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed, transcriptionally active members of these pivotal signaling mediators to develop specific signatures of HPV-positive and HPV-negative oral lesions by immunohistochemical method that is applicable in low-resource settings. We examined a total of 31 prospective and 30 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from treatment-naive, histopathologically and clinically confirmed cases diagnosed as oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC/OPSCC). Following determination of their HPV status by GP5 + /GP6 + PCR, the sequential sections of the tissues were evaluated for expression of JunB, JunD, c-Fos, p50, p65, STAT3, and pSTAT3(Y705), along with two key regulatory proteins pEGFR and p16 by IHC. Independent analysis of JunB and p65 showed direct correlation with HPV positivity, whereas STAT3 and pSTAT3 were inversely correlated. A combined analysis of transcription factors revealed a more restrictive combination, characterized by the presence of AP-1 and NF-kappa B lacking involvement of STAT3 that strongly correlated with HPV-positive tumors. Presence of STAT3/pSTAT3 with NF-kappa B irrespective of the presence or absence of AP-1 members was present in HPV-negative lesions. Expression of pSTAT3 strongly correlated with all the AP-1/NF-kappa B members (except JunD), its upstream activator pEGFR(Y1092), and HPV infection-related negative regulator p16. Overall, we show a simple combination of AP-1, NF-kappa B, and STAT3 members' expression that may serve as molecular signature of HPV-positive lesions or more broadly the tumors that show better prognosis.

AB  - The science of multiple myeloma (MM) and related plasma cell disorders is rapidly evolving with increased understanding of the disease biology and recent approval of the newer drugs widening the therapeutic armamentarium. Despite multiple international guidelines regarding the management of this disease, the practice of managing MM is not uniform amongst Indian physicians. There are challenges in management which are unique to the Indian patients. This review discusses these challenges and the consensus of the nation-wide experts in dealing with the same. We also briefly highlighted the perspective of international experts as discussed in the Myeloma State of the Art conference held in September 2016 at PGI, Chandigarh. An Indian Myeloma Academic Groupe (IMAGe) group was formed to strengthen the research, create awareness about myeloma and related disorders and form consensus guidelines/recommendations that can be adapted to the Indian Scenario.

AB  - An ever growing number of reports on graft rejection and/or failure even with good HLA matches have highlighted an important role of non-HLA antigens in influencing allograft immunity. The list of non-HLA antigens that have been implicated in graft rejection in different types of organ transplantation has already grown long. Of these, the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I chain-related molecule A (MICA) is one of the most polymorphic and extensively studied non-HLA antigenic targets especially in the kidney transplantation. Humoral response to MICA antigens has repeatedly been associated with lower graft survival and an increased risk of acute and chronic rejection following kidney and liver transplantation with few studies showing conflicting results. Although there are clear indications of MICA antibodies being associated with adverse graft outcome, a definitive consensus on this relationship has not been arrived yet. Furthermore, only a few studies have dealt with the impact of MICA donor-specific antibodies as compared to those that are not donor specific on graft outcome. In addition to the membrane bound form, a soluble isoform of MICA (sMICA), which has the potential to engage the natural killer cell-activating receptor NKG2D resulting in endocytosis and degradation of receptor-ligand interaction complex leading to suppression of NKG2D-mediated host innate immunity, has been a subject of intense discussion. Most studies on sMICA have been directed toward understanding their influence on tumor growth, with limited literature focusing its role in transplant biology. Furthermore, a unique dimorphism (methionine to valine) at position 129 in the alpha 2 domain categorizes MICA alleles into strong (MICA-129 met) and weak (MICA-129 val) binders of NKG2D receptor depending on whether they have methionine or valine at this position. Although the implications of MICA 129 dimorphism have been highlighted in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, its role in solid organ transplantation is yet to be explored. This review summarizes the currently available information on MICA antibodies, soluble MICA, and MICA-129 dimorphism in a setting of solid organ transplantation.

AB  - Trigeminal innervated areas in face, nasolacrimal, and nasal mucosa can produce a wide array of cardiorespiratory manifestations that include apnea, bradypnea, bradycardia, hypotension, and arrhythmias. This reflex is a well-known entity called "trigemino-cardiac reflex" (TCR). The role of TCR is investigated in various pathophysiological conditions especially in neurosurgical, but also skull base surgery procedures. Additionally, its significance in various sleep-related disorders has also been highlighted recently. Though, the role of diving reflex, a subtype of TCR, has been extensively investigated in sudden infant death syndrome. The data related to other sleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, bruxism is very limited and thus, this mini review aims to investigate the possible role and correlation of TCR in causing such sleep abnormalities.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Aqueous bark extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) has been in use as an ethnomedicine for cardiovascular ailments in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Studies using hemodynamic, ROS scavenging and anti-inflammatory parameters in animal models have shown its anti-atherogenic, hypotensive, inotropic, anti-inflammatory effects. However, details analysis on its effects on established molecular and cell biological markers are a prerequisite for its wider acceptance to the medical community.
   Aims of the study: To test the efficacy of TA extract in ameliorating cardiac hypertrophy induced by ISO in rats.
   Methods: Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by ISO (5 mg/kg/day s.c. for 14 days) in rats and a standardized aqueous extract of TA stem bark was orally administered by gavage. Total RNA and protein were isolated from control, ISO, ISO plus TA and TA treated rat hearts and analyzed for the transcripts for the markers of hypertrophy, signaling kinases, transcription factors and total protein profile.
   Results: TA extract reversed the induction of fetal genes like beta-myosin heavy chain, skeletal alpha-actin and brain natriuretic peptide in hypertrophic rat hearts. While ISO slightly increased the level of phospho-ERK, TA repressed it to about one third of the base line level. Survival kinase Akt, ER stress marker Grp78 and epigenetic regulator HDAC5 were augmented by ISO and TA restored them by various extents. ISO administration moderately increased the transcription factor NF kappa B binding activity, while coadministration of TA further increased it. AP-1 binding activity was largely unchanged by ISO treatment but it was upregulated when administered along with TA. MEF2D binding activity was increased by ISO and TA restored it to the baseline level. Global proteomic analysis revealed that TA treatment restored a subset of proteins up- and down-regulated in the hypertrophied hearts. Amongst those restored by TA were purinergic receptor X, myosin light chain 3, tropomyosin, and kininogen; suggesting a nodal role of TA in modulating cardiac function.
   Conclusions: This study for the first time reveals that TA partially or completely restores the marker mRNAs, signaling kinases, transcription factors and total protein profile in rat heart, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in preventing ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

AB  - Background: The Plasmodium genome encodes for a number of 6-Cys proteins that contain a module of six cysteine residues forming three intramolecular disulphide bonds. These proteins have been well characterized at transmission as well as hepatic stages of the parasite life cycle. In the present study, a large complex of 6-Cys proteins: Pfs41, Pfs38 and Pfs12 and three other merozoite surface proteins: Glutamate-rich protein (GLURP), SERA5 and MSP-1 were identified on the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface.
   Methods: Recombinant 6-cys proteins i.e. Pfs38, Pfs12, Pfs41 as well as PfMSP-1(65) were expressed and purified using Escherichia coli expression system and antibodies were raised against each of these proteins. These antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the native proteins and their associated partners from parasite lysate. ELISA, Far western, surface plasmon resonance and glycerol density gradient fractionation were carried out to confirm the respective interactions. Furthermore, erythrocyte binding assay with 6-cys proteins were undertaken to find out their possible role in host-parasite infection and seropositivity was assessed using Indian and Liberian sera.
   Results: Immunoprecipitation of parasite-derived polypeptides, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis, identified a large Pfs38 complex comprising of 6-cys proteins: Pfs41, Pfs38, Pfs12 and other merozoite surface proteins: GLURP, SERA5 and MSP-1. The existence of such a complex was further corroborated by several protein-protein interaction tools, co-localization and co-sedimentation analysis. Pfs38 protein of Pfs38 complex binds to host red blood cells (RBCs) directly via glycophorin A as a receptor. Seroprevalence analysis showed that of the six antigens, prevalence varied from 40 to 99%, being generally highest for MSP-1(65) and GLURP proteins.
   Conclusions: Together the data show the presence of a large Pfs38 protein-associated complex on the parasite surface which is involved in RBC binding. These results highlight the complex molecular interactions among the P. falciparum merozoite surface proteins and advocate the development of a multi-sub-unit malaria vaccine based on some of these protein complexes on merozoite surface.

AB  - Background: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are one of the commonest birth defects. There was paucity of community-based data on occurrence of NTDs in India, especially from rural parts of the country. Against this background, the current study was carried out with main objectives to determine the prevalence of NTDs and its specific types (anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocele) in a rural community setting over the time period 2001 to 2014. Methods: This was a community-based cross-sectional study carried out in 28 villages of Ballabgarh Tehsil of Faridabad district in north India (population similar to 96,000). A household survey was undertaken by trained multipurpose workers who enquired ever-married women about history of conception with outcome as NTD during the study period. The probable case of NTD was determined using a colored pictorial card with photographs of different types of NTDs. These cases were confirmed by doctors. Results: A total of 26,946 live births occurred during the years 2001 to 2014. A total of 140 confirmed cases of NTDs were identified. The live birth prevalence of NTDs was 24.1 per 10,000 live births (95% confidence interval, 18.8-30.6). The birth prevalence of NTDs for the years 2008 to 2014 was 50.8 (95% confidence interval, 39.9-63.8) per 10,000 live and stillbirths. The most common type of NTD was found to be spina bifida followed by anencephaly and encephalocele. Conclusion: We found high prevalence of NTDs in rural community settings from north India for years 2001 to 2014. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is one of the member of the mammalian proteins of the Sirtuin family of NAD+ dependent deacetylases, has recently been shown to attenuate amyloidogenic processing of amyloid protein precursor (APP) in in-vitro cell culture studies and transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SIRT1 has been shown to have a protective role against (AD). It has been reported earlier that increasing SIRT1 activity can prevent AD in mice model. Tripeptide as an activator of SIRT1 were screened on the basis of structural information by molecular docking and synthesized by solid phase method. The enhancement of biochemical activity of pure recombinant SIRT1 as well as SIRT1 in serum of AD patients in presence of tripeptide was done by Fluorescent Activity Assay. The activity of SIRT1 by peptide was assessed in IMR-32 cell line by measuring acetylated p53 level. Further the protective effect of SIRT1 activator in cellular model of AD was analyzed by MIT assay. We find CWR tripeptide as a SIRT1 activator by molecular docking, enhanced the activity of SIRT1 protein by lowering the Michaelis constant, Km by allosteric mechanism. The activity of serum SIRT1 of AD was also increases by CWR. It also decreased the acetylation of p53 in IMR32 neuroblastoma cells and protected the cell death caused by A beta amyloid fragments in cell line model of AD. Thus, it can be concluded that CWR may serve as platform to elucidate further small molecule activator as a therapeutic agent for AD targeting SIRT1. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Melamine adulteration of food: detection by point-of-care testing tool
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
KW  - PRODUCTS

AB  - Melamine has emerged as one of the major food adulterants world over. Its high nitrogen content makes it a cheaper protein alternative, resulting in illegal adulteration of food and feed. Despite past incidences showing a higher risk to humans, there is no single method available to detect melamine in human samples at a lower cost-setting. Since melamine is excreted in the urine in an unchanged form, it can be detected directly by the development of a test at a patient's bedside via exploiting the intrinsic fluorescence ability of melamine cyanuric acid complex. Such a simple test will encourage huge public awareness and participation.

AB  - Hyperglycemia induced advanced glycation end products-receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE-RAGE) activation is thought to involve in the development of cardiovascular disease in diabetics. Activation of AGE-RAGE axis results in the oxidative stress and inflammation. Mangiferin is found in the bark of mango tree and is known to treat diseases owing to its various biological activities. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of mangiferin in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) induced myocardial injury in diabetic rats. A single injection of STZ (70 mg/kg; i. p.) was injected to male albino Wistar rats to induce diabetes. After confirmation of diabetes, rats were administered vehicle (2 ml/kg; i. p.) and mangiferin (40 mg/kg; i. p.) for 28 days. On 28th day, left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 45 min and then reperfused for 60 min. Mangiferin treatment significantly improved cardiac function, restored antioxidant status, reduced inflammation, apoptosis and maintained myocardial architecture. Furthermore, mangiferin significantly inhibited the activation of AGE-RAGE axis, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 and increased the expression of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the myocardium. Thus, mangiferin attenuated IR injury in diabetic rats by modulation of AGE-RAGE/MAPK pathways which further prevented oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in the myocardium.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Traditionally, Zizyphus jujuba is used for anticonvulsant, hypnotic-sedative, anxiolytic, tranquilizer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Likewise silymarin is popularly used for its potent antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. Stroke being a multifactorial disease with unsatisfactory treatment outcomes, necessitates development of multimodal therapeutic interventions. Thus, we evaluated the therapeutic benefits of herbal combination of Z jujuba and silymarin in a focal cerebral ischemia model.
   Aim of the study: To evaluate the neuroprotective potential of hydroalcoholic extract of Z jujuba (HEZJ) fruit and silymarin alone and in combination in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model of focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
   Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats were pretreated with HEZJ (100, 250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) or silymarin (250 mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 days prior to induction of MCAo. Neurological deficit score, motor impairment and cerebral infarction were assessed 24 h following MCAo. HEZJ (250 mg/kg) co-administered with silymarin (250 mg/1<g) for 3 days prior to induction of MCAo was also evaluated for above parameters and oxidative stress. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in the cortex, striatum and hippocampal brain regions were estimated 24 h post MCAo.
   Results: Pretreatment with HEZJ and silymarin reduced the neurological deficit score, motor impairment and cerebral infarction volume. HEZJ and silymarin pretreatment also ameliorated the oxidative stress in different brain regions, which was evident from increased SOD levels, decreased MDA and NO levels as compared to MCAo control rats. Interestingly neuroprotective efficacy was potentiated by pretreatment with HEZJ and silymarin combination.
   Conclusion: Pretreatment with HEZJ and silymarin combination was observed to have better neuroprotection mediated via amelioration of oxidative stress in the focal cerebral ischemia model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The stem bark of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) is widely used in Ayurveda in various cardiovascular diseases. Many animal and clinical studies have validated its anti-ischemic, antihypertensive, antihypertrophic and antioxidant effects.
   Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a fatal disease which causes right ventricular hypertrophy and right heart failure. Pulmonary vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased oxidative stress are major pathological features of PH. As available limited therapeutic options fail to reduce the mortality associated with PH, alternative areas of therapy are worth exploring for potential drugs, which might be beneficial in PH.
   Aim of the study: The effect of a standardised aqueous extract of the stem bark of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) in preventing monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH in rat was investigated.
   Materials and methods: The study was approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committe. Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were randomly distributed into five groups; Control, MCT (50 mg/kg subcutaneously once), sildenafil (175 pg/kg/day three days after MCT for 25 days), and Arjuna extract (TA125 and TA250 mg/kg/day orally after MCT for 25 days). PH was confirmed by right ventricular weight to left ventricular plus septum weight (Fulton index), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), echocardiography, percentage medial wall thickness of pulmonary arteries (%MWT). Oxidative stress in lung was assessed by super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TSARS). The protein expressions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX-1) in lung and gene expression of Bc12 and Bax in heart were analyzed by Western blot and RT PCR respectively.
   Results: MCI' caused right ventricular hypertrophy (0.58 +/- 0.05 vs 0.31 +/- 0.05; P < 0.001 vs. control) and increase in RVSP (33.5 +/- 1.5 vs 22.3 +/- 4.7 mm of Hg; P < 0.001). Both sildenafil and Arjuna prevented hypertrophy and RVSP. Pulmonary artery acceleration time to ejection time ratio in echocardiography was decreased in PH rats (0.49 +/- 0.05 vs 0.32 +/- 0.06; P < 0.001) which was prevented by sildenafil (0.44 +/- 0.06; P < 0.01) and TA250 (0.45 +/- 0.06; P < 0.01). % MWT of pulmonary arteries was increased in PH and was prevented by TA250. Increase in TBARS (132.7 +/- 18.4 vs 18.8 +/- 1.6 nmol/mg protein; P < 0.001) and decrease in SOD (58.4 +/- 14.1 vs 117.4 +/- 26.911/mg protein; P < 0.001) and catalase (0.30 +/- 0.05 vs 0.75 +/- 0.31 U/mg protein; P<0.001) were observed in lung tissue of PH rats, which were prevented by sildenafil and both the doses of Arjuna extract. Protein expression of NOX1 was significantly increased in lung and gene expression of Bc12/Bax ratio was significantly decreased in right ventricle in MCT-induced PH, both were significantly prevented by Arjuna and sildenafil.
   Conclusions: Aqueous extract of Terminalia aijuna prevented MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension which may be attributed to its antioxidant as well as its effects on pulmonary arteriolar wall thickening. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and purpose Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) is a rare developmental intracranial vascular malformation. We analyzed the clinical presentations, imaging findings, angioarchitecture, management options, and outcome in a demographically heterogeneous set of VGAM patients.
   Methods We retrospectively analyzed cases of VGAM from our departmental archive collected between 1988 and January 2015. Demographic, clinical, therapeutic, and follow-up details were obtained for each patient from the available records.
   Results We identified 36 patients with VGAM including 6 neonates, 18 infants, 7 children aged 2-10years, and 5 adults. Macrocrania was the commonest presenting feature. Type of fistulae was mural in 14 and choroidal in 18 patients while 4 had a thrombosed sac at presentation. In 3 cases the dilated venous sac had connection with the deep venous system. Bilateral jugular atresia and stenosis were seen in 9 and 6 patients, respectively. Giant venous sac (>4cm) was significantly correlated with mural type (p=0.0001). Dural arterial recruitment was seen in 4 patients including 3 adults. Among the 23 patients treated by endovascular means, 14 had a good outcome, 5 had a poor outcome, and 4 died. A significant correlation was noted between jugular atresia and poor outcome (p=0.003).
   Conclusions We encountered a wide range of demographic, clinical, and angiographic features in VGAM. Mural type malformations were associated with giant venous sacs. Good outcome after embolization was seen in selected neonates and in most of the infants, children, and adults. Jugular atresia was significantly associated with poor outcome.

AB  - IntroductionTuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. Immunosuppressive drugs are one of the most important risk factor for post-transplant tuberculosis (PTTB). A paucity of data exists about the impact of the type of calcineurin inhibitor on PTTB.
   MethodsIn this retrospective study, all adult patients on calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression were included. Patients receiving TB chemoprophylaxis were excluded. Diabetes, duration of dialysis, hepatitis B and C, past treated TB, induction therapy, type of antimetabolite, acute rejection, new onset of diabetes after renal transplantation (RT) (NODAT) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were analyzed in tacrolimus (Tac) and cyclosporine (CsA) groups. Primary outcome was incidence of TB and secondary outcomes were timeline of development of TB after RT and pattern of TB in the two groups.
   ResultsOf the 1664 patients included, 582 patients received CsA-based immunosuppression while 1082 received Tac-based immunosuppression. Duration of dialysis, positive tuberculin skin test, use of induction, mycophenolate mofetil use, CMV infection, and NODAT were significantly more, and hepatitis B infection, past treated TB, and acute rejection episodes were significantly less in the Tac group. At the end of follow-up, incidence of TB in the Tac group was significantly less than in the CsA group (6.1% vs 19.9%, P<.001). Mean time for development of TB after RT was similar in both the groups and nodal and disseminated TB were more common in the Tac group.
   ConclusionIn conclusion, our study shows that use of Tac as compared to CsA significantly decreases incidence of PTTB. Time of infection since transplant was similar in both the groups. However, nodal and disseminated TB were more common in the Tac group.

AB  - Human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) is a potent immune-tolerant molecule and has a critical role in various pathological conditions of cancer. The aim of the study was to analyze the association of HLA-G polymorphism as a risk factor in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). The HLA-G polymorphism at 3'UTR 14bp INDEL (rs371194629) and +3142G/C (rs1063320) were studied in 383 HNSCC patients and 383 ethnically similar-aged healthy controls in North Indian population. The genotyping study of two polymorphisms of HLA-G was documented using DNA-PAGE and RFLP-PCR method. 14bp INDEL Del/Ins, Ins/Ins genotype and Ins allele were more pronounced in HNSCC patients in compared to controls. Whereas, +3142 C/C genotype and C allele were associated with risk factors in HNSCC. Furthermore, the dual effect of polymorphisms; both variants (Del/Ins-Ins/Ins & G/C-C/C) carrying loci was significantly (OR = 2.78) associated with the disease compared to one variant (Del/Del-G/C or Del/Del-C/C or Ins/Ins-G/G). Moreover, both polymorphisms showed promising link in terms of tobacco influence on HNSCC risk. It can be concluded that this study first time reports that C/C, Del/Ins and Ins/Ins genotype as well as C and Ins allele could be major risk factors with strong impact of tobacco for HNSCC in North Indian population.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) methodology has demonstrated consistent benefits in patients undergoing colorectal, urological and thoracic surgeries. Principles of these protocols and their advantages are expected to extend into other surgical specialties such as bariatric surgery. In this review, we summarize the components of ERAS protocols for bariatric surgery and present the evidence on the emerging role of ERAS principles in obese patients.
   Recent findings
   Many recent trials have evaluated ERAS protocols for bariatric surgery. Most of these protocols originate from modifications within the individual hospital-based conventional perioperative care strategies. Studies demonstrate that 'ERAS based' care requires evidence-based modifications in all preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative phase. Despite a lack of standardization in protocols at present, benefits such as decreased length of hospital stay, rapid patient turnover, shorter operating room times and lower healthcare costs have been well demonstrated repeatedly.
   Summary
   ERAS for bariatric surgery is in its early phase. Nevertheless, literature supports its role in improving perioperative outcomes compared with conventional care in this scenario. Evidence-based protocols, multidisciplinary teamwork and meticulous audit seem to be the key factors for success in ERAS methodology.

AB  - Background & objectives: Antibodies specific to donor human leucocyte antigen (HLA) play a critical role in graft rejection and graft loss. In recent years, techniques for their detection have evolved significantly providing an ever-increasing degree of sensitivity and specificity, from the conventional cell-based assays to the advanced solid-phase system based on the Luminex platform. Consensus is still evolving on the routine employment of all these methods, either stand alone or in combination. The objective of this study was to explore the near-accurate mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) cut-off values detected on Luminex platform predicting the strength of cell-based crossmatch results.
   Methods: Serum samples from 116 primary renal transplant recipients awaiting transplantation were tested for the presence of antidonor antibodies by the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and flow crossmatch (FCXM) methods with their corresponding donors as well as for HLA-donor-specific antibodies (DSA) detection using a sensitive single antigen bead (SAB) assay.
   Results: None of the patients having HLA Class I DSA with MFI values < 1000 showed positivity for T-cell FCXM or CDC crossmatch, while in the group having MFI values between 1000 and 3000, 54 per cent showed positivity for the FCXM but none by the CDC method. However, in the group having MFI values > 3000, 95 per cent of cases were positive for FCXM. Further, those groups with MFI values between 3000 and 5000, only 36 per cent were positive for CDC crossmatch, while 90 per cent showed positivity in the group with MFI > 7000.
   Interpretation & conclusions: A cut-off MFI value of 3000 for Luminex SAB-based assay was found to significantly correlate with the FCXM positivity while a MFI value of 7000 and above predicted a positive CDC crossmatch. MFI cut-off value obtained as a surrogate marker for CDC and FCXM tests will help in resolving the limitations of different cell-based techniques.

AB  - Forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors are a class of highly conserved proteins, which serve critical cellular functions including cell cycle regulation. The downstream mechanisms of cell cycle regulation involve preservation of retinoblastoma protein function. Its deactivation by phosphorylation and translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm leads to cell proliferation. FOXO3a has been found to be dysregulated in few cancers. However, no study has been reported on role of FOXO3a in retinoblastoma. We assessed the expression of FOXO3a in sections of archived tissue blocks of enucleated/exenterated specimens of retinoblastoma by immunohistochemistry. The histopathologic features were reviewed and correlated with its expression. Effect of FOXO3a expression on survival was assessed. FOXO3a expression was assessed in 100 sections. Six samples did not contain any viable tissue. Retrospective data of 94 patients revealed that median age at presentation was 36 months with male: female ratio of 1.9:1. Fifty-one percent of patients were International Retinoblastoma Staging System stage 1. Of the 94 sections, 68 (72%) showed cytoplasmic expression. Choroidal invasion was associated with cytoplasmic FOXO3a (P = 0.04). A trend was also noted in optic nerve cut end involvement (P = 0.07). No other histopathologic features were found to be associated with FOXO3a expression. The overall survival and progression-free survival were not found to be affected by FOXO3a expression. Cytoplasmic expression of FOXO3a is frequently found in retinoblastoma and may be involved in pathogenesis. Activation by relocation of FOXO3a to nucleus may activate nonmutated retinoblastoma and may be a potential target of treatment in retinoblastoma.

AB  - Objectives: An accurate description of the seizure semiology improves the recognition of the ictal onset zone and helps in hypothesizing the possible epileptogenic zone (EZ). Semiology based on a reliable description of seizures may be as good as investigative modalities, as has been shown by numerous studies. The main objective of this study was to apply a questionnaire-tool for auras and semiology (QUARAS) in refractory epilepsy cohort and compare its yield to that of standard history-taking.
   Methods: A drug refractory epilepsy cohort of 139 subjects was selected, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects underwent routine history-taking, and a structured interview with QUARAS (in Hindi language) about 3-6 months later when they were admitted for pre-surgical work-up (Video-EEG, MRI, SPECT and PET), by an epilepsy nurse. Seizures were localised and lateralised at the each step separately, in a blinded manner; concordance with the final hypothesis was checked, after the epilepsy-surgery case-conference, and statistical significance of the difference calculated.
   Results: Auras were reported in significantly more number of patients after administration of QUARAS (p < 0.001); there was also higher concordance between the final hypothesis and the localization and lateralization based on QUARAS than an unstructured history (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Administering a structured questionnaire in the native language of patients by trained personnel leads to better localisation and lateralisation and may help arrive at a hypothesis about the EZ. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The treatment of retinoblastoma (Rb) has improved significantly in recent times. Worldwide, there is an increasing trend to use conservative treatment modalities that aim to preserve the globe as well as vision with minimum morbidity. Recently, the use of targeted delivery of chemotherapy to the eye in the form of selective intra-arterial and intravitreal chemotherapy has shown promising results. Radiotherapy is beneficial in selected cases, either in the form of plaque brachytherapy or as external beam radiotherapy. Orbital disease carries a poor prognosis for survival. However, a multimodal treatment protocol has improved survival in children with extraocular disease. Nevertheless, challenges remain, especially for the developing world. This review aims to highlight recent advances in the management of Rb that have contributed towards improving treatment outcomes and also discuss the challenges ahead, with special reference to the Indian scenario.

AB  - Trabeculectomy surgery is the current standard of care in glaucoma for achieving a low target intraocular pressure if medical therapy is not adequate. Augmentation of trabeculectomy with antimetabolites brought a revolutionary change in the long-term success rates of trabeculectomy, but along with it came a plethora of complications. There still is a big window for therapeutic innovations on this subject. The foremost target for these innovations is to modulate the wound healing response after glaucoma drainage surgery. Achieving the desired balance between long-term success of filtering blebs versus early failure due to scarring of blebs and hypotony due to dysfunctional filtering blebs poses a unique challenge to the ophthalmologists. Alternatives to trabeculectomy such as glaucoma drainage devices and minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries cannot solve the problem of glaucoma blindness in our country, mainly due to their unpredictable results and unfavorable cost-benefit ratio. In this article, we present a summary of our innovations in glaucoma surgery to advance patient care by making it more effective, safer, and economical.

AB  - Albumin is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, modifications in albumin structure may reduce its antioxidant properties and modulate its immune-regulatory functions. We examined alterations in circulating albumin in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) patients and their contribution to neutrophil activation, intracellular stress, and alteration in associated molecular pathways. Albumin modifications and plasma oxidative stress were assessed in SAH patients (n= 90), alcoholic cirrhosis patients (n= 60), and healthy controls (n=30) using liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry and spectrophotometry. Activation and intracellular ROS were measured in healthy neutrophils after treatment with purified albumin from the study groups. Gene expression of SAH neutrophils was analyzed and compared to gene expression from healthy neutrophils after stimulation with purified albumin from SAH patient plasma. SAH- albumin showed the highest albumin oxidative state (P < 0.05) and prominent alteration as human nonmercaptalbumin 2 (P < 0.05). Plasma oxidative stress (advanced oxidative protein product) was higher in SAH versus alcoholic cirrhosis patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, myeloperoxidase, and intracellular ROS levels were highest in SAH- albumin- treated neutrophils (P < 0.05). Genes associated with neutrophil activation, ROS production, intracellular antioxidation, and leukocyte migration plus genes for proinflammatory cytokines and various toll- like receptors were overexpressed in SAH neutrophils compared to healthy neutrophils (P < 0.05). Expression of the above- mentioned genes in SAH- albumin- stimulated healthy neutrophils was comparable with SAH patient neutrophils, except for genes associated with apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In patients with SAH, there is a significant increase in albumin oxidation, and albumin acts as a pro-oxidant; this promotes oxidative stress and inflammation in SAH patients through activation of neutrophils.

AB  - BackgroundSevoflurane is preferred for pediatric day care procedures. However, financial and environmental costs remain major limitations. Induction dose of sevoflurane could itself be sufficient for maintaining anesthesia with low fresh gas flow during short noninvasive procedures.
   MethodsFifty children, aged 1-5 years, scheduled for ophthalmic examination under anesthesia, were randomized into two groups. All children were induced with 8% sevoflurane in O-2 : N2O (40 : 60). In the Group S, anesthesia was maintained with 2% sevoflurane at 1 lmin(-1) fresh gas flow [O-2 : N2O = 50 : 50]. In Group L, the sevoflurane vaporizer was turned off and fresh gas flow was reduced to 0.5 lmin(-1) [O-2 : N2O = 50 : 50]. HR, BP, MAC, BIS, total sevoflurane consumption, ocular deviation, body movement, time to laryngeal mask airway removal (T-WO), and airway complications were compared between the groups. Rescue propofol bolus was used, if needed.
   ResultsMedian duration of examination was 14 min (IQR = 9-17) in Group S and 15 min (IQR = 10-17) in Group L. Sevoflurane consumption was lower in the Group L (7 ml) compared to Group S (9 ml) [median difference = 2 ml, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.96-3.04]. T-WO was lower in Group L (86 s) compared to Group S (131 s) [median difference = 45 s, P = 0.002, 95% CI = 19.85-70.15]. There was no difference in hemodynamic parameters, incidence of ocular deviation, movement or airway complications, and need for rescue propofol.
   ConclusionInduction dose of sevoflurane is, in itself, adequate for maintaining anesthesia for short noninvasive ophthalmic examinations lasting approximately 15 min. This method significantly reduces sevoflurane consumption and cost.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of Azadirachta indica (neem)-based herbal mouthrinse in improving plaque control and gingival health. Methods: Literature search was accomplished using electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE) and manual searching, up to February 2015, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) presenting clinical data for efficacy of neem mouthrinses when used alone or as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene as compared to chlorhexidine mouthrinses for controlling plaque and gingival inflammation in patients with gingivitis. Results: Of the total 206 articles searched, three randomized controlled trials evaluating neem-based herbal mouthrinses were included. Due to marked heterogeneity observed in study characteristics, meta-analysis was not performed. These studies reported that neem mouthrinse was as effective as chlorhexidine mouthrinse when used as an adjunct to toothbrushing in reducing plaque and gingival inflammation in gingivitis patients. However, the quality of reporting and evidence along with methods of studies was generally flawed with unclear risk of bias. Conclusion: Despite the promising results shown in existing randomized controlled trials, the evidence concerning the clinical use of neem mouthrinses is lacking and needs further reinforcement with high-quality randomized controlled trials based on the reporting guidelines of herbal CONSORT statement.

AB  - There is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying epilepsy to find novel prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers to prevent epilepsy patients at risk. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is involved in multiple neuronal functions and plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostatic synaptic plasticity by regulating intracellular signalling cascades at synapses. CDK5 deregulation is shown to be associated with various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The association between chronic loss of CDK5 and seizures has been reported in animal models of epilepsy. Genetic expression of CDK5 at transcriptome level has been shown to be abnormal in intractable epilepsy. In this review various possible mechanisms by which deregulated CDK5 may alter synaptic transmission and possibly lead to epileptogenesis have been discussed. Further, CDK5 has been proposed as a potential biomarker as well as a pharmacological target for developing treatments for epilepsy.

AB  - Posturethroplasty sexual dysfunction (SD) is multifactorial and its true incidence is unknown. Even with the current evidence suggesting that it is uncommon, de novo SD causes dissatisfaction even after a successful surgery. Posterior urethroplasty carries the highest chance of SD, mostly attributable to the pelvic fracture itself rather than the urethroplasty. With anterior urethroplasty, transecting bulbar urethroplasty leads to greater SD compared with penile or nontransecting bulbar urethroplasty. Most patients with posturethroplasty SD recover within 6 months after surgery.

AB  - Background & objectives: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The disease is attributed to mutations in CYP21A2 gene encoding 21-hydroxylase enzyme. In view of severe phenotype in salt-losing cases, issues related to genital ambiguity in girls and precocity in boys, most families opt for prenatal testing and termination of affected foetus. CAH can be diagnosed in utero through direct molecular analysis of CYP21A2 gene, using DNA extracted from foetal tissues or cells obtained from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of prenatal diagnosis (PND) using sequencing and multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) methods in families at risk for CAH.
   Methods: Fifteen pregnant women at risk of having an affected offspring with CAH were included in this study. Ten families had previous affected children with salt-wasting/simple virilising form of CAH and five families did not have live children but had a high index of suspicion for CAH in previous children based on history or records. Mutation analysis was carried out by Sanger sequencing and MLPA method.
   Results: Seven different mutations were identified in 15 families. Deletions and I2g mutation were the most common. Of the 15 foetuses analyzed, nine were unaffected while six were affected. Unaffected foetuses were delivered, they were clinically normal and their genotype was found to be concordant to the prenatal report. All except two families reported in the second trimester. None of the couples opted for prenatal treatment.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our preliminary findings show that PND by direct mutation analysis along with MLPA is a feasible strategy that can be offered to families at risk.

AB  - Introduction: Small bowel villous atrophy can represent a diagnostic challenge for gastroenterologists and pathologists. In Western countries small bowel atrophy and mild non-atrophic alterations are frequently caused by celiac disease. However, other pathology can mimic celiac disease microscopically, widening the differential diagnosis. The several novelties on this topic and the introduction of the device-assisted enteroscopy in the diagnostic flowchart make an update of the literature necessary.Areas covered: In this review, a description of the different clinical scenarios when facing with small bowel mucosal damage, particularly small bowel atrophy, is described. The published literature on this subject has been summarized and reviewed.Expert commentary: When an intestinal mucosal alteration is histologically demonstrated, the pathology report forms part of a more complex workup including serological data, clinical presentation and clinical history. A multidisciplinary team, including pathologists and enteroscopy-devoted endoscopists, is frequently required to manage patients with small bowel alterations, especially in cases of severe malabsorption syndrome.

AB  - Background: Obesity among children and adolescents is a growing public health problem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors and metabolic consequences of obesity among schoolchildren from Kashmir, India.
   Methods: The study subjects (n = 2024) included 870 boys and 1154 girls, aged between 6 and 18 years. Data were collected by interviewer-administered questionnaires. Information was obtained about different lifestyles, anthropometric parameters and dietary habits. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI)percentileas per the guidelines of Centers for Disease Control, 2000. For the evaluation of different clinical parameters, blood samples were collected from the subjects in the fasting state at 8 to 9 am after an overnight (10-12 h) fast.
   Results: The highest representation of subjects was from fee-paying private schools. Out of the total subjects, 6.69% were overweight and 4.64% were obese. The hip circumference, abdominal circumference, BMI, blood pressure (BP), use of ready-made foods as well as the clinical parameters like glucose, phosphorous, cholesterol and triglycerides were found significantly higher among girls than boys (p < 0.05). Boys were taller and were physically more active than girls (p < 0.01). Compared to the boys (3.33%), the girls were found to be more obese (5.63%). Rural dwelling subjects (4.22%) exhibited a lower percentage of obesity than urban population (5.00%). The difference in obesity among the different age groups was found statistically significant (p < 0.05). Additionally, children with active lives in the form of vigorous (10.59%) or moderate (10.34%) exercise decreased their chances of gaining weight substantially.
   Conclusions: Results from the present study have shown that prevalence of obesity among children was high in our population.

AB  - Objectives: There is shortage of specialists for the diagnosis of children with epilepsy, especially in resource limited settings. Existing INCLEN (International Clinical Epidemiology Network) instrument was validated for children aged 2-9 years. The current study validated modifications of the same including wider symptomatology and age group.
   Methods: The Modified INCLEN tool was validated by a team of experts by modifying the existing tools (2-9 years) to widen the age range from 1 month to 18 years and include broader symptomatology in a tertiary care teaching hospital of North India between January and June 2015. A qualified medical graduate applied the candidate tool which was followed by gold standard evaluation by a Pediatric Neurologist (both blinded to each other).
   Results: A total of 197 children {128 boys (65%) and 69 girls (35%)}, with a mean age of 72.08 (+/- 50.96) months, completed the study. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio of the modified epilepsy tool were 91.5% (84.5-96.1), 88.6% (80.0-93.5), 89.7% (81.9-95.3), 90.8% (83.7-95.7), 8 (6.6-9.8) and 0.09 (0.07-0.12) respectively.
   Significance: The new modified diagnostic instruments for epilepsy is simple, structured and valid instruments covering 1month to 18 years for use in resource limited settings with acceptable diagnostic accuracy. All seizure semiologies as well as common seizure mimics like breath-holding spells are included in the tool. It also provides for identification of acute symptomatic and febrile seizures.

AB  - Purpose: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of intracranial parts of sixth nerve and seventh nerve and the extraocular muscles (EOMs) in orbit to correlate the clinical characteristics in patients with two special forms of strabismus in congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders which are Duane's retraction syndrome (DRS) and Mobius syndrome.
   Materials and Methods: Morphological analysis by 3T MRI of orbit (using surface coils) and brain (using 32 channel head coil) was performed on 6 patients with clinical DRS (1 bilateral), 2 cases with Mobius syndrome, and 1 case with congenital sixth nerve palsy. These were compared with findings in five controls.
   Results: We observed absence/hypoplasia of sixth nerve in five out of seven eyes with DRS (71.42%), anomalous course in one eye, sixth and seventh nerve absence/hypoplasia in affected eyes with Mobius syndrome and bilateral absence/hypoplasia of the sixth nerve in congenital sixth nerve palsy. For EOMs we calculated maximum diameter, area, and circumference of muscles using Osirix software, and noticed significant hypoplasia of lateral rectus in comparison to controls (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: MRI gives useful information regarding confirmation of clinical diagnosis and its neurological anomalies in complex cases and helps to plan tailor made surgical management.

AB  - Oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic neuronal cell death are cardinal mechanisms involved in the cascade of acute ischemic stroke. Lercanidipine apart from calcium channel blocking activity possesses anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. In the present study, we investigated neuroprotective efficacy and therapeutic time window of lercanidipine in a 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in male Wistar rats. The study design included: acute (pre-treatment and post-treatment) and sub-acute studies. In acute studies (pre-treatment) lercanidipine (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 60 min prior MCAo. The rats were assessed 24 h post-MCAo for neurological deficit score (NDS), motor deficit paradigms (grip test and rota rod) and cerebral infarction via 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TM) staining. The most effective dose was found to be at 0.5 mg/kg, i.p., which was considered for further studies. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored till 120 min post-reperfusion to assess vasodilatory property of lercanidipine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) administered at two different time points: 60 min post-MCAo and 15 min post-reperfusion. In acute studies (post-treatment) lercanidipine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 15 min, 120 min and 240 min post-reperfusion. Based on NDS and cerebral infarction via TTC staining assessed 24 h post-MCAo, effectiveness was evident upto 120 min. For sub-acute studies same dose/vehicle was repeated for next 3 days and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 96 h after the last dose. Biochemical markers estimated in rat brain cortex 24 h post-MCAo were oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, nitric oxide, superoxide dismutase), blood brain barrier damage (matrix metalloproteinases-2 and-9) and apoptotic (caspase-3 and -9). Lercanidipine significantly reduced NDS, motor deficits and cerebral infarction volume as compared to the control group. Lercanidipine (60 min post-MCAo) significantly increased rCBF (86%) as compared to vehicle treated MCAo group (64%) 120 min post-reperfusion, but failed to show vasodilatation with 15 min post-reperfusion group. Lercanidipine (13.78 +/- 2.78%) significantly attenuated percentage infarct volume as evident from diffusion -weighted (DWI) and T2-weighted images as compared to vehicle treated MCAo group (25.90 +/- 2.44%) investigated 96 h post-MCAo. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was also significantly improved in lercanidipine group as compared to control group. Biochemical alterations were significantly ameliorated by lercanidipine till 120 min post-reperfusion group and MMP-9 inhibition observed even with 240 min group. Thus, lercanidipine revealed significant neuroprotective effect mediated through attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The genes related to B-cell development are frequently altered in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). One hundred sixty-two newly diagnosed B-ALL cases, median age 8.5 years (2 months-67 years), were prospectively analyzed for copy number alterations (CNAs) in CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, RB1, ETV6, BTG1, EBF1, and pseudoautosomal region genes (CRLF2, CSF2RA, IL3RA) using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The CNAs were detected in 114 (70.4%) cases; most commonly affected genes being CDKN2A/B-55 (34%), PAX5-51 (31.5%), and IKZF1-43 (26.5%). IKZF1 and RB1 deletions correlated with higher induction failure. Patients classified as good-risk, according to the integrated CNA profile and cytogenetic criteria, had lower induction failure [5 (8.6%) vs. 20 (25.3%); p=0.012]. Those classified as good-risk, based on CNA profile irrespective of cytogenetics, also showed lower induction failure [6 (9.4%) vs. 19 (26%); p=0.012]. The CNA profile identified patients with better induction outcome and has a potential role in better risk stratification of B-ALL.

AB  - BackgroundEthnic diversity between different populations may affect treatment safety and efficacy.
   Aims and methodsA subanalysis to a global trial (study 326) was carried out to ascertain the safety and efficacy of donepezil 23 mg/day compared with donepezil 10 mg/day in Asian patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. Changes in cognition and global functioning were measured by the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) and Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus), respectively, at week 24.
   ResultsCognitive improvement measured by SIB score was greater with donepezil 23 mg than with donepezil 10 mg (+1.36 vs -1.56]; difference, 2.92). There was no difference between the groups in global function measured by the CIBIC-Plus (3.94 and 3.95, respectively). Overall, 119 patients (82.1%) receiving donepezil 23 mg and 56 (71.8%) receiving donepezil 10 mg experienced 1 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). In the donepezil 23 mg group, the incidence of TEAEs was higher among patients of lower weight (<55 kg) at baseline than in those of higher weight (64 of 75 patients [85.3%] vs 55 of 70 patients [78.5%]).
   ConclusionsThe benefits and risks associated with donepezil 23 mg in Asian patients are comparable to those of the global study population.

AB  - Theranostics has received considerable attention since both therapy and imaging modalities can be integrated into a single nanocarrier. In this study, fluorescent iron oxide (FLO) nanoparticles and gemcitabine (G) encapsulated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanospheres (PGFIO) conjugated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, (HER-2) antibody (HER-PGFIO) were prepared and characterized. HER-PGFIO showed the magnetic moment of 10 emu/g, relaxivity (r(2)) of 773 mM(-1) s(-1) and specific absorption rate (SAR) of 183 Wig. HER-PGFIO showed a sustained release of gemcitabine for 11 days in PBS (pH 7.4). In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of HER-PGFIO in 3D MIAPaCa-2 cultures showed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.11 mg/mL. Subcutaneous tumor xenografts of MIAPaCa-2 in SCID mice were developed and the tumor regression study at the end of 30 days showed significant tumor regression (86 +/- 3%) in the HER-PGFIO with magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) treatment group compared to control group. In vivo MRI imaging showed the enhanced contrast in HER-PGFIO + MHT treated group compared to control. HER-PGFIO showed significant tumor regression and enhanced MRI in treatment groups, which could be an effective nanocarrier system for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
   Statement of Significance
   Combination therapies are best suitable to treat pancreatic cancer. Theranostics are the next generation therapeutics with both imaging and treatment agents encapsulated in a single nanocarrier. The novelty of the present work is the development of targeted nanocarrier that provides chemotherapy, thermotherapy and MRI imaging properties.
   The present work is the next step in developing the nanocarriers for pancreatic cancer treatment. Different treatment modalities embedding into a single nanocarrier is the biggest challenge that was achieved without compromising the functionality of each other. The surface modification of polymeric nanocarriers for antibody binding and their multifunctional abilities will appeal to wider audience. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: The postoperative course following on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is often unpredictable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify predictors of poor postoperative outcome in this subset of patients. Design: Prospective observational study
   Setting: Single university hospital
   Participants: Forty patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction undergoing isolated on-pump CABG
   Interventions: None
   Measurements and Main Results: Comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination was performed to obtain the indices of systolic and diastolic LV function after induction of anesthesia. A poor postoperative outcome was defined as patient death or vasoactive inotropic score > 20 for at least 6 hours and/or requiring intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and/or mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours. Poor postoperative outcome was observed in 40% (16/40) of patients. Patients with poor postoperative outcomes had a significantly higher systolic dyssynchrony index, septal-lateral delay with a significantly lower global longitudinal strain and isovolumic acceleration, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and lateral and medial mitral annulus systolic velocity. In a binary logistic regression model, global longitudinal strain (odds ratio, 1.5, confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.19-1.88, p = 0.001), septal-lateral delay (odds ratio, 1.02, 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; p = 0.001) and systolic dyssychrony index (odds ratio, 1.3, 95% CI, 1.13-1.48; p = 0.000) were found to be predictors of poor postoperative outcome.
   Conclusion: Global longitudinal strain, systolic dyssynchrony index, and septal-lateral delay were reliable and accurate predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction undergoing on-pump CABG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Consumer knowledge is understood to play a role in managing risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and may be influenced by level of education. The association between population knowledge, behaviours and actual salt consumption was explored overall, and for more-educated compared to less-educated individuals. A cross-sectional survey was done in an age-and sex-stratified random sample of 1395 participants from urban and rural areas of North and South India. A single 24-h urine sample, participants' physical measurements and questionnaire data were collected. The mean age of participants was 40 years, 47% were women and mean 24-h urinary salt excretion was 9.27 (8.87-9.69) g/day. Many participants reported favourable knowledge and behaviours to minimise risks related to salt. Several of these behaviours were associated with reduced salt intake-less use of salt while cooking, avoidance of snacks, namkeens, and avoidance of pickles (all p < 0.003). Mean salt intake was comparable in more-educated (9.21, 8.55-9.87 g/day) versus less-educated (9.34, 8.57-10.12 g/day) individuals (p = 0.82). There was no substantively different pattern of knowledge and behaviours between more-versus less-educated groups and no clear evidence that level of education influenced salt intake. Several consumer behaviours related to use of salt during food preparation and consumption of salty products were related to actual salt consumption and therefore appear to offer an opportunity for intervention. These would be a reasonable focus for a government-led education campaign targeting salt.

AB  - The incidence of myopia is constantly on the rise. Patients of high myopia and pathological myopia are young and can lose vision due to a number of degenerative changes occurring at the macula. With the emergence of new technologies such as swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography, our understanding of macular pathology in myopia has improved significantly. New conditions such as myopic traction maculopathy have been defined. Early, noninvasive detection of myopic choroidal neovascularization and its differentiation from lacquer cracks is possible with a greater degree of certainty. We discuss the impact of these new exciting and promising technologies and management of macular pathology in myopia. Incorporation of OCT in the microscope has also improved macular surgery. New concepts such as fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane peeling have emerged. A review of literature and our experience in managing all these conditions are discussed.

AB  - The microenvironment of a tumor changes chemically and morphologically during cancer progression. Cancer-stimulated fibroblasts promote tumor growth, however, the mechanism of the transition to a cancer-stimulated fibroblast remains elusive. Here, the multi-modal spectroscopic methods Fourier transform infrared imaging (FTIRI), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray fluorescence imaging (XFI) are used to characterize molecular and atomic alterations that occur in cancerstimulated fibroblasts. In addition to chemical changes in lipids (olefinic and acyl chain) and protein aggregation observed with FTIRI, a new infrared biomarker for oxidative stress in stimulated fibroblasts is reported. Oxidative stress is observed to cause lipid peroxidation, which leads to the appearance of a new band at 1721 cm(-1), assigned to 4-hydroxynonenal. Complementary to FTIRI, XFI is well suited to determining atom concentrations and XAS can reveal the speciation of individual elements. XFI reveals increased concentrations of P, S, K, Ca within stimulated fibroblasts. Furthermore, XAS studies reveal alterations in the speciation of S and Ca in stimulated fibroblasts, which might provide insight into the mechanisms of cancer progression. Using XFI, not only is the concentration change of individual elements observed, but also the subcellular localization. This study demonstrates the wealth of biochemical information provided by a multi-modal imaging approach and highlights new avenues for future research into the microenvironment of breast tumors.

KW  - EPIRETINAL MEMBRANES
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To report a distinct optical coherence tomography (OCT) appearance of macular combined hamartoma of retina and retinal pigment epithelium (CHRRPE).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of four eyes of four patients with macular CHRRPE who were assessed with the help of color fundus photographs, swept-source OCT (SSOCT), and fundus fluorescein angiography wherever required.
   RESULTS: All four patients presented with decreased visual acuity. SS-OCT in all patients showed adherent epiretinal membrane (ERM) and localized thickening of underlying retina. An omega-shaped disorganization of inner retinal layers was seen bounded posteriorly by the outer plexiform layer. This was termed, "Omega sign."
   CONCLUSION: Omega sign is a characteristic feature of macular CHRRPE and may help to distinguish macular CHRRPEs from ERMs.

AB  - Purpose of the Review Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is an established form of therapy for femoropopliteal artery disease. Currently, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is carried out using standard balloon with or without deployment of a stent but is associated with a high rate of restenosis and stent-related complications. Treatment options for restenosis, especially in-stent restenosis, are limited. Drug-coated balloons promise to reduce the rates of restenosis by effective delivery of antiproliferative agent (paclitaxel) directly to vessel wall without the need for a permanent implant. In this review, we look at the technology and rationale behind drug-coated balloons and examine the evidence available so far.
   Recent Findings Recently, several studies tested the effectiveness of paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty compared to that of standard PTA in both de novo lesions and in-stent restenosis of femoropopliteal artery. Paclitaxel-coated balloon use resulted in reduced rates of restenosis and favourable clinical outcomes in both these lesion groups. However, in complex lesions, there is still lack of data to support the use of these balloons.
   Summary Paclitaxel-coated balloon is a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients with both de novo lesions and in-stent restenosis involving femoropopliteal artery. In light of the new evidence, it is time to consider incorporation of this effective therapeutic option into clinical practice. However, further research is needed for the use of paclitaxel-coated balloons in complex femoropopliteal lesions like calcified lesions especially as adjuncts to cutting balloons and debulking strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the agreement between transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measured from shielded skin and serum total bilirubin (STB) in infants (34 to 41 weeks of gestation) with hyperbilirubinemia receiving phototherapy (PT).
   STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective cohort study, we shielded a small area of skin on sternum using a commercial photo-opaque patch (BilEclipseTM, Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA). The TcB from the shielded skin (TcBs) and STB were measured at four time points-before initiation, 12 and 24 h during and once after (12 h) cessation of PT. TcB was measured using multiwavelength transcutaneous bilirubinometer (BiliChek, Philips Children's Medical Ventures, Monroeville, PA, USA). The STB was measured in triplicate by spectrophotometry (Apel BR 5100, APEL, Japan). Bland and Altman plots were drawn to determine agreement between the TcBs and STB.
   RESULTS: The gestation and birth weight of enrolled neonates were 37.0 (1.0) weeks and 2750 (458) g, respectively. The age at initiation and duration of PT were 75 (27 to 312) and 25.3 (4.4) h, respectively. Bland and Altman plot showed poor agreement between TcBs and STB at all time points. The gradient (median, range) between TcBs and STB at 0, 12, 24 h and 12 h after cessation of PT were -0.2 (-4.9 to 3.5), 1.4 (-4.7 to 4.0), 1.5 (-3.8 to 9.4) and 2 (-2.9 to 5.8) mg dl(-1). The proportions of TcBs values outside +/- 1.5 mg dl(-1) of STB ranged from 47 to 64% at four time points.
   CONCLUSION: TcBs does not appear to be reliable for estimating serum bilirubin in late preterm and term neonates receiving PT.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of autologous blood harvest (ABH)-induced volume shifts using electrical cardiometry (EC) in patients with pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to left heart disease.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
   Setting: A tertiary care hospital.
   Participants: The study comprised 50 patients scheduled to undergo heart valve replacement.
   Interventions: Patients were divided randomly into 2 experimental groups that were distinguished by whether ABH was performed. Blood volume extracted in the test group was replaced simultaneously with 1:1 colloid (Tetraspan; B Braun Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany). Hemodynamic, respiratory, and EC-derived parameters were recorded at predefined set points (TI [post-induction/pre-ABH] and T2 [20 minutes post-ABH]).
   Measurements and Main Results: Withdrawal of 15% of blood volume in the ABH group caused significant reductions in thoracic fluid content (TFC) (-10.1% [-15.0% to 6.1%]); right atrial pressure (-23% [-26.6% to 17.6%]); mean arterial pressure (-12.6% [-22.2% to 3.8%]); airway pressures: (peak 6.2% [-11.7% to 2.8%] and mean 15.4% [-25.0% to 8.3%]); and oxygenation index (-10.34% [-16.4% to 4.8%]). Linear regression analysis showed good correlation between the percentage change in TFC after ABH and the percentage of change in right atrial pressure, stroke volume variation, autologous blood extracted, peak and mean airway pressures, and oxygen index.
   Conclusions: In addition to its proven role in blood conservation, therapeutic benefits derived from ABH include decongestion of volume-loaded patients, decrease in TFC, and improved gas exchange. EC tracks beat-to-beat fluid and hemodynamic fluctuations during ABH and helps in the execution of an early patient-specific, goal-directed therapy, allowing for its safe implementation in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to left heart disease.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the common sleep breathing disorders in adults, characterised by frequent episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep. Craniofacial disharmony is an important risk factor for OSA. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) study is considered to be the most reliable confirmatory investigation for OSA diagnosis, whereas the precise localization of site of obstruction to the airflow cannot be detected. Identifying the cause of OSA in a particular ethnic population/individual subject helps to understand the etiological factors and effective management of OSA. The objective of the meta-analysis is to elucidate altered craniofacial anatomy on lateral cephalograms in adult subjects with established OSA. Significant weighted mean difference with insignificant heterogeneity was found for the following parameters: anterior lower facial height (ALFH: 2.48 mm), position of hyoid bone (Go-H: 5.45 mm, S-H: 6.89 mm, GoGn-H: 11.84 degrees, GoGn-H: 7.22 mm, N-S-H: 2.14 degrees), and pharyngeal airway space (PNS-Phw: -1.55 mm, pharyngeal space: -495.74 mm(2) and oro-pharyngeal area: -151.15 mm(2)). Significant weighted mean difference with significant heterogeneity was found for the following parameters: cranial base (SN: -2.25 mm, S-N-Ba: -1.45 degrees), position and length of mandible (SNB: -1.49 degrees and Go-Me: -5.66 mm) respectively, maxillary length (ANS-PNS: -1.76 mm), tongue area (T: 366.51 mm(2)), soft palate area (UV: 125.02 mm(2)), and upper airway length (UAL: 5.39 mm). This meta analysis supports the relationship between craniofacial disharmony and obstructive sleep apnea. There is a strong evidence for reduced pharyngeal airway space, inferiorly placed hyoid bone and increased anterior facial heights in adult OSA patients compared to control subjects. The cephalometric analysis provides insight into anatomical basis of the etiology of OSA that can influence making a choice of appropriate therapy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Age-related changes in peripheral anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations and transcriptional abundance of AMH gene in testicular tissue were studied in crossbred (Holstein Friesian x Tharparkar) and Zebu (Tharparkar) males. In both the breeds, basal AMH concentrations were estimated using ELISA method in blood plasma obtained from six males each at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months age. After blood collection at respective ages, all the males were castrated and expression and immunolocalization of AMH was performed in the testicular tissue. The concentration of AMH in blood plasma was found to be highest at 1 month of age in both crossbred and Zebu males, which subsequently decreased with advancing age. Significantly (P < 0.05) lower concentration of AMH was observed in crossbred as compared with Zebu males at 24 months of age. In line with peripheral AMH concentrations, the expression of AMH gene was also higher (P < 0.05) at 1 month of age, which thereafter declined significantly with advancement of age in crossbred males. Furthermore, the expression of AMH gene differed significantly between Zebu and crossbred males at all the age groups studied. Immunolocalization of AMH in testicular tissue also revealed a stronger expression at 1 month age, which gradually decreased till 24 months of age. The true Sertoli cell count was significantly higher in Zebu compared with crossbred males at all age groups studied except at 6 months age. The relationship between Sertoli cell count and circulating AMH concentrations was negative and significant (r = -0.81; P = 0.004). In conclusion, expression of AMH gene in testicular tissue and peripheral blood concentrations of AMH were higher in young compared with adults in both crossbred and Zebu males; however, the transcriptional abundance and circulating levels of AMH were higher in Zebu compared with crossbred males.

AB  - Purpose: To determine if ictal-magnetoencephalography (ictal-MEG) source localization (SL) added information towards delineating the ictal-onset zone (IOZ), whether and how it helped final decision making in epilepsy-surgery.
   Methods: Definite focal clusters on ictal-MEG were available for 32 DRE-patients, data was analyzed (single equivalent current dipole (ECD) model), SL done. Clinical history, long-term video-EEG (VEEG) monitoring, epilepsy-protocol MRI, FDG-PET, ictal-SPECT and interictal-MEG were discussed at the multispeciality Epilepsy Surgery Case-conference (ESC). Cases were reviewed with ictal-MEG SL presented only at the last ESC (after decision using other available modalities). Patients were grouped as VEEG localization and MRI-lesion concordant (Group-A), discordant (Group-B), and no MRI-lesion (Group-C). Final hypothesis or decision, surgical outcome in those operated, and how ictal-MEG data influenced them were recorded.
   Results: Five lesion-negative patients had identification of lesions after review of MRI with ictal-MEG SL. The difference between numbers of patients cleared for surgery without and with ictal MEG data was statistically significant (p = 0.0044); but the difference in those cleared for phase II monitoring was not (p = 1.00). Ictal MEG influenced decisions on possibility of surgery in 9 and converted decisions of phase II monitoring in 11 patients to electrocorticography-guided lesionectomy (20 in all; Group A-11, Group B-4, Group C-5); five were operated, with good seizure-control on follow-up.
   Conclusions: Delineation of IOZ by ictal-MEG helped convert DRE patients unsuitable for surgery or planned for phase II monitoring into candidates suitable for surgery, even ECoG-guided resections, and resulted in favorable outcomes in those who were operated.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome and treatment-related morbidity in pediatric patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with chemoradiotherapy.
   Methods: We did a retrospective review of 41 pediatric patients diagnosed with NPC between 2000 and 2013. The majority of the patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation with the dose of 70 Gy in 35 fractions. Eight patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy, while the remaining with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or two-dimensional simulation technique.
   Results: The median age of the patients was 14 years (range 6-20 years). Most of the patients had locoregionally advanced disease (stage III/IVA/IVB). The histology of all the cases was undifferentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry for the Epstein-Barr virus-Latent membrane protein 1 was positive in nine of the 13 tested cases. The median follow-up for all and the surviving patients was 26.6 months (range 2-140.8) and 51.2 months, respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were estimated at 83.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.893%) and 55.8% (95% CI: 38.7-69.8%), respectively. Distant metastases were the predominant pattern of failure. Treatment response showed an independent association with OS. T classification (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4) was significantly associated with EFS. Xerostomia, hypothyroidism, dental caries, neck fibrosis, trismus, and dysphagia were the common late effects in survivors. Radiation myelitis was observed in one patient.
   Conclusions: Treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation provides good survival outcomes in pediatric NPC. The quality of life of the survivors is a pertinent area that necessitates consideration.

AB  - Absence of visible physical symptoms and limited capacity to express trauma directly, pose significant challenges in assessment of its exact nature of trauma and its correlates in child sexual abuse. There are numerous assessment tools however, deciding upon the appropriateness is often challenging in Asian socio-cultural and health care set up. A review would provide a ready reference to the practioner regarding the exact clinically utility of the tools and also would guide them in the direction of culture specific modifications. Computerized databases namely Medline, PsycINFO, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, and Social Sciences Citation Index were used. 52 scales were obtained and analysed in terms of scale characteristics, reference to theory and DSM, and cultural competency. Despite of a wide variety of methods, and newer instruments, many of the traditionally used techniques of child's internal thinking and emotional assessment appear outdated while reviewing the recent theories of CSA related psychological trauma. An integrated format, incroporating child-parent-clinicain rating, with multiple domain speciafic items and verbal and non-verbal tasks, is the current need in the Asian region.

AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intraocular bacteria causing trachoma, adult and neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis, was the leading cause of blindness in the last century worldwide. Improvement in socioeconomic and living conditions, availability of antibiotics, and introduction of National Trachoma Control Programmes reduced the prevalence in developed countries, but it persisted in resource-poor settings of Africa and Asia, including India. In 2016, as per the WHO report, trachoma is restricted to 42 countries, causing blindness/visual impairment in similar to 1.9 million people. India is one of the five countries with nearly half of total active trachoma patients. Introduction of Global Elimination of Trachoma 2020 program by the WHO, using SAFE strategy (surgery for trachomatous trichiasis; Antibiotics for C. trachomatis; Facial cleanliness; and environmental improvement) greatly reduced the prevalence, but trachoma still persists in India. Global increase in the reproductive tract infection by C. trachomatis urogenital serotypes (D-K) has led to concurrent increase in C. trachomatis eye infections. Therefore, kerato eye infections due to chlamydial infections continue to be seen in hospitals. Over the years, there have been advances in laboratory diagnostics, in understanding the pathogenesis, tissue tropism, C. trachomatis genomics, and treatment modalities. Due attention and research is still needed for the study of C. trachomatis eye infections.

AB  - Resistance to APC (APCR) is a very important cause of thrombophilia and most frequently caused by the Leiden mutation. APCR is also seen in the absence of FV Leiden and associated with elevated levels of factor V (FV), factor VIII (FVIII) and antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs). The aim of this prospective case control study was to find out the frequency and role of FV, FVIII and APLAs in the pathogenesis of APCR in FV Leiden negative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) patients in India. A total 30 APCR positive and FV Leiden negative patients with DVT and similar number of age and sex matched healthy controls were recruited. Significantly higher mean FVIII levels were observed in patients as compared to controls [patients: 132.3 +/- 30.7 IU/ml, controls: 117.5 +/- 17.7 IU/ml, p = 0.025]. A significant negative correlation was also observed between FVIII and APC ratio (Pearson correlation = 0.368, p = < 0.001). Mean FV levels in patients [107.1 +/- 13.1 IU/ml] and controls [102 +/- 11.9 IU/ml] were not statistically significant (p = 0.119). Anti beta 2 glycoprotein I (Anti-beta 2-GPI, IgG) showed significant association with APCR phenotype (p = 0.050), unlike other factors such as protein C, protein S, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. The strong association of FVIII and anti-beta 2 GPI (IgG) antibodies with APCR phenotype is suggestive of incorporation of these factors in APCR positive DVT patients in the absence of FV Leiden mutation in India. However more studies in large sample size are required for setting up the proper investigation protocol in these patients.

AB  - Background: In this study we describe the morphology of the posteromedial fragment in pertrochanteric fractures using 3D CT scans and answer two questions 1) Do differences exist between the 3D CT appearances of posteromedial fragments and the depictions made in the AO classification 2) Does the posteromedial fragment affect stability in pertrochanteric fractures, in terms of fracture collapse?
   Methods: Preoperative CT scans of eight 31-A1 and fifty 31-A2 fractures were analysed. The presence of PM fragment, its fragmentation, greater trochanter (GT) involvement, lesser trochanter (LT) fragment size (in terms of its posterior and medial extent as well as LT length), LT fragment displacement (in terms of medial displacement and rotation) were determined. All fractures were treated with a DHS. Fracture collapse was determined on postoperative radiographs. The relationship between fracture collapse and patient factors including age, gender, fracture type (A1 versus A2), characteristics of the posteromedial fragment, and the presence of a lateral wall fracture were determined.
   Results: Three out of eight 31-A1 fractures demonstrated a separate GT fragment (three part fracture). Out of the 50 31-A2 fractures, 12 had a single PM fragment, which included the LT and GT in continuity. The more common four part fractures seem to form by further fragmentation of this basic form. In A2 fractures, the GT was almost always broken and the broken fragment comprised a mean 56% of normal GT. The LT fragment involved an average of 74% of the posterior wall, and an average of 36% of the medial wall of the proximal femur. Larger LT fragments were less displaced as compared to smaller fragments. Univariate regression analyses revealed that fracture collapse was significantly correlated with fracture type (A1 versus A2, p 0.036), GT size (p 0.002) and the presence of a lateral wall fracture (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study revealed some important differences between the 3D CT appearances and AO classification of pertrochanteric fractures. Further, neither fragmentation of the posteromedial fragment, nor the size of the lesser trochanter fragment was found to predict stability in pertrochanteric fractures. A perioperative lateral wall fracture is the main determinant of stability in these fractures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Meningocele is defined as a protrusion of the meninges through an opening in the skull or spinal column, forming a bulge or sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid. A pseudomeningocele is defined as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection formed due to escape of CSF through a dural defect with trapping of CSF into the surrounding soft tissues. We herby report rare occurrence of a large (pseudo) meningocele in a young patient with congenital skull base defect presenting as upper lateral neck swelling.
   Case presentation We present the case of a 17-year-old boy who had painless progressive swelling right side of the upper neck without any history of meningitis or CSF leak. He had a history of undergoing cranioplasty using steel plates for nontraumatic boggy swelling right parieto-occipital region at the age of 5 years at another hospital. Clinical examination showed painless swelling right side of the upper neck, with positive cough impulse and transillumination. CT head with cisternography showed a large right skull base defect through which a large pseudomeningocele was herniating, thus producing upper neck swelling and compressing oral cavity. The neck swelling and intraoral bulge reduced in size after the coperitoneal shunt.
   Conclusion Differential diagnosis of (pseudo) meningocele should be considered while evaluating a painless progressive upper neck swelling having cough impulse and transillumination in a young patient.

AB  - To analyze the impact of counseling on antenatal congenital surgical anomalies (ACSA).
   Cases presenting with ACSA for fetal counseling and those presenting in post-natal period following diagnosis of ACSA (PACSA) for surgical opinion were analyzed for spectrum, presentation and outcome.
   117 cases including ACSA(68);PACSA(49) were analyzed. Gestational age at diagnosis of ACSA;PACSA was 17-37;17-39 weeks (median 24;32 weeks). Diagnoses in ACSA;PACSA included urological (26;31), neurological (10;5), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)(5;1), gastrointestinal (5;5), lung and chest anomalies (5;1), intraabdominal cysts (4;1), abdominal wall defects (4;0), tumors (3;3), limb anomaly (1;1), esophageal atresia (1;1), conjoint twins (1;0), hepatomegaly (1;0), and major cardiac anomalies (2;0). Two antenatal interventions were done for ACSA; vesicoamniotic shunt and amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios. 17;24 ACSA;PACSA required early surgical intervention in post-natal period. Nine ACSA underwent medical termination of pregnancy and 4 had intrauterine demise. Nine ACSA babies died including two CDH, one gastroschisis, one duodenal atresia, one conjoint twins, one megacystitis with motility disorder and three posterior urethral valves. All PACSA babies survived.
   Fetal counseling for CSA portrays true outcome of ACSA with 32.3% (22/68) mortality versus 0% for PACSA due to selection bias. However, fetal counseling ensures optimal perinatal care.

AB  - Enhancer of zeste homolog-2(EZH2) is a key epigenetic regulator that functions as oncogene and also known for inducing altered trimethylation of histone at lysine-27 (H3K27me3) mark in various tumors. However, H3K27me3 targets and their precise relationship with gene expression are largely unknown in astrocytic tumors. In this study, we checked EZH2 messenger RNA and protein expression in 90 astrocytic tumors of different grades using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Further, genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis for H3K27me3 modification was also performed on 11 glioblastomas (GBMs) and 2 diffuse astrocytoma (DA) samples. Our results showed EZH2 to be highly overexpressed in astrocytic tumors with a significant positive correlation with grade. Interestingly, ChIP-seq mapping revealed distinct differences in genes and pathways targeted by these H3K27me3 modifications between GBM versus DA. Neuroactive ligand receptor pathway was found most enriched in GBM (P = 9.4 x 10(-25)), whereas DA were found to be enriched in metabolic pathways. Also, GBM showed a higher enrichment of H3K27me3 targets reported in embryonic stem cells and glioma stem cells as compared with DAs. Our results show majority of these H3K27me3 target genes were downregulated, not only due to H3K27me3 modification but also due to concomitant DNA methylation. Further, H3K27me3 modification-associated gene silencing was not restricted to promoter but also present in gene body and transcription start site regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high-resolution genome-wide mapping of H3K27me3 modification in adult astrocytic primary tissue samples of human, highlighting the differences between grades. Interestingly, we identified SLC25A23 as important target of H3K27me3 modification, which was downregulated in GBM and its low expression was associated with poor prognosis in GBMs.

AB  - Calcified chronic subdural hematomas are an occurrence rarely seen in neurosurgical clinical practice. And when they occur bilaterally, the radiologic image they present is fascinating, as is the clinical presentation, but their management may be challenging. They have been reported to present with a multitude of neurologic deficits but never with diabetes insipidus, which is described here. Due to the rarity of this pathology, the management protocol is not well defined, though there have been quite a few papers on this condition. This review article gathers information published over the years on this rare entity to suggest a treatment protocol.

AB  - Aim: This study aims to determine treatment patterns, long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) and perimetric control in different glaucomas seen at a tertiary eye center.
   Settings and Design: Hospital-based, cross-sectional chart review of patients routinely following up at an outpatient glaucoma service.
   Methods: Patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years were evaluated. Their mean IOP, visual field (VF) status, and medications/surgery required at final assessment were noted.
   Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and range) were used for all parameters.
   Results: A total of 230 patients met our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 79 having ocular hypertension with open angles or primary angle closure (PAC), 35 primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), 50 PAC glaucoma (PACG), 20 primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), 46 secondary glaucoma patients. Ocular hypertensives with open angles showed progression to POAG in 3.7%, those with PAC in 5.2%, at a mean IOP of 17.3 +/- 3.37 mmHg and 17.13 +/- 4.41 mmHg, respectively. A progression on Humphrey Field Analyzer was seen in 11% of POAG and PACG eyes at a mean IOP of 13.50 +/- 5.07 and 13.09 +/- 3.95 mmHg, respectively. Fifteen percent of primary congenital glaucomas (PCGs) showed a glaucomatous VF defect after 10 years. In secondary glaucoma eyes, the mean IOP at last follow-up visit was 12.38 +/- 3.74 mmHg, with progression noted in 7.69% of eyes.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that routine delivery of care can provide well controlled IOP in glaucomas, both primary and secondary, and the VF stabilized in about 90% of patients over a period of 10 years, with the currently available glaucoma medications and trabeculectomy.

AB  - Optimal T cell activation is vital for the successful resolution of microbial infections. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a key immune check-point receptor expressed by activated T cells. Aberrant/excessive inhibition mediated by PD-1 may impair host immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, leading to disseminated disease such as miliary tuberculosis (MTB). PD-1 mediated inhibition of T cells in pulmonary tuberculosis and TB pleurisy is reported. However, their role in MTB, particularly at the pathological site, remains to be addressed. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of PD-1-PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in T cell responses at the pathological site from patients of TB pleurisy and MTB as clinical models of contained and disseminated forms of tuberculosis, respectively. We examined the expression and function of PD-1 and its ligands (PD-L1-PD-L2) on host immune cells among tuberculosis patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage-derived CD3 T cells in MTB expressed PD-1 (54.2 +/- 27.4%, P >= 0.0009) with significantly higher PD-1 ligand-positive T cells (PD-L1: 19.8 +/- 11.8%; P >= 0.019, PD-L2: 12.6 +/- 6.2%; P >= 0.023), CD19(+) B cells (PD-L1: 14.4 +/- 10.4%; P >= 0.042, PD-L2: 2.6 +/- 1.43%; not significant) and CD14(+) monocytes (PD-L1: 40.2 +/- 20.1%; P >= 0.047, PD-L2: 22.4 +/- 15.6%; P >= 0.032) compared with peripheral blood (PB) of MTB and healthy controls. The expression of PD-1 was associated with a diminished number of cells producing effector cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL) 22 and elevated apoptosis. Locally accumulated T cells were predominantly PD-1(+)-PD-L1(+), and blocking this pathway restores the protective T cell response. We conclude that M. tuberculosis exploits the PD-1 pathway to evade the host immune response by altering the T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 balance at the pathological site of MTB, thereby favouring disease dissemination.

AB  - Background: Over last 2 years, many trials have evaluated newly approved liposomal bupivacaine for periarticular infiltration in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with mixed results. Our meta-analysis attempts to consolidate the results and make evidence-based conclusions.
   Methods: Trails comparing periarticular infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine to conventional analgesic regimens for total knee arthroplasty published till June 2016 were searched in medical database. Comparisons were made for length of stay (LOS), postoperative pain scores, range of motion, and opioid consumption. Meta-regression was performed for LOS to evaluate various analgesic control subgroups.
   Results: Sixteen trials were included in the final analysis. Liposomal bupivacaine group showed a shorter LOS (reported in 13 subgroups) than control group by 0.17 +/- 0.04 days (random effects, P < .001, I-2 = 84.66%). Meta-regression for various types of control showed a predictability (R-2) of 73%, t(2) = 0.013 (random effects, P < .001, I-2 = 45.16). Only femoral block subgroup attained statistically significant shorter LOS on splitting the control group. Numeric pain scores were lower for pooled control group and local anesthetic infiltration subgroup in immediate postoperative phase. Second postoperative day analgesia was statistically superior to overall clubbed controls and femoral block subgroup. Superiority and/or inferiority of liposomal bupivacaine could not be proven for opioid consumption and range of motion because of a small pooled sample size. Publication bias is likely for LOS (Egger test, X intercept = 2.42, P < .001).
   Conclusion: Liposomal bupivacaine infiltration has questionable clinical advantage, as it marginally shortens patient's hospital stay especially in comparison with patients receiving analgesic femoral nerve block. Compared with conventional regimens, it can provide slightly superior yet sustained (till second postoperative day) perioperative analgesia. High heterogeneity suggests need for standardization of infiltration techniques for better predictability of results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Application of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) to the bariatric surgical procedures is at its early stages with little consolidated evidence. This meta-analysis evaluates present literature and indicates pathways for development of evidence-based standardized ERAS protocols for bariatric surgery. Comparative trials between ERAS and conventional bariatric surgery published till June 2016 were searched in the medical database. Comparisons were made for length of stay (LOS), readmission, complications (major/minor), and reoperation rates. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the strength of meta-analysis was performed for the primary outcome LOS. Five subgroups with a total of 394 and 471 patients in ERAS and conventional group respectively were included. LOS was shorter in ERAS group by 1.56 +/- 0.18 days (random-effects, p < 0.001, I (2) = 93.07 %). The sample size in ERAS was well past the "information size" variable which was calculated to be 189 as per the TSA for power 85%. MH odds ratio [1.41 (95% CI 1.13 to1.76)] was higher for minor complications in the ERAS group (fixed effects, I (2) = 0, p < 0.001). Superiority/inferiority of ERAS could not be established for major or overall complications, readmission, and anastomotic leak rates. No publication bias was found in the included trials (Egger's test, X-intercept = 6.14, p = 0.66). Evaluation based on Cochrane collaboration recommendations suggested that all the five included trials had a high risk of methodological bias. ERAS protocols for bariatric procedures allow faster return to home for patients. The present bariatric ERAS protocols have high heterogeneity and would benefit from standardization. Minor complication rates increase with implementation of ERAS, however without any significant effect on overall patient morbidity. Further randomized trials comparing ERAS with conventional care are required to consolidate these findings.

AB  - Monocytes and macrophage combat infections and maintain homeostatic balance by engulfing microbes and apoptotic cells, and releasing inflammatory cytokines. Studies have described that these cells develop antiinflammatory properties upon recycling the free-hemoglobin (Hb) in hemolytic conditions. While investigating the phenotype of monocytes in two hemolytic disorders-paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and sickle cell disease (SCD), we observed a high number of pro-inflammatory (CD14(+) CD16(hi)) monocytes in these patients. We further investigated in vitro the phenotype of these monocytes and found an estimated 55% of CD14(+) cells were transformed into the CD14(+)CD16(hi) subset after engulfing Hb-activated platelets. The CD14(+) CD16(hi) monocytes, which were positive for both intracellular Hb and CD42b (platelet marker), secreted significant amounts of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, unlike monocytes treated with only free Hb, which secreted more IL 10. We have shown recently the presence of a high number of Hb-bound hyperactive platelets in patients with both diseases, and further investigated if the monocytes engulfed these activated platelets in vivo. As expected, we found 95% of CD14(+) CD16(hi) monocytes with both intracellular Hb and CD42b in both diseases, and they expressed high TNF-alpha. Furthermore our data showed that these monocytes whether from patients or developed in vitro after treatment with Hb-activated platelets, secreted significant amounts of tissue factor. Besides, these CD14(+) CD16(hi) monocytes displayed significantly decreased phagocytosis of E. coif. Our study therefore suggests that this alteration of monocyte phenotype may play a role in the increased propensity to pro-inflammatory/ coagulant complications observed in these hemolytic disorders-PNH and SCD.

AB  - Optimum perioperative fluid administration may improve postoperative outcome after major surgery. This meta-analysis and systematic review has been aimed to determine the effect of dynamic goal directed fluid therapy (GDFT) on postoperative morbidity and mortality in non-cardiac surgical patients.
   Meta-analysis of published prospective randomized controlled trials where GDFT based on non-invasive flow based hemodynamic measurement has been compared with a standard care. Data from 41 prospective randomized trials have been included in this study.
   Use of GDFT in major surgical patients does not decrease postoperative hospital/30-day mortality (OR 0.70, 95 % CI 0.46-1.08, p = 0.11) length of post-operative hospital stay (SMD -0.14; 95 % CI -0.28, 0.00; p = 0.05) and length of ICU stay (SMD -0.12; 95 % CI -0.28, 0.04; p = 0.14). However, number of patients having at least one postoperative complication is significantly lower with use of GDFT (OR 0.57; 95 % CI 0.43, 0.75; p < 0.0001). Abdominal complications (p = 0.008), wound infection (p = 0.002) and postoperative hypotension (p = 0.04) are also decreased with used of GDFT as opposed to a standard care. Though patients who received GDFT were infused more colloid (p < 0.0001), there is no increased risk of heart failure or pulmonary edema and renal failure.
   GDFT in major non- cardiac surgical patients has questionable benefit over a standard care in terms of postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay. However, incidence of all complications including wound infection, abdominal complications and postoperative hypotension is reduced.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aortopulmonary window (APW) is a rare congenital heart defect. We reviewed our experience with this condition over the last two decades.
   METHODS: Between September 1993 and December 2013, 62 patients underwent surgery for APW. Depending on the associated lesions, they were divided into two groups: Simple (Group 1) or complex (Group 2). In the complex group, six patients had a ventricular septal defect, five patients had interrupted aortic arch, three patients had tetralogy of Fallot, two patients had double outlet right ventricle, and one patient had the right pulmonary artery arising from the ascending aorta.
   RESULTS: Mean age at repair was 21.6 +/- 32.02 months (median = 6, range 0.1-144 months). By preoperative echocardiographic assessment 27 out of 62 patients had severe pulmonary artery hypertension (52% of the cohort). Patch repair of APW was performed using the sandwich method (transwindow) (n = 27; 43.5%), transaortic (n = 18; 29%), and transpulmonary artery (n = 5; 8.1%) approaches; 10 patients (16.1%) underwent double ligation and two (3.2%) underwent division and suturing. Overall hospital mortality in group 1 was 6.97% (3/43) and in group 2 it was21%(4/19), p = 0.085. Mean hospital stay in group 1 was 6.9 +/- 2.4 days (median = 7 days) and in group 2 was 12 +/- 6.1 days (median = 13 days), p = 0.0001. Follow-up in group 1 was 1.6-9.8 years (median = 6 years); in group 2, it was 1.8-8.9 years (median = 6.5 years). There were no late deaths. Two patients needed reintervention for distortion of the right pulmonary artery origin. All patients were in New York Heart Association Class I/II at last follow up.
   CONCLUSION: There are multiple acceptable surgical strategies for the treatment of aortopulmonary window. Despite a relatively advanced age and substantial number of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension the outcomes can still be good. Associated anomalies complicate the repair. Patients in the complex group had a protracted hospital course and a higher early mortality but similar late survival.

Methods: Review of archival material, records, project reports, policy and procedures' manuals, and publications was done. Descriptive and analytical processing of data obtained was undertaken. Parameters evaluated included total collection, transplantation, utilization rates of donor cornea, changing trends over time in terms of numbers and duration of recipients waiting, impactful research translated into changes in standard operating protocols, new facilities, and subsequent effects on numbers or quality assurance measures and overview of major achievements. Periodic situational analysis with contextual relevance and interpretation of outcomes was done pertaining to national goals and international standards. Results: The NEB and cornea services have played a key leadership role in furthering the development of eye banking and corneal transplantation services. The contribution extends beyond routine patient care to education, training, generation of resources, advocacy, and policymaking. In quantifiable terms, the overall performance has steadily increased over the years. Major contributions include training of doctors, eye bank staff and corneal surgeons, introduction of innovative techniques for corneal transplantation, setting of national standards for eye banking and provision of preservation media, customized corneal, and ocular surface cell replacement therapy in collaboration with other departments and institutes. Conclusion: The eye banking and corneal transplantation facilities have evolved with time providing quality services, modernized as appropriate with updated knowledge and incorporating technological advances supported by the systematic evidence-based approach.

AB  - Intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality that provides a real-time dynamic feedback of the various surgical steps. Comprehensive literature search was performed in MEDLINE using "intraoperative optical coherence tomography" and "iOCT" as keywords. The use of iOCT as an aid to decision-making has been successfully reported in cases undergoing keratoplasty, implantable Collamer lens (ICL) implantation as well as cataract surgery. iOCT helps to assess the graft-host relationship in penetrating keratoplasty. It helps confirm the presence of a big bubble, detect subclinical big bubbles and guide layer by layer stromal dissection in cases of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. It acts as a guide during crucial surgical steps in endothelial keratoplasty, right from scoring of the Descemet membrane to ensuring graft apposition at the end of surgery. The morphological features of the corneal incision in phacoemulsification may be assessed. iOCT is a useful tool in assessing the status of the posterior capsule and may help identify preexisting posterior capsular defects during cataract surgery in various clinical scenarios such as posterior polar cataract, traumatic cataract, and vitrectomized eyes. It allows on-table assessment of the ICL vault and potentially facilitates exchange of ICL in the same sitting in extremes of vault. Ocular surface disorders such as ocular surface squamous neoplasia, pterygium, and dermoid may find an application for iOCT, wherein an iOCT-guided stromal dissection will ensure adequate depth of dissection. Further technological advancements may allow for automatic centration and tracking and address the present limitation of instrument-induced shadowing.

AB  - Background & objectives: There is no consensus regarding optimal standard for diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In this study, use of 75 g glucose load in non-fasting state [Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group of India (DIPSI) criteria] as a diagnostic test for GDM in pregnant women was compared with different oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs).
   Methods: This prospective study included 936 pregnant women, who underwent plasma glucose evaluation two hours after the challenge of 75 g glucose load irrespective of the timing of last meal (DIPSI criteria for GDM). After three days, standard 75 g OGTT was done in all women irrespective of previous plasma glucose value. Accuracy of the first result was compared to OGTT using cut-offs as per the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria for the diagnosis of GDM.
   Results: Of the total 936 pregnant women, 73 (7.8%) patients had plasma glucose value >= 140 mg/dl when measured two hours after glucose load. When comparing with the WHO and IADPSG criteria, the sensitivity values were 65.1 and 74.1 per cent, respectively, and the corresponding specificity values were 96.3 and 96.9 per cent, respectively. On comparing with the WHO OGTT, only 41 of the 73 (56.2%) were true positives, whereas when IADPSG criteria were used, true positives were 46 (63%). False negative cases were also present when classified by the WHO and IADPSG criteria though in lesser numbers than false positives. The positive predictive values (PPVs) for the WHO and IADPSG criteria were 56.1 and 63 per cent, respectively, and their corresponding negative predictive values were 97.7 and 97.9 per cent, respectively.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed that when 75 g glucose load in non-fasting state was used as a diagnostic test for GDM, almost one quarter of patients with GDM escaped diagnosis as sensitivity values were low. On the other hand, some GDM cases were falsely labelled as normal as this test did not account for cases of fasting hyperglycaemia. In addition, comparison with other OGTTs showed low PPVs. Hence, use of DIPSI criteria for diagnosing GDM must be reconsidered till further validation.

AB  - A review appropriateness of the current definition of blindness under National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB), Government of India. Online search of peer-reviewed scientific published literature and guidelines using PubMed, the World Health Organization (WHO) IRIS, and Google Scholar with keywords, namely blindness and visual impairment, along with offline examination of reports of national and international organizations, as well as their cross-references was done until December 2016, to identify relevant documents on the definition of blindness. The evidence for the historical and currently adopted definition of blindness under the NPCB, the WHO, and other countries was reviewed. Differences in the NPCB and WHO definitions were analyzed to assess the impact on the epidemiological status of blindness and visual impairment in India. The differences in the criteria for blindness under the NPCB and the WHO definitions cause an overestimation of the prevalence of blindness in India. These variations are also associated with an over-representation of refractive errors as a cause of blindness and an under-representation of other causes under the NPCB definition. The targets for achieving elimination of blindness also become much more difficult to achieve under the NPCB definition. Ignoring differences in definitions when comparing the global and Indian prevalence of blindness will cause erroneous interpretations. We recommend that the appropriate modifications should be made in the NPCB definition of blindness to make it consistent with the WHO definition.

AB  - Tuberculosis continues to be a major pandemic with enormous public health implication. Involvement of ocular tissues in the form of tubercles, tuberculomas, panophthalmitis, and iris granulomas are well recognized as definitive manifestations of tuberculosis. For these lesions, confirmatory evidence is available in the form of demonstration of acid-fast Bacillus on ZiehluNeelsen staining. For other retinochoroidal disorders such as central serous chorioretinopathy, retinal vasculitis, and presumed ocular tuberculosis, hard evidence about the role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is lacking. In this review, work done at our center over the past four decades in the form of experimental animal studies, nucleic acid amplification assays and clinical studies regarding the above retinochoroidal pathologies and the tubercle Bacillus is presented. It is possible that revisiting experimental animal studies may be a way forward in the current scenario of ambiguity about the causeueffect relationship between M. tuberculosis and few of the retinochoroidal disorders.

AB  - Background and AimCrohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) have close phenotypic resemblance. Mesenteric fat (a component of visceral fat [VF]) hypertrophy and fat wrapping, which is visible radiologically as fibrofatty proliferation, is seen more commonly in CD than in ITB.
   AimThe present study was conducted to study the role of VF in differentiating CD and ITB.
   MethodsVisceral fat area and subcutaneous (SC) fat area were measured on computed tomography in two cohorts (development and validation). VF/SC ratio was also calculated for all patients. In the development cohort, retrospective data collection was carried out for 75 patients with CD and ITB who were on follow-up from January 2012 to November 2014. In the validation cohort, 82 patients were recruited prospectively from December 2014 to December 2015 and were diagnosed as CD or ITB according to standard diagnostic criteria.
   ResultsVisceral fat area and VF/SC ratio were significantly higher in CD patients (n=42: development, n=46: validation) than in ITB patients (n=33: development, n=36: validation) in both the development (106.263.5 vs 37.3 +/- 22, P=<0.001; 1.1 +/- 0.57 vs 0.43 +/- 0.24, P=<0.001) and validation cohorts (102.2 +/- 69.8 vs 55.8 +/- 44.9, P=0.01; 1.2 +/- 0.68 vs 0.56 +/- 0.33, P=<0.001). A cut-off of 0.63 for VF/SC ratio in the development cohort had a high sensitivity (82%) and specificity (81%) in differentiating CD and ITB. Similar sensitivity (81%) and specificity (78%) were seen when this cut-off was applied in the validation cohort.
   ConclusionThe VF/SC ratio is a simple, cost-effective, non-invasive and single objective parameter with a good sensitivity and specificity to differentiate CD and ITB.

AB  - Study Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinopathy of women, is a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and is closely linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), is the usual first choice of treatment in women with PCOS. Because OCP use has been linked to the risk of venous thrombosis and there are limited data on the effect of OCP use on the inflammatory state of women with PCOS, our objective was to compare the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 between drug-naive and OCP-treated women with PCOS.
   Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures: Consequent to women diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg, levonogestrel-0.15 mg) for a period of 6 months (n = 50) or drugnaive (n = 51) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.
   Results: The mean ages of patients and control participants were comparable (21.99 +/- 4.78 vs 21.92 +/- 5.83 years; P = .947) as was body mass index (24.47 +/- 3.92 vs 23.66 +/- 3.43; P = .271). Clinical and androgen excess symptoms were significantly better in the OCP group compared with the drug-naive group (P = .01, P = .04). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the OCP group (P = .01). Plasma ICAM-1 levels, TNF-alpha levels, and MCP-1 levels showed a higher trend in patients but reached statistical significance only in cases of ICAM-1 and TNF-alpha (P = .01).
   Conclusion: OCP treatment of 6 months increases plasma ICAM-1, MCP-1, and TNF-alpha levels among women with PCOS, although OCPs significantly help in ameliorating features of hyperandrogenism and regularizing menstrual cycles. These cytokines correlate positively with many metabolic parameters including plasma glucose, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance. Further investigation with well designed, randomized, longitudinal studies might help to ascertain the effect of OCPs on proinflammatory profiles among women with PCOS.

AB  - Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with dengue virus (DENV) infections. With a focus on understanding the possible mechanism of thrombocytopenia in DENV infections we described a direct correlation between activation and depletion of platelets in patients. Our data showed a sharp decrease in platelet counts at day 4 of fever in patients. The high DENV genome copies in platelets correlated directly with the elevated platelet activation along with increased binding of complement factor C3 and IgG on their surface at day 4. Recovery in platelet count was observed on day 10 through day 6 and 8 with simultaneous decrease in platelet activation markers. Further, our in vitro data supported the above observations describing a concentration-dependent increase in platelet activation by DENV serotype-2. The high copy number of DENV2 genome in the platelet pellet correlated directly with platelet activation, microparticle generation and clot formation. Furthermore the DENV2-activated platelets were phagocytosed in large numbers by the monocytes. The DENV2-mediated lysis and clearance of platelets were abrogated in presence of platelet activation inhibitor, prostacyclin. These observations collectively suggest that platelet activation status is an important determinant of thrombocytopenia in dengue infections. A careful strategy of inactivation of platelets may rescue them from rapid destruction during DENV infections.

AB  - Background: Miltefosine unresponsive and relapse cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are increasingly being reported. However, there has been no laboratory confirmed reports of miltefosine resistance in VL. Here, we report two laboratory confirmed cases of VL from India.
   Methods: Two patients with VL were referred to us with suspected VL. The first patient was a native of the VL endemic state of Bihar, but residing in Delhi, a VL non-endemic area. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antipyretics but was unresponsive to treatment. The second patient was from Jharkhand state in eastern India (adjoining Bihar), another endemic state for VL. He was refractory to anti-leishmanial treatment, which included administration of miltefosine. Following investigation, both patients were serologically positive for VL, and blood buffy coat from both patients grew Leishmania donovani. The isolates derived from both cases were characterized for their drug susceptibility, genetically characterised, and SNPs typed for LdMT and LdROS gene expression. Both patients were successfully treated with amphotericin B.
   Results: The in vitro drug susceptibility assays carried out on both isolates showed good IC50 values to amphotericin B (0.1 +/- 0.0004 mu g/ml and 0.07 +/- 0.0019 mu g/ml). One isolate was refractory to Sb-III with an IC50 of > 200 mu M while the second isolate was sensitive to SbIII with an IC50 of 36.70 +/- 3.2 mu M. However, in both the isolates, IC50 against miltefosine was more than 10-fold higher (> 100 mu M) than the standard strain DD8 (6.8 +/- 0.1181 mu M). Furthermore, genetic analyses demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ((354)Tyr -> Phe and (1078)Phe -> Tyr) in the LdMT gene of the parasites.
   Conclusions: Here, we document two laboratory confirmed cases of miltefosine resistant VL from India. Our finding highlights the urgent need to establish control measures to prevent the spread of these strains. We also propose that LdMT gene mutation analysis could be used as a molecular marker of miltefosine resistance in L. donovani.

AB  - Epidemiologic studies show an inverse correlation between garlic consumption and progression of cardiovascular disease. However, the molecular basis for the beneficial effect of garlic on the heart is not known. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to (1) investigate the effect of raw garlic on isoproterenol (Iso) induced cardiac hypertrophy (2) find the active metabolites of garlic responsible for the beneficial effect. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in rats by subcutaneous single injection of Iso 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 15 days and the effect of garlic (250 mg/kg/day orally) was evaluated. Garlic metabolites in in vivo were identified by LC/MS study. The effect of garlic and its metabolites were evaluated against hypertrophy in H9C2 cells. Garlic normalized cardiac oxidative stress after Iso administration. Cardiac pathology and mitochondria' enzyme activities were improved in hypertrophy heart after garlic administration. Decreased Na+/K+-ATPase protein level that observed in hypertrophy heart was increased after garlic administration. We identified three garlic metabolites in rat serum. To confirm the role of garlic metabolites on cardiac hypertrophy, Na+/K+-ATPase expression and intracellular calcium levels were measured after treating H9C2 cells with raw garlic and two of its active metabolites, allyl methyl sulfide and allyl methyl sulfoxide. Raw garlic and both metabolites increased Na+/K+-ATPase protein level and decreased intracellular calcium levels and cell size in Iso treated H9C2 cells. This antihypertrophic effect of garlic and its sulfur metabolites were lost in H9C2 cells in presence of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor. In conclusion, garlic and its active metabolites increased Na+/K+-ATPase in rat heart, and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and associated remodeling. Our data suggest that identified new garlic metabolites may be useful for therapeutic intervention against cardiac hypertrophy.

AB  - The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) is witnessing an increase in chronic disorders, including mental illness. With ongoing unrest, this is expected to rise. This is the first study to quantify the burden of mental disorders in the EMR. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 2013. DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) allow assessment of both premature mortality (years of life lost-YLLs) and nonfatal outcomes (years lived with disability-YLDs). DALYs are computed by adding YLLs and YLDs for each age-sex-country group. In 2013, mental disorders contributed to 5.6% of the total disease burden in the EMR (1894 DALYS/100,000 population): 2519 DALYS/100,000 (2590/100,000 males, 2426/100,000 females) in high-income countries, 1884 DALYS/100,000 (1618/100,000 males, 2157/100,000 females) in middle-income countries, 1607 DALYS/100,000 (1500/100,000 males, 1717/100,000 females) in low-income countries. Females had a greater proportion of burden due to mental disorders than did males of equivalent ages, except for those under 15 years of age. The highest proportion of DALYs occurred in the 25-49 age group, with a peak in the 35-39 years age group (5344 DALYs/100,000). The burden of mental disorders in EMR increased from 1726 DALYs/100,000 in 1990 to 1912 DALYs/100,000 in 2013 (10.8% increase). Within the mental disorders group in EMR, depressive disorders accounted for most DALYs, followed by anxiety disorders. Among EMR countries, Palestine had the largest burden of mental disorders. Nearly all EMR countries had a higher mental disorder burden compared to the global level. Our findings call for EMR ministries of health to increase provision of mental health services and to address the stigma of mental illness. Moreover, our results showing the accelerating burden of mental health are alarming as the region is seeing an increased level of instability. Indeed, mental health problems, if not properly addressed, will lead to an increased burden of diseases in the region.

AB  - Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the host-parasite interaction during red cell invasion by Plasmodium is important for developing newer antimalarial therapeutics. Recently, we have characterized a Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38, which is expressed by its merozoites, binds to host erythrocytes, and interferes with parasite growth. Interaction of this parasite ligand with the host erythrocyte occurs through its two regions present at amino acid positions 167-178 (P-2) and 197-208 (P-4). Each region recognizes its own erythrocyte receptor. Previously, we identified band 3 as the chymotrypsin-sensitive erythrocyte receptor for the P-4 region, but the other receptor, binding to P-2 region, remained unknown. Here, we have identified basigin as the second erythrocyte receptor for PvTRAg38, which is resistant to chymotrypsin. The specificity of interaction between PvTRAg38 and basigin was confirmed by direct interaction where basigin was specifically recognized by P-2 and not by the P-4 region of this parasite ligand. Interaction between P-2 and basigin is stabilized through multiple amino acid residues, but Gly-171 and Leu-175 of P-2 were more critical. These two amino acids were also critical for parasite growth. Synthetic peptides P-2 and P-4 of PvTRAg38 interfered with the parasite growth independently but had an additive effect if combined together indicating involvement of both the receptors during red cell invasion. In conclusion, PvTRAg38 binds to two erythrocyte receptors basigin and band 3 through P-2 and P-4 regions, respectively, to facilitate parasite growth. This advancement in our knowledge on molecular mechanisms of host-parasite interaction can be exploited to develop therapeutics against P. vivax malaria.

AB  - Background Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.
   Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.
   Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19.1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127.0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125.7-128.3) in men and 122.3 mm Hg (121.0-123.6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78.7 mm Hg (77.9-79.5) for men and 76.7 mm Hg (75.9-77.6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24.1% (21.4-27.1) in men and 20.1% (17.8-22.5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence.
   Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

TI  - Comparison of TST and IGRA in Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in a High TB-Burden Setting
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - COUNTRIES
KW  - ASSAYS
AB  - Background
   There are currently two tests for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); TST and IGRA. However, it is still unclear that which one of these tests performs better in high TB-burden settings.
   Methods
   1511 household contacts of pulmonary TB patients were enrolled to compare the performance of TST and IGRA for LTBI. At baseline all participant underwent testing for IGRA [QuantiFERON-TB (R) Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT) assay] and TST [2 tuberculin unit (TU), purified protein derivative (PPD), RT23, Staten Serum Institute (SSI), Copenhagen, Denmark]. All the household contacts were followed-up for two years for incident TB cases.
   Results
   Active TB was diagnosed in 76 household contacts at an incidence rate of 2.14 per 1000 person-years. Both, TST [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-1.79, p = 0.57], as well as QFT-GIT assay (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 0.97-2.84, p = 0.06) results at baseline were not significantly associated with subsequent development of active TB among household contacts of pulmonary TB patients.
   Conclusion
   Neither TST nor IGRA predicted subsequent development of active TB among household contacts of pulmonary TB patients during follow-up. However, keeping in view the cost, and other logistics, TST remains the most preferred method for LTBI diagnosis in resource-limited, high TB-burden settings.

AB  - Background: Recognizing patterns of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in families helps to identify and target individuals who may have the most to gain from preventive interventions. The overall goal of the study is to test the effectiveness and sustainability of an integrated care model for managing cardiovascular risk in high risk families. The proposed care model targets the structural and environmental conditions that predispose high risk families to development of CHD through the following interventions: 1) screening for cardiovascular risk factors, 2) providing lifestyle interventions 3) providing a framework for linkage to appropriate primary health care facility, and 4) active follow-up of intervention adherence.
   Methods: Initially, a formative qualitative research component will gather information on understanding of diseases, barriers to care, specific components of the intervention package and feedback on the intervention. Then a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 740 families comprising 1480 participants will be conducted to determine whether the package of interventions (integrated care model) is effective in reducing or preventing the progression of CHD risk factors and risk factor clustering in families. The sustainability and scalability of this intervention will be assessed through economic (cost-effectiveness analyses) and qualitative evaluation (process outcomes) to estimate value and acceptability. Scalability is informed by cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the integrated cardiovascular risk reduction approach.
   Discussion: Knowledge generated from this trial has the potential to significantly affect new programmatic policy and clinical guidelines that will lead to improvements in cardiovascular health in India.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the incremental value of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m-MDP) single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) over planar bone scintigraphy (BS) and SPECT for the diagnosis of active condylar hyperplasia (CH).Patients and methodsData of 21 patients (mean age: 21.95.3 years, 10 males, 11 females) who underwent Tc-99m-MDP BS along with regional SPECT/CT for the diagnosis of active CH were retrospectively evaluated. Planar BS, SPECT, and SPECT/CT images were evaluated by two nuclear medicine physician in consensus. Radioactive counts were measured per region of interest and the respective ratios were calculated. A percentage of condylar uptake 55% or higher, generating differences of 10% or more between condyles, was considered to be indicative of active unilateral condylar hyperactivity. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated separately for planar BS, SPECT, and SPECT/CT. Clinical/imaging follow-up and histopathology was considered the reference standard.ResultsPlanar BS, SPECT, and SPECT-CT of 21 patients with suspected CH were retrospectively evaluated. Planar BS was positive in eight patients, of whom six had active CH as the final diagnosis. SPECT was positive in 14 patients, of whom 12 patients had CH. Out of 14 patients who were positive in SPECT, two patients were considered negative in SPECT-CT. The diagnostic accuracy was the lowest for planar BS (47.6%) and the highest for SPECT/CT (85.8%). SPECT/CT and SPECT had similar sensitivity (80%), whereas SPECT-CT had the highest specificity (100%).ConclusionSPECT/CT is superior to planar BS and SPECT for the diagnosis of active CH.

AB  - Since precise control of nanoscale features is in high demand, it is being exploited to develop and improve OSL dosimetric materials, where striking improvement might also be expected in lanthanide-doped metal halides. The major challenge in the development of a nanophosphor lies in avoiding the aggregation of a dopant element in host materials, which has long prevented an in-depth exploration for the same purpose. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of Sm-doped KCl nanophosphors to develop a novel accession to investigate the highly sensitive trivalent Sm-doped KCl phosphor. Herein, we were able to overcome the aggregation phenomena and we showed that Sm-doped KCl with 0.45 mol% of Sm, which is the optimised dopant concentration, exhibits the high-intensity luminescence performance under blue light stimulation for the gamma doses in the range from 100 mGy to 1000 Gy. This sensitivity is attributed to the uniform nanospheres encapsulated in KCl along with the predominant existence of a trivalent (Sm3+) state, where these conditions can introduce additional defects centres. The presence of these additional defect centres was confirmed by photoluminescence studies, plausibly supporting the charge transfer due to the optical energy between these states, leading to high sensitivity. To establish KCl: Sm as a good OSL dosimetric materials (DM), we investigated fading, reusability, and reproducibility and compared these with those of commercial DM compounds such as Al2O3:C and BeO. Overall, Sm-doped KCl is non-toxic, cost-effective, robust, and a promising candidate for reusable dosimetry.

AB  - High-mobility group A1 (HMGA1) is a non-histone chromosomal protein, which is known as 'architectural' transcription factor that facilitates the assembly of 'enhanceosome.' Because of its elevated expression in a number of human malignancies, with barely minimal levels in healthy adults, HMGA1 is considered as potential 'tumor marker.' Therefore, we looked at the inhibition of hmga1 using anti-gene strategy, as an attractive therapeutic approach. This was achieved by two triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), TFO1 and TFO2 targeted to the promoter of hmga1 at positions, -284(-)-304 and -2800(-)-2826, respectively. The stability of two DNA triplexes was characterized using a variety of biophysical and thermodynamics techniques and was confirmed by gel retardation assay using gamma-P-32 [ATP]. The efficacy of TFOs on HMGA1 expression was evaluated in HeLa cells using MTT assay, Flow cytometry, Western blot, and RT-PCR. Results revealed that DNA Triplex1 formed by TFO1 is more stable and stronger than the corresponding Triplex2. Although both TFOs downregulated hmga1 expression at mRNA and protein levels and caused apoptotic cell death in HeLa cell line, TFO1 demonstrated a greater effect at low concentration which corroborates well with the stability data. Thus, TFO-mediated inhibition of hmga1 expression can be a promising strategy for the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics.

In biopsy, 83.1, 83.1, and 78.1% of lung cancer patients and 72.9, 70, and 70% of controls, while in serum, 52.5, 30.6, and 65.6% of lung cancer patients and 14.3, 18.6, and 30% of controls were positive for APC, DAPK, and GSTP1 hypermethylation respectively. We couldn't find any significant role of DNA hypermethylation in lung cancer. However, long follow-up of methylation positive controls will be required to confirm its role for the prediction of lung cancer.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of trabeculectomy with combined subconjunctival and subscleral ologen implant in eyes with advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
   Design: This is a retrospective, noncomparative case series.
   Methods: Twenty seven eyes of 23 patients with advanced primary glaucoma who underwent fornix-based trabeculectomy with insertion of ologen both subsclerally and subconjunctivally along with low dose Mitomycin-C (0.1 mg/mL x 1 min) were evaluated. Data recorded included a complete history, demographic profile, and ophthalmic examination including gonioscopy and visual fields. Any complications or secondary procedures performed after trabeculectomy were recorded. Complete success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) <= 15mm Hg without ocular hypotensive medication and qualified success as IOP <= 15mm Hg with medications.
   Results: The average age of patients was 46.2 +/- 14.8 years. There were 17 males and 6 females. Of these, 7 patients were diagnosed with juvenile open-angle glaucoma, 7 patients with primary openangle glaucoma and 9 patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma and pseudophakia. The average follow-up time was 23.3 +/- 5.6 months, with a minimum of at least 12 months. The mean preoperative IOP was 38.3 +/- 6.6mm Hg. Postoperatively, the IOP at 3 months was 12.5 +/- 1.9mm Hg; 6 months was 12.6 +/- 3.9mm Hg; 12 months was 12.3 +/- 2.5mm Hg; and 24 months was 12.5 +/- 1.6mm Hg (n= 17); (P<0.0001). Complete success was noted in 92.6% eyes, qualified success in 3.7% eyes, and failure in 3.7% eyes. The preoperative and postoperative bestcorrected visual acuity in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution was 0.3 +/- 0.2 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 (P=0.31). The average number of ocular hypotensive medications used preoperatively was 4.2 +/- 0.5 (median 4) which decreased to 0.07 +/- 0.3 (median 0), (P<0.0001) postoperatively.
   Conclusions: Trabeculectomy with low dose Mitomycin-C and with implantation of ologen both subsclerally and subconjunctivally, appears to offer encouraging results in achieving a low target IOP in eyes with advanced primary adult glaucoma.

AB  - The disadvantages associated with routine toxicological samples, such as blood samples, have encouraged the forensic toxicologist to use vitreous humour as an alternative matrix. However, its use is still limited. The reason for this is the lack of a systematic study in this domain. Moreover, the phenomena of drug disposition in ocular tissues are mostly unexplored. This paper presents a controlled study to investigate the distribution of diazepam in post-mortem blood, vitreous humour and ocular tissues using rabbit as an animal model. This study reveals that diazepam levels in vitreous and aqueous humour increase with their decrease in whole blood at post-mortem. A further study on the distribution of diazepam in ocular tissues reveals that the anterior and posterior segment tissues might be responsible for the increase in diazepam levels in aqueous humour and vitreous humour respectively.The present study strengthens the possibility of using vitreous humour as a complementary sample to blood in forensic toxicological investigations.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the study was to use deformable mapping of planning CT (pCT) electron density values on weekly cone-beam CT (CBCT) to quantify the anatomical changes and determine the dose-volume relationship in offline adaptive volumetric-modulated arc therapy.
   Methods: 10 patients treated with RapidArc plans who had weekly CBCTs were selected retrospectively. The pCT was deformed to weekly CBCTs and the deformed contours were checked for any discrepancies. Clinical target volume 66Gy and 60Gy (CTV66 and CTV60), parotids and spinal cord were the structures selected for analysis. Volume reduction and dice similarity index (DSI) were determined. Hybrid RapidArc plans were created and the cumulative dose-volume histograms for selected structures were analyzed.
   Results: Results showed a mean volume reduction of 18.826 +/- 6.08% and 18.226 +/- 6.1% for Clinical target volume 66Gy and 60Gy (CTV66 and CTV60), respectively, and their corresponding DSI values were 0.94 +/- 60.03 and 0.95 +/- 60.01. Mean volume reductions of left and right parotids were 32.796 +/- 10.28% and 29.466 +/- 8.78%, respectively, and their corresponding mean DSI values were 0.90 +/- 60.05 and 0.89 +/- 60.05. The cumulative mean dose difference for Planning target volume 66Gy (PTV66) was -1.356 +/- 1.71% and for Planning target volume 60Gy (PTV60), it was -0.696 +/- 1.37%. Spinal cord doses varied for all patients over the course.
   Conclusion: The results from the study showed that it is clinically feasible to estimate the dose-volume relationship using deformed pCT. Monitoring of patient anatomic changes and incorporating patient-specific replanning strategy are necessary to avoid critical structure complications.
   Advances in knowledge: Deformable mapping of pCT electron density values on weekly CBCTs has been performed to establish the volumetric and dosimetric changes. The anatomical changes differ among the patients and hence, the choice for adaptive radiotherapy should be strictly patient specific rather than time specific.

AB  - Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4) is one of the most investigated materials used as Thermally Stimulated Luminescence Dosimeter (TLD). It has been experimentally modified with several dopants to increase/modify its Thermo luminescent (TL) sensitivity. Mn (Manganese) doping in CaSO4 being the first to be investigated. CaSO4: Mn inspite of high sensitivity, lost its popularity due to its high fading (40-85% in the first 3 days after exposures). Another potential limitation in the use of this material was its sensitivity to light. We have attempted to turn its limitation to its advantage by discovering its Opticaly Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) properties. Till now no study has been reported in this material for its OSL characteristics. This paper investigates the preliminary studies CaSO4:Mn as a new material for OSL dosimetry. The irradiation was carried out from Sr-90 (beta) and Cs-137 (gamma) sources. Synthesis was carried out by recrystallization method using Calcium sulfate with concentrated sulfuric acid. Formation of the compound was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. In addition to the study of variation of dose (beta and gamma) on the OSL signal, effect of light induced fading, effect of excitation source, effect of power and time on stimulation signal, effect of thermal and optical annealing have also been examined and reported. The paper also explores the dependence of temperature on the OSL intensity popularly known as Thermally Assisted OSL (TA-OSL) which showed a correlation between the TL and OSL traps. Theoretical analysis of OSL curves for three excitation sources were performed in order to have a deeper understanding of the OSL phenomena. OSL response to a wide range of beta and gamma doses of CaSO4:Mn and excellent reusability confirm its suitability as an effective OSL material and explore its potential for tremendous applications in radiation dosimetry.

T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - POVERTY
AB  - Background. We aimed to generate evidence on the social and economic impact of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by households on illness.
   Methods. We did a hospital-based cross-sectional study including a convenience sample of 374 inpatients and outpatients.
   Results. The median illness expenditure was the same (762 500) for inpatients and outpatients. Of all respondents, 51.3% among the rural and 65.5% among the urban patients were employed before illness, but after illness only 24.4% among the rural and 23.4% among the urban patients remained in employment. The proportion of rural households of different socioeconomic categories that experienced decrease in expenditure on food, education and health, and those who had to sell land or cattle, and the education of whose children suffered was statistically significant. The proportion of indebted families in different socioeconomic classes was also statistically significant among both rural and urban patients. The lowest socioeconomic strata depended mostly upon the financial support of their friends to tide over the financial crisis of an illness.
   Conclusion. Our study shows that out-of-pocket expenses on healthcare are a burden not only for the poor but also the middle classes.

AB  - Background: "Dual disorder'' or "dual diagnosis'' refers to the co-occurrence of substance use disorder and psychiatric disorders. Prospective studies have shown that treatment outcomes, such as symptom levels, hospitalization rates, housing stability, and functional status, are worse among the patients with dual disorders as compared with those who have either of these disorders.
   Objectives: The current article is aimed at reviewing the current state of evidence on neurobiology of dual disorders. Given the high prevalence of co-occurrence of substance use disorder and psychiatric disorders, it is important to explore the various facets of this association. The current review assimilates the information on neurobiological research on dual disorders and helps the readers gain insights into the current understanding on this theme.
   Methods: The electronic database of PubMed was searched for relevant publications.
   Results: The studies included in the review belonged to various domains of neurobiology including neuropathology, structural neuroimaging, functional neuroimaging, genetics, neurochemicals/neuroreceptors, and neuroendocrinology. Forty studies were included in the review.
   Conclusions: Most of the issues related to the neurobiology of dual disorders remain inadequately studied. However, the current evidence suggests that the individuals with co-occurring disorders are likely to differ from those with either substance use disorders or psychiatric disorders alone on various neurobiological aspects. Hence, it is imperative to systematically study the various neurobiological aspects of dual disorders in the future.

AB  - India is estimated to have over 10 million persons with autism. Rising awareness of autism in India over last decade with ready access to information has led to an increase in prevalence and earlier diagnosis, the creation of services and some policy initiatives. However, there remains a gaping chasm between policy and implementation. The reach and quality of services continues sketchy and uneven, especially in the area of education. The present review discusses existing legal provisions for children and adults with autism in India. It also discusses Governmental efforts and lacunae in existing health care facilities and education services in India. While there are examples of good practice and stories of hope, strong policy initiatives have to support grassroots action to improve the condition of persons with autism in India.

AB  - In an air-conditioning system, the compressor is a large electric pump that pressurizes the refrigerant gas as part of the process of turning it back into a liquid. The explosion of an air conditioner (AC) compressor is an uncommon event, and immediate death resulted from the blast effect is not reported in forensic literature. We report three such cases in which young AC mechanics were killed on the spot due to compressor blast, while repairing the domestic split AC unit. The autopsy findings, the circumstances leading to the explosion of the compressor, are discussed in this study.

AB  - Background: Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare aggressive tumour arising from the Schneiderian epithelium lining the sinonasal tract. Although considered the cornerstone of therapy, surgical resection can only be performed in a limited number of patients. This report describes the experience of treating sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma with a multimodality approach.
   Method: The treatment charts of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma patients treated at a tertiary care centre from 2004 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed.
   Results: A total of 16 sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma patients with a median age at diagnosis of 47.5 years (range 8-65 years) were included: 19 per cent had neck nodal metastasis at presentation. Four patients (25 per cent) underwent surgery: of these, two had post-operative radiotherapy, one had pre-operative radiotherapy and one had adjuvant chemotherapy alone. Six patients (38 per cent) received definitive radiotherapy: five had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy to reduce tumour size and help in radiotherapy planning, while four (25 per cent) received palliative radiotherapy. The median follow up was 10.4 months (range 1-42.5 months). The estimated median progression-free survival time was 29.3 months. One-and three-year progression-free survival rates were 77 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively.
   Conclusion: Surgery is the best treatment option for sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, although most patients require post-operative radiotherapy for advanced disease and close tumour margins. Definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy may be suitable for patients with inoperable locally advanced disease. Elective nodal irradiation to address the high nodal involvement rates should be considered to improve the survival rate.

AB  - Clinical stage alone is used for risk stratification in treatment of pediatric advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). To identify other risk factors, we collected data from three tertiary centers on 186 patients with advanced stage (IIB-IV) consecutively treated with Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, Dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy. Freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) and overall survival (OS) were end points. With median follow-up period of 57.9 months (range: 1-151 months), five-year FFTF and OS was 84.8% (95% CI 78.6-89.3%) and 95.3% (95% CI 90.78-97.6%), respectively. We identified stage-4 [HR-3.6(1.25, 9.97); p = .017], high total leukocyte count (> 15,000/mm(3)) [HR-2.6(1.3,8.1); p = .008] and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <= 8%) [HR-4.9(1.7,14.1); p = .002] predictive of inferior FFTF. Patients with none or one of these risk factors had significantly better five-year FFTF (91.9%) as compared to those with risk factors (two risk factor [74.7%; p = .001]; 3,4 risk factors [14.3%; p <. 0001]). Patients without these risk factors can be treated with ABVD and may not need intensive therapy.

AB  - Background: Primary intracranial germ cell tumour is a rare entity and constitutes 2-3% of all paediatric brain tumours in Western countries. We herein intend to report the clinical features and treatment outcome of patients with primary central nervous system germ cell tumour treated at our institute. Methods: Clinical data were collected by retrospective chart review from 2006 to 2012. Histopathology slides were reviewed and relevant immunohistochemistry stains were done. Overall survival (OS) and progression- free survival (PFS) were analysed by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Results: Twenty patients met the study criterion (male: female = 7: 3). Median age at presentation was 13 years. Tumour location was pineal in 10 patients, suprasellar in 6, thalamic in 2, basal ganglion in 1, and spinal in 1. Leptomeningeal spread was noted in 1 patient at presentation. Surgical resection was gross-total in 7 patients (35%), neatotal in 2 (10%), subtotal in 4 (20%), and limited to biopsy in 6 (30%). The tumours were germinomatous, non-germinomatous, and of mixed germ cell subtype in 17 patients (85%), modality treatment consisting of limited resection followed by platinum-based systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy (40-50 Gy) is a reasonable treatment strategy in patients of primary central nervous system germ cell tumour in a developing nation.2 patients (10%), and 1 patient (5%), respectively. Systemic chemotherapy (median of 4 cycles) was given to 19 patients (95%). The common regimens used were a combination of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) in 14 patients (70%) and etoposide and cisplatin (EP) in 5 patients (25%). Radiation therapy (40-50 Gy in conventional fractionation; median of 42 Gy) was delivered to 17 patients (85%): local radiation in 6 and whole ventricular, whole brain, and craniospinal irradiation followed by a boost in 5, 3, and 3 patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 44.52 months, 17 patients (85%) were in complete response and 3 (15%) had progressive disease. Death and disease recurrence were noted in 6 patients (30%) and 1 patient, respectively. Median OS and PFS were not reached. The actuarial rates of OS at 3 and 5 years were 75.8 and 68.9%, respectively. The actuarial rates of PFS at both 3 and 5 years were 81.6%. Conclusion: Multi

AB  - Background There is concern about radiation exposure with radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). This sub-study of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Study reports radiation doses from MPI, and use of dose-optimisation protocols in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and compares them with data from the rest of the world.
   Methods Data were collected from 7911 MPI studies performed in 308 laboratories worldwide in one week in 2013, including 439 MPI studies from 34 ANZ laboratories. For each laboratory, effective radiation dose (ED) and a quality index (QI) score (out of 8) based on pre-specified "best practices'' was determined.
   Results In ANZ patients, ED ranged from 0.9-17.9 milliSievert (mSv). Median ED was similar in ANZ compared with the rest of the world (10.0 (IQR: 6.5-11.7) vs. 10.0 (IQR 6.4-12.6, P=0.15), as were mean QI scores (5.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.3, P= 0.84). Use of stress-only imaging (17.6% vs. 31.8% of labs, P= 0.09) and weight-based dosing of technetium-99m (14.7% vs. 30.3%, P= 0.07) was lower in ANZ compared with the rest of the world but this difference was not statistically significant. Median ED was significantly lower in metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan laboratories (10.1 mSv vs. 11.6 mSv, P < 0.01), although mean QI scores were similar (5.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.7, P= 0.75).
   Conclusion Across ANZ, there is variability in ED from MPI, and use of radiation safety practices, particularly between metropolitan and non-metropolitan laboratories. Overall, ANZ laboratories have a similar median ED to laboratories in the rest of the world.

AB  - Atypical pathogens including Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are increasingly recognized as important causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounts for 20-40% of all CAP and L. pneumophila is responsible for 3-15% of cases. The paucity of data from India in this regard prompted us to conduct this prospective multicentric analysis to detect the prevalence of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in our geographical region. A total of 453 patients with symptoms of pneumonia and 90 controls with no history of lower respiratory tract infections were included in the study. A duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 543 bp region of P1 adhesin gene of M. pneumoniae and 375 bp region of macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene of L. pneumophila was standardized for simultaneous detection of these atypical pathogens. Respiratory secretions, blood, and urine samples were collected from each patient and control and were subjected to duplex PCR, culture and serology for M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. Urine samples were subjected for detecting L. pneumophila antigen. Among the 453 patients investigated for M. pneumoniae, 52 (11.4%) were positive for IgM antibodies, 17 were positive by culture, and seven tested positive by PCR (P1 gene). Similarly for L. pneumophila, 50 cases (11%) were serologically positive for IgM antibodies, one was positive by PCR (mip gene) and urine antigen detection. A total of eight samples were positive by duplex PCR for M. pneumoniae P1 gene (N = 7) and L. pneumophila mip gene (N = 1). Of the 90 controls, two samples (2.2%) showed IgM positivity, and 15 (16.7%) showed IgG positivity for M. pneumoniae. For L. pneumophila, three samples (3.3%) tested positive for IgM, and 12 (13.3%) tested positive for IgG antibodies. The study findings indicate the presence of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in our geographical region, and a combination of laboratory approaches including PCR, culture, and serology is required for effective detection of these agents.

AB  - Extra Corporeal irradiation and Reimplantation Therapy (ECRT) is an established biological reconstruction technique of limb salvage surgery for malignant bone tumor. Several studies have focused on clinical outcome of the procedure, but biomechanical changes post ECRT procedure are not well established. The present study investigates changes in strength, deformation, and composition of cortical bone obtained post en block resection from five patients suffering from ECRT, and the results are verified against age-match control specimen from cadaver. For pre-irradiated sample, average indentation modulus varied from 11.1 GPa to 15.8 GPa, and hardness from 0.36 GPa to 0.48 GPa. Post 50 Gy irradiation, we observed an overall increase in deformation, viscous response, and energy dissipation across all samples, together with reduction in indentation modulus and hardness. These changes in strength and deformation were found to be consistent with compositional investigations via Raman spectroscopy, where mineralization and amount of calcium content was found to be decreased. The study thus quantifies the effect of extra corporeal irradiation on bone mechanical and compositional response, which in turn can provide clinicians much needed insight into the mechanism of bone healing and repair post ECRT to guide follow-up care and recovery.

AB  - 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis (GD) constitutes a rare group of disorders characterized by the presence of dysfunctional testes in genotypic males. The molecular etiology is not known in about 2 thirds of instances. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic cause in patients with 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis. Based on clinical, cytogenetic, and biochemical screening, 10 patients with 46, XY GD were recruited. Direct sequencing of SRY, NR5A1, SOX9, DAX1, DHH, DMRT1 genes was carried out for molecular analysis. Among 10 patients, 5 were diagnosed with complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD), 3 with partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD), and 3 with testicular agenesis. Molecular analysis revealed 12 heterozygous genetic changes, 4 of which were novel. One (c.416T > A) was observed in evolutionary conserved region of DMRT1 gene in a patient with CGD and was found to be probably damaging on in silico analysis. Other 3 were identified in NR5A1 gene (c.990 + 22 C > A, c.1387 + 1403T > A and p.131P), but their association with gonadal dysgenesis is not evident from our study. These genetic changes were absent in parents and 50 healthy control samples, which were also studied. With targeted sequencing approach, a molecular diagnosis was made in only one patient with 46,XY GD. The application of new genomic technologies is required for the precise evaluation of these rare genetic defects.

AB  - Context: Bone mineral density (BMD) is increased in idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) deficiency, hypocalcemic seizures, and anticonvulsants could compromise skeletal health in IH.
   Objective: We assessed vertebral fractures (VFs) and related factors in IH and change in BMD during follow-up.
   Design: VFs were assessed by morphometry. BMD was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometery at the lumbar spine, hip, and forearm. Change in BMD was assessed in a subset after a 10-year follow-up.
   Setting: The endocrine clinic of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Subjects: Included were 104 patients with IH and 64 healthy controls. Hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, normal kidney function, and low serum PTH levels were used to diagnose IH.
   Results: VFs were seen in 18.3% of patients with IH and 4.7% of controls (odds ratio, 4.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 16.04). Use of anticonvulsants and menopausewere significantly associated (P < 0.05) with VF. Mean BMD at lumbar spine and hipwere higher by 21.4% and 8.6%, respectively, in IH than in controls (P < 0.001), respectively. BMD significantly increased during follow-up at all sites. Change in BMDcorrelatedwithmaintenance of the serum calcium/ phosphorus ratio during follow-up.
   Conclusions: Despite increased BMD, prevalence of vertebral-fractures is greater in patients with IH, especially in postmenopausal women and those on anticonvulsant therapy.

AB  - Recently, peeling of internal limiting membrane (ILM) has become one of the most common and effective surgical procedures for macular disorders. The authors discuss the adverse effects of such procedures and explore the possible functions of the membrane, We also suggest a barrier function of this membrane in addition to its possible other physiological roles. Thus, apart from the well-known inner and outer retinal barriers, ILM might be the third and innermost retinal barrier. The possible evidences supporting this hypothesis are presented.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a case of hypertension and retinitis pigmentosa presenting with a unilateral macular star. Methods: Case report. Results: A 17-year-old female with chronic kidney disease and hypertension presented with a mild blurring of vision in the left eye. There was a history of night blindness. Both eyes had optic disc pallor, arteriolar attenuation, and peripheral bony spicules suggestive of the triad of retinitis pigmentosa. Macular star was seen in the left eye alone. We ascribe the macular star to hypertension as the patient had only a mild decrease in vision, no relative afferent pupillary defect, and similar visual evoked response amplitude and latency in both eyes. Conclusion: Unilateral macular star may be seen in hypertension and may simulate neuroretinitis in the clinical setting.

AB  - Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a low molecular weight metabolite whose production is dependent on metabolism of its precursors choline, carnitine, creatinine, betaine or lecithin by host gut microbes resulting in the synthesis of trimethylamine (TMA), which is subsequently oxidized to TMAO via hepatic flavin monooxygenase (FMO). TMAO is associated with microbial dysbiosis and is being studied for its linkage with cardiovascular disorders. In addition, dysregulated levels of TMAO have been linked with renal diseases, neurological disorders and cancer. Here we discuss the enzymatic and metabolic landscape that results in TMAO production, and in addition, collate data from numerous clinical studies that have assessed TMAO as a biomarker for various disease conditions. We also summarize the interaction of TMAO with modern and traditional drugs that together affect circulating TMAO levels in the human body.

AB  - Muller Stem cells to treat ocular diseases has triggered enthusiasm across all medical and scientific communities. Recent development in the field of stem cells has widened the prospects of applying cell based therapies to regenerate ocular tissues that have been irreversibly damaged by disease or injury. Ocular tissues such as the lens and the retina are now known to possess cell having remarkable regenerative abilities. Recent studies have shown that the Muller glia, a cell found in all vertebrate retinas, is the primary source of new neurons, and therefore are considered as the cellular basis for retinal regeneration in mammalian retinas. Here, we review the current status of retinal regeneration of the human eye by Muller stem cells. This review elucidates the current status of retinal regeneration by Muller stem cells, along with major retinal degenerative diseases where these stem cells play regenerative role in retinal repair and replacement.

AB  - Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to establish 'Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network' in India and to monitor the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of clinical isolates to establish a national network across the country for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, nodal centre with clinical isolates of Salmonellae collected from four centres across India, which included Christian Medical College, Vellore; Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry. Total 20% of the selected strains from each centre were characterised for molecular studies which included molecular mechanism of fluoroquinolones resistance and multiple locus sequence type. Results: A total of 622 Salmonellae were received from all centres during January 2014 to December 2015. Out of these 622 isolates, 380 were Salmonella Typhi, 162 were Salmonella Paratyphi A and 7 were S. Paratyphi B isolated from blood and 73 were other Salmonella serotypes. Multiple drug resistance (resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole) was less than 3% in S. Typhi. In S. Paratyphi A, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole susceptibility was 100% and 99%, respectively, whereas ampicillin susceptibility was 86% (139/161). Ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid susceptibility was 15% (24/162) and 1% (2/162) from all centres. S. Paratyphi B was isolated from 7 patients. All isolates were third-generation cephalosporin sensitive. The most common mutations found were at codon 83 and at codon 87. We did not find any mutation in acrR gene. Efflux pump and qnr genes were not found in any isolate tested. All 86 S. Typhi isolates clustered into two sequence types -ST1 and ST2. Out of these 86 isolates, 70 S. Typhi were ST1 and 16 were ST2. All S. Paratyphi A was clustered in ST85 and ST129 on the basis of mutation in sucA gene. Out of 27 S. Paratyphi A, 13 were grouped into ST85 and 14 were grouped into ST129. Conclusions: Enteric fever is one such infection which poses challenges in antimicrobial resistance. Hence, continuous surveillance is important to track bacterial resistance and to treat infections in a cost-effective manner.

AB  - Pseudoaneurysmogastric fistula is a rare consequence of pseudoaneurysms occurring in the vicinity of stomach. They are the result of pseudoaneurysms eroding into the stomach, and represent a life threatening emergency. Urgent surgical intervention is often necessary to salvage the patient. Data regarding the presentation and management of this condition is sparse. Herein, we present our experience with four cases of pseudoaneurysmogastric fistula, their clinical context, presentation, management and outcomes. We attempt to outline an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of this unusual complication.

AB  - Background: Reports about regulations and laws on Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide (PAS) are becoming increasingly common in the media. Many groups have expressed opposition to euthanasia and PAS while those in favor argue that severely chronically ill and debilitated patients have a right to control the timing and manner of their death. Others argue that both PAS and euthanasia are ethically legitimate in rare and exceptional cases. Given that these discussions as well as the new and proposed laws and regulations may have a powerful impact on patients, caregivers, and health care providers, the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC) has prepared this statement.
   Purpose: To describe the position of the IAHPC regarding Euthanasia and PAS.
   Method: The IAHPC formed a working group (WG) of seven board members and two staff officers who volunteered to participate in this process. An online search was performed using the terms "position statement'', "euthanasia'' "assisted suicide'' "PAS'' to identify existing position statements from health professional organizations. Only statements from national or pan-national associations were included. Statements from seven general medical and nursing associations and statements from seven palliative care organizations were identified. A working document including a summary of the different position statements was prepared and based on these, an initial draft was prepared. Online discussions among the members of the WG took place for a period of three months. The differences were reconciled by email discussions. The resulting draft was shared with the full board. Additional comments and suggestions were incorporated. This document represents the final version approved by the IAHPC Board of Directors.
   Result: IAHPC believes that no country or state should consider the legalization of euthanasia or PAS until it ensures universal access to palliative care services and to appropriate medications, including opioids for pain and dyspnea.
   Conclusion: In countries and states where euthanasia and/or PAS are legal, IAHPC agrees that palliative care units should not be responsible for overseeing or administering these practices. The law or policies should include provisions so that any health professional who objects must be allowed to deny participating.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is insult to the spinal cord, which results in loss of sensory and motor function below the level of injury. SCI results in both immediate mechanical damage and secondary tissue degeneration. Following traumatic insult, activated microglia release proinflammatory cytokines and excess iron due to hemorrhage, initiating oxidative stress that contributes to secondary degeneration. Literature suggests that benefits are visible with the reduction in concentration of iron and activated microglia in SCI. Magnetic field attenuates oxidative stress and promotes axonal regeneration in vitro and in vivo. The present study demonstrates the potential of extremely low frequency magnetic field to attenuate microglia-and iron-induced secondary injury in SCI rats. Complete transection of the spinal cord (T13 level) was performed in male Wistar rats and subsequently exposed to magnetic field (50 Hz, 17.96 mu T) for 2 h daily for 8 weeks. At the end of the study period, spinal cords were dissected to quantify microglia, macrophage, iron content and study the architecture of lesion site. A significant improvement in locomotion was observed in rats of the SCI + MF group as compared to those in the SCI group. Histology, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry revealed significant reduction in lesion volume, microglia, macrophage, collagen tissue and iron content, whereas, a significantly higher vascular endothelial growth factor expression around the epicenter of the lesion in SCI + MF group as compared to SCI group. These novel findings suggest that exposure to ELF-MF reduces lesion volume, inflammation and iron content in addition to facilitation of angiogenesis following SCI.

AB  - Introduction: Hippocampus undergoes atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Calculation of hippocampal volumes can be done by a variety of methods using T1-weighted images of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Medial temporal lobes atrophy (MTL) can be rated visually using T1-weighted MRI brain images. The present study was done to see if any correlation existed between hippocampal volumes and visual rating scores of the MTL using Scheltens Visual Rating Method. Materials and Methods: We screened 84 subjects presented to the Department of Neurology of a Tertiary Care Hospital and enrolled forty subjects meeting the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, AD related Disease Association criteria. Selected patients underwent MRI brain and T1-weighted images in a plane perpendicular to long axis of hippocampus were obtained. Hippocampal volumes were calculated manually using a standard protocol. The calculated hippocampal volumes were correlated with Scheltens Visual Rating Method for Rating MTL. A total of 32 cognitively normal age-matched subjects were selected to see the same correlation in the healthy subjects as well. Sensitivity and specificity of both methods was calculated and compared. Results: There was an insignificant correlation between the hippocampal volumes and MTL rating scores in cognitively normal elderly (n = 32; Pearson Correlation coefficient = 0.16, P 0.05). In the AD Group, there was a moderately strong correlation between measured hippocampal volumes and MTL Rating (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.54;P< 0.05. There was a moderately strong correlation between hippocampal volume and Mini-Mental Status Examination in the AD group. Manual delineation was superior compared to the visual method (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Good correlation was present between manual hippocampal volume measurements and MTL scores. Sensitivity and specificity of manual measurement of hippocampus was higher compared to visual rating scores for MTL in patients with AD.

AB  - Purpose: To study the clinical profile of children aged <10 years presenting with epiphora at a tertiary eye care center, to compare the clinical profile between the early onset (< 3 years) and the late-onset (>= 3 years) group, and to study the success of different treatment modalities. Materials and Methods: A prospective nonrandomized observational study was conducted in 209 eyes of 167 patients (42 bilateral cases). The main outcome measure was postoperative relief of presenting symptoms and signs at 3 months follow-up. Results: Fifty-five percent cases (92 of 167) were early-onset cases, and 45% (75 of 167) were late onset. The male: female ratio was 1.9:1. Seventy-five percent cases were unilateral. The etiological profile was -76% cases of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), 18% traumatic/surgical, 4% acquired NLDO, and 2% punctal causes. The overall success rate of all the treatment modalities in our study was 80% (167/208) - 82% for sac massage, 77% for probing, 79% for intubation dacryocystorhinostomy, and 100% for punctal surgery. A significant association was noted between the treatment outcome and laterality (P = 0.04), presence of infection (P = 0.032), symptom severity (P = 0.027), history of previous treatment (P = 0.024), and age. No significant association was found between the treatment outcome and gender (P = 0.73), socioeconomic status (P = 0.43), etiology (P = 0.45), and treatment modality (P=0.33).Conclusion: This study describes the complete range of causes and treatment modalities for pediatric epiphora and highlights the etiology, signs and symptoms, treatment, and the comparative outcome between the early versus the late-onset group and analyses the factors predictive of the outcome.

AB  - In the present analysis, we aim at probing into many important mechanisms that serve to bridge conceptual gaps to fill up the mosaic of a picture revealing that glaucoma indeed is brain specific diabetes and more appropriately "Diabetes Type 4". Based on this conceptual substance, we weave a novel idea of insulin being a potential remedy for glaucoma. This analysis synthesizes upon the published literature on brain changes in glaucoma, possibility of isolated brain diabetes, insulin signaling glitches in glaucoma pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in glaucomatous eyes, insulin mediated regulation of intraocular pressure and its dysregulation in mitochondrial dysfunction. We also look into the role of amyloidopathy and taupathy in glaucoma pathogenesis vis-a-vis insulin signaling. At every step, the discussion reveals that insulin and other allied moieties are a sure promise for glaucoma treatment and management. In this article, we aim at synthesizing a persuasive and all inclusive picture of glaucoma etiopathomechanism centered on "insulin-hypofunctionality" in the central nervous system (i.e. brain specific diabetes). We start with considering the possibility of neurodegenerative diabetes that exists independent of the peripheral diabetes. Once that condition is met, then a metabolic conglomeration of this brain specific diabetes is deliberated upon leading us to understand the development of retinal ganglion cell apoptosis, intraocular pressure elevation, optic cupping and mitochondrial dysfunction. All these are the hallmarks and sufficient conditions to satisfy the diagnostic criteria for glaucoma. Immediate application of this analysis points towards glaucoma therapy centered upon improving what we have termed insulin-hypofunctionality.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: It remains unclear whether cervical laminoplasty (LP) offers advantages over cervical laminectomy and fusion (LF) in patients undergoing posterior decompression for degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to compare outcomes of LP and LF.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a multicenter international prospective cohort study.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 266 surgically treated symptomatic DCM patients undergoing cervical decompression using LP (N=100) or LF (N=166) were included.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (mJOA), Nurick grade, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Short-Form 36v2 (SF36v2), length of hospital stay, length of stay in the intensive care unit, treatment complications, and reoperations. METHODS: Differences in outcomes between the LP and LF groups were analyzed by analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. The dependent variable in all analyseswas the change score between baseline and 24-month follow-up, and the independent variable was surgical procedure (LP or LF). In the analysis of covariance, outcomes were compared between cohorts while adjusting for gender, age, smoking, number of operative levels, duration of symptoms, geographic region, and baseline scores.
   RESULTS: There were no differences in age, gender, smoking status, number of operated levels, and baseline Nurick, NDI, and SF36v2 scores between the LP and LF groups. Preoperative mJOA was lower in the LP compared with the LF group (11.52 +/- 2.77 and 12.30 +/- 2.85, respectively, p=.0297). Patients in both groups showed significant improvements in mJOA, Nurick grade, NDI, and SF36v2 physical and mental health component scores 24 months after surgery (p<.0001). At 24 months, mJOA scores improved by 3.49 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.84, 4.13) in the LP group compared with 2.39 (95% CI: 1.91, 2.86) in the LF group (p=.0069). Nurick grades improved by 1.57 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.90) in the LP group and 1.18 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.44) in the LF group (p=.0770). There were no differences between the groups with respect to NDI and SF36v2 outcomes. After adjustment for preoperative characteristics, surgical factors and geographic region, the differences in mJOA between surgical groups were no longer significant. The rate of treatment-related complications in the LF group was 28.31% compared with 21.00% in the LP group (p=. 1079).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both LP and LF are effective at improving clinical disease severity, functional status, and quality of life in patients with DCM. In an unadjusted analysis, patients treated with LP achieved greater improvements on the mJOA at 24-month follow-up than those who received LF; however, these differences were insignificant following adjustment for relevant confounders.

AB  - The Vitiligo Global Issues Consensus Conference ( VGICC), through an international e-Delphi consensus, concluded that ` repigmentation' and ` maintenance of gained repigmentation' are essential core outcome measures in future vitiligo trials. This VGICC position paper addresses these core topics in two sections and includes an atlas depicting vitiligo repigmentation patterns and color match. The first section delineates mechanisms and characteristics of vitiligo repigmentation, and the second section summarizes the outcomes of international meeting discussions and two e- surveys on vitiligo repigmentation, which had been carried out over 3 yr. Treatment is defined as successful if repigmentation exceeds 80% and at least 80% of the gained repigmentation is maintained for over 6 months. No agreement was found on the best outcome measure for assessing target or global repigmentation, therefore highlighting the limitations of e- surveys in addressing clinical measurements. Until there is a clear consensus, existing tools should be selected according to the specific needs of each study. A workshop will be conducted to address the remaining issues so as to achieve a consensus.

AB  - Objective: Arachnoid cysts are discrete pockets of CSF or CSF-like fluid found adjacent to normal CSF spaces, either spinal or cranial. Spinal arachnoid cysts (SAC) are most commonly extradural, however intradural or perineural are also described.
   Methods: All patients admitted to our center and surgically treated with a diagnosis of SAC, were included in the study. The results were analyzed in terms of the clinical symptoms, location of cyst, surgical procedure performed and outcome following surgery.
   Results: Eleven patients were operated for SAC during the study period and the mean age at surgery was 32.920.8 years. Male to female ratio was 2.7:1 in our series. Common presenting complaints were lower limb weakness and pain. The median duration of symptoms before surgery was nine months (mean 21 +/- 28 months). Ten patients had extradural cysts while one had intradural cyst. Extradural cysts were managed by laminoplasty and excision of the cyst, except for one patient in whom the SAC extended from C3 to L2 and marsupialization of the cyst was done. The only patient with intradural cyst underwent cyst fenestration. One patient had two communications and both were closed. In our series, at the time of last follow up two patients became completely free of symptoms, while other five reported substantial improvement in their symptoms. Operative complications were noted in two patients.
   Conclusion: Formation and expansion of SAC is not completely understood. Myelography, CT myelography and cinematic MRI can demonstrate the location of the communication site between the spinal subarachnoid space and the cyst cavity. The usual management of SAC is excision of the cyst with closure of the dural defect in extradural cysts, while in case of intradural cysts, especially the ones located anterior to the cord, fenestration of the cyst is usually performed.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested an important role of T helper 17 (Th17) cells in tumor biology however, their phenotypic and functional aspects are poorly understood in context with oral cancer. We therefore, investigated the various phenotypic and functional markers of Th17 cells elucidating their relevance in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Multi-color flow cytometry (FACs) was used to analyze the frequency and different markers of circulating Th17 cells ex vivo in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) from 69 OSCC patients and 35 healthy controls. Percent Mean +/- SEM of different types of cells were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test. We found significantly (p < 0.0001) increased frequency of Th17 cells in patients as compared to controls. These cells were found to express CCR6 profoundly but not CXCR4, CD62L, and CCR7 as chemokine receptors. Additionally, it expressed HLA-DR, CD69, and CD25 moderately but CD28 and CD161 highly. The cytokine profiling revealed 3 subsets namely Th17/1 (IL17A(+)IFN(+)), Th17/inflammatory (IL17A(+)IL8(+)), and Th17/2 (IL17A(+)IL4(+)) which were found to be elevated in patients as compared to controls. The early stage patients had a shift toward Th17/1 type and vice versa. Our results suggest that Th17 cells may have effector immune functions in oral cancer immunity through CCR6, CD161, HLA-DR, CD69, CD28 receptors and inducing Th17/1 type of cells expressing polyfunctional antitumor IFN cytokine. Thus, novel immune-boosting regimens based on enhancement of Th17 cells in oral cancer patients may provide therapeutic benefits in them.

AB  - With the growing popularity of propofol mediated deep sedation for upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures, challenges are being felt and appreciated. Research suggests that management of the airway is anything but routine in this setting. Although many studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the safety of propofol sedation administered by registered nurses under the supervision of gastroenterologists (likely related to the lighter degrees of sedation than those provided by anesthesia providers and is under medicolegal controversy in the United States), there is no agreement on the optimum airway management for procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Failure to rescue an airway at an appropriate time has led to disastrous consequences. Inability to evaluate and appreciate the risk factors for aspiration can ruin the day for both the patient and the health care providers. This review apprises the reader of various aspects of airway management relevant to the practice of sedation during upper GI endoscopy. New devices and modification of existing devices are discussed in detail. Recognizing the fact that appropriate monitoring is important for timely recognition and management of potential airway disasters, these issues are explored thoroughly.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is the commonest primary malignant bone tumor. Since bones lack a lymphatic system, metastatic spread in these tumors is exclusively hematogenous, the commonest sites being lungs and bone. We report a case of osteosarcoma humerus which recurred locally after primary therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and limb salvage surgery, who developed calcified liver metastases in addition to local and pulmonary relapse. Liver, though a common site of hematogenous spread in most solid tumors, has rarely been reported to be involved in metastatic osteosarcomas.

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the orientation of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images on the precision and reliability of 3-dimensional cephalometric landmark identification. Methods: Ten CBCT scans were used for manual landmark identification. Volume-rendered images were oriented by aligning the Frankfort horizontal and transorbital planes horizontally, and the midsagittal plane vertically. A total of 20 CBCT images (10 as-received and 10 oriented) were anonymized, and 3 random sets were generated for manual landmark plotting by 3 expert orthodontists. Twenty-five landmarks were identified for plotting on each anonymized image independently. Hence, a total of 60 images were marked by the orthodontists. After landmark plotting, the randomized samples were decoded and regrouped into as-received and oriented data sets for analysis and comparison. Means and standard deviations of the x-, y-, and z-axis coordinates were calculated for each landmark to measure the central tendency. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze the interobserver reliability of landmark plotting in the 3 axes in both situations. Paired t tests were applied on the mean Euclidean distance computed separately for each landmark to evaluate the effect of 3-dimensional image orientation. Results: Interobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, >0.9) was excellent for all 25 landmarks for the x-, y-, and z-axes on both before and after orientation of the images. Paired t test results showed insignificant differences for the orientation of volume-rendered images for all landmarks except 3: R1 left (P = 0.0138), sella (P = 0.0490), and frontozygomatic left (P = 0.0493). Also midline structures such as Bolton and nasion were plotted more consistently or precisely than bilateral structures. Conclusions: Orientation of the CBCT image does not enhance the precision of landmark plotting if each landmark is defined properly on multiplanar reconstruction slices and rendered images, and the clinician has sufficient training. The consistency of landmark identification is influenced by their anatomic locations on the midline, bilateral, and curved structures.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among patients with stroke and to examine the anatomical correlation between location of stroke and RLS symptoms.
   Methods: We administered a pre-structured sleep questionnaire to consecutive stroke patients seen in our neurology services department over a 3-year period. Unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 15) or aphasic, renally impaired, or neuropathic patients were excluded. Diagnosis of RLS was established according to the criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG), and polysomnography was conducted.
   Results: Of 346 stroke patients, 35 (10.11%) fulfilled IRLSSG diagnostic criteria for RLS, which had existed for an average (+/- standard deviation) of 60 +/- 40 months before stroke. The mean age of onset was 52.94 (+/- 10.32) years. Twenty-four patients (68%) had RLS symptoms contralateral to the hemisphere involved in the stroke (eight with unilateral and 16 with grossly asymmetrical RLS). Twenty-nine of 35 patients (82.86%) had imaging evidence of subcortical (16 with hemorrhagic and 13 with ischemic) stroke. Patients with pre-stroke RLS differed from those without it only by subcortical location of the stroke (82.9% vs 31.5% respectively, p<0.001).The most significant differentiating factor between patients with subcortical stroke and those with cortical stroke was pre-stroke RLS (22.83% vs 2.74%, p< 0.001), the others being history of hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke type.
   Conclusion: RLS, especially unilateral or asymmetrical, might frequently pre-exist in patients presenting with subcortical stroke. The common laterality may suggest an important predictive value for RLS, and may form an important point for future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to detect mitochondrial dysfunction and ischaemia in severe traumatic brain injury and their relationship with outcome.Methods: Forty-one patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) who underwent decompressive craniectomy were prospectively monitored with intracerebral microdialysis catheters (MD). Variables related to energy metabolism were studied using microdialysis.Results: Twentysix patients (63.4%) had a good outcome in terms of Glasgow outcome score (GOS) at 6 months while the rest (15 patients) had poor GOS at 6 months. Mitochondrial dysfunction was defined as Lactate Pyruvate ratio (LP ratio) > 25 and pyruvate <70 while ischaemia was defined as LP ratio > 25 and pyruvate >70. The poor outcome group showed significantly higher proportion of mitochondrial dysfunction 65.9% vs. 55.9% (p<0.001) and ischemia 13.9% vs. 7.2% (p<0.001)Conclusions: After decompressive craniectomy in severe TBI, patients with higher incidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and ischaemia were more likely to have poorer outcome with ischaemia having a more profound effect.Abbreviations: Traumatic brain injury (TBI), microdialysis (MD), lactate pyruvate ratio (LP ratio), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), intracranial pressure (ICP), mitochondrial transition pore (MTP), non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT), traumatic axonal injury (TAI).

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) refers to therapies that aim to eliminate a patient's hematopoietic and immune system and replace it with his own (autologous) or someone else's (allogenic) system. The applications of this therapy are vast and growing, and include several malignant and benign diseases incurable by any other existing modalities. Pediatric patients constitute a minority of HSCT recipients with unique concerns. Despite substantial progress in the last two decades, limitations due to financial, infrastructural, manpower and research constraints act as barriers to fulfilling the large need for pediatric HSCT services in our country. Limited availability of unrelated donors and cord blood units is another constraint. Here in this oration, we discuss the current issues pertaining to pediatric HSCT in India and describe our experience with the same.

KW  - WOMEN

KW  - RISK
AB  - AimTo investigate the distribution of and risk factors for dysglycaemia (Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes) in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus in India.
   MethodsAll women (n = 989) from two obstetric units in New Delhi and Hyderabad with a history of gestational diabetes were invited to participate, of whom 366 (37%) agreed. Sociodemographic, medical and anthropometric data were collected and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test were carried out.
   ResultsWithin 5 years (median 14 months) of the pregnancy in which they were diagnosed with gestational diabetes, 263 (72%) women were dysglycaemic, including 119 (32%) and 144 (40%) with Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, respectively. A higher BMI [odds ratio 1.16 per 1-kg/m(2) greater BMI (95% CI 1.10, 1.28)], presence of acanthosis nigricans [odds ratio 3.10, 95% CI (1.64, 5.87)], postpartum screening interval [odds ratio 1.02 per 1 month greater screening interval 95% CI (1.01, 1.04)] and age [odds ratio 1.10 per 1-year older age 95% CI (1.04, 1.16)] had a higher likelihood of having dysglycaemia. The American Diabetes Association-recommended threshold HbA(1c) value of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.4 and 90.7%, respectively, for determining the presence of Type 2 diabetes postpartum.
   ConclusionThe high post-pregnancy conversion rates of gestational diabetes to diabetes reported in the present study reinforce the need for mandatory postpartum screening and identification of strategies for preventing progression to Type 2 diabetes. Use of the American Diabetes Association-recommended HbA(1c) threshold for diabetes may lead to significant under-diagnosis.
   What's new?
   This study provides new information pertaining to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes among Indian women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus. Within 5 years of a gestational diabetes pregnancy, 32% women have progressed to Type 2 diabetes. Another 40% have prediabetes. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes rose from < 25% within 2 years to almost 50% after 2-4 years' follow-up. The utility of HbA(1c) in postpartum screening has been evaluated for the first time from an Indian sample. HbA(1c) 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) had a sensitivity and specificity of 81 and 91%, respectively, for determining the presence of Type 2 diabetes postpartum. A detailed analysis of factors associated with increased risk of dysglycaemia is provided.

AB  - Influence of polymorphisms in the genes coding for imatinib transporters and metabolizing enzymes on cytogenetic relapse in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is not known. One hundred and four patients (52 cases with cytogenetic relapse and 52 controls without relapse) with chronic-phase CML on imatinib therapy and have completed 5 years of follow-up were enrolled. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped; C1236T, C3435T, G2677T/A in MDR1 gene and A6986G in CYP3A5 gene, using PCR-RFLP method and validated by direct gene sequencing. Imatinib trough levels were measured using LC-MS/MS. Patients with CC genotype for MDR1-C1236T polymorphism were at significantly higher risk for cytogenetic relapse [OR =4.382, 95% CI (1.145, 16.774), p = .022], while those with TT genotype for MDR1-C3435T polymorphism had significantly lower risk of relapse [OR = 0.309, 95% CI (0.134, 0.708), p = .005]. Imatinib trough levels were lower in patients with relapse compared to those without relapse (1551.4 +/- 1324.1 vs. 2154.2 +/- 1358.3 ng/mL; p = .041). MDR1-C3435T genotype [adjusted-OR: 0.266; 95% CI (0.111, 0.636); p = .003] and trough levels (p = .014) were independent predictors of relapse in multivariate analysis. To conclude, C1236T and C3435T polymorphisms in MDR1 gene and trough levels significantly influence the risk of cytogenetic relapse. MDR1-C3435T genotype might emerge as a potential biomarker to predict the risk of cytogenetic relapse in patients with CML.

AB  - Dehydroquinase (3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, DHQD, EC 4.2.1.10) catalyzes the conversion of dehydroquinate to dehydroshildmate. DHQD from Acinetobacter baumannii (AbDHQD) was cloned, expressed and purified to homogeneity. The binding studies showed that two compounds quinic acid and citrazinic acid bound to AbDHQD at micromolar concentrations. AbDHQD was crystallized using 30% PEG-3350, 50 mM tris-HCl and 1.0 M MgSO4 at pH 8.0. Crystals of AbDHQD were stabilized with 25% glycerol for data collection at 100 K. The X-ray intensity data were collected to 2.0 angstrom resolution. Crystals belonged to monoclinic space group P2(1) with cell dimensions, a = 82.3, b = 95.3, c = 132.3 angstrom and beta = 95.7. The structure was solved with molecular replacement method and refined to values of 0.200 and 0.232 for R-cryst and R-free factors. The structures of 12 crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetry unit were identical with r.m.s shifts for the C-alpha atoms ranging from 0.3 angstrom to 0.8 angstrom. They formed a dodecamer with four trimers arranged in a tetrahedral manner. The classical lid adopted an open conformation although a sulfate ion was observed in the substrate binding site. As a result of which, the compounds quinic acid and citrazinic acid could not bind to AbDHQD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) antibodies is considered as an economical screening method in lung adenocarcinomas. Automated Ventana D5F3-IHC is approved by US Food and Drug Administration for targeted therapy; however, the automated IHC apparatus are not widely used in most laboratories. We evaluated the performance of ALK IHC using the manual semiquantitative method to assess the concordance with Ventana ALK IHC assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested 156 cases of primary lung adenocarcinomas for ALK protein expression by D5F3-IHC. The intensity of cytoplasmic staining was classified as 0 or 1+/2+/3+ (weak/medium/strong). Binary score of positive and negative was used for Ventana assay. A comparison analysis and clinicopathological features were recorded. RESULTS: ALK IHC was positive in 25 (16.02%) cases, of which 18 were men and mostly nonsmokers. The mean age for all patients was 55 years, and for ALK IHC-positive cases was 48 years. Nine of 25 (36%) ALK IHC-positive cases showed signet ring cell and mucinous morphology. On comparison, all, but one, cases positive by manual method showed positive results by automated assay. IHC negative cases by manual method were negative by Ventana assay. CONCLUSION: Manual IHC is equally effective in the detection of ALK-rearranged cases as automated methods. It can be easily integrated as a screening method into routine practice thus reducing the cost of automated systems. However, equivocal cases should be tested by approved methods.

AB  - Studies related to vitamin D deficiency and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children have inconsistent findings. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in children with LRTI, and to evaluate the correlation between vitamin D levels and the incidence and severity of LRTI. A total of 12 studies enrolling 2279 participants were included in our analysis. Children with LRTI were found to have significantly lower mean vitamin D levels as compared to controls There was likewise a correlation between vitamin D levels and incidence and severity of LRTI. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate effect of vitamin D supplementation for LRTI.

AB  - Background-The scientific evidence base in support of population-wide salt reduction is strong, but current high-quality data about salt intake levels in India are mostly absent. This project sought to estimate daily salt consumption levels in selected communities of Delhi and Haryana in north India and Andhra Pradesh in south India.
   Methods and Results-In this study, 24-hour urine samples were collected using an age-and sex-stratified sampling strategy in rural, urban, and slum areas. Salt intake estimates were made for the overall population of each region and for major subgroups by weighting the survey data for the populations of Delhi and Haryana, and Andhra Pradesh. Complete 24-hour urine samples were available for 637 participants from Delhi and Haryana and 758 from Andhra Pradesh (65% and 68% response rates, respectively). Weighted mean population 24-hour urine excretion of salt was 8.59 g/day (95% CI 7.68-9.51) in Delhi and Haryana and 9.46 g/day (95% CI 9.069.85) in Andhra Pradesh (P= 0.097). Estimates inflated to account for the minimum likely nonurinary losses of sodium provided corresponding estimates of daily salt intake of 9.45 g/day (95% CI 8.45-10.46) and 10.41 g/day (95% CI 9.97-10.84), respectively.
   Conclusions-Salt consumption in India is high, with mean population intake well above the World Health Organization recommended maximum of 5 g/day. A national salt reduction program would likely avert much premature death and disability.

AB  - Introduction: Delay in initiation of tuberculosis (TB) treatment may have a tremendous impact on disease transmission, development of drug resistance, poor outcome and overall survival of TB patients. The delay can occur at various levels. Delay in initiation of treatment after diagnosis is mostly due to health system failure and has immense programmatic implications. It has not been studied extensively in the Indian setting.
   Methods: The authors did a cohort analysis of all TB patients initiated on treatment from two primary health centres (PHCs) at Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System between January 2007 and December 2014. Diagnosis and treatment of TB in the study area was done as per the protocol envisaged in the national program. Information related to demography, details of diagnosis and treatment of TB and outcome of treatment were extracted from the TB register. Delay in initiation of treatment after diagnosis was considered if the gap between diagnosis and treatment was greater than 7 days. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to find the association of various factors with delay in initiation of treatment after diagnosis.
   Results: Out of 885 patients, 662 patients started treatment for pulmonary TB. Mean time interval between diagnosis and initiation of treatment was 8.95 days. Only 57.7% of pulmonary TB patients were started on treatment within 7 days of diagnosis, and an additional 24.5% were started on treatment 8-14 days after diagnosis. Patients on retreatment regimens and those residing in villages without a PHC were more likely to have delayed initiation of treatment (odds ratio (OR)=1.82 (1.3-2.7, p=0.001) and OR=1.62 (1.1-2.5, p=0.01) respectively). Delay in initiation of treatment was also associated with unfavourable treatment outcome such as default, failure or death.
   Conclusions: There is a need to have healthcare changes related to TB care to enable initiation of treatment as early as possible. Pretreatment counselling especially for retreatment patients is of utmost importance.

AB  - Background: Glioblastoma has been reckoned as the prime cause of death due to brain tumours, being the most invasive and lethal. Available treatment options, i.e. surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapies are not effective in improving prognosis, so an alternate therapy is insistent. Plant based drugs are efficient due to their synergistic action, multi-targeted approach and least side effects.
   Methods: The anti-tumorous potential of Nardostachys jatamansi rhizome extract (NJRE) on U87 MG cell line was evaluated through various in vitro and in silico bio-analytical tools.
   Results: NJRE had a strong anti-proliferative effect on U87 MG cells, Its IC50 was 33.73 +/- 3.5, 30.59 +/- 3.4 and 28.39 +/- 2.9 mu g/mL, respectively after 24, 48 and 72 h. NJRE at 30 mu g/mL induced DNA fragmentation, indicating apoptosis, early apoptosis began in the cells at 20 mu g/mL, whereas higher doses exhibited late apoptosis as revealed by dual fluorescence staining. NJRE at 60 and 80 mu g/mL caused a G(0)/G(1) arrest and at 20 and 40 mu g/mL showed excessive nucleation and mitotic catastrophe in the cells. Immuno-blotting validated the apoptotic mode of cell death through intrinsic pathway. NJRE was harmless to normal cells. In silico docking of NJRE marker compounds: oroselol, jatamansinol, nardostachysin, jatamansinone and nardosinone have revealed their synergistic and multi-targeted interactions with Vestigial endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), Cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
   Conclusion: A strong dose specific and time dependent anti-tumorous potential of NJRE on U87 MG cells was seen. The extract can be used for the development of safe and multi-targeted therapy to manage glioblastoma, which has not been reported earlier.

TI  - Appropriateness-based reimbursement of elective invasive coronary procedures in low- and middle-income countries: Preliminary assessment of feasibility in India
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Elective coronary interventional procedures are often overused and sometimes inappropriately used. The incentives for overuse are greater in low- and middle-income countries, where much of healthcare is provided by poorly regulated, fee-for-service systems. Overuse and inappropriate use increase healthcare costs and are potentially harmful to patients. Linking appropriate use of elective procedures to their reimbursement might deter overuse.
   Methods. We explored the feasibility of introducing appropriateness criteria as a precondition to settling reimbursement claims in a publicly funded health insurance scheme in Maharashtra, India. Clinical algorithms were developed from the current best-practice criteria and used to determine appropriateness at the time of obtaining pre-authorization for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. The number of PCIs as a proportion of the total number of procedures reimbursed under the scheme was the primary outcome measure. This proportion was compared for 1-year periods before and after implementation of appropriateness-based reimbursement, using the chi-square test. Comparisons were also made separately for public and private hospitals. The change in the proportion of CABG surgeries over the same time periods was used as a comparator (as they are less subject to inappropriate use).
   Results. The insurance scheme provided cover to a population of 20 424 585 (18.2% of the population of Maharashtra) in 8 districts, through 106 hospitals (73 private and 33 public). There was a 12.3% (95% CI 8.9%-15.5%, p = 0.0001) reduction in the proportion of PCIs performed in the 1-year period after the introduction of appropriateness-based reimbursement. The reduction was similar for public and private hospitals. There was no significant change in the proportion of CABG surgeries (2.3% v. 2.2%, p = 0.20). At current rates, use of appropriateness-based reimbursement would result in approximately 783 (95% CI 483-1099) less Pas with potential annual savings of about (sic)57 million (US$0.93 million; 95% CI 0.57-1.3) to the government scheme.
   Conclusions. It seems feasible to implement an appropriateness-based system for reimbursement of elective coronary interventional procedures in a government-funded health insurance scheme in a developing country. This potentially cost-saving approach may reduce inappropriate use.

AB  - The simultaneous occurrence of carcinoma of the cervix and pelvic kidney is rare. As the pelvic kidney occupies the conventional radiation portal for carcinoma of the cervix, treatment of these patients with radiation presents a therapeutic challenge. A 48-year-old stage IIIB cervical carcinoma patient with an incidental diagnosis of pelvic kidney was treated with radical chemoradiotherapy using intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent weekly cisplatin, followed by intracavitary radiotherapy. The bilateral kidney dose was restricted within a tolerance limit of 16.6 Gy. At the 18-month follow-up, the patient was disease free and had no deterioration in kidney function. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy provided the necessary means for delivering radical radiation doses in this case scenario with adequate sparing of the kidney.

AB  - Aim: Purpose of this study is to dosimetrically compare head and neck (H and N) cancer patients planned with multivendor volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technology. VMAT treatment planning can be done using biological (treatment planning system [TPSB]: Monaco) or physical (TPSP : Eclipse)-based cost function optimization techniques. Planning and dosimetric comparisons were done in both techniques for H and N cases.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty H and N patients were retrospectively selected for this study. VMAT plans were generated using TPSP (V11.0) and TPSB (V3.0) TPS. A total dose of 66 Gy (planning target volume 1 [PTV1]) and 60 Gy (PTV2) were prescribed to primary and nodal target volumes. Clinical planning objectives were achieved by both the optimization techniques. Dosimetric parameters were calculated for PTVs, and quantitative analyses were performed for critical organs. Monitor units were compared between two TPSs, and gamma analysis was performed between I'matriXX measured and TPS calculated.
   Results: Clinically, acceptable VMAT plans showed comparable dose distributions between TPSB and TPSP optimization techniques. Comparison of mean dose, homogeneity index, and conformity index for PTV1 showed no statistical difference (P-0.922, 0.096, and 0.097); however, in PTV2 statistically significant difference was observed (P-0.024, 0.008, and 0.002) between TPSB and TPSP. TPSB optimization showed statistically significant superiority for spinal cord and brainstem (D-1% P-0.0078, 0.00002) whereas improved parotid sparing was observed in TPSP optimization (mean dose P-0.00205). Gamma analysis illustrated that both systems could produce clinically deliverable plans.
   Conclusion: VMAT plans by TPSP and TPSB offered clinically acceptable dose distributions. TPSB-based optimization showed enhanced sparing of serial organs whereas TPSP -based optimization showed superior sparing of parallel organs.

AB  - Objectives: To identify the prevalence and correlates of bipolar I patients with a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Methods: Bipolar I disorder was diagnosed in 150 patients as per DSM-IV-TR criteria. Their lifetime suicide risk was assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. NIMH retrospective Life Chart Methodology was used to chart the illness course. Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess the recent adherence and subjective sleep quality, respectively. The suicide attempters were compared with non-attempters on individual variables.
   Results: Around 23% had a positive lifetime history of suicide attempt. They were predominantly female, had an index (first ever) episode of depression, spent more proportion of time being ill, especially in depressive or mixed episode phase. Comorbid substance use disorder along with suicidal attempts was seen only in males. Suicide attempters displayed poor medication adherence attitudes for medications taken during the past week and reported impaired sleep quality for the previous month.
   Conclusions: A positive history of lifetime suicide attempt was significantly associated with a worse course of bipolar I disorder. Effective treatment of depressive episodes, addressing non-adherence, substance use and sleep problems can reduce the suicide risk in such patients. Retrospective design of the study and recall bias are some of the limitations.

KW  - UPDATE
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the visual and anatomical outcomes of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) in patients with toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS).
   Methods: Fourteen eyes of 14 patients who underwent clear corneal DSAEK for endothelial decompensation secondary to TASS after phacoemulsification were included in this prospective study. Intraoperative surgical difficulties were noted. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation of visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, and endothelial count was performed in all cases.
   Results: The interval between onset of TASS and DSAEK was 9 +/- 3.8 months (range: 2-15 months). Intraoperative difficulties were encountered during Descemet membrane scoring, and a floppy iris with extensive pigment release was observed. The postoperative inflammatory response was more intense with the formation of a characteristic pigment ring at the host-graft junction. Secondary glaucoma developed in 57.1% (8/14) cases. All grafts were attached post-operatively. In 2 patients, DSAEK was undertaken within 3 months of occurrence of TASS. Both cases required a regraft with eventual graft failure. In the subsequent 12 cases, DSAEK was performed more than 3 months after TASS. All 12 grafts were clear with no episode of graft rejection, and the corrected visual acuity ranged from 6/18 to 6/9.
   Conclusions: Successful visual and anatomical outcomes are achieved with DSAEK in cases of chronic TASS. The time interval between TASS and DSAEK is a critical factor determining long-term success, and a minimum 3- to 6-month waiting period after TASS is essential for optimal outcomes. Preoperative and postoperative control of inflammation and intraocular pressure is necessary to enhance graft survival.

AB  - To study the association between serum vitamin D levels and levels of asthma control in children aged 5-15 years.
   Children with physician-diagnosed asthma who were under follow-up for at least 6 months were enrolled. Participants were categorized into three asthma control groups as per standard guidelines, and their serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and pulmonary function tests were compared.
   Out of 105 children with asthma enrolled in the study, 50 (47.6%) were controlled, 32 (30.5%) were partly controlled and 23 (21.9%) were uncontrolled. Median (IQR) serum vitamin D levels in these three groups were 9.0 (6.75, 15) ng/mL, 10 (6.25, 14.75) ng/mL and 8 (5, 10) ng/mL (P=0.24), respectively.
   We did not observe any association of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels with the level of control of childhood asthma.

AB  - Xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase have been implicated in producing myocardial damage following reperfusion of an occluded coronary artery. We investigated and compared the effect of febuxostat and allopurinol in an experimental model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury with a focus on the signaling pathways involved. Male Wistar rats were orally administered vehicle (CMC) once daily (sham and IR + control), febuxostat (10 mg/kg/day; FEB10 + IR), or allopurinol (100 mg/kg/day; ALL100 + IR) for 14 days. On the 15th day, the IR-control and treatment groups were subjected to one-stage left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation for 45 minutes followed by a 60-minute reperfusion. Febuxostat and allopurinol pretreatment significantly improved cardiac function and maintained morphological alterations. They also attenuated oxidative stress and apoptosis by suppressing the expression of proapoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-3), reducing TUNEL-positive cells, and increasing the level of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). The MAPK-based molecular mechanism revealed suppression of active JNK and p38 proteins concomitant with the rise in ERK1/ERK2, a prosurvival kinase. Additionally, a reduction in the level of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and NF-kappa B) was also observed. The changes observed with febuxostat were remarkable in comparison with those observed with allopurinol. Febuxostat protects relatively better against IR injury than allopurinol by suppressing inflammation and apoptosis mediating the MAPK/NF-kappa Bp65/TNF-alpha pathway.

AB  - AIM: Microscope may fail to detect culprit vessel at the root entry zone or distally, especially when the suprameatal tubercle is prominent and when the compressing vessel is lying anteriorly to the trigeminal nerve without using significant brain retraction. Endoscopic techniques allow better visualization of the nerve and vascular conflict.
   MATERIAL and METHODS: A retrospective study of 178 patients of endoscopic vascular decompression without the use of microscope was done. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 108 months (average 58 months).
   RESULTS: The age of the patients ranged from 32 to 75 years. Neuralgia was in the maxillary, mandibular and both (maxillary and mandibular) divisions in 89, 72 and 16 patients, respectively. Duration of the operation and hospital stay ranged from 85 to 160 minutes and 2 to 10 days (average 2.7 days), respectively. Offending vessels could be identified in 174 patients. The superior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, single vessel, double vessel conflicts and a vessel anterior to the nerve were seen in 136, 76, 133, 41 and 31 patients, respectively. The pain was relieved in 167 patients (93.8%). Temporary complications included trigeminal dysesthesias (3.9%), cerebrospinal fluid leak (2.8%), facial paresis (3.9%), decreased hearing (1.7%) and vertigo (3.3%). Permanent hearing loss, recurrence of pain and re-surgery was observed in 1, 7 and 3 patients, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Endoscopic vascular decompression is a safe and effective technique for vascular decompression with advantages of better visualization of the entire course of the nerve and vascular conflict without brain retraction. It also helps in better detection of the completeness of surgery.

TI  - Effect of balanced phacoemulsification tip on the outcomes of torsional phacoemulsification using an active-fluidics system
T2  - JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY
AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of torsional phacoemulsification with a new balanced tip (Intrepid) and a conventional tip (Kelman) using a single active-fluidics torsional phacoemulsification machine (Centurion).
   Setting: Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Design: Prospective comparative case-control study.
   Methods: Patients with senile cataract had torsional phacoemulsification with the Kelman conventional tip orthe new Intrepid balanced tip using the active-fluidics torsional machine. Intraoperative parameters, such as cumulative dissipated energy (CDE), total ultrasound (US) time, torsion use time, torsion amplitude, aspiration time, and fluid use, were noted and compared. Endothelial cell loss and central comeal thickness (COT) changes were evaluated at 1 month.
   Results: The new tip showed significantly less CDE, total US time, torsion amplitude, aspiration time, and fluid use (8.55 +/- 6.9 [SD], 33.59 +/- 28.12 seconds, 37.8 +/- 13.42, 173.19 +/- 47.26 seconds, and 66.59 +/- 20.44 mL, respectively) than the conventional tip (13.47 +/- 10.65, 42.8 +/- 33.46 seconds, 42.58 +/- 16.38, 202.25 +/- 71.28 seconds, and 97.14 +/- 36.86 mL, respectively) (P < .01), especially in higher grades of cataract. Anterior capsulorhexis margin tear occurred in 2 patients with the new tip. There were no comeal bums in either group. The mean endothelial cell loss and the percentage change in CCT were not significantly different at 1 month.
   Conclusions: The new balanced tip performed phacoemulsification more efficiently, especially in hard cataracts requiring higher energy and prolonged phacoemulsification time. (C) 2016 ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Most TKA prostheses are designed based on the anatomy of white patients. Individual studies have identified key anthropometric differences between the knees of the white population and other major ethnic groups, yet there is limited understanding of what these findings may indicate if analyzed collectively.
   What are the differences in morphologic features of the distal femur and proximal tibia among and within various ethnicities?
   A systematic review of the PubMed database and a hand-search of article bibliographies identified 235 potentially eligible English-language studies. Studies were excluded if they did not include morphology results or had insufficient data for analysis, were unrelated to the distal femur or proximal tibia, were conducted in pediatric patients or those undergoing unicondylar knee arthroplasty, or bone surface measurements were obtained for trauma products. This left 30 eligible studies (9050 knees). Study quality was assessed and reported as good, fair, or poor according to the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Morphometric data for the distal femur and proximal tibia were available for four ethnic groups: East Asian (23 studies; 5543 knees), white (11 studies; 3111 knees), Indian (three studies; 283 knees), and black (three studies; 113 knees). Although relatively underrepresented, the knees from the Indian and black studies were maintained for hypothesis-generating purposes and to highlight crucial gaps in the data. The two key dimensions for selecting a suitable implant based on a patient's unique anatomy-AP length and mediolateral (ML) width-were assessed for the femur and tibia, in addition to aspect ratio, calculated by dividing the ML width by the AP length. Study measurement techniques were compared visually when possible to ensure that each pooled study conducted a similar measurement process. Any significant measurement outliers were reviewed for eligibility to determine if the measurement techniques and landmarks used were comparable to the other studies included.
   White patients had larger femoral AP measurements than East Asians (62 mm, [95% CI, 57-66 mm] vs 59 mm, [95% CI, 54-63 mm]; mean difference, 3 mm; p < 0.001), a smaller femoral aspect ratio than East Asians (1.20, [95% CI, 1.11-1.29] vs 1.25, [95% CI, 1.16-1.34]; mean difference, 0.05; p = 0.001), and a larger tibial aspect ratio than black patients (1.55, [95% CI, 1.40-1.71] vs 1.49, [95% CI, 1.33-1.64]; mean difference, 0.06; p = 0.005).
   This analysis uncovered differences of size (AP height and ML width of the femur and tibia) and shape (tibial and femoral aspect ratios) among knees from white, East Asian, and black populations. Future research is needed to understand the clinical implications of these discrepancies and to provide additional data with underrepresented groups.

TI  - The World Health Organization Fetal Growth Charts: A Multinational Longitudinal Study of Ultrasound Biometric Measurements and Estimated Fetal Weight
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE

KW  - HEAD
AB  - Background
   Perinatal mortality and morbidity continue to be major global health challenges strongly associated with prematurity and reduced fetal growth, an issue of further interest given the mounting evidence that fetal growth in general is linked to degrees of risk of common non-communicable diseases in adulthood. Against this background, WHO made it a high priority to provide the present fetal growth charts for estimated fetal weight (EFW) and common ultrasound biometric measurements intended for worldwide use.
   Methods and Findings
   We conducted a multinational prospective observational longitudinal study of fetal growth in low-risk singleton pregnancies of women of high or middle socioeconomic status and without known environmental constraints on fetal growth. Centers in ten countries (Argentina, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Norway, and Thailand) recruited participants who had reliable information on last menstrual period and gestational age confirmed by crown-rump length measured at 8-13 wk of gestation. Participants had anthropometric and nutritional assessments and seven scheduled ultrasound examinations during pregnancy. Fifty-two participants withdrew consent, and 1,387 participated in the study.
   At study entry, median maternal age was 28 y (interquartile range [IQR] 25-31), median height was 162 cm (IQR 157-168), median weight was 61 kg (IQR 55-68), 58% of the women were nulliparous, and median daily caloric intake was 1,840 cal (IQR 1,487-2,222).
   The median pregnancy duration was 39 wk (IQR 38-40) although there were significant differences between countries, the largest difference being 12 d (95% CI 8-16). The median birthweight was 3,300 g (IQR 2,980-3,615). There were differences in birthweight between countries, e. g., India had significantly smaller neonates than the other countries, even after adjusting for gestational age. Thirty-one women had a miscarriage, and three fetuses had intrauterine death.
   The 8,203 sets of ultrasound measurements were scrutinized for outliers and leverage points, and those measurements taken at 14 to 40 wk were selected for analysis. A total of 7,924 sets of ultrasound measurements were analyzed by quantile regression to establish longitudinal reference intervals for fetal head circumference, biparietal diameter, humerus length, abdominal circumference, femur length and its ratio with head circumference and with biparietal diameter, and EFW. There was asymmetric distribution of growth of EFW: a slightly wider distribution among the lower percentiles during early weeks shifted to a notably expanded distribution of the higher percentiles in late pregnancy.
   Male fetuses were larger than female fetuses as measured by EFW, but the disparity was smaller in the lower quantiles of the distribution (3.5%) and larger in the upper quantiles (4.5%). Maternal age and maternal height were associated with a positive effect on EFW, particularly in the lower tail of the distribution, of the order of 2% to 3% for each additional 10 y of age of the mother and 1% to 2% for each additional 10 cm of height. Maternal weight was associated with a small positive effect on EFW, especially in the higher tail of the distribution, of the order of 1.0% to 1.5% for each additional 10 kg of bodyweight of the mother. Parous women had heavier fetuses than nulliparous women, with the disparity being greater in the lower quantiles of the distribution, of the order of 1% to 1.5%, and diminishing in the upper quantiles. There were also significant differences in growth of EFW between countries. In spite of the multinational nature of the study, sample size is a limiting factor for generalization of the charts.
   Conclusions
   This study provides WHO fetal growth charts for EFW and common ultrasound biometric measurements, and shows variation between different parts of the world.

AB  - Background: The increasing reports of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from many countries emphasize its importance for international travel. Muslim pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah involve mass gatherings of international travellers. We set out to assess the presence of influenza and MERS-CoV in Hajj/Umrah returnees with acute respiratory infection..
   Methods: Disembarking passengers (n = 8753) from Saudi Arabia (October 2014 to April 2015) were interviewed for the presence of respiratory symptoms; 977 (11%) reported symptoms and 300 (age 26-90, median 60 years; 140 male) consented to participate in the study. After recording clinical and demographic data, twin swabs (nasopharyngeal and throat) were collected from each participant, pooled in viral transport media and tested by real-time RT PCR for MERS-CoV and influenza A and B viruses and their subtypes.
   Results: The participants had symptoms of 1-15 days (median 5d); cough (90%) and nasal discharge (86%) being the commonest. None of the 300 participants tested positive for MERS-CoV; however, 33 (11%) tested positive for influenza viruses (A/H3N2 =13, A/H1N1pdm09 = 9 and B/Yamagata = 11). Eighteen patients received oseltamivir. No hospitalizations were needed and all had uneventful recovery.
   Conclusion: Despite a high prevalence of acute respiratory symptoms, MERS coV was not seen in returning pilgrims from Hajj and Umrah. However detection of flu emphasises preventive strategies like vaccination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for around 80-85% of total stroke and is a complex polygenic multi-factorial disorder which is affected by a complex combination of vascular, environmental, and genetic factors.
   Objective: The study was conducted with an aim to examine the relationship of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PDE4D (T83C, C87T, and C45T) gene with increasing risk of IS in patients in North Indian population.
   Methods: In this hospital-based case-control study, 250 IS subjects and 250 age-and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled from the Neurosciences Centre, A.I.I.M.S., New Delhi, India. Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) were extracted using the conventional Phenol-Chloroform isolation method. Different genotypes were determined by Polymerase chain reaction- Restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of relationship of polymorphisms with risk of IS were calculated by conditional multivariable regression analysis.
   Results: High blood pressure, low socioeconomic status, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and family history of stroke were observed to be statistically significant risk factors for IS. Multivariable adjusted analysis demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between SNP 83 of PDE4D gene polymorphism and increasing odds of IS under the dominant model of inheritance (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.50; p value=0.04) after adjustment of potential confounding variables. Stratified analysis on the basis of TOAST classification demonstrated a statistically significant association for increasing 2.73 times odds for developing large vessel disease stroke as compared to controls (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.16 to 0.02; p value=0.02). We did not find any significant association of SNPs (C87T and C45T) of the PDE4D gene with the risk of IS.
   Conclusion: SNP 83 of PDE4D gene may increase the risk for developing IS whereas SNP 87 and SNP45 of PDE4D may not be associated with the risk of IS in the North Indian population. Prospective cohort studies are required to corroborate these findings.

AB  - Previously published studies that have examined whether the three polymorphisms, G894T, T786C, and 4b/a in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene, are associated with ischemic stroke (IS) have reported conflicting results. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the potential association between these three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the eNOS gene and IS risk. A literature search was carried out for eligible candidate gene studies published before August 05, 2015 in the PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases. The following combinations of main keywords were used in our study: ('endothelial nitric oxide synthase') or ('eNOS') and ('G894T, 4b/a, and T786C') and ('polymorphism') or ('polymorphisms') and ('Ischemic Stroke' or 'IS') and ('Cerebral Infarction' or 'CI') and ('genetic polymorphism' or 'single nucleotide polymorphisms' or 'SNP'). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using fixed or random effects model. Meta-regression analysis was used to investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity. Begg's funnel plots were used to explore the publication bias, and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 test. Twenty seven case-control studies involving 6733 cases and 7305 controls were analyzed in our meta-analysis. Significant association was observed for G894T (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.41; P = 0.019) and 4b/a (OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.72; P = 0.04) whereas a non-significant association was observed for T786C (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.26; P = 0.109) eNOS gene polymorphisms and IS. Our meta-analysis establishes that the G894T and 4b/a polymorphisms of eNOS gene are significantly associated with the risk of IS. However, a non-significant association was found between T786C polymorphism of the eNOS gene and IS risk. Further prospective large epidemiological studies need to be done to confirm these findings.

AB  - The study represents synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation of redox responsive polymeric nanoparticles based on random multiblock copolymer for doxorubicin delivery in breast cancer. The random multiblock copolymer was synthesized via ring opening polymerization of lactide with polyethylene glycol to form triblock copolymer followed by isomerization polymerization of the triblock copolymer and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide with the help of hexamethylene diisocynate in presence of dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst. Folic acid was conjugated to hydroxyl group from the multiblock polymer through DCC-NHS coupling. High drug loading content of similar to 22% was achieved in the polymeric nanoparticles with size range of similar to 110 nm and polyethylene glycol fraction of similar to 18% in the multiblock copolymer. Drug release profile confirmed the redox responsive behavior of polymeric nanoparticles with similar to 72% drug release at pH 5.5 in presence of 10 mM GSH as compared to similar to 18% drug release at pH 7.4. In vitro cellular uptake studies showed similar to 22% cellular uptake with dual (folic acid and trastuzumab) conjugated polymeric nanoparticles as compared to non-targeted polymeric nanoparticles. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) studies demonstrated higher apoptosis (similar to 80%) as compared to non-conjugated polymeric nanoparticles (20%) in MCF-7 cell line. In vivo studies showed 91% tumor regression in Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) as compared to free doxorubicin treated mice without showing any significant toxicity. Thus, it is envisaged that these redox responsive polymeric nanocarriers act as Trojan horses in cancer therapeutics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context (Background): We report our experience with robotic thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and provide data on the surgical results and neurologic outcomes, as per the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) recommendations for MG clinical research standards.
   Objective: The study aims at reporting the surgical and neurological outcomes of patients of Myasthenia gravis treated by robotic thymectomy.
   Materials and Methods: Prospective data was collected from 71 patients with myasthenia gravis (in the age range 15-67 years) with or without thymoma, who had completed a minimum follow up of one year. All patients were treated with robotic radical thymectomy. The clinical classification, status of preoperative and postoperative therapy, evaluation of post-interventional clinical status, and descriptions of morbidity/mortality were done as per the MGFA recommendations. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to assess the factors associated with achievement of complete stable remission(CSR).
   Results: A total of 71 patients were included in this study. Twenty-one out of 71 patients (29.6%) with myasthenia gravis had thymoma. At the last follow up, 70 patients were alive. No evidence of tumour recurrence was found in patients with thymoma. The overall CSR rate was 38% with the median time to CSR of 17.5 months (range 11-48 months). The CSR rate for patient of MG with thymoma was 19 % (n-4/21). Factor found to be significantly predicting CSR were young age, lesser severity of MG and non-thymomatous histology.
   Conclusions: Robotic thymectomy is a technically feasible and safe operation with a low morbidity and short hospitalization. It is associated with good neurological long-term results in terms of both CSR and clinical improvement.

AB  - Background: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-1) is a multifunctional pleiotropic cytokine involved in inflammation and pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases. There is limited information on the association between variations within the TGF-1 gene polymorphisms and risk of ischemic stroke (IS). The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the TGF-1 gene (C509T, G800A, and T869C) polymorphisms, and their haplotypes with the risk of IS in North Indian population. Methods: A total of 250 IS patients and 250 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. IS was classified using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the strength of association between TGF-1 gene polymorphisms and risk of IS. Genotyping was performed using SNaPshot method. Results: Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, alcohol, smoking, family history of stroke, sedentary lifestyle, and low socioeconomic status were found to be associated with the risk of IS. The distribution of C509T, G800A and T869C genotypes was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium in the IS and control groups. Adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of TGF-1 C509T (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI; 1.2u3.8;P= 0.006), G800A (OR, 4.4; 95% CI; 2.1u9.3;P< 0.001) and T869C (OR, 2.6; 95% CI; 1.5u4.5;P= 0.001) with the risk of IS under dominant model. Haplotype analysis showed that C509-A800-T869 and T509-G800-C869 haplotypes were significantly associated with the increased risk of IS. C509T and T869C were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' =0.51, r(2) = 0.23). Conclusion: Our results suggest that TGF-1 polymorphisms and their haplotypes are significantly associated with the risk of IS in North Indian population.

AB  - Background: There is paucity of studies on etiology of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants. The objective of this study is to document incidence and etiology of ARI in infants, their seasonal variability and association of clinical profile with etiology.
   Methods: A birth cohort was followed for the first year of life; for each episode of ARI, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected to identify the causative respiratory virus(es) using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. For lower respiratory tract infections blood culture, serum procalcitonin, serum antibodies to Mycoplasma and Chlamydia and urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were also assayed.
   Results: A total of 503 ARI episodes were documented in 310 infants for an incidence rate of 1.8 episodes per infant per year. Of these, samples were processed in 395 episodes (upper respiratory tract infection: 377; lower respiratory tract infection: 18). One or more viruses were detected in 250 (63.3%) episodes and viral coinfections in 72 (18.2%) episodes. Rhinovirus was the most common virus [105 (42%)] followed by respiratory syncytial virus [50 (20%)], parainfluenza virus [42 (16.8%)] and coronavirus [44 (17.6%)]. In lower respiratory tract infections, viral infections were detected in 12 (66.7%) episodes, bacterial infections in 17 (94.4%) episodes and mixed bacterial-viral infections in 8 (44.4%) episodes. Peak incidence of viruses was observed during February-March and September-November. There was no significant difference in symptom duration with virus types.
   Conclusion: In this cohort of infants, ARI incidence was 1.8 episodes per year per infant; 95% were upper respiratory tract infections. Viruses were identified in 63.3% episodes, and the most common viruses detected were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this article was to share 10 years of operational experience of medical cyclotron and to provide working knowledge on the same. This experience has helped us gain working knowledge on cyclotron operation with practical points, which may help in improving F-18 yield, minimizing the breakdown time, and help in the prevention of the occurrence of unusual events.Materials and methodsOur facility has a self-shielded radioisotope delivery system eclipse 111 medical cyclotron with an 11MeV proton beam in use for the past 10 years to produce positron emitters - namely, F-18, N-13, and F-18-2 gas - for PET imaging. During F-18 production, we have followed a set protocol comprising the following: monitoring target pressure, rinsing the target with O-16 water just immediately after bombardment, ion source feedback, radiofrequency (RF) feedback, and recording any unusual events that occurred during the operation. Besides this, enrichment of O-18 water, target volume, target current, energy of the beam, variation in argon pressure on the target, bombardment duration, target status (new or old target or total number of previous bombardments on the same target), status of the delivery lines from target to the radiochemistry module (old or new) were also recorded.ResultsRinsing with O-16 water immediately after bombardment increases the life of the target and delivery line. The frequent problems encountered were with the ion source, RF, and target foil rupture. These problems were solved by rebuilding the ion source, changing the fuse of RF, and rebuilding the target.Conclusion(18)F yield can be increased by rinsing with O-16 water immediately after bombardment. The effect of target leak - that is, rupture of vacuum window - can be avoided by immediate stoppage of bombardment.

AB  - Traumatic insults to the spinal cord induce both immediate mechanical damage and subsequent tissue degeneration. The latter involves a range of events namely cellular disturbance, homeostatic imbalance, ionic and neurotransmitters derangement that ultimately result in loss of sensorimotor functions. The targets for improving function after spinal cord injury (SCI) are mainly directed toward limiting these secondary injury events. Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) is a possible non-invasive therapeutic intervention for SCI rehabilitation which has the potential to constrain the secondary injury-induced events. In the present review, we discuss the effects of ELF-EMF on experimental and clinical SCI as well as on biological system.

AB  - Glaucoma is a very common disorder of the eye wherein the disturbance of the structural or functional integrity of the optic nerve causes characteristic atrophic changes in the optic nerve, which may lead to specific visual field defects over time. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is most frequent among the three principle glaucoma subtypes. With well-established role of genes like Myocilin (MYOC), Optineurin (OPTN) and WD repeat Domain 36, (WDR36), at least 29 genetic loci have been found till date to be linked to POAG. Moreover, association studies have found 66 loci with 76 genes associated to POAG till date with conflicting results. This particular study is to summarize the current knowledge regarding the change in glaucoma prevalence worldwide and in India from 1993 onwards and compiles all the studied genes that are involved in POAG pathogenesis in Indian population.

AB  - BackgroundThe conventional fundus imaging covers up to 60 degrees of retina only. Although various montaging techniques can significantly increase the area that can be imaged, it is still difficult to image and document the peripheral retina. The purpose of this study is to describe the use of ultra-wide field imaging in the diagnosis and management of adult-onset Coats' disease.
   MethodsThis is a retrospective case series of three patients diagnosed with adult-onset Coats' disease that were treated at the retina clinic of our institute. The case records, conventional and ultra-wide field fluorescein angiograms and optical coherence tomography scans were reviewed.
   ResultsThe ultra-wide field pseudo-colour photographs and fluorescein angiograms were able to provide clinically useful information over and above that provided by conventional imaging. In all three patients, ultra-wide field angiography showed the temporal avascular periphery. In addition, it revealed retinal neovascularisation, peripheral vascular leakage and documented peripheral telangiectasia in selected patients.
   ConclusionUltra-wide field imaging provides information that can help in the diagnosis and management of adult-onset Coat's disease. This may lead to better visual outcomes in Coats' disease.

AB  - Human lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease, causing permanent and long-term disability with severe immunopathology. Abundant larval transcript (ALT) plays a crucial role in parasite establishment in the host, due to its multi-faceted ability in host immune regulation. Although ALT protein is a key filarial target, its exact function is yet to be explored. Here, we report epitope mapping and a structural model of Brugia malayi ALT-2, leading to development of a multi-epitope vaccine. Structural analysis revealed that ALT represents unique parasitic defence proteins belonging to a toxin family that carries a "knottin' fold. ALT-2 has been a favourite vaccine antigen and was protective in filarial models. Due to the immunological significance of ALT-2, we mapped B-cell epitopes systematically and identified two epitope clusters, 1-30 and 89-128. To explore the prophylactic potential of epitope clusters, a recombinant multi-epitopic gene comprising the epitopic domains was engineered and the protective efficacy of recombinant ALT epitope protein (AEP) was tested in the permissive model, Mastomys coucha. AEP elicited potent antibody responses with predominant IgG1 isotype and conferred significantly high protection (74.59%) compared to ALT-2 (61.95%). This proved that these epitopic domains are responsible for the protective efficacy of ALT-2 and engineering protective epitopes as a multi-epitope protein may be a novel vaccine strategy for complex parasitic infections.

AB  - Psilocybin is a naturally occurring alkaloid, pharmacologically similar to the classic hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although primarily used as a recreational drug or an entheogen in particular cultural settings, recent population based studies have shown that it does not lead to serious physical or mental health problems or dependent use. In view of recent work demonstrating psilocybin's potential to increase subjective sense of wellbeing and because of its novel mechanism of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonism, it is being explored for possible therapeutic utility in mood and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Adverse drug effects that are uncommon or appear only on chronic administration of a drug may not be detected in clinical trials. This explains the need of strict post-marketing vigilance on drug use. Phenytoin administration has been shown in the literature to be associated with development of neoplasia (benign/malignant). In our knowledge current work represents the first case of pleomorphic-adenoma of sub-mandibular salivary gland developed following chronic phenytoin use. A 40 year old male having a history of head trauma twenty years back, had been on tablet phenytoin 100 mg thrice daily since then. One year back he noticed a small swelling in left sub-mandibular region and gradually increasing in size. FNAC and CECT revealed the diagnosis of pleomorphic-adenoma of sub-mandibular salivary gland. Other causes were ruled out. Surgical excision was performed successfully and continuing follow-up with no recurrence at the end of 6 months. Histo-pathogical examination of the tissue did not show any malignant changes.

AB  - Context: Major histocompatibility complex class I allele HLA-A*26:01 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertype A01 (STA01) are increased in idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH). However, cellmediated autoimmune responses directed against the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) have not been demonstrated.
   Objective: To study CaSR-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of IH patients.
   Design: Twenty-four peptides of CaSR (RH1 to RH24) were evaluated for their ex vivo potential to stimulate PBMCs from IH patients and controls in interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays.
   Setting: Tertiary patient care center and National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India.
   Patients and Other Participants: Forty-five patients with IH attending the endocrine clinic of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and 22 healthy controls.
   Main Outcome Measures: Major histocompatibility complex class-I restricted, CaSR-specific cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell responses evaluated by IFN-g ELISPOT assay.
   Results: Of IH patients, 82.2% showed IFN-g-secreting cells when stimulated ex-vivo with CaSR peptides. Peptides RH7, RH9, and RH16 elicited HLA supertype A01-restricted responses in IH. RH8, RH14, RH15, RH20, and RH21 peptides induced significantly higher responses in STA01+ IH patients compared with healthy controls irrespective of their supertype A01 status.
   Conclusions: Our ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays demonstrate the presence of CaSR-specific memory CD8+ T cells in the peripheral circulation of patients with IH, suggesting the role of cell-mediated autoimmune responses in the etiopathogenesis of IH.

AB  - Aims: This study describes an immunoassay to detect anti-torque teno virus (TTV) antibodies using a peptide obtained from expression of the N22 region of TTV genotype 2. Methods: The N22 region (similar to 500 bp) of TTV genotype 2 was cloned in a pET-28a(+) vector and expressed in ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium. Following metal affinity chromatography, a purified polypeptide was used as an antigen for the development of an immunoassay to detect anti-TTV antibodies in human sera. Results: Recombinant protein (similar to 25-kDa) was obtained after 24 h of incubation at 25 degrees C in ZYM-5052 auto-induction medium. A blot assay developed using this polypeptide as an antigen and TTV-positive sera as the primary antibody produced a distinct spot on the nitrocellulose membrane. Serum samples from 36 of 42 patients with renal disease and 29 of 48 patients with liver diseases produced a positive signal using this immunoassay. Simultaneously, 18 of 48 healthy controls were also detected to be positive for anti-TTV antibodies. These results were found to be comparable with TTV detection using PCR, and the assay showed a high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., 97.44 and 91.67%, respectively). Moreover, this assay could detect TTV infection irrespectively of the genotype, including cases of mixed infection. Conclusion: The present immunoassay using the N22 expression product may be used as an alternative to PCR to detect TTV infection in large populations. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Various studies comparing operative and non-operative intervention for displaced intrarticular calcaneal fractures have reported conflicting findings in the past. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) vis-a-vis conservative management.
   Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing operative and non-operative intervention for displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures were assessed and included in this meta-analysis. Data was extracted independently and methodological quality was further assessed.
   The inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis were: randomized controlled trials comparing operative with non-operative intervention for displaced intraarticular fractures of calcaneum and reporting atleast one of the main outcomes as failure to resume preinjury work, residual pain and other complications. Eight randomized controlled trials fulfilled the criteria for this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that patients managed conservatively failed to resume pre-injury work (RR 0.60, 95% CI = 0.37-0.98, P = 0.04). However operative intervention was associated with more complications (RR 1.74, 95% CI = 1.28 to 2.37, P = 0.0005). There was no statistically significant difference in residual pain (RR 0.73 95% CI = 0.401.36, P = 0.33) and reoperation (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.48-1.16, P = 0.20) between the two groups.
   Surgery can benefit patients with calcaneal fracture and increases their likelihood to resume preinjury work. However, the complication rates are significantly higher in the operative group. Since the included trials have used different scores to measure patient outcomes, hence little effective data could be pooled for the meta-analysis from these scores or scales.

AB  - Purpose: To compare graft outcomes following pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft fixation using patient's in situ autologous blood or standard fibrin glue-assisted conjunctival autograft adhesion.
   Methods: Outcomes of 23 consecutive eyes which underwent pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft with autologous in situ blood coagulum (group I) were compared with historical case controls (20 eyes) that had undergone fibrin glue-assisted conjunctival autograft (group II). Primary outcome measure was graft stability. Secondary outcome measure was severity of graft inflammation at day 1, day 7, 3 months, and 6 months.
   Results: The two groups were similar regarding age, gender, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error, tear function tests, and pterygium size. Mean surgical time was similar for the two groups (14.2 +/- 2.74 min, group I; 12.25 +/- 1.88 min, group II; P=0.1); with the mean difference in operative time being 1.95 min (95% CI, 0.48-3.42 min). Postoperatively, there was a statistically significant reduction in astigmatism and improvement in UCVA, BCVA, and spherical equivalent in all eyes. No difference was found in mean epithelial defect healing time, UCVA, BCVA, astigmatism, tear film break-up time, and Schirmer I and II at 6 months between the two groups. Initial graft stability was better for group II at 1 month (P=0.001) but was similar for both groups at 6 months. Median score of graft inflammation was significantly more for group II during the first week (P<0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
   Conclusion: Autologous blood may be used as an effective alternative with lesser postoperative inflammation in comparison to glue-assisted autograft fixation.

AB  - Posttraumatic stiff elbow is a frequent and disabling complication and poses serious challenges for its management. In this review forty studies were included to know about the magnitude of the problem, causes, pathology, prevention, and treatment of posttraumatic stiff elbow. These studies show that simple measures such as internal fixation, immobilization in extension, and early motion of elbow joint are the most important steps that can prevent elbow stiffness. It also supports conservative treatment in selected cases. There are no clear guidelines about the choice between the numerous procedures described in literature. However, this review article disproves two major beliefs-heterotopic ossification is a bad prognostic feature, and passive mobilization of elbow causes elbow stiffness.

AB  - Background: Dislocation of the patella can occur around its vertical as well as horizontal axis. However, near 180 degree rotation of the patella around its vertical axis within the intercondylar notch without its complete dislocation has never been previously reported to the best of our knowledge. We report one such neglected case along with its management.
   Methods: The patient underwent open reduction and de-rotation of patella with repair of the medial and lateral patellar retinacula. The orientation of the patellar tendon intra-operatively was used as a guide for the reduction manoeuvre required.
   Results: The patient had a good functional result at more than one year of follow-up.
   Conclusions: A skyline view of the knee in symptomatic patients with normal AP and lateral radiographs of the knee can be useful in diagnosing a rare intra-articular dislocation of the patella around its vertical axis. Neglected cases of such injuries can be easily treated with open reduction with the orientation of the patellar tendon guiding the manoeuvre to de-rotate the patella. Careful repair of lateral and medial retinacula in such cases is important in preventing future patellar instability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - UV-radiations are the invisible part of light spectra having a wavelength between visible rays and X-rays. Based on wavelength, UV rays are subdivided into UV-A (320-400 nm), UV-B (280-320 nm) and UV-C (200280 nm). Ultraviolet rays can have both harmful and beneficial effects. UV-C has the property of ionization thus acting as a strong mutagen, which can cause immune-mediated disease and cancer in adverse cases. Numbers of genetic factors have been identified in human involved in inducing skin cancer from UV-radiations. Certain heredity diseases have been found susceptible to UV-induced skin cancer. UV radiations activate the cutaneous immune system, which led to an inflammatory response by different mechanisms. The first line of defense mechanism against UV radiation is melanin (an epidermal pigment), and UV absorbing pigment of skin, which dissipate UV radiation as heat. Cell surface death receptor (e.g. Fas) of keratinocytes responds to UV-induced injury and elicits apoptosis to avoid malignant transformation. In addition to the formation of photo-dimers in the genome, UV also can induce mutation by generating ROS and nucleotides are highly susceptible to these free radical injuries. Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) has been known to be implicated in different UV-induced damages such as pigmentation, adaptive tanning, and skin cancer. UV-B induces the formation of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal layer of skin. UV-induced tans act as a photoprotection by providing a sun protection factor (SPF) of 3-4 and epidermal hyperplasia. There is a need to prevent the harmful effects and harness the useful effects of UV radiations.

AB  - Background: Controversy exists regarding the role of oxidative DNA damage and DNA repair in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). We performed a case control study to test the hypothesis that oxidative DNA damage and base excision repair (BER) genes PARP1 and OGG1 are involved in POAG pathogenesis.Materials and Methods: The study included 116 POAG patients and 116 cataract patients as controls. The 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were measured by ELISA. RNA was extracted from blood by Trizol and converted to cDNA. The relative quantification of PARP1 and OGG1 genes normalized to -actin was calculated by the 2(-Ct) method. Comparisons between groups were done by student's t-test and correlation between parameters was seen by Pearson correlation coefficient. All p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.Results: Mean levels of 8-OHdG were (patients v/s controls) 19.53 1.40 vs. 15.0 +/- 2.6 ng/ml in plasma and 8.55 +/- 1.94 vs. 5.15 +/- 1.09 ng/ml in aqueous humor (p < 0.0001). Expression levels of PARP1 (0.44 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.04) and OGG1 (0.46 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.01) were significantly (p < 0.0001) less in the patients than controls. There was a significant negative correlation between the expression levels of PARP1 and OGG1 with plasma and aqueous 8-OHdG. There was a strong positive correlation between plasma and aqueous 8-OHdG levels.Conclusion: These results support our hypothesis that oxidative stress-induced DNA damage is associated with POAG. Increased oxidative DNA damage in POAG may be attributed to decreased expression of DNA repair enzymes of the BER pathway.

   Differentiation between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease is difficult and may require therapeutic trial with anti-tubercular therapy in tuberculosis-endemic regions.
   Aim
   To evaluate the role of therapeutic trial with anti-tubercular therapy in patients with diagnostic confusion between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease.
   Methods
   We performed retrospective-comparative (n = 288: 131 patients who received anti-tubercular therapy before being diagnosed as Crohn's disease and 157 intestinal tuberculosis patients) and prospective-validation study (n = 55 patients with diagnostic confusion of intestinal tuberculosis/Crohn's disease). Outcomes assessed were global symptomatic response and endoscopic mucosal healing.
   Results
   In the derivation cohort, among those eventually diagnosed as Crohn's disease, global symptomatic response with anti-tubercular therapy was seen in 38% at 3 months and in 37% who completed 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy. Ninety-four per cent of intestinal tuberculosis patients showed global symptomatic response by 3 months. Endoscopic mucosal healing was seen in only 5% of patients with Crohn's disease compared with 100% of intestinal tuberculosis patients. In the validation cohort, all the patients with intestinal tuberculosis had symptomatic response and endoscopic mucosal healing after 6 months of antitubercular therapy. Among the patients with an eventual diagnosis of Crohn's disease, symptomatic response was seen in 64% at 2 months and in 31% who completed 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy, none had mucosal healing.
   Conclusions
   Disproportionately lower mucosal healing rate despite an overall symptom response with 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy in patients with Crohn's disease suggests a need for repeat colonoscopy for diagnosing Crohn's disease. Patients with intestinal tuberculosis showing significant symptomatic response after 2-3 months of anti-tubercular therapy, suggest that symptom persistence after a therapeutic trial of 3 months of anti-tubercular therapy may indicate the diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

AB  - Introduction: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious life threatening condition affecting children as well as adults worldwide. Timely diagnosis and effective treatment, both of which are complex in children, are the prerogatives for a favorable outcome.Areas covered: This review covers epidemiology, treatment regimen and duration, newer drugs and adverse events in children with MDR-TB. Special note has been made of epidemiology and principles of treatment followed in Indian children.Expert opinion: High index of suspicion is essential for diagnosing childhood MDR-TB. If there is high probability, a child can be diagnosed as presumptive MDR-TB and started on empiric treatment in consultation with experts. However, every effort should be made to confirm the diagnosis. Backbone of an effective MDR-TB regimen consists of four 2nd line anti-TB drugs plus pyrazinamide; duration being 18-24 months. The newer drugs delamanid and bedaquiline can be used in younger children if no other alternatives are available after consultation with experts. Wider availability of these drugs should be ensured for benefit to all concerned. More research is required for development of new and repurposed drugs to combat MDR-TB. Children need to be included in clinical trials for such life-saving drugs, so that nobody is denied the benefits.

AB  - Background: HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box-1) is a very versatile highly abundant architectural protein that plays multiple roles in human health and diseases. Under physiological condition it serves as an amazing assortment of roles in different compartments of cell. The reported high expression of HMGB1 in almost all types of human cancers and inflammatory diseases makes it a critical molecular therapeutic target.
   Objective: In the present study, we have mobilized a proximal twenty one base pair nucleotide (21RY) which is in the promoter region (-55 to-75) of hmgb1 gene and targeted it with triplex forming oligonucleotide (TFO) in combination with two widely used chemotherapeutic drugs, actinomycin (ACT) and adriamycin (ADM).
   Method: The interaction of actinomycin and adriamycin to 21R*R.Y DNA triplex was studied using UV melting profiles, CD spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry and Isothermal titration calorimetry. The 21R*R.Y formation was confirmed from biphasic thermal melting profiles, continuous variation method, analysis of CD marker band and thermodynamic parameters.
   Results: The binding of ADM and ACT to 21R*R.Y was characterized by hypochromic and bathochromic shift in their respective absorption spectrum, quenching (ADM) and enhanced fluorescence (ACT) of steady-state fluorescence intensity, perturbation in the circular dichroic spectrum and change in thermal melting temperatures. The ITC profile and Scatchard plot analysis indicate non-cooperative and higher binding affinity of these drugs to 21R*R.Y compared to their corresponding duplexes.
   Conclusion: Therefore, combining these chemotherapeutic drugs with triplex forming oligonucleotide may offer new diagnostic and therapeutic options in targeting a gene of interest more specifically with fewer side effects. This study shows that ACT and ADM effectively recognize 21R*R.Y triplex DNA formed on the hmgb1 promoter region.

AB  - PURPOSE
   We aimed to assess the performance of computed tomography (CT) in localizing site of traumatic gastrointestinal tract (GIT) injury and determine the diagnostic value of CT signs in site localization.
   METHODS
   CT scans of 97 patients with surgically proven GIT or mesenteric injuries were retrospectively reviewed by radiologists blinded to surgical findings. Diagnosis of either GIT or mesenteric injuries was made. In patients with GIT injuries, site of injury and presence of CT signs such as focal bowel wall hyperenhancement, hypoenhancement, wall discontinuity, wall thickening, extramural air, intramural air, perivisceral infiltration, and active vascular contrast leak were evaluated.
   RESULTS
   Out of 97 patients, 90 had GIT injuries (70 single site injuries and 20 multiple site injuries) and seven had isolated mesenteric injury. The overall concordance between CT and operative findings for exact site localization was 67.8% (61/90), partial concordance rate was 11.1% (10/90), and discordance rate was 21.1% (19/90). For single site localization, concordance rate was 77.1% (54/70), discordance rate was 21.4% (15/70), and partial concordance rate was 1.4% (1/70). In multiple site injury, concordance rate for all sites of injury was 35% (7/20), partial concordance rate was 45% (9/20), and discordance rate was 20% (4/20). For upper GIT injuries, wall discontinuity was the most accurate sign for localization. For small bowel injury, intramural air and hyperenhancement were the most specific signs for site localization, while for large bowel injury, wall discontinuity and hypoenhancement were the most specific signs.
   CONCLUSION
   CT performs better in diagnosing small bowel injury compared with large bowel injury. CT can well predict the presence of multiple site injury but has limited performance in exact localization of all injury sites.

AB  - Mediastinal staging is a crucial factor in the decision making in patients with non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mediastinoscopy has historically been the gold standard for this purpose. With the advent of PET-CT, the role of an invasive staging modality like mediastinoscopy has been diminishing. Newer developments in endoscopic staging like EBUS and EUS-FNA have also provided means to get a cytological diagnosis of enlarged lymph nodes. With the meta-analyses showing encouraging results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable lung cancers including the early stage disease, the sanctity of invasive mediastinal staging for the sole purpose for selecting patients for upfront surgery is debatable. This article discusses the various modalities for mediastinal staging in NSCLC. We also present our perspective regarding the need for a balanced approach between the accuracy of mediastinal staging, invasiveness of the staging modalities, and alternate staging methods. With the liberal use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable NSCLC, the role of invasive mediastinal staging procedures is likely to get limited further, giving way to non-invasive staging modalities like PET-CT.

AB  - Purpose The successful labelling of bisphosphonates (BP) with Ga-68 using macrocyclic chelators such as the based triazacyclononane (NO2AP) is a step forward in the in-house availability of a novel bone-seeking PET radiopharmaceutical with dual advantage of PET/CT imaging and generator production. In this study, we compared the novel generator-based skeletal radiotracer Ga-68-1,4,7-triazacyclonone-1,4-diacetic acid (Ga-68-NO2AP-BP) with sodium fluoride (F-18-NaF) for the detection of skeletal metastases in breast cancer patients. In addition, dosimetric analysis of Ga-68-NO2AP-BP was performed in a subset of patients.
   Methods This was a prospective study of histopathologically proven cases of breast cancer patients who were referred for bone scintigraphy and underwent positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with F-18-NaF and Ga-68-NO2AP-BP within a week in random order. The scans of each patient were compared both qualitatively for image quality and quantitatively for number of lesions and SUVmax of lesions. Dosimetric analysis was performed in five patients. Their PET/CT scans were acquired at multiple time points and urine and blood samples were collected. Dosimetric calculations were performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 software. Statistical analysis was done using Stata 13 (StataCorp) software package. An agreement analysis regarding number of lesions detected with the two skeletal radiotracers was carried out.
   Results The image quality of Ga-68-NO2AP-BP PET/CTscans were comparable to that of F-18-NaF. There was no statistically significant difference in the SUVmax of lesions, normal bone and lesion to background ratio between the two skeletal radiotracers. There was good agreement in the number of lesions detected by both skeletal radiotracers. The mean whole body effective dose for Ga-68-NO2AP-BP was 0.00583 mSv/MBq and the effective dose equivalent was 0.0086 mSv/MBq.
   Conclusion The excellent lesion detection agreement between Ga-68-NO2AP-BP and F-18-NaF favours the former as an alternative for skeletal scintigraphy in centres without an on-site cyclotron. The favourable dosimetric results and its potential to be used as a theranostic agent makes it an important generator-based skeletal radiotracer.

AB  - Background
   This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 6, 2015). Failure to respond to antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled seizure activity such as refractory status epilepticus (RSE) has led to the use of anaesthetic drugs. Coma is induced with anaesthetic drugs to achieve complete control of seizure activity. Thiopental sodium and propofol are popularly used for this purpose. Both agents have been found to be effective. However, there is a substantial lack of evidence as to which of the two drugs is better in terms of clinical outcomes.
   Objectives
   To compare the efficacy, adverse effects, and short-and long-term outcomes of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) treated with one of the two anaesthetic agents, thiopental sodium or propofol.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (16 August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 16 August 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 16 August 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (16 August 2016), and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials (16 August 2016). Previously we searched IndMED, but this was not accessible at the time of the latest update.
   Selection criteria
   All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs (regardless of blinding) assessing the control of RSE using either thiopental sodium or propofol in patients of any age and gender.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of relevant and eligible trials before retrieving the full-text publications.
   Main results
   One study with a total of 24 participants was available for review. This study was a small, single-blind, multicentre trial studying adults with RSE receiving either propofol or thiopental sodium for the control of seizure activity. This study was terminated early due to recruitment problems. For our primary outcome of total control of seizures after the first course of study drug, there were 6/14 patients versus 2/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 5.61, low quality evidence). Mortality was seen in 3/14 patients versus 1/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 11.93, low quality evidence). Our third primary outcome of length of ICU stay was not reported. For our secondary outcomes of adverse events, infection was seen in 7/14 patients versus 5/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.41). Hypotension during administration of study drugs and requiring use of vasopressors was seen in 7/14 patients versus 4/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.38 to 2.00). The other severe complication noted was non-fatal propofol infusion syndrome in one patient. Patients receiving thiopental sodium required more days of mechanical ventilation when compared with patients receiving propofol: (median (range) 17 days (5 to 70 days) with thiopental sodium versus four days (2 to 28 days) with propofol). At three months there was no evidence of a difference between the drugs with respect to outcome measures such as control of seizure activity and functional outcome.
   Authors' conclusions
   Since the last version of this review we have found no new studies. There is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence to clarify the efficacy of propofol and thiopental sodium compared to each other in the treatment of RSE. There is a need for large RCTs for this serious condition.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of alpha-amyrin (a pentacyclic triterpene) on high-fructose diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome in rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into different groups. The control group was fed normal rat chow diet. The HFD group was fed HFD (60%; w/w) for 42 days. Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg, orally, once daily) was used as a standard drug. alpha-Amyrin was administered in 3 doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, orally, once daily along with HFD). Plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were estimated. Changes in blood pressure, oral glucose tolerance, and insulin tolerance were measured. Hepatic oxidative stress as well as messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) were analyzed. A significant increase in systolic blood pressure, plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides and a significant decrease in HDL-C were observed in HFD rats as compared with control rats. Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were also significantly impaired with HFD. alpha-Amyrin prevented these changes in a dose-dependent manner. Hepatic oxidative stress as well as micro-and macrovesicular fatty changes in hepatocytes caused by HFD were also attenuated by alpha-amyrin. alpha-Amyrin preserved the hepatic mRNA and protein levels of PPAR-alpha, which was reduced in HFD group. This study thus demonstrates that alpha-amyrin attenuates HFD-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.

AB  - Introduction: Pediatric head and neck Squamous cell carcinoma (PHNSCC) is a rare disease. The optimum treatment and outcome remains poorly understood because of rarity.
   Methods: We conducted an individual patient data analysis of PHNSCC. Two authors independently searched PubMed, google search, and Cochrane library for eligible studies using following search words: Pediatric Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma under age of 20, Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in young, PHNSCC till June 1, 2016 published in English language.
   Results: Total of 217 patients of PHNSCC were found in the literature. Median age among the cohort was 15 years (Range: 0-20 years) with a clear male preponderance. Oral cavity tumors were commonest 75 (70%) followed by laryngeal neoplasms 16(15%). Median disease free survival was 9 months (Range: 0 -216 months). Median overall survival was 48 months (Range: 1-216 months). In univariate analysis treatment modality had significant impact on disease free survival (DFS). Whereas, patients treated with Surgery, Laryngeal primary had significantly better OS. Patients with associated fanconis anemia had significantly worse overall survival (OS).
   Conclusion: PHNSCC is a rare disease with poorer outcome. Associated DNA defects leads to poorer OS. Patients treated with surgery alone or surgery followed by adjuvant radiation had better DFS and OS. Molecular profiling and personalized therapy may improve survival with limited toxicity.

AB  - Background objectives: The frequently encountered co-morbidity of alcohol dependence (AD) with nicotine dependence (ND) increases the risk for various diseases. Ankyrin repeats and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene polymorphism is reported to be associated with both ND and AD. This study was undertaken to investigate the possible association of alcohol and tobacco use variables with ANKK1 polymorphism in co-morbid alcohol- and nicotine-dependent treatment seekers visiting a tertiary care centre in north India.
   Methods: Seventy nine male participants (18-65 yr old) fulfilling diagnostic criteria for ND and AD were included in the study. The socio-demographic data, along with alcohol and tobacco use profile, was recorded and ANKK1 profiling was carried out. Both the allele groups, A1 and A2, were compared with respect to demographic and substance dependence profile. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk of high nicotine and alcohol consumption with genotype.
   Results: The A1 carrier group (n=33) reported a significantly higher amount of alcohol and tobacco consumed per day. The scores on parameters of ND were found to be significantly higher in this group. The logistic regression analysis revealed that participants with A1 genotype were 2.5 times more likely to report higher amount of alcohol and nicotine consumption than A2 carriers.
   Interpretation conclusions: The study provides an indication for the association of ANKK1 polymorphism in the form of higher substance consumption among alcohol dependent smokers, who are A1 carriers and thus may require higher attention of the treatment provider.

AB  - Background. Medical therapy is widely used for managing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and has made an impact on the profile of patients who ultimately undergo surgery. This changing profile may impact outcomes of surgery and associated complications. To assess the impact of medical management, we evaluated the profile of patients who had surgery for BPH at our institution.
   Methods. A retrospective chart-review was performed of patient demographics, indications for surgery, preoperative comorbid conditions and postoperative course in patients who underwent surgery for BPH over a 5-year period. The data were analysed for demographic trends in comparison with historical cohorts.
   Results. A total of 327 patients underwent surgery for BPH between 2008 and 2012. Their mean age was 66.4 years, the mean prostate gland weight was 59.2 g and the mean duration of symptoms was 35.3 months; 34% had a prostate gland weight of > 60 g; 159 (48.6%) patients had an absolute indication for surgery; 139 (42.5%) of these were catheterized and 6.1% of patients presented with azotaemia or upper tract changes without urinary retention.
   Conclusions. In comparison with historical cohorts, more patients are undergoing surgery for absolute indications including retention of urine and hydroureteronephrosis. However, the patients are younger, they have fewer comorbid conditions and have a similar rate of complications after the procedure.

AB  - Purpose: Routine surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an essential component of measures aimed to tackle the growing threat of resistant microbes in public health. This study presents a 1-year multicentre report on AMR in Staphylococcus species as part of Indian Council of Medical Research-AMR surveillance network. Materials and Methods: Staphylococcus species was routinely collected in the nodal and regional centres of the network and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against a panel of antimicrobials. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of vancomycin (VAN), daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid (LNZ) against selected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were determined by E-test and MIC creep, if any, was determined. Resistant genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction for those isolates showing phenotypic resistance. Results: The prevalence of MRSA was found to be range from moderate (21%) to high (45%) among the centres with an overall prevalence of 37.3%. High prevalence of resistance was observed with commonly used antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin and erythromycin in all the centres. Resistance to LNZ was not encountered except for a single case. Full-blown resistance to VAN in S. aureus was not observed; however, a few VAN-intermediate S. aureus isolates were documented. The most common species of coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) identified was Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Resistance among CoNS was relatively higher than S. aureus. Most phenotypically resistant organisms possessed the corresponding resistance genes. Conclusion: There were localised differences in the prevalence of resistance between the centres. The efficacy of the anti-MRSA antimicrobials was very high; however, almost all these antimicrobials showed evidence of creeping MIC.

AB  - Objective: Colposcopic scoring systems provide an objective diagnosis and select patients who require treatment. A new scoring system, Swede score, has added lesion size as a parameter. This study aimed to compare the strength of association of Reid colposcopic index versus Swede score and assess their utility in low-resource settings.
   Methods: In this prospective study, 150 women aged 30 to 59 years with abnormal screening result were enrolled. All women underwent colposcopy; the findings were scored by both Reid colposcopic index and Swede score, biopsy taken from all abnormal areas. Performances of both the scores were calculated.
   Results: A total of 33 (22%) CIN 2+ lesions were detected. Reid colposcopic index at a cutoff of 5 had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detecting CIN2+ lesions of 96.97%, 95.35%, 88.89%, and 98.8%, respectively. Using Swede score at a cutoff of 8, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 42.42%, 100%, 100%, and 81.9%, and with a cutoff of 5, these were 100%, 88.37%, 76.74%, and 100%, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R-2) was 0.919. By Spearman rank correlation coefficient, the strength of correlation between Swede score and RCI was 0.937 (p < .001).
   Conclusions: Swede score can be used flexibly depending on the setting. The lower threshold (5) with high sensitivity can be used for screening, whereas the higher threshold (8) with high specificity can be used for screen-and-treat selection to decrease the overtreatment rate. Thus, it is a more attractive option for cancer prevention programs in low-resource settings.

AB  - Opioids are one of the most problematic illegal substances globally. Opioid abuse is associated with complications in various spheres of the user's life, his/her family, and the society. Injecting drug use (IDU) is also linked to public health problems such as HIV infection and viral hepatitis. Medications form an important cornerstone in the treatment of opioid dependence. Treatment strategies such as "detoxification" alone or long-term treatment with opioid antagonist have limited acceptability and retention rates. Opioid substitution therapy (OST) has demonstrated better retention rates than other existing treatment strategies and helps improve the individual's functioning as well as his/her quality of life. The use of OST in India spans three decades, with initial use of low-dose buprenorphine followed by higher strength buprenorphine and buprenorphine-naloxone. Other medications such as slow-release oral morphine, and recently, methadone have also been introduced. Indian research also confirms the findings from Western literature on the effectiveness as well as acceptability of this treatment modality. OST received its biggest thrust when it became a part of the National AIDS Control Programme. In recent years, the number of OST centers in India has increased manifold. Practice guidelines, standard operating procedures, and capacity-building mechanisms have been put in place for effective OST implementation. Despite such widespread use, many challenges exist for OST implementation. The targets for ensuring adequate coverage of the population with this treatment are still far away. There is concern of OST being branded as a "harm reduction" intervention reserved only for injecting drug users. Despite three decades of advancements, certain sections of policymakers and practitioners still have reservations with this treatment modality. There is a need to overcome these barriers for OST to become easily accessible to those who need it.

AB  - Urogenital infection due to Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and is a major public health problem worldwide. Molecular characterisation of CT is important for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of chlamydial disease and its transmission dynamics in sexual networks. Traditionally, strain typing of CT was based on serotyping methods characterising the major outer membrane protein (MOMP). With the advent of polymerase chain reaction and sequencing the era of molecular typing began. Molecular characterization of CT strains is based on sequence analysis of ompA gene encoding MOMP. However, in due course of time, improvements were made to enhance the discriminatory power of sequencing and quality of epidemiological information. New high-resolution genotyping methods using multiple loci such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats (MLVA) were developed but were unable to differentiate mixed infections (MIs). The development of DNA-hybridisation methods emerged as a major breakthrough in detecting MIs. Although MLST and MLVA are more discriminative than other genotyping methods, they are laborious and expensive. DNA microarray technique is an affordable alternative for genotyping. Since recombination is widespread in the CT genome, ompA is not a reliable marker for phylogenetic studies; hence, whole genome sequencing may provide maximum phylogenetic resolution of CT strains. A descriptive review is provided of the various molecular CT typing methods. The vital information gained can be used for formulating screening programmes, targeted prevention and optimising therapeutic measures aiming to reduce disease transmission.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe, recurrent mood disorder, associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, with high rates of suicides and medical comorbidities. There is a high risk of mood disorders among the first-degree relatives of patients with BD. In the current clinical practice, the diagnosis of BD is made by history taking, interview and behavioural observations, thereby lacking an objective, biological validation. This approach may result in underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis and eventually poorer outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of BD, the possibility of developing a single, specific biomarker is still remote; however, there is a set of promising biomarkers which may serve as predictive, prognostic or treatment markers in the future. The review presents a critical appraisal and update on some of the most promising candidates for biomarkers, namely, neuroimaging markers, peripheral biomarkers and genetic markers, including a brief discussion on cognitive endophenotypes as indicative of genetic risk. The lessons learnt from other fields and specialties in medicine need to be applied to psychiatry to translate the knowledge from 'bench to bedside' by means of clinically useful biomarkers. Overall, the biomarkers may help in pushing the shift towards personalized medicine for psychiatric patients.

AB  - Background: Common mental disorders, such as mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, are significant contributors to disability globally, including India. Available research is, however, limited by methodological issues and heterogeneities. Aim: The present paper focuses on the 12-month prevalence and 12-month treatment for anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders in India. Materials and Methods: As part of the World Health Organization World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative, in India, the study was conducted at eleven sites. However, the current study focuses on the household sample of 24,371 adults (>= 18 years) of eight districts of different states, covering rural and urban areas. Respondents were interviewed face-to-face using the WMH Composite International Diagnostic Interview after translation and country-specific adaptations. Diagnoses were generated as per the International Classification of Diseases, 10(th) edition, Diagnostic Criteria for Research. Results: Nearly 49.3% of the sample included males. The 12-month prevalence of common mental disorders was 5.52% - anxiety disorders (3.41%), mood disorders (1.44%), and substance use disorders (1.18%). Females had a relatively higher prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders, and lower prevalence of substance use disorders than males. The 12-month treatment for people with common mental disorders was 5.09% (range 1.66%u11.55% for individual disorders). The survey revealed a huge treatment gap of 95%, with only 5 out of 100 individuals with common mental disorders receiving any treatment over the past year. Conclusion: The survey provides valuable data to understand the mental health needs and treatment gaps in the Indian population. Despite the 12-month prevalence study being restricted to selected mental disorders, these estimates are likely to be conservative due to under-reporting or inadequate detection due to cultural factors.

AB  - Retropharyngeal abscess is a potentially serious deep neck space infection occurring more frequently in children than in adults. The clinical picture of RPA is highly variable with paucity of physical findings. Prompt diagnosis of RPA especially in infants is mandatory to prevent potential fatal complications including airway obstruction. The diagnosis of RPA should be based on high index of clinical suspicion with supportive imaging studies like lateral X-ray of neck and CT.
   We present a case of acute retropharyngeal abscess which was initially misdiagnosed as meningitis and led to airway obstruction. This case is reported to create awareness among emergency physicians, paediatricians and otolaryngologists to have high index of suspicion in diagnosing RPA especially in infants.

AB  - Scarcely understood defects lead to asthenozoospermia, which results in poor fertility outcomes. Incomplete knowledge of these defects hinders the development of new therapies and reliance on interventional therapies, such as in vitro fertilization, increases. Sperm cells, being transcriptionally and translationally silent, necessitate the proteomic approach to study the sperm function. We have performed a differential proteomics analysis of human sperm and seminal plasma and identified and quantified 667 proteins in sperm and 429 proteins in seminal plasma data set, which were used for further analysis. Statistical and mathematical analysis combined with pathway analysis and self-organizing maps clustering and correlation was performed on the data set.
   It was found that sperm proteomic signature combined with statistical analysis as opposed to the seminal plasma proteomic signature can differentiate the normozoospermic versus the asthenozoospermic sperm somp/es.This is despite the results that some of the seminal plasma proteins have big fold changes among classes but they fall short of statistical significance. S-Plot of the sperm proteomic data set generated some high confidence targets, which might be implicated in sperm motility pathways. These proteins also had the area under the curve value of 0.9 or 1 in ROC curve analysis.
   Various pathways were either enriched in these proteomic data sets by pathway analysis or they were searched by their constituent proteins. Some of these pathways were axoneme activation and focal adhesion assem- bly, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, cellular response to stress and nucleosome assembly among others. The mass spectrometric data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXDO04098.

AB  - Objectives To screen patients with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) for the presence of ambulatory hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.
   Methods Following ethical and parental approvals, consecutive patients with FRNS of >= 2 y duration were enrolled. Those with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and known familial hypercholesterolemia or diabetes mellitus were excluded. Clinic blood pressure was measured by oscillometry and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was recorded by Spacelab 90207; echocardiography was done for left ventricular mass. Ambulatory hypertension was defined as the presence of clinic blood pressure >95th centile for age, sex and height, and systolic blood pressure load exceeding 25 %.
   Results Of 99 patients, 73 were boys; their median (IQR) age was 120 (84-156) mo. Clinic blood pressure was >95th percentile in 63 (63.6 %) patients. Ambulatory hypertension was present in 33 (33.3 %), including 14 patients with severe hypertension; 16 (16.1 %) had masked hypertension and 30 (30.3 %) had white coat hypertension. Non-dipping was seen in 72 and 55 patients had high nocturnal systolic blood pressure load. Of 21 patients with increased left ventricular mass index, 9 (42.9 %) had ambulatory hypertension, 3 (14.3 %) had masked hypertension and 6 (28.6 %) patients had white coat hypertension. Compared to those with normal blood pressure, patients with ambulatory hypertension were younger at onset of nephrotic syndrome (odds ratio, OR 0.94; 95 % CI 0.91-0.98; P = 0.002), longer duration of frequently relapsing disease (OR 1.05; 95 % CI 1.00-1.10; P = 0.034) and higher body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.61; 95 % CI 1.07-4.40; P = 0.020). BMI was positively correlated with 24-h systolic blood pressure load (r = 0.23; P = 0.002) and with the left ventricular mass index (r = 0. 57; P = 0.001).
   Conclusions Many patients with FRNS showed high prevalence of clinic, ambulatory and white coat hypertension, emphasizing the need to carefully screen these patients in order to ensure their appropriate management. While clinic blood pressure monitoring detects most patients with hypertension, it misses a significant proportion with masked hypertension, underscoring the need for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and screening for end organ damage. High BMI was the chief risk factor for hypertension, suggesting that control of overweight and hypertension might improve cardiovascular outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Ang (1-7) recognised as a biologically active component of renin angiotensin system (RAS). It has been documented that peripheral activity of Ang (1-7) gets reduced during diabetic nephropathy (DN) which is one of the most common cause of end stage renal disease. Peripheral activity of RAS is regulated by brain RAS. The purpose of present study is to investigate the role of brain angiotensin (1-7) in chronic hyperglycemia induced nephropathy in wistar rats. Material and methods: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is induced by single dose of alloxan (120 mg/kg: i.p.). The biochemical parameters related to DN was estimated using commercially available kits. Results: Diabetic rat, after 8 weeks of alloxan administration shows elevated serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, protein in urine, kidney weight/body weight and deceased level of serum nitrite. However, intracerebroventricular treatment with Ang (1-7) (4.8 mu g/day) and valsartan (100 nmol/day) (which do not cross blood brain barrier) alone and combination of Ang (1-7) and valsartan for 2 weeks markedly attenuated these changes and increased serum nitrite in DN induced rats. Conclusion: The finding of this study suggests that brain Ang (1-7) play a vital role in controlling the peripheral activity of RAS in diabetic nephropathy which may be due to the decreased central sympathetic outflow and peripheral activity of Ang II.

AB  - Background and aimAbdominal pain is difficult to treat in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Medical therapy including antioxidants has been shown to relieve pain of CP in the short-term. Our aim was to study the long-term results of optimized medical and interventional therapy for pain relief in patients with CP with a step-up approach.
   MethodsAll consecutive patients with CP were included prospectively in the study. They were treated medically with a well-balanced diet, pancreatic enzymes, and antioxidants (9000IU beta-carotene, 0.54g vitamin C, 270IU vitamin E, 600 mu g organic selenium, and 2g methionine). Endoscopic therapy and/or surgery were offered if medical therapy failed. Pain relief was the primary outcome measure.
   ResultsA total of 313 patients (mean age 26.1612.17; 244 males) with CP were included; 288 (92%) patients had abdominal pain. The etiology of CP was idiopathic in 224 (71.6%) and alcohol in 82 (26.2%). At 1-year follow-up, significant pain relief was achieved in 84.7% of patients: 52.1% with medical therapy, 16.7% with endoscopic therapy, 7.6% with surgery, and 8.3% spontaneously. The mean pain score decreased from 6.36 +/- 1.92 to 1.62 +/- 2.10 (P<0.001). Of the 288 patients, 261, 218, 112, and 51 patients were followed up for 3, 5, 10, and 15years, respectively; 54.0%, 57.3%, 60.7%, and 68.8% of them became pain free at those follow-up periods.
   ConclusionSignificant pain relief is achieved in the majority of patients with optimized medical and interventional treatment.

AB  - Objective: Infections are common and associated with complications and mortality in acute liver failure (ALF). The temporal relationship between ammonia and infection in ALF patients is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the predictors of infection and its relationship with arterial ammonia levels.Materials and methods: Consecutive ALF patients hospitalized between January 2004 and December 2015, without signs of infection at/within 48h of admission, were included. Occurrence of infection after 48h was documented and ammonia levels were estimated for five consecutive days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with development of infection. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to evaluate five-day time trend of ammonia in patients with and without infection.Results: Of 540 consecutive patients, 120 were infected at admission/within 48h and were excluded. Of the rest 420 patients, 144 (34.3%) developed infection after 48h and 276 (65.7%) remained non-infected. Infected patients had higher mortality than non-infected patients (61.8% vs 40.0%, p<.001). On multivariate analysis, presence of cerebral edema(HR 2.049; 95%CI, 1.30-3.23), ammonia level on day 3 of admission (HR 1.006; 95%CI, 1.003-1.008), and model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score (HR 1.051; 95%CI, 1.026-1.078) were associated with development of infection. GEE showed group difference in serial ammonia values between infected and non-infected patients indicating lack of ammonia decline in infected patients.Conclusions: Cerebral edema, elevated ammonia on day 3, and higher MELD score predict the development of infection in ALF. Ammonia persists at high levels in infected patients, and elevated ammonia on day 3 is associated with complications and death.

AB  - Background: Delayed presentation of orbital trauma as an acute subperiosteal hematoma. Case report: A 12-year-boy developed sudden painful abaxial proptosis of the left eyeball 15 days after blunt trauma over the forehead. On contrast-enhanced computed tomography, a heterogeneous, hypodense, non-enhancing mass with biconvex contour was seen adjacent to the orbital roof. Direct needle drainage was performed and about 10 mL dark blood was aspirated. Proptosis reduced immediately and resolved completely at 2 weeks follow-up. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Sudden proptosis with no immediate history of trauma can be alarming for the emergency physician. Familiarity with this clinical entity and early drainage can decrease morbidity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are newly discovered non-coding small (similar to 17-24 nucleotide) RNAs that regulate gene expression of its target mRNA at the post-transcriptional levels. In this study, total 12,593 ESTs of Curcuma longa were taken from database of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) and clustered into 2821 contigs using EGassembler web server. Precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) were predicted from these contigs that folded into stem-loop structure using MFold server. Thirty-four mature C. longa miRNAs (clo-miRNAs) were identified from pre-miRNAs having targets involved in various important functions of plant such as self-defence, growth and development, alkaloid metabolic pathway and ethylene signalling process. Sequence analysis of identified clo-miRNAs indicated that 56% miRNAs belong to ORF and 44% belong to non-ORF region. clo-mir-5 and clo-mir-6 were established as the conserved miRNAs, whereas clo-mir-20 was predicted to be the most stable miRNA. Phylogenetic analysis carried out by molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) software indicated close evolutionary relationship of clo-mir-5075 with osa-MIR5075. Further, identified clo-miRNAs were checked for their cross-kingdom regulatory potential. clo-mir-14 was found to regulate various gene transcripts in humans that has been further investigated for its biostability in foetal bovine serum (FBS). The results indicated higher degree of stability of clo-mir-14 (48h) in FBS. Thus, contribution of this miRNA to the cellular immune response during the inflamed condition of rheumatoid arthritis and adequate stability may make it a good choice for the therapeutic agent in near future.

AB  - Intracardiac or intrapulmonary dislodgement of dialysis catheter or guidewire coating is extremely rare. When present, it can be potentially lethal as it may get complicated by arrhythmias, myocardial or pulmonary artery rupture, valvular perforation, pulmonary thromboembolism, infarction, and infective endocarditis. Percutaneous removal should be attempted as an initial measure and is usually effective in most of the cases. We report 2 such cases, where in first patient it was the hemodialysis catheter which broke, with a large part migrating into the heart, while in second patient, it was the hydrophilic coating of the guidewire that migrated into the pulmonary arteries. Percutaneous retrieval of these foreign bodies was done successfully in both the cases.

AB  - Introduction: Heterotopic pancreas (HP) has rarely been identified in the wall of choledochal cyst (CC).
   Methods: Retrospectively we screened 200 excised specimens of CC received at our Institute over a period of last eight years and looked for presence of HP rests in them. All the specimens were processed in their entirety.
   Result: HP was identified in the wall of 13 (6.5%) CCs, out of which 11 were Heinrich Type 2, and two were Heinrich Type 1. In half of the cases peribiliary mucous glands were observed intermingled with the HP rests. Features of chronic fibrosing pancreatitis were identified in these rests, with ulceration of overlying cyst lining.
   Conclusions: HP rests in the wall of CC though rare; their coexistence with peribiliary glands may possibly indicate their common embryonic origin. As a common site of inflammation, HP rest may be one of the common causes of CC.

AB  - Congenital H-type fistula is a rare congenital rectourogenital connection with an external anal opening in a normal or ectopic position. A systematic review was done to study the anatomical types of congenital H-type fistula, embryology, clinical presentation, relative gender distribution, associated anomalies, investigative modalities, and recent advances in treatment of these lesions. A PubMed search included H-type anorectal malformation; H-type anorectal malformations; H-type anorectal; and H-type congenital anorectal that gave 9;43;76;26 abstracts, respectively. Relevant studies and cited articles were studied omitting duplicate search. The reported incidence is 0.1-16 % of all anorectal malformation. The H-type anorectal malformation is 2.5-6 times more common in females and usually associated with a normal anus. In males, the anomaly is usually a variant with an ectopic anus or a perineal fistula. Anatomical types include anovestibular; rectovestibular; rectovaginal fistula in females and rectourethral (bulbar, prostatic, bladder neck) and rectovesical fistula in males. Variants identified include H-type fistula with perineal fistula, perineal groove, H-type sinus, H-type canal, and acquired H-type fistula. This review compiles the available literature over last six decades. Various surgical corrective procedures have been described. The high recurrence decreases with a learning curve and experience.

AB  - Objective: The EAACI/GA(2)LEN/EDF/WAO recommendation of increasing antihistamines' dose up to four times in urticaria not adequately controlled with the standard dose is largely based on expert opinion. The objective of this study is to test the current urticaria guidelines of up-dosing antihistamines as second-line treatment.
   Methods: This was an open-label study conducted prospectively on 113 patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. All patients were treated with sequentially increasing doses of levocetrizine (5mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg/day) every week till the patients became completely asymptomatic or dose of 20 mg/day reached. Urticaria Activity Score (UAS)-7,urticaria-related quality-of-life (CU-Q2oL) and patients global assessment were used to assess treatment response.
   Results: Twenty-one (18.58%) patients became asymptomatic with levocetirizine 5 mg/day, while 50 required higher doses of levocetirizine for complete control: 29/92 (31.52%), 6/63 (9.52%) and 15/57 (26.31%) with 10 mg, 15 mg and 20mg/day, respectively. The percentage of patients experiencing > 75% improvement increased with increasing doses of levocetirizine: 26.54%, 53.98%, 60.17% and 69.91% with 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg/day, respectively. Sequential up-dosing of levocetirizine produced a progressive improvement in both urticaria control (UAS-7) and quality-of-life (CU-Q2oL) without significantly increasing somnolence.
   Conclusions: Our results support the current recommendations of increasing antihistamines up to four times the standard dose in patients who fail the first-line treatment.

AB  - Skin colour (specifically in relation to its melanin content and composition) has a marked influence on its interaction with ultraviolet light. Eumelanin has mainly photoprotective properties while pheomelanin has the ability to cause formation of reactive oxygen species. This difference is responsible for the difference in incidence and presentation of various idiopathic photodermatoses in dark skinned patients compared to those with lighter skin types. Certain conditions are peculiar to darker skins including pin point popular variant of polymorphous light eruption. These differences are discussed in this chapter while also highlighting the challenges faced in performing phototesting in patients with dark skin.

AB  - Hookworms are recognised as a cause of iron-deficiency anaemia in endemic areas. They are, however, often not considered in the differential diagnosis of overt gastrointestinal bleeding. We report the endoscopic diagnosis of hookworms as the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in three patients, two of whom had frank haemorrhage with one presenting in hypovolemic shock. Hookworm infestation is an important treatable cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in tropical countries.

AB  - We sought to identify independent, nonacademic predictors of medical and nursing student intent to migrate abroad or from rural to urban areas after graduation in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). This was a cross-sectional survey of 3,199 first-and final-year medical and nursing students at 16 training institutions in eight LMIC. Questionnaires assessed demographics, career intentions, and preferences regarding selected career, location, and work-related attributes. Using principal component analysis, student preferences were reduced into four discrete categories of priorities: 1) work environment resources, 2) location livability, 3) altruistic job values, and 4) individualistic job values. Students' preferences were scored in each category. Using students' characteristics and priority scores, multivariable proportional odds models were used to derive independent predictors of intentions to emigrate for work outside the country, or to work in a rural area in their native country. Students prioritizing individualistic values more often planned international careers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-1.78), whereas those prioritizing altruistic values preferred rural careers (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.50-2.21). Trainees prioritizing high-resource environments preferentially planned careers abroad (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.12-1.69) and were unlikely to seek rural work (aOR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73). Independent of their priorities, students with prolonged prior rural residence were unlikely to plan emigration (aOR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.50-0.90) and were more likely to plan a rural career (aOR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.16-2.03). We conclude that use of nonacademic attributes in medical and nursing admissions processes would likely increase retention in high-need rural areas and reduce emigration "brain drain" in LMIC.

AB  - Chloroma refers to the extramedullary proliferation of immature myeloid precursors occurring in a gamut of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic conditions; acute myeloid leukaemia being the commonest. With non-specific clinical and imaging manifestations, it runs a high risk of misdiagnosis which may significantly affect the outcome of an otherwise treatable lesion. Also with these lesions heralding impending blast crises, awareness of the imaging findings becomes imperative. Imaging not only helps raise the suspicion but also guides further confirmation by demonstration of specific immunohistochemistry markers, ensuring timely institution of chemotherapy. In general, solid enhancing lesions in any haematological disorder could be chloromas, especially if multifocal with mass effect.

AB  - The ability of microbial cells to use genetic modifications as a strategy for better survival and disseminate the changes with the community gives rise to the peril of antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistance. Silver has long been known for its enhanced antimicrobial actions. Advancements in nanotechnology sciences has given a vent to the better applicability of silver salts, which is further enhanced by their green (plant mediated) synthesis resulting in Green Silver Nanoparticles (GSNPs). Apart from the antimicrobial actions, these particles have been found to be associated with the modulation of immune system and anticancer activities, bone cement additives, joint replacement therapies, dental fillings, wound dressings etc. The diagnostic domain of medical science applies these particles as an effective agent of biosensing. The established applications of silver nanoparticles in these areas strongly advocate the future researches related to the analysis of the role of phytochemicals in augmenting the activities of silver nanoparticles in case of green synthesis. This review focuses on surfacing the mechanisms of actions of GSNPs on human disease causing agents and conditions, which help may be helpful in developing the strategies for combating different pathological conditions in humans.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the PPP2R2B gene. Previously, the causal length of CAG repeats ascribed to SCA12 was more than 51; however, a few reports have also described unusual occurrence of CAG repeat length 36-51 repeats among patients of different geographical population, with atypical clinical association. From our systematic search for SCA12 in a genetic screening programme, we have identified a large number of SCA12 cases. In this study, we specifically describe the clinical behaviour of 18 patients who harbour CAG repeats in the range of 43-50 and compare their clinical behaviour with patients carrying typical pathogenic threshold length of 51 CAG repeats. Unsurprisingly, we observed that the clinical characteristics were similar to those of typical SCA12 phenotype, with large variability in the age at onset. Radiologically, we observed a variable degree of cerebro-cerebellar degeneration along with white matter changes that do not correlate with the disease severity. We define a new pathogenic threshold of CAG-43 to be pathogenic for SCA12 diagnosis and also describe the clinical profiles of two biallelic CAG expansion carriers. We also propose that SCA12 might not be that restricted in terms of occurrence in other geographical or ethnic populations, as it was previously presumed to be.

AB  - Increased obesity in leukemia survivors has been attributed to chemotherapy and radiation. Data on total energy intake (TEI) and total energy expenditure (TEE) are lacking in obese childhood leukemia patients after completion of therapy from India. We conducted a cross-sectional study in pediatric acute leukemia patients after completion of therapy wherein energy intake was assessed by 24-hour recall method. TEE was calculated using Harris-Benedict equation, by assessing the physical activity level using Physical Activity Questionnaire for children and basal metabolic rate by World Health Organization equation. Indian Academy of Pediatrics 2015 guidelines for BMI were used for defining overweight and obesity. Nutritional status was assessed in 150 leukemia patients after completion of therapy. Twenty-five percent of leukemia patients after completion of therapy were overweight and obese versus 11% of healthy controls (p = 0.042). The mean ratio of TEI/required energy intake (REI), TEE/required energy expenditure (REE), and (TEI:REI)/(TEE:REE) were significantly higher in overweight and obese group versus nonobese survivors (p < 0.001, p = 0.091, p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed higher income (HR-2.3, p = 0.04), increased TEI/REI (HR-4, p = 0.049) and higher (TEI:REI)/(TEE:REE) (HR-3.1, p = 0.039) to be significant factors predicting obesity. Obesity in leukemia patients after completion of therapy is associated with increased energy intake, causing imbalance between energy intake and TEE in these patients.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the effect of intravenous mannitol (IVM) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in vitrectomized eyes. Methods: Thirty-one patients with raised IOP after retinal surgery with silicone oil injection were included. Patients were administered IVM (20% solution, 1g/Kg, over 30 minutes) and IOP was noted at regular intervals. IOP reduction in vitrectomized eyes (Group 1) was compared with the normal eyes (Group 2). Result: Percentage IOP reduction was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 at all time intervals, 24.5% vs. 19.2% at 15 minutes (p=0.34), 22.6% vs. 9.8% at 45 minutes (p=0.003), 19.1% vs. 9.9% at two hours (p=0.023), and 16.1% vs. 7.8% at four hours (p=0.04), respectively. In Group 1, 40% eyes had an IOP reduction of 2-6 mmHg while 30% eyes had IOP reduction >6 mmHg at four hours post-IVM. Conclusion: IVM is useful for short-term IOP reduction in vitrectomized eyes. IOP reduction is independent of baseline IOP, and sustained and higher as compared to normal eyes.

   Methods: Forty eyes of 22 consecutive patients undergoing ICL implantation were prospectively evaluated. Vaulting was measured intraoperatively using microscope-integrated iOCT. The ICL-lenticular relationship was dynamically assessed throughout the surgery. Postoperative vaulting was measured using anterior segment optical coherence tomography on the first postoperative day and after 1 month and compared with the intraoperative vaulting. Uncorrected and best-corrected Snellen visual acuity, intraocular pressure (lOP), and anterior and posterior segments were assessed in all cases.
   Results: The mean central vaulting noted intraoperatively was 558.4 +/- 122.8 mu m. Postoperative mean vaulting was 576.0 +/- 131.2 mu m on day 1 and 551.1 +/- 122.5 mu m on day 30. There was a significant correlation between the intraoperative and the postoperative day 1 vaulting (paired samples correlation: 0.969, p<0.001) and day 30 vaulting (paired samples correlation: 0.945, p<0.001). An ICL-lenticular touch was not noted at any time during the surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful and no patient developed raised lOP or lenticular changes by the last follow-up.
   Conclusions: Intraoperative vaulting correlates well with postoperative vaulting and can aid in on-table detection of extremes of vaulting and decision-making. It enhances the safety of the surgical procedure by providing a real-time display of the intraoperative manipulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer consists of a chemotherapy backbone and HER2-directed therapy. The increase in cardiotoxicity by the use of trastuzumab with an anthracycline-based regimen has led to the use of nonanthracycline-based alternative regimens. The docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) are one such regimen. The efficacy and toxicity of this regimen have not been widely studied in Indian patients. AIMS: This retrospective study aims to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant TCH regimen in locally advanced and oligometastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in Indian patients. METHODOLOGY: The hospital records between January 2014 and December 2016 were reviewed to identify patients with locally advanced and oligometastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with uniform 3-weekly neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocol-containing docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)), carboplatin (AUC = 6), and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading followed by 6 mg/kg) (TCH). The primary outcome was the pathologic complete response (pCR), which was defined as an absence of invasive and noninvasive cancer in breast or lymphnode. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with mean age 46 years met our inclusion criteria, of these 24 patients had locally advanced breast cancer, and eight patients had oligometastatic breast cancer. 13 (40.6%) patients had hormone-positive breast cancer. The objective response rate as assessed clinically was 100%, and pCR rate was 36.3%. The patients with oligometastatic breast cancer also showed a good response to chemotherapy with three patients showing pCR and four patients showing resolution disease at metastatic sites. The patients experienced very few Grade III/IV toxicities, and no patient had clinical congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: The TCH protocol is an efficacious neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced and oligometastatic breast cancer and is safe and well tolerated in this population.

AB  - Introduction: Metastatic/advanced soft tissue sarcoma has a poor prognosis conventionally, treatment options have been limited. In recent years, this area has been a rich ground for research with many new drugs being approved and several more in the pipeline. With multiple new treatment options available, it is vital to keep up pace with this rapidly changing field.
   Areas covered: Recent data regarding use of novel agents in advanced soft tissue sarcoma is reviewed with a focus on clinical applicability. The goal is to guide the clinician into choosing appropriate lines of therapy for the individual patient in light of recent availability of multiple new treatment options.
   Expert commentary: Patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma can expect to receive several lines of therapy in the modern era. Tumor histology should ideally guide the choice of therapy. The new FDA approved second line drugs viz, trabectedin, pazopanib and eribulin should be considered first after failure of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. Additional options have become available, such as antiangiogenic agents, mTOR inhibitors, and several new molecules targeting specific oncogenic pathways. All these agents have a role in treating soft tissue sarcoma, and careful individualization of therapy can help achieve optimal outcomes in these challenging patients.

AB  - This study was designed to explore the impact of Yoga and Meditation based lifestyle intervention (YMLI) on cellular aging in apparently healthy individuals. During this 12-week prospective, open-label, single arm exploratory study, 96 apparently healthy individuals were enrolled to receive YMLI. The primary endpoints were assessment of the change in levels of cardinal biomarkers of cellular aging in blood from baseline to week 12, which included DNA damage marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH2dG), oxidative stress markers reactive oxygen species (ROS), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and telomere attrition markers telomere length and telomerase activity. The secondary endpoints were assessment of metabotrophic blood biomarkers associated with cellular aging, which included cortisol, beta-endorphin, IL-6, BDNF, and sirtuin-1. After 12 weeks of YMLI, there were significant improvements in both the cardinal biomarkers of cellular aging and the metabotrophic biomarkers influencing cellular aging compared to baseline values. The mean levels of 8-OH2dG, ROS, cortisol, and IL-6 were significantly lower and mean levels of TAC, telomerase activity, beta-endorphin, BDNF, and sirtuin-1 were significantly increased (all values p < 0.05) post-YMLI. The mean level of telomere length was increased but the finding was not significant (p = 0.069). YMLI significantly reduced the rate of cellular aging in apparently healthy population.

AB  - Background: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a potentially fatal complication of measles. The authors report a case of recurrent myoclonic jerks under investigation, whose ophthalmic examination pointed to the diagnosis.
   Case presentation: A 12-year-old boy with recurrent episodes of myoclonic jerks was found to have optic disc pallor and an irregular macular scar with pigmentation in the left eye. The retinal finding proved to be a strong diagnostic clue for SSPE. There was a history of exanthematous fever in childhood. Antibodies against measles were detected in both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Retinitis with intraretinal and subretinal hemorrhage in the right eye was noted 6-weeks after the initial presentation.
   Conclusion: The authors describe the importance of ophthalmic evaluation in cases of recurrent myoclonic jerks. Optical coherence tomographic features and ultrawide field imaging characteristics of a case of SSPE are described.

AB  - Aims: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is a malignant epithelial neoplasm that occurs rarely in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). AdCC at various sites is associated with the novel fusion transcript MYB-NFIB, along with the overexpression of the Myb protein. The expression of the Myb protein in AdCC of the LRT has not been evaluated much. Study Design: Cases of AdCC of the LRT diagnosed on cytology or histology were retrieved from our institutional archives. c-Myb expression was analyzed on immunocytochemistry/immunohistochemistry (ICC/IHC) and was correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Results: Twenty-three samples of AdCC originating from the LRT were included in the study. Four cases were diagnosed on cytology, 3 of which had corresponding histology specimens. The remaining 19 cases had either biopsy or resection. Most of the patients presented with endobronchial mass. The mean age was 49.4 years and a male predominance was seen. ICC and IHC for c-Myb showed positivity in 75 and 59% of the cases, respectively. Western blot was used to validate IHC results. Conclusion: AdCC of the LRT is rare and hence poses diagnostic difficulty. Cytology smears can be utilized for c-Myb ICC. The presence of c-Myb immunopositivity in most cases may possibly make Myb a diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for personalized treatment. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The emergence of injectable hydrogels as biomaterials has been a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of on-demand drug delivery and tissue engineering. The promising features of these systems include their biodegradability, biocompatibility, permeability, ease of the surgical implantation, and most importantly exhibit minimally invasiveness. These hydrogels have been explored as sustained and on-demand release carriers for the various bioactive agents, growth factors, live cells, various hydrophobic drugs and as extracellular matrices for tissue engineering. Present review is an attempt to highlight the recent systems explored for on-demand drug release and tissue engineering. It also gives an overview of the role of nanotechnology in the advancements of injectable hydrogels. The future prospects and challenges of these hydrogels have also been addressed.

AB  - Hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare soft tissue tumors. The eyelid is a very uncommon site for these tumors, and an anaplastic variant of HPC in the eyelid has not been reported before. A 44-year-old male presented with complaints of slowly progressive, painless swelling on the inner aspect of the left upper eyelid for 9 months. He underwent local excision of the swelling and histopathology revealed a WHO Grade III anaplastic HPC. Whole body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography done postoperatively did not show any evidence of local or distant disease. The patient was planned for adjuvant radiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks in view of high grade of histopathology and doubtful margins. He is disease free at the time of the last follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of anaplastic HPC of eyelid being reported in English literature.

KW  - AZATHIOPRINE
AB  - Background: Parthenium dermatitis is the most common type of airborne contact dermatitis in India. It is a chronic disease of a remitting and relapsing course with significant morbidity and distress, but there is no scoring system to assess its severity. Aim: To design a scoring system for the assessment of clinical severity of disease in Parthenium dermatitis and to use this scoring system in various studies to determine its sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Methods and Results: In our first few studies on Parthenium dermatitis, we designed and used a basic clinical severity scoring system based on itching, morphology of the lesions, and areas involved. However, in subsequent studies, we modified it to the present scoring system as Parthenium dermatitis severity score (PDSS). Our studies showed the high sensitivity of PDSS in characterization of the disease severity at the given point of time, as well as to determine the efficacy of a prescribed treatment modality which was reliable and reproducible. Conclusion: Thus, PDSS may be used by clinicians for appropriate scoring of the clinical severity of Parthenium dermatitis and in monitoring the disease response to therapy.

AB  - Delhi is the second largest city of the world both in terms of population and area, as well as being the capital of India. Every year, thousands of people from different states throng to the capital in search of a job in order to earn a living. When these people die and their bodies are found without any identifying documentation, it is very difficult for the police to establish their identities. These bodies are labelled as unidentified/unclaimed or unknown, and are sent for usually sent for medicolegal autopsy. Invariably, skeletonised bodies are also recovered, which are also subjected to medicolegal autopsy. Female foeticide is another social problem, and whenever such foetuses are disposed of illegally, they are also grouped under this category and brought for medicolegal autopsy. We undertook a five-year retrospective analysis ( for the period 2010-2014) of all such cases brought for medicolegal autopsy at our centre, which caters only for the south and south-east districts of Delhi. A total of 7964 cases were brought for medicolegal autopsy, of which unknown cases accounted for about 16%. About 25-30 foetuses and skeletonised bodies were brought each year that was studied. The manner of death was certified as natural in about 71% of cases, with predominant pathology in the lungs. There was a clear predominance of males over females, with the 31-to 50-year age group accounting for half of all cases. There was an increase in the number of deaths during months of extreme temperatures. The average time between the recovery of a body by the police and the post-mortem was about seven days. These findings raise many questions, including the failure of governmental policies, police investigating agencies and social menace. The creation of a national missingpersons database as well as a DNA databank is needed to aid in the identification of unidentified/unclaimed and unknown bodies.

AB  - Background. Results on body composition in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have been heterogeneous and are lacking from Asia. Present study assessed body composition in CD/UC and correlated it with disease severity/duration. Methods. Patients of CD/UC following between Dec 2014 and Dec 2015 who consented for bioimpedance analysis for body fat measurement were included. Lean mass and fat-free mass index (FFMI) were calculated with standard formulae. Visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SCA), and visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio (VF/SC) were evaluated in CD patients on abdominal CT. Results. Lean mass in CD (n = 44, mean age: 41.2 +/- 15.8 years, 73% males) was significantly lower than UC (n = 53, mean age: 33.2 +/- 11.2 years, 68% males; 44.2 +/- 7.8 versus 48.3 +/- 8.4 Kg, p = 0.01). In both UC/CD, disease severity was associated with nonsignificant decline in BMI (UC: 22.1 +/- 4.9 versus 20.2 +/- 3.2 versus 19.9 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2), p = 0.23; CD: 22.1 +/- 4.2 versus 19.9 +/- 2.3 versus 19.7 +/- 4.2 kg/m(2), p = 0.18) and fat mass (UC: 10.9 +/- 8.9 versus 8.1 +/- 5.9 versus 5.7 +/- 3.6 kg, p = 0.14; CD: 11.2 +/- 7 versus 7.9 +/- 4.4 versus 7.2 +/- 5.9 kg, p = 0.16), and disease duration was associated with significant decline in FFMI (p < 0.05). In CD, disease severity was associated with nonsignificant decline in SCA and increase in VF/SC. Conclusions. CD patients have lower lean mass than UC. Body fat decreases with increasing disease severity and fat-free mass decreases with increasing disease duration in both UC/CD.

AB  - Objective(177)Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617, a urea-based compound, binds to the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen, thus providing an effective target for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Before its therapeutic use, it is necessary that the radiation dosimetry of this radiopharmaceutical be studied to determine the safe activity that can be administered in patients to prevent haematological, renal and liver toxicity. The present study thus aimed to assess the pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in CRPC patients.Materials and methodsAfter obtaining ethical clearance from the institute ethics review board, we enrolled mCRPC patients who were positive on a Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[Ga-68(HBED-CC)] PET/CT scan. For kidney protection, a cocktail of lysine and arginine diluted in 2 litres of normal saline was infused, starting from 30 to 60min before Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 infusion. The mean administered activity in the overall population was 2.521.3GBq. For the purpose of dosimetry, each patient underwent nine planar whole-body scans along with blood and urine sample collection at 0.5, 3.5, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168h, respectively. SPECT/CT was performed to derive the volume of salivary glands (parotid and submandibular glands) and tumour. Dosimetric evaluation was carried out using the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software.ResultsA total of 26 mCRPC patients with a mean age of 66.30 +/- 9.95 years (range: 38-81 years) were recruited. Normal physiological uptake was observed in all the patients in the lacrimal glands, salivary glands (parotid glands and submandibular glands), liver, spleen, kidneys, intestines and urinary bladder. Organs with the highest absorbed doses were the salivary glands, followed by the kidneys, receiving 1.24 +/- 0.26 and 0.99 +/- 0.31mGy/MBq, respectively. The mean absorbed doses to the liver, urinary bladder and red marrow were 0.36 +/- 0.10, 0.243 +/- 0.09 and 0.048 +/- 0.05mGy/MBq, respectively. The mean whole-body dose was 0.016 +/- 0.003mGy/MBq.Conclusion(177)Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy is a safe option in the treatment of mCRPC patients.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel theranostic agent, Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
   Methods Thirty-one mCRPC patients with progressive disease despite second-line hormonal therapy and/or docetaxel chemotherapy were recruited for the study. All patients underwent diagnostic(68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CCPET/CT, prior to inclusion for therapy. Included patients then underwent quarterly Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy. Hematological, kidney function, liver function tests, and serum PSA levels were recorded before and after therapy at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 month intervals. Biochemical response was assessed with trend in serum PSA levels. Metabolic response was assessed by PERCIST 1 criteria. Clinical response was assessed by visual analogue score (VASmax) analgesic score (AS), Karanofsky performance status (KPS), and ttoxicity and response criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria.
   Results The mean age of patients was 65.93 +/- 9.77 years (range: 38-81 years). The mean activity administered in the 31 patients was 5069 +/- 1845 MBq ranging from one to four cycles. There was a decline in the mean serum PSA levels from the baseline (baseline: 275 ng/mL, post 1st cycle therapy: 141.75 ng/mL). Based on biochemical response criteria 2/31, 20/31, 3/31, and 6/31 had complete response (CR), partial response(PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), respectively. Metabolic response revealed 2/6 patients with CR, and the remaining 3/6 patients with PR and 1/6 patients with SD. The mean VASmax score decreased from 7.5 to 3. The mean analgesic score decreased from 2.5 to 1.8 after therapy. The mean KPS score improved from 50.32 to 65.42 after therapies. The mean ECOG performance status improved from 2.54 to 1.78 after therapy. Two patients experienced grade I and grade II hemoglobin toxicity each. None of the patients experienced nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity.
   Conclusion Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 radionuclide therapy is a safe and effective approach in the treatment of mCRPC patients.

AB  - Background & objectives: Human cryptosporidiosis is endemic worldwide, and at least eight species have been reported in humans; the most common being Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum. Detailed understanding of the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium is increasingly facilitated using standardized universal technique for species differentiation and subtyping. In this study micro-and minisatellite targets in chromosome 6 were used to assess genetic diversity of C. hominis by sequence length polymorphisms along with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
   Methods: A total of 84 Cryptosporidium positive stool specimens were subjected to speciation and genotyping using small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as the target gene. Genetic heterogeneity amongst C. hominis isolates was assessed by sequencing minisatellites, microsatellites and polymorphic markers including genes encoding the 60 kDa glycoprotein (GP60), a 47 kDa protein (CP47), a mucin-like protein (Mucin-1), a serine repeat antigen (MSC6-7) and a 56 kDa transmembrane protein (CP56).
   Results: Of the 84 Cryptosporidium positive stool specimens, 77 (92%) were positive by SSU rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Of these 77 isolates, 54 were identified as C. hominis and 23 as C. parvum. Of all the loci studied by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), GP60 gene could reveal the highest genetic diversity. Population substructure analysis of C. hominis performed by combined sequence length and nucleotide polymorphism showed nine multilocus subtypes, all of which were distinct groups in the study population.
   Interpretation & conclusions: MLST, a powerful discriminatory test, demonstrated both variations and distribution pattern of Cryptosporidium species and its subtypes.

AB  - Background: Immunofluorescence (IFM) antigen mapping is the most commonly used technique to diagnose and differentiate epidermolysis bullosa (EB). In India, IFM is limited to few research laboratories and is not readily available, making the diagnosis largely clinical and often inaccurate. Objective of the Study: To examine the diagnostic usefulness of immunohistochemistry (IHC) as compared to IFM in resource-limited settings. Methods: Forty-four consecutive EB patients were included in this study. IHC and IFM were performed on 7-mu m frozen tissue sections using standard laboratory protocols with a limited panel of antibodies. The kappa coefficient of agreement was calculated with genetic analysis as the gold standard. Results: IFM and IHC accurately identified the subtype of EB in 80.9% (p < 0.001) of the cases, when a clear blister cavity was evident on biopsy. The sensitivities and specificities of IHC and IFM for diagnosing EB simplex, junctional EB, and dystrophic EB were 100, 100, and 60% and 82.4, 100, and 100%, respectively. IHC was equally effective (p < 0.001) in establishing the type of EB as IFM. Conclusions: IHC staining and its interpretation were simple and comparable to IFM. IHC had an advantage of showing subtle changes in the epidermal architecture that could not be appreciated on IFM and hence can be considered useful in resource-limited settings. (C) 2017 S.

AB  - Coumestrol is a phytoestrogen present in soybean products and recognized as potential cancer therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, the clear molecular mechanism of anticancer-activity of coumestrol in breast carcinoma has not been reported. It is well established that copper levels are elevated in different malignancies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the copper dependent cytotoxic action of coumestrol in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Results showed that coumestrol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, which was prevented by copper chelator neocuproine and ROS scavengers. Coumestrol treatment induced ROS generation coupled to DNA fragmentation, up-regulation of p53/p21, cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspases 9/3 activation. All these effects were suppressed by ROS scavengers and neocuproine. These results suggest that coumestrol targets elevated copper for redox cycling to generate ROS leading to DNA fragmentation. DNA damage leads to p53 up-regulation which directs the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase and promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, copper targeted ROS-mediated p53-dependent mechanism better explains the cytotoxic action of coumestrol in MCF-7 cells. Thus, targeting elevated copper levels might be a potential therapeutic strategy for selective cytotoxic action against malignant cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective
   Examining the Retinal Renin Angiotensin System (RRAS) in the ROP neonates and analyzing the possibility of modulating the RRAS to prevent the progression in Oxygen Induced Retinopathy (OIR) model.
   Method
   Vitreous of ROP patients (n = 44, median age 5.5 months) was quantified for RRAS components, VEGF, HIF-1 alpha and compared with age matched control. The involvement of RRAS in ROP was tested in the rat model of OIR and compared with normoxia. Expressions of RAS components, VEGF and HIF-1 alpha in retina were analyzed using qPCR and retinal structure and function was also analyzed. Effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) was evaluated and compared with Bevacizumab which served as a positive control. Drug penetration into retina was confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled ESI-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS).
   Results
   Multifold increase in the expression of RAS components in human vitreous and rat retina showed their involvement in ROP. ERG & fundus studies in OIR revealed the altered function of retina and were successfully prevented by ARB (telmisartan), ACEI (lisinopril) and bevacizumab. Retinal analysis revealed the presence of ACEI and ARB in their therapeutic levels.
   Conclusion
   This study for the first time demonstrates the upregulated level of RAS components in human ROP vitreous and further that the pharmacological intervention in RRAS can functionally and structurally preserve retina against the progression of ROP in the OIR model.

AB  - AIM: To study the various morphological patterns of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images in patients with age -related macular degeneration (AMD) in Indian population.
   METHODS: Totally 179 eyes of 104 patients with clinical diagnosis of AMD were recruited into the study. Autofluorescence images were captured using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope and the patterns of FAF were classified.
   RESULTS: Of 179 eyes, 27 (15.08%) were early AMD, 58 (32.41%) were intermediate AMD, 94 eyes (52.51%) were late AMD. Of 94 eyes with late AMD, 79 (84.04%) were neovascular AMD and 15 (15.96%) were central geographic atrophy. In eyes with early and intermediate AMD, 9 patterns of FAF were noted. Six patterns (normal, minimal change, focal increased, patchy increased, linear, reticular) were similar to that in the published classification. Two patterns (lacelike and speckled) described in the published classification were not found. Three new patterns (focal hypo -fluorescence, patchy hypo-fluorescence, mixed focal hypo-fluorescence and hyper-fluorescence) were detected. In eyes with neovascular AMD, 6 morphological patterns of FAF were noted. Two patterns (mixed hypo -fluorescence and hyper-fluorescence, central hypo -fluorescence with hyper-fluorescent rim) were similar to that in published classification. Two patterns (normal, near normal or normal background fluorescence in the centre of hypo-fluorescent area) described in the published classification were not found. Four new patterns (minimal change, hypo -fluorescent patch, central hypo fluorescence with surrounding reticular, bull's eye) were recognized. In eye with central geographic atrophy 5 morphological patterns were noted and these were similar to that in published classification.
   CONCLUSION: Phenotypic differences in the pattern of FAF exist in the study population compared to existing classification systems.

AB  - Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare disease in pediatric age group. A thirteen-year-old male child presented with complaints of headache for six months, vomiting and diplopia for three days. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a single lesion of 1.7 cm x 1.6 cm x 1.6 cm in the mid brain and tectum. He underwent a gross total resection of the tumor. The histopathological evaluation revealed B cell high grade non Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient was treated with High dose methotrexate and cranio spinal radiation. The patient was alive without disease 12 mo after completion of treatment. This case highlights importance of keeping PCNSL as differential in brain stem lesions of pediatric patients also. Radiation and chemotherapy remains the most important treatment for such patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   We previously reported that there was no significant difference at 30 days or at 1 year in the rate of the composite outcome of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal failure between patients who underwent coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) performed with a beating-heart technique (off-pump) and those who underwent CABG performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump). We now report the results at 5 years (the end of the trial).
   METHODS
   A total of 4752 patients (from 19 countries) who had coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to undergo off-pump or on-pump CABG. For this report, we analyzed a composite outcome of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure, or repeat coronary revascularization (either CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention). The mean follow-up period was 4.8 years.
   RESULTS
   There were no significant differences between the off-pump group and the on-pump group in the rate of the composite outcome (23.1% and 23.6%, respectively; hazard ratio with off-pump CABG, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.10; P = 0.72) or in the rates of the components of the outcome, including repeat coronary revascularization, which was performed in 2.8% of the patients in the off-pump group and in 2.3% of the patients in the on-pump group (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.73; P = 0.29). The secondary outcome for the overall period of the trial - the mean cost in U.S. dollars per patient - also did not differ significantly between the off-pump group and the on-pump group ($15,107 and $14,992, respectively; between-group difference, $115; 95% CI, -$697 to $927). There were no significant between-group differences in quality-of-life measures.
   CONCLUSIONS
   In our trial, the rate of the composite outcome of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure, or repeat revascularization at 5 years of follow-up was similar among patients who underwent off-pump CABG and those who underwent on-pump CABG.

AB  - Biomarkers reflecting the extent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-induced pathology and normalization during anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) would considerably facilitate trials of new treatment regimens and the identification of patients with treatment failure. Therefore, in a cohort of 99 Indian children with intrathoracic tuberculosis (TB), we performed blood transcriptome kinetic analysis during ATT to explore 1) the association between transcriptional biomarkers in whole blood (WB) and the extent of TB disease at diagnosis and treatment outcomes at 2 and 6 months, and 2) the potential of the biomarkers to predict treatment response at 2 and 6 months. We present the first data on the association between transcriptional biomarkers and the extent of TB disease as well as outcome of ATT in children: Expression of three genes down-regulated on ATT (FCGR1A, FPR1 and MMP9) exhibited a positive correlation with the extent of TB disease, whereas expression of eight up-regulated genes (BCL, BLR1, CASP8, CD3E, CD4, CD19, IL7R and TGFBR2) exhibited a negative correlation with the extent of disease. Baseline levels of these transcripts displayed an individual capacity >70% to predict the six-month treatment outcome. In particular, BLR1 and FCGR1A seem to have a potential in monitoring and perhaps tailoring future antituberculosis therapy.

AB  - Intravascular hemolysis increases the risk of thrombosis in hemolytic disorders. Our previous study showed that the binding of adult hemoglobin (HbA) to glycoprotein (GP) 1b alpha induced the activation of platelets. The elevated plasma Hb or platelet surface bound Hb positively correlated with platelet activation in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Furthermore, this study shows that the sickle Hb [HbS, occurs due to single nucleotide polymorphism at A>T of beta-globin gene of Hb and causes sickle cell disease (SCD)] also bound to GP1b alpha and activated platelets in a concentration-dependent manner. The HbS bound to glycocalicin (extramembranous part of GP1ba) with K-D similar to 10.46 +/- 3 mu M. HbS induced phosphorylation of signaling adapter proteins, such as Lyn, PI3K, Akt and ERK in platelets, and also increased the surface expression of platelet activation markers such as P-selectin (10.7 fold) and PAC1 binding (10.4 fold) in platelet surface in a concentration-dependent manner. HbS also increased the platelet microparticle-generation (4.7 fold) and thrombus-formation (4.3 fold) in a concentration-dependent manner. An elevated level of extracellular Hb in plasma correlated directly with platelet activation markers such as P-selectin (r = 0.7947), PAC1 binding (r = 0.5914) on platelet surface and plasma levels of platelet-derived microparticles (r = 0.7834) in patients with SCD. Our study therefore suggests that the HbS-induced platelet activation may play a crucial role in intravascular clot formation observed in SCD patients characterized by high propensity to vascular occlusion and hypercoagulable states.

AB  - The anti-apoptotic defense mechanism of cancer cells poses a major hurdle which makes chemotherapy less effective. Combinatorial delivery of drugs and siRNAs targeting anti-apoptotic proteins is a vital means for improving therapeutic effects. The present study aims at designing a suitable carrier which can effectively co-deliver doxorubicin and plk1 siRNA to tumor cells. Low molecular weight poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) was chemically modified via a click reaction to obtain a cationic amphiphilic polymer for the co-delivery of therapeutic agents. Short glycol chains were utilized as linker molecules for grafting which in turn imparted a stealth nature and minimized plasma protein adsorption to the polymeric surface. Isonicotinic acid was grafted to the polymer due to its ability to penetrate the endolysosomal membrane and arginine-lysine conjugates were embedded for complexing siRNA. The polymer was able to self-assemble in to smooth, spherical micellar structures with a CMC of similar to 3 mg mL(-1). The particle size of the micelles was similar to 14-30 nm as depicted using TEM and FESEM. Atomic force microscopic analysis showed an average height of similar to 12 nm for the polymeric micelles. An optimum doxorubicin loading of similar to 9% w/w was achieved with the micelles using a dialysis method. Effective complexation of siRNA occurred above a polymer/siRNA weight ratio of 10 without any significant change in the particle size. Doxorubicin and fluorescent labeled siRNA loaded micelles exhibited excellent co-localization within the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells. The synergistic effect of the active agents in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation was depicted using an MTT assay and visualized using calcein/propidium iodide staining of the treated cells. Co-administration of doxorubicin and plk1 siRNA in EAT tumor bearing Swiss albino mice using the cationic micelles significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy.

AB  - The anti-cancer activity of the benzo[h]quinolines was evaluated on cultured human skin cancer (G361), lung cancer (H460), breast cancer (MCF7) and colon cancer (HCT116) cell lines. The inhibitory effect of these compounds on the cell growth was determined by the MTT assay. The compounds 3e, 3f, 3h and 3j showed potential cytotoxicity against these human cancer cell lines. Effect of active compounds on DNA oxidation and expression of apoptosis related gene was studied. We also developed a quantitative method to measure the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases-2 (CDK2) by western blotting in the presence of active compound. In addition, molecular docking revealed that benzo[ h] quinolines can correctly dock into the hydrophobic pocket of the targets receptor protein aromatase and CDK2, while their bioavailability/drug-likeness was predicted to be acceptable but requires future optimization. These findings reveal that benzo[h]quinolines act as anti-cancer agents by inducing oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is an unexplained death in infants, which usually occurs during sleep. The cause of SIDS remains unknown and multifactorial. In this regard, the diving reflex (DR), a peripheral subtype of trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR), is also hypothesized as one of the possible mechanisms for this condition. The TCR is a well-established neurogenic reflex that manifests as bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, and gastric hypermotility. The TCR shares many similarities with the DR, which is a significant physiological adaptation to withstand hypoxia during apnea in many animal species including humans in clinical manifestation and mechanism of action. The DR is characterized by breath holding (apnea), bradycardia, and vasoconstriction, leading to increase in blood pressure. Several studies have described congenital anomalies of autonomic nervous system in the pathogenesis of SIDS such as hypoplasia, delayed neuronal maturation, or decreased neuronal density of arcuate nucleus, hypoplasia, and neuronal immaturity of the hypoglossal nucleus. The abnormalities of autonomic nervous system in SIDS may explain the role of TCR in this syndrome involving sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. We reviewed the available literature to identify the role of TCR in the etiopathogenesis of SIDS and the pathways and cellular mechanism involved in it. This synthesis will help to update our knowledge and improve our understanding about this mysterious, yet common condition and will open the door for further research in this field.

AB  - Background-The high burden of undetected and undertreated hypertension and diabetes mellitus is a major health challenge worldwide. The mPower Heart Project aimed to develop and test a feasible and scalable intervention for hypertension and diabetes mellitus by task-sharing with the use of a mobile phone-based clinical decision support system at Community Health Centers in Himachal Pradesh, India.
   Methods and Results-The development of the intervention and mobile phone-based clinical decision support system was carried out using mixed methods in five Community Health Centers. The intervention was subsequently evaluated using pre-post evaluation design. During intervention, a nurse care coordinator screened, examined, and entered patient parameters into mobile phone-based clinical decision support system to generate a prescription, which was vetted by a physician. The change in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) over 18 months of intervention was quantified using generalized estimating equations models. During intervention, 6797 participants were enrolled. Six thousand sixteen participants had hypertension (mean systolic blood pressure: 146.1 mm Hg, 95% CI: 145.7, 146.5; diastolic blood pressure: 89.52 mm Hg, 95% CI: 89.33, 89.72), of which 3152 (52%) subjects were newly detected. Similarly, 1516 participants had diabetes mellitus (mean FPG: 177.9 mg/dL, 95% CI: 175.8, 180.0), of which 450 (30%) subjects were newly detected. The changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and FPG observed at 18 months of follow-up were -14.6 mm Hg (95% CI: -15.3, -13.8), -7.6 mm Hg (CI: -8.0, -7.2), and -50.0 mg/dL (95% CI: -54.6, -45.5), respectively, and were statistically significant even after adjusting for age, sex, and Community Health Center.
   Conclusions-A nurse-facilitated, mobile phone-based clinical decision support system-enabled intervention in primary care was associated with improvements in blood pressure and blood glucose control and has the potential to scale-up in resource poor settings.

   Objectives: To investigate the role of hypothalamus in abnormal feeding behaviour after spinal cord injury (SCI) and the effect of exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) on it.
   Setting: India.
   Methods: Male Wistar rats (n=44) were divided into Sham (laminectomy), SCI (complete transection of T13 spinal cord), SCI+MF (ELF-MF exposure to SCI rats), VMHL (lesion of ventromedial hypothalamus; VMH), SCI+VMHL (VMHL after SCI) and SCI+VMHL+MF (ELF-MF exposure to SCI+VMHL rats) groups. Food intake (FI), water intake (WI), calorie intake (CI), body weight (BWT), taste preference and sucrose-induced biphasic (SIB) response to noxious stimulus were studied pre and post surgery. Neuronal activity at VMH was assessed by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. The extent of neuronal degeneration and regeneration in spinal cord was assessed microscopically.
   Results: Data revealed post-SCI decrease in FI, WI, CI and BWT, preference for sodium chloride and citric acid, prolonged analgesic phase of SIB and increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in VMH of SCI rats vs Sham rats. VMH lesion increased FI, WI, CI, BW, preference for sweet tastants and abolished SIB, whereas in SCI+VMHL rats it abolished the effects of SCI on these parameters indicating probable involvement of VMH in SCI-induced alteration in feeding behaviour. Exposure to MF improved the study parameters in SCI rats and reduced the c-Fos immunoreactivity in VMH besides reduction in lesion volume, greater myelination and neuronal regeneration at SCI site.
   Conclusion: SCI influences VMH, leading to alteration in feeding behaviour, which is improved by exposure to ELF-MF.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Efficacious ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu)-directed treatments, in addition to trastuzumab and lapatinib, are needed.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether neratinib, an irreversible pan-ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitor, plus paclitaxel improves progression-free survival compared with trastuzumab plus paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of recurrent and/ormetastatic ERBB2-positive breast cancer.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In the randomized, controlled, open-label NEfERT-T trial conducted from August 2009 to December 2014 at 188 centers in 34 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America, 479 women with previously untreated recurrent and/or metastatic ERBB2-positive breast cancer were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (neratinib-paclitaxel [n = 242] or trastuzumab-paclitaxel [n = 237]). Women with asymptomatic central nervous system metastases were eligible, and randomization was stratified by prior trastuzumab and lapatinib exposure, hormone-receptor status, and region.
   INTERVENTIONS Women received neratinib (240 mg/d orally) or trastuzumab (4 mg/kg then 2 mg/kg weekly), each combined with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days). Primary prophylaxis for diarrhea was not mandatory.
   MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary outcome was progression-free survival. Secondary end pointswere response rate, clinical benefit rate, duration of response, frequency, and time to symptomatic and/or progressive central nervous system lesions, and safety.
   RESULTS The intent-to-treat population comprised 479 women 18 years or older (neratinib-paclitaxel, n = 242; trastuzumab-paclitaxel, n = 237) randomized and stratified in their respective treatment arms by prior trastuzumab and lapatinib exposure, hormone-receptor status, and region. Median progression-free survival was 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1-14.9) with neratinib-paclitaxel and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1-14.8) with trastuzumab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.81-1.27; P =. 89). With neratinib-paclitaxel, the incidence of central nervous system recurrences was lower (relative risk, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29-0.79; P=.002) and time to central nervous system metastases delayed (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26-0.78; P=.004). Common grade 3 to 4 adverse events were diarrhea (73 of 240 patients [30.4%] with neratinib-paclitaxel and 9 of 234 patients [3.8%] with trastuzumab-paclitaxel), neutropenia (31 patients [12.9%] vs 34 patients [14.5%]) and leukopenia (19 patients [7.9%] vs 25 patients [10.7%]); no grade 4 diarrhea was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In first-line ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer, neratinib-paclitaxel was not superior to trastuzumab-paclitaxel in terms of progression-free survival. In spite of similar overall efficacy, neratinib-paclitaxel may delay the onset and reduce the frequency of central nervous system progression, a finding that requires a larger study to confirm.

AB  - Background: Laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) has been associated with a high incidence acute and chronic pain due to use of nonabsorbable tackers. Several absorbable tackers have been introduced to overcome these complications. This randomized study was done to compare 2 techniques of mesh fixation, that is, nonabsorbable versus absorbable tackers for LIVHR.
   Materials and Methods: Ninety patients admitted for LIVHR repair (defect size <15cm) were randomized into 2 groups: nonabsorbable tacker fixation (NAT group, 45 patients) and absorbable tacker fixation (AT group, 45 patients). Intraoperative variables and postoperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed.
   Results: Patients in both the groups were comparable in terms of demographic profile and hernia characteristics. Mesh fixation time and operation time were also comparable. There was no significant difference in the incidence of immediate postoperative and chronic pain over a mean follow-up of 8.8 months. However, cost of the procedure was significantly higher in AT group (P<0.01) and NAT fixation was more cost effective as compared with AT. Postoperative quality of life outcomes and patient satisfaction scores were also comparable.
   Conclusions: NAT is a cost-effective method of mesh fixation in patients undergoing LIVHR with comparable early and late postoperative outcomes in terms of pain, quality of life, and patient satisfaction scores.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of the present study was to compare the outcomes of secondary laparoscopic CBD exploration (LCBDE) following failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and primary laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) exploration. Materials and Methods: One hundred eighty-five patients undergoing LCBDE were divided into Group I consisting of patients undergoing a primary LCBDE (n=102) and Group II consisting of patients undergoing LCBDE after failure of ERCP to clear the CBD stones (n=83). Primary outcome measure was successful laparoscopic CBD clearance. The secondary outcome measures were degree of difficulty, operative time, complications, hospital stay, and the cost of treatment. Results: Success rate was similar in both groups (85.3% versus 80.7%). Mean operative time, degree of difficulty, hospital stay, and cost of procedure were significantly higher in Group II (P value <.05). Conclusion: It may be prudent to consider ERCP failure patients for primary LCBDE than risk the complications of ERCP if they are suitable for primary surgery.

AB  - Heating/frying and reuse of edible fats/oils induces chemical changes such as formation of trans fatty acids (TFAs). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of heating/frying on formation of TFAs in fats/oils. Using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector, TFA was estimated in six commonly used fat/oils in India (refined soybean oil, groundnut oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, clarified butter, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil), before and after subjecting them to heating/frying at 180 circle C and 220 circle C. All six fats/oils subjected to heating/frying demonstrated an increase in TFAs (p < 0.001), saturated fatty acids (p < 0.001) and decrease in cis-unsaturated fatty acids (p < 0.001). The absolute increase in TFA content of edible oils (after subjecting to heating/reheating) ranged between 2.30 +/- 0.89 g/100 g and 4.5 +/- 1.43 g/100 g; amongst edible fats it ranged between 2.60 +/- 0.38 g/100 g and 5.96 +/- 1.94 g/100 g. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups (heating and frying; p = 0.892). Considering the undesirable health effects of TFA, appropriate guidelines for heating/re-frying of edible fats/oils by Asian Indians should be devised. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) results from variations affecting the production and release of growth hormone (GH) and is of 2 types: isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) and combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). IGHD results from mutations in GH1 and GHRHR while CPHD is associated with defects in transcription factor genes PROP1, POU1F1, and HESX1. The present study reports on screening of POU1F1, PROP1, and HESX1 in CPHD patients and the novel variations identified. Fifty-one CPHD patients from 49 unrelated families clinically diagnosed on the basis of biochemical and imaging investigations along with 100 controls were enrolled. Detailed family history was noted from all participants and 5 ml blood samples drawn were processed for DNA isolation followed by direct sequencing of POU1F1, PROP1, and HES-X1genes. Of the 51 patients, 8 were females and 43 were males. Mean height standard deviation score (SDS) and weight SDS were -5.50 and -2.76, respectively. Thirty-six of the 51 patients underwent MRI of which 9 (25%) had normal pituitary structure and morphology while 27 (75%) showed abnormalities. Molecular analysis revealed 10 (20%) patients to have POU1F1 and PROP1 mutations/variations of which 5 were novel and 2 previously reported. No mutations were identified in HESX1. The novel variations identified were absent in the 100 healthy individuals screened and the control database Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Reported POU1F1 and PROP1 mutation hotspots were absent in our patients. Instead, novel POU1F1 changes were identified suggesting existence of a distinct mutation spectrum in our population.

AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest that India has the largest number of dengue virus infection cases worldwide. However, there is minimal information about the immunological responses in these patients. CD8 T cells are important in dengue, because they have been implicated in both protection and immunopathology. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of HLA-DR+ CD38(+) and HLA-DR- CD38(+) effector CD8 T cell subsets in dengue patients from India and Thailand. Both CD8 T cell subsets expanded and expressed markers indicative of antigen-driven proliferation, tissue homing, and cytotoxic effector functions, with the HLA-DR+ CD38(+) subset being the most striking in these effector qualities. The breadth of the dengue-specific CD8 T cell response was diverse, with NS3-specific cells being the most dominant. Interestingly, only a small fraction of these activated effector CD8 T cells produced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) when stimulated with dengue virus peptide pools. Transcriptomics revealed downregulation of key molecules involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Consistent with this, the majority of these CD8 T cells remained IFN-gamma unresponsive even after TCR-dependent polyclonal stimulation (anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28) but produced IFN-gamma by TCR-independent polyclonal stimulation (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA] plus ionomycin). Thus, the vast majority of these proliferating, highly differentiated effector CD8 T cells probably acquire TCR refractoriness at the time the patient is experiencing febrile illness that leads to IFN-gamma unresponsiveness. Our studies open novel avenues for understanding the mechanisms that fine-tune the balance between CD8 T cell-mediated protective versus pathological effects in dengue.
   IMPORTANCE
   Dengue is becoming a global public health concern. Although CD8 T cells have been implicated both in protection and in the cytokine-mediated immunopathology of dengue, how the balance is maintained between these opposing functions remains unknown. We comprehensively characterized CD8 T cell subsets in dengue patients from India and Thailand and show that these cells expand massively and express phenotypes indicative of overwhelming antigenic stimulus and tissue homing/cytotoxiceffector functions but that a vast majority of them fail to produce IFN-gamma in vitro. Interestingly, the cells were fully capable of producing the cytokine when stimulated in a T cell receptor (TCR)-independent manner but failed to do so in TCR-dependent stimulation. These results, together with transcriptomics, revealed that the vast majority of these CD8 T cells from dengue patients become cytokine unresponsive due to TCR signaling insufficiencies. These observations open novel avenues for understanding the mechanisms that fine-tune the balance between CD8-mediated protective versus pathological effects.

AB  - Background: Optimal development of children in their early months and years has a bearing on their achievement levels later in life.
   Objectives: To assess the socio-emotional and cognitive development in children 0-5 years and to find out the proportion of children having developmental delay and its associated factors.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in 520 children in Delhi. Development was assessed using the Indian Council for Medical Research Development Screening Test.
   Results: In all, 10.6% of children < 5 years old were found to be developmentally delayed. Maximum number of children (10.1%) were found to have a delay in the do main of 'hearing language, concept development'. Of all the factors, the strongest association was found with stunting, paternal education, alcohol abuse, attendance in anganwadi/playschool.
   Conclusions: The study concludes that developmental delay is present in a sizable proportion of children < 5 years of age and may be a significant factor in the overall achievement of life's potential in them.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the metabolic profile of milk on day 3 and at the 6th month of lactation in mothers with preeclampsia (PE) and normotensive mothers.
   Study design: Women with PE (n = 29) and control women (n = 31) were recruited for this study. Milk was collected on day 3 and at the 6th month of lactation. Proton NMR spectroscopy was used to identify 25 milk metabolites (alpha-lactose, beta-lactose, oligosaccharides, myo-inositol, alanine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, valine, acetone, citrate, creatine, phosphocreatine, acetate, choline, lactate, lipid, phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine). Principle component analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were carried out to identify differences in milk metabolite composition between both the groups.
   Results: The levels of milk metabolites varied between the control and PE groups. Alpha and beta-lactose, glycine, glycerophosphocholine (p < 0.01 for all); glutamate, glutamine and phosphocholine levels (p < 0.05 for all) were increased at the 6th month as compared to day 3 of lactation in the control group. However, in the PE group, only glycerophosphocholine level showed an increase (p < 0.01) at the 6th month. The levels of acetate, acetone (p < 0.05 for both) and creatine (p < 0.01) decreased at the 6th month as compared to day 3 of lactation in both groups. However, the levels of oligosaccharides were similar between groups and also similar at day 3 and at the 6th month of lactation.
   Conclusion: Our data indicates differential levels of metabolites in the milk of women with PE. Future studies are required to investigate the associations between milk components and infant growth and development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During a routine dissection class for the undergraduate students at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, a rare uncommon variation of the peritoneal ligament was found. Information regarding variation in such type of accessory peritoneal reflections is necessary for anatomists, surgeons, and radiologists. Normally there was no peritoneal reflection between gallbladder, duodenum and transverse colon, but in the present case report, it was present and termed as cysto-duodeno-colic ligament. Knowledge of such variation is necessary during gallbladder surgeries and liver transplantation surgeries.

AB  - Despite great advances in our understanding of the process of epileptogenesis we are yet to develop reliable biomarkers that have the potential to accurately localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ), and to resolve the issue of heterogeneity in epilepsy surgery outcome. Inability to precisely localize the epileptogenic foci is one of the reason why more than 30% of these DRE patients are not benefited. Molecular and cellular biomarkers in combination with imaging and electrical investigations will provide a more specific platform for defining epileptogenic zone. Potential molecular biomarkers of epileptogenesis including markers of inflammation, synaptic alterations and neurodegeneration may also have the potential for localizing EZ. At molecular level components derived from epileptogenic tissues, such as metabolites, proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs that are significantly altered can serve as biomarkers and can be clubbed with existing techniques to preoperatively localize the EZ. Neurosurgeons across the world face problems while defining the margins of the epileptogenic tissues to be resected during surgery. In this review we discuss molecular biomarkers reported so far in the context of epileptogenesis and some of the unexplored markers which may have the potential to localize EZ during surgery. We also discuss "Intelligent knife" technique that couples electrosurgery and mass spectrometry allowing near-real-time characterization of human tissue and may prove to be instrumental in defining the margins of the epileptogenic zone during surgery.

AB  - Temporomandibular joint ankylosis is a unique disease where fracture of the mandibular condyle or any other cause leading to ankylosis of the joint can lead to multiple problems if not detected and treated early. If affected in early years of life, it may cause facial dysmorphism, restricted mouth opening, and difficulty in eating, speech, and sleep. Early surgery and physiotherapy can restore the joint function to a great extent. Anesthetizing a pediatric patient with this disorder is a definite challenge which needs expertise in difficult airway management.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) developed due to the insult of trauma is a leading cause of death. The high mortality rate in these patients with and without sepsis has been reported up to 50%, throughout the world and thus required an urgent insight to overcome this problem.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the differential changes in subsets of T cells, imbalance in cytokine profile, immune-paralysis (T cell anergy) in Trauma hemorrhagic shock (THS) and post traumatic sepsis patients.
   Methodology: 114, THS patients and 50 healthy controls were recruited in the present study. We have measured the T cell proliferation assay using dominant antigens of both gram positive (LTA, 100 ng/ml) and gram negative (LPS-100 ng/ml) bacteria and PHA (4 mu g/ml) using radioactive thymidine (1H(3)) assay. Simultaneously, we have measured the culture supernatant level of cytokines using Cytokine bead assay (CBA). The other parts of this study include the analysis of different subsets of T cells.
   Results and conclusion: We observed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced T cell proliferation in THS patients as compared to control. Our study also showed patients died due to sepsis/septic shock, had significantly (p < 0.05) lower T cell response and had significantly elevated levels of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-beta, but low level of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in culture supernatant. THS patients who developed sepsis complication had significantly higher T regulatory cells and lower Th17 cells in comparison to non-sepsis. In conclusion, our study showed an imbalance in cell mediated immune response and disturbance in Th1/Th2/Th17 and T reg population of T helper cells and also the shifts towards Th2 and T17 in THS patients who had developed sepsis and showed poor outcomes.

AB  - To evaluate long-term success of the Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) for refractory glaucoma after vitreoretinal surgery with silicone oil insertion.
   Prospective non-comparative evaluation of patients who underwent AGV insertion for management of post-vitreoretinal surgery glaucoma, post-silicone oil removal. Intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, and glaucomatous neuropathy status were evaluated preoperatively and at multiple follow-up visits postoperatively. Success, using Kaplan-Meier analysis, was determined at the 12-month follow-up visit and at the last follow-up. Factors associated with failure were analysed.
   Twenty-seven eyes of 27 patients with a mean age of 28.3 +/- 15.2 years underwent a superior AGV implantation. The average follow-up after AGV implantation was 17.11 +/- 8.36 months (range: 9-60 months). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a 62 % success at 12 months and 37 % at 5 years. A 48 % rate of complications was noted, 22 % of which were vision-threatening. Factors analysed, including patient age, interval between vitreoretinal surgery and silicone oil removal, interval between vitreoretinal surgery and AGV implantation, and phakic status, were not found to be associated with higher failure rates.
   Long-term success of AGV implantation for glaucoma after vitreoretinal surgery with silicone oil insertion is better than that reported for trabeculectomy, though complication rates remain high.

AB  - Light causes damage to the retina, which is one of the supposed factors for age-related macular degeneration in human. Some animal species show drastic retinal changes when exposed to intense light (e.g. albino rats). Although birds have a pigmented retina, few reports indicated its susceptibility to light damage. To know how light influences a cone-dominated retina (as is the case with human), we examined the effects of moderate light intensity on the retina of white Leghorn chicks (Gallus g. domesticus). The newly hatched chicks were initially acclimatized at 500 lux for 7 days in 12 h light: 12 h dark cycles (12L:12D). From posthatch day (PH) 8 until PH 30, they were exposed to 2000 lux at 12L:12D, 18L:6D (prolonged light) and 24L:0D (constant light) conditions. The retinas were processed for transmission electron microscopy and the level of expressions of rhodopsin, S- and L/M cone opsins, and synaptic proteins (Synaptophysin and PSD-95) were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Rearing in 24L:0D condition caused disorganization of photoreceptor outer segments. Consequently, there were significantly decreased expressions of opsins and synaptic proteins, compared to those seen in 12L:12D and 18L:6D conditions. Also, there were ultrastructural changes in outer and inner plexiform layer (OPL, IPL) of the retinas exposed to 24L:0D condition. Our data indicate that the cone-dominated chick retina is affected in constant light condition, with changes (decreased) in opsin levels. Also, photoreceptor alterations lead to an overall decrease in synaptic protein expressions in OPL and IPL and death of degenerated axonal processes in IPL.

AB  - The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is one of the most widely used questionnaire for the assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). This study was conducted to assess the validity of ESS in the Hindi language.
   The Hindi version was developed by translation and back translation by independent translators. The English and Hindi versions were administered to 115 bilingual subjects who presented with symptoms of SDB, of whom 98 underwent a polysomnography at a tertiary care hospital in North India.
   The questionnaire had a high level of internal consistency as measured by Cronbach's alpha (alpha = 0.84). There was no significant difference between the mean ESS scores of Hindi and English versions (11.65 +/- 5.47 vs 11.70 +/- 5.49, respectively; p = 0.80). The Hindi version of ESS showed a strong correlation with the English version (Spearman's correlation rho = 0.98 and weighted kappa = 0.94). Each of the 8 individual questions of Hindi ESS demonstrated a good agreement with the corresponding English version. The Hindi ESS score was significantly higher in subjects with OSA compared to those without OSA (12.67 +/- 5.29 vs 7.76 +/- 5.44, respectively; p = 0.002). However, there was no difference in ESS score between mild and moderate OSA or between moderate and severe OSA.
   The Hindi version of the ESS showed a good internal consistency and a strong correlation with the English version and can be used in the Hindi-speaking population.

AB  - Medulloblastoma (MB) is a childhood tumor comprising four molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH, group 3 and group 4, with diagnostic and prognostic connotations. Very few studies are available on molecular subgrouping of adult MBs due to their rarity. Recently, loss of chromosome14q has been reported in SHH MBs, with downregulation of miR-379/miR-656 cluster (C14MC) in pediatric SHH MBs. Hence, the present study on adult MBs was undertaken to enumerate clinicopathological characteristics and molecular subgroups, and to analyze expression of C14MC and its transcriptional regulators, MEF2, JUN and ESRRG. Immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin, GAB1 and YAP1 was performed to identify molecular subgroups. MYC amplification was evaluated by FISH. Expression profiling of 47 miRNAs from C14MC was performed using customized Taqman low-density array. Expression of transcriptional regulators was examined using RT-PCR. Seventy-one adult MBs were analyzed. They had male predominance and majority were located laterally (52 %). A significant proportion of cases were of Desmoplastic/nodular histology (32 %); MBEN was not seen. WNT tumors constituted 4.2 %, SHH 62 %, and non-WNT/non-SHH 33.8 %. MYC amplification was identified in 11.1 % cases. Patient outcome was worse in adults. Significant downregulation of C14MC was observed in all MB subgroups, and MEF-2 expression was downregulated. Adult MBs are distinct from childhood MBs in terms of location, histopathological subtypes, molecular subgroups, as well as prognosis. Silencing of C14MC in all MB subgroups suggests its role as a tumor suppressor locus in tumorigenesis. Deregulation of C14MC can possibly be attributed to repression of MEF2.

AB  - Neuroblastoma-like schwannoma is an extremely rare histological variant of schwannoma, which histologically mimics a malignant small round cell tumor. Only 19 cases have been reported in the literature to date. We report a case of this tumor located at the skull base in a 44-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of right-sided earache and hearing loss. MRI revealed a large, lobulated, extra-axial mass measuring 8.8 cm x 3.6 cm x 4.2 cm in the floor of the middle and posterior cranial fossa. Microscopic examination revealed a perplexing histopathology with peculiar collagenous rosettes. Differential diagnoses included a broad range of benign and malignant tumors. Typical schwannoma seldom poses a difficulty in diagnosis; however, this unusual variant is a diagnostic challenge which requires an extensive clinico-radiological correlation and immunohistochemical work-up. Hence, knowledge of this entity is a must to avoid erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate treatment.

AB  - Aim: To compare ormeloxifene with combined oral contraceptive (COC) in abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) due to leiomyoma (AUB-L).
   Methods: Fifty women with AUB-L were randomized after informed consent and institute ethics clearance. Group I (n = 25) was given ormeloxifene (a SERM i.e. selective estrogen receptor modulator) 60 mg twice per week and group II (n = 25) was given COC (ethinyl estradiol 30 mu g with desogestrel 150 mu g) on days 1-21 for 6 months. Menstrual blood loss was assessed on pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score and leiomyoma volume was assessed on ultrasound. Fibroids were classified according to FIGO-PALM-COEIN classification for AUB where leiomyomas were further sub-classified as types 0 to 8 according to their location. Follow up was done at 1, 3, 6 and 9 months.
   Results: Mean PBAC score reduced by 81% with ormeloxifene (group I) compared with 43.8% for COC (group II). After 6 months, 18 patients (72%) in group I had PBAC score in the non-menorrhagic range (<100) compared with only two (8%) in group II. In group I, PBAC score in FIGO-PALM-COEIN leiomyoma types 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 reduced by 90.2%, 82.5%, 93.3%, 56.4% and 100%, respectively and 14 (56%) developed amenorrhea; compared with reduction of 64%, 27.5%, 25.9% in types 4, 5 and 6, respectively in group II. Dysmenorrhea visual analog scale score decreased in both groups. Mean leiomyoma volume increased in both groups: by 25.7% with ormeloxifene versus 16.9% with COC; only grade 2 leiomyoma in group I reduced by 44%. One patient in group II with grade 2 leiomyoma discontinued treatment at 3 months. Seven patients (28%) developed ovarian cyst in group I with no other major adverse effect in either group.
   Conclusion: Ormeloxifene with its convenient twice-weekly dosage schedule was effective in treating AUB-L, with 72% of patients responding to 6-month treatment compared with 8% with COC, even though leiomyoma volume increased insignificantly with both ormeloxifene and COCs.

AB  - Introduction: The middle cranial fossa (MCF) in human skulls is characterized by extremely complex architecture and dense crowding of structures traversing the various foramina present in its floor. Despite the numerous variations exhibited by these foramina and their critical importance to neurosurgeons operating in this area, comprehensive accounts of metric and non-metric data on MCF foramina are quite scarce in literature. The present study aims to bridge this gap in knowledge.
   Methods: Fifty well-preserved dry, macerated adult (age >20 yrs) skulls were obtained from the Anatomy departments of AIIMS and other medical colleges in Delhi. Each skull was examined for all the MCF foramina and the variations noted. The foramina were digitally photographed for morphometric data with reference to sex and side (left/right) using ImageJ software.
   Results: The data survey revealed numerous individual variations in the metric and/or non-metric characteristics of each MCF foramen. The foramina ovale, rotundum, spinosum & lacerum were found to be consistently present in all 50 skulls whereas some skulls exhibited the foramen of Vesalius (unilateral 17%; bilateral 12%) and canaliculus innominatus (5%). The data on maximum diameter and area tabulated for each foramen revealed significant individual, sex and side variations.
   Discussion: The present study found several variations in the shape, size, dimensions, laterality and frequency of foramina present in the MCF floor. The little data existing in literature about these foramina compares well with these findings. The neurosurgical importance of baseline data pertaining to MCF foramina among various ethnic and demographic groups cannot be overstated. (C) 2017 Anatomical Society of India.

AB  - The prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has improved significantly in the past two decades. This is attributed to use of novel agents for induction, high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), maintenance therapy, and improved supportive care. Currently, evidence-based management guidelines recommendations developed by International societies/groups are being followed partially in low-resource settings. Lack of quality diagnostics (eg, cytogenetics/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), serum free light chains), novel therapeutics, and trained manpower, and limited financial resources are key challanges. An optimal utilization of available resources with continued educational activities of treating physicians focused on improving knowledge in the management of such patients may be a way forward to improve the outcome of myeloma patients in these countries. Our current approach to the management of this disease is presented here through a discussion of clinical vignettes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dysregulation in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression has been observed in distinct acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes, and their potential as an effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarker is slowly being realized. Certain miRNAs have been found to be associated with various cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities of prognostic significance in AML. Experimental evidences have indicated the potential of modulating miRNA expression as an effective antileukaemic strategy. This has opened a new window for miRNAs-based targeted therapies. In this review, we present results of some studies analyzing the dysregulation in miRNAs expression pattern in paediatric AML and also discuss their use as diagnostic and prognostic markers.

TI  - Innovating affordable neonatal care equipment for use at scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - The care of small and sick neonates requires biomedical technologies, such as devices that can keep babies warm (radiant warmers and incubators), resuscitate (self-inflating bags), track growth (weighing scales), treat jaundice (phototherapy units) and provide oxygen or respiratory support (hoods, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices and ventilators). Until the 1990s, most of these products were procured through import at a high cost and with little maintenance support. Emerging demand and an informal collaboration of neonatologists, engineers and entrepreneurs has led to the production of good quality equipment of several high-volume categories at affordable cost in India. Radiant warmers, resuscitation bags, phototherapy units, weighing scales and other devices manufactured by Indian small-scale companies have enabled an expansion of neonatal care in the country, particularly in district hospitals, medical college hospitals and subdistrict facilities in the public sector as a part of the National Rural Health Mission. Indian products have acquired international quality standards and are even exported to developed nations. This paper captures this story of innovation and entrepreneurship in neonatal care.

AB  - The hypoxic microenvironment is an important contributor of glioblastoma (GBM) aggressiveness via HIF1, while tumour inflammation is profoundly influenced by FAT Atypical Cadherin (FAT1). This study was designed to explore the functional interaction and significance of FAT1 and HIF1 under severe hypoxia-mimicking tumour microenvironment in primary human tumours. We first identified a positive correlation of FAT1 with HIF1 and its target genes in GBM tumour specimens, revealing the significance of the FAT1-HIF1 axis in glioma cells. We found that severe hypoxia leads to an increased expression of FAT1 and HIF1 in U87MG and U373MG cells. To reveal the relevance of FAT1 under hypoxic conditions, we depleted endogenous FAT1 under hypoxia and found a substantial reduction in the expression of HIF1 and its downstream target genes like CA9, GLUT1, VEGFA, MCT4, HK2, BNIP3 and REDD1, as well as a significant reduction in the invasiveness in GBM cells. At the molecular level, under hypoxia the FAT1 depletion-associated reduction in HIF1 was due to compromised EGFR-Akt signaling as well as increased VHL-dependent proteasomal degradation of HIF1. In brief, for the first time, these results reveal an upstream master regulatory role of FAT1 in the expression and role of HIF1 under hypoxic conditions and that FAT1-HIF1 axis controls the invasiveness of GBM. Hence, FAT1 represents a novel potential therapeutic target for GBM.
   What's new? The hypoxic microenvironment is an important contributor of glioblastoma aggressiveness via HIF1 while tumor inflammation is profoundly influenced by FAT Atypical Cadherin (FAT1). This study explores the functional interaction of FAT1 and HIF1 in severe hypoxia-mimicking tumor microenvironments. The results show that FAT1 upregulation is critical for enhancing and maintaining high HIFI levels in tumors with severe hypoxia. FAT1 both increases HIFI transcription and decreases HIFI degradation in glioblastoma multiforme cell lines under hypoxic conditions. With FAT1 regulating the activity of HIF1 under hypoxic condition and the FAT1-HIF1 axis controlling the invasiveness of glioblastoma, FAT1 represents a novel potential therapeutic target for glioblastomas.

AB  - Anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been extensively tested against pesudoviruses of diverse strains. We generated and characterized HIV-1 primary isolates from antiretroviral naive infected Indian children, and determined their susceptibility to known NAbs. All the 8 isolates belonged to subtype-C and were R5 tropic. Majority of these viruses were resistant to neutralization by NAbs, suggesting that the bnAbs, known to efficiently neutralize pseudoviruses (adult and pediatric) of different strains, are less effective against pediatric primary isolates. Interestingly, AIIMS_329 isolate displayed high susceptibility to neutralization by PG9 and PG16bnAbs, with IC50 titer of 1.3 and 0.97 mu g/ml, suggesting exposure of this epitope on this virus. All isolates except AIIMS_506 were neutralized by contemporaneous plasma antibodies. Our findings suggest that primary isolates, due to close resemblance to viruses in natural infection, should be used to evaluate NAbs as effective vaccine candidates in both children and adults.

AB  - Purpose. To review the outcome of total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a short femoral stem in 33 hips.
   Methods. Records of 33 hips in 20 men and 10 women aged 25 to 40 (mean, 30) years who underwent cementless THA using a short femoral stem by a single senior surgeon were reviewed. The diagnosis included avascular necrosis (n=9), ankylosing spondylitis (n=12), rheumatoid arthritis (n=7), post traumatic arthritis (n=4), and Hurler syndrome (n=1). Clinical outcome was assessed using the Harris Hip Score. Radiological outcome was assessed according to a modified Gruen zoning system. Stem positioning (neutral, varus, valgus) and bone contact were evaluated, as were fixation and early host response as well as subsidence and changes in the calcar region (zone 5). Trabecular response (trabecular attachment), spot welds, cortical hypertrophy, and pedestal formation were determined. Heterotopic ossification was graded by the Brooker classification.
   Results. The mean follow-up period was 6.5 years. The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 40 to 90. All hips achieved immediate postoperative stability. No patient had thigh pain.. Four hips had varus placement (5-7) of the stem; all were asymptomatic and remained stable without any migration. Evidence of proximal load transfer (endosteal spot welds) between the endosteum and the stem in zones 2 and/or 4 was noted in 12 hips on both sides and in 8 hips on the lateral side only. At one year, all stems showed evidence of osseointegration. None had subsidence or progressive varus migration. There was no radiolucent line or osteolysis around the stem, pedestal formation or buttressing at the prosthesis tip, or cortical hypertrophy. One patient had grade I heterotopic ossification that was not clinically significant. One patient had a 1.5 cm leg lengthening. One patient had a discharging sinus, a loosened acetabular component, and intrapelvic migration at 2 years and underwent implant removal and debridement. One patient developed a crack in the proximal femur even with the smallest stem. The stem was fixed with cerclage wiring and remained stable with no migration.
   Conclusion. A short femoral stem design that transfers load proximally through a prominent lateral flare achieved good short-term outcome in younger patients. Nonetheless, the ease of removal and preservation of bone at the time of revision should guide the choice of the design of the short stem.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D deficiency is a widely recognized public health problem. Efficacy of a recently developed micellized form of vitamin D3 has not been studied. Hence, we undertook this study to compare its efficacy with the conventionally used fat-soluble vitamin D3.
   Methods: In this open-labeled nonrandomized pilot study, we recruited 180 healthy children, aged 13-14 years in two groups and supplemented Group A (60 children) with 60,000 IU of fat-soluble vitamin D3/month with milk and Group B (120 children) with 60,000 IU/month of water miscible vitamin D3 under supervision for 6 months. Serum 25(OD) D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were evaluated before and after supplementation in 156 children (54 in Group A and 102 in Group B) who completed the study.
   Results: We observed a significantly greater increase in the serum 25(OH) D levels in group B as compared to group A (31.8 +/- 9.1 ng/mL vs. 23.7 +/- 10.4 ng/mL; p < 0.001). All children in group B achieved adequate levels of serum 25(OH) D (> 20 ng/mL) as against 83.3% children in group A. Serum PTH and ALP levels declined considerably in both the groups following supplementation.
   Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation significantly increased the serum 25(OH) D levels in both groups. Miscible form of vitamin D3 appears to be better in achieving higher levels of serum 25(OH) D than that observed with a similar dose of fat-soluble vitamin D3. Further studies with different dose regimens are required to establish its efficacy over the conventionally used fat-soluble vitamin D3.

AB  - The two important issues affecting recipients of solid organ transplants and of importance to immunologists are (i) sensitization of the recipient to HLA antigens and the resultant humoral immune response leading to the development of anti-HLA antibodies; and ii) development of robust assays for early detection of humoral rejection post-transplant. Evidence from several studies clearly indicates that presence of circulating anti-HLA antibodies especially donor specific leads to early graft loss and high titres of DSA may even lead to hyperacute or accelerated acute rejection. Long-term graft survival too is adversely affected by the presence of either pre-or post-transplant DSA. HLA matching status of the recipient - donor pair - is an important factor in the modulation of humoral response following transplantation and in a way affects de novo development of DSA. Data collected over the past decade clearly indicate significantly lower level of DSAs in optimally matched donor-recipient pairs. HLA mismatches especially those on HLA-DR and HLA-C loci have wider implications on post-transplant graft survival. The presence of circulating anti-HLA antibodies leads to endothelial damage in the newly grafted organ through complement dependent or independent pathways. Although detection of C4d deposition in renal biopsies serves as an important indicator of humoral rejection, its absence does not preclude the presence of DSAs and humoral rejection, and hence, it cannot be relied upon in every case. The emergence of epitope-based screening for anti-HLA antibodies on Luminex platform with high degree of sensitivity has revolutionized the screening for anti-HLA antibodies and DSAs. Studies indicate that humoral response to non-HLA antigens might also have a detrimental effect on allograft survival. High titres of such circulating antibodies may even lead to hyperacute rejection. Pre-emptive testing of solid organ recipients, especially kidney transplant recipients for anti-HLA and non-HLA antibodies and aggressive post-transplant monitoring of allograft function to detect DSAs using Luminex-based tests, is highly recommended.

AB  - As part of a multicenter project supported by the World Health Organization, we developed a web-based intervention to reduce alcohol use and related problems. We evaluated the predictors of adherence to, and the outcomes of the intervention. Success was defined as a reduction in consumption to low risk levels or to <50% of the baseline levels of number of drinks. From the 32,401 people who accessed the site, 3389 registered and 929 completed the full Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a necessary condition to be considered eligible to take part in the intervention. Based on their AUDIT scores, these participants were classified into: low risk users (LRU; n = 319) harmful/hazardous users (HHU; n = 298) or suggestive of dependence users (SDU; n = 312). 29.1% of the registered users (LRU = 42; HHU = 90; SDU = 82) completed the evaluation form at the end of the six-week period, and 63.5% reported low-risk drinldng levels. We observed a significant reduction in alcohol consumption in the HHU (62.5%) and SDU (64.5%) groups in relation to baseline. One month after the intervention, in the follow-up, 94 users filled out the evaluation form, and their rate of success was similar to the one observed in the previous evaluation. Logistic regression analyses indicated that HHU participants presented higher adherence than LRU. Despite a relatively low adherence to the program, its good outcomes and low cost, as well as the high number of people that can be reached by a web-based intervention, suggest it has good cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare heterogeneous neoplasm of variable aggressiveness. A 55-year-old woman underwent Ga-68-DOTANOC PET-CT for suspected NET, which revealed DOTANOC-avid soft tissue mass in the second part of the duodenum with multiple hepatic metastases. Another non-DOTANOC-avid abdominal mass and hypodense lesion in segment VI of the liver were noted. For further evaluation, FDG PET-CT was performed, which revealed increased uptake in the abdominal mass and lesion in segment VI of the liver. Biopsy from the previously mentioned lesions revealed poorly differentiated high-grade NET.

AB  - Vaccine immunogen with expanded T cell coverage for protection against HIV-1 diversity is the need of the hour. This study was undertaken to examine the ability of T cells to respond to a broad spectrum of potential T cell epitope (PTE) peptides containing variable as well as conserved sequences that would most accurately reflect immune responses to different circulating strains. Set of 320 PTE peptides were pooled in a matrix format that included 40 pools of 32 peptides per pool. These pools were used in interferon- enzyme-linked immunospot assay for screening and confirmation of HIV-1 PTE Gag-specific T cell immune responses in 34 HIV-1 seropositive Indian individuals. Deconvolute This software was used for result analysis. The dominant target in terms of magnitude and breadth of responses was observed to be the p24 subunit of Gag protein. Of the 34 study subjects, 26 (77%) showed a response to p24 PTE Gag peptides, 17 (50%) to p17, and 17 (50%) responded to p15 PTE peptides. The total breadth and magnitude of immune response ranged from 0.75 to 14.50 and 95.02 to 1,103 spot-forming cells/10(6) cells, respectively. Seventy-six peptides located in p24 Gag were targeted by 77% of the study subjects followed by 51 peptides in p17 Gag and 46 peptides in p15 Gag with multiple variants being recognized. Maximum study participants recognized PTE peptide sequence Gag(271285)NKIVRMYSPVSILDI located in p24 Gag subunit. T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals can recognize multiple PTE peptide variants, although the magnitude of the responses can vary greatly across these variants.

AB  - Neonatal units in teaching and non-teaching hospitals both in public and private hospitals have been increasing in number in the country since the sixties. In 1994, a District Newborn Care Programme was introduced as a part of the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Programme (CSSM) in 26 districts. Inpatient care of small and sick newborns in the public health system got a boost under National Rural Health Mission with the launch of the national programme on facility-based newborn care (FBNC). This has led to a nationwide creation of Newborn Care Corners (NBCC) at every point of child birth, newborn stabilization units (NBSUs) at First Referral Units (FRUs) and special newborn care units (SNCUs) at district hospitals. Guidelines and toolkits for standardized infrastructure, human resources and services at each level have been developed and a system of reporting data on FBNC created. Till March 2015, there were 565 SNCUs, 1904 NBSUs and 14 163 NBCCs operating in the country. There has been considerable progress in operationalizing SNCUs at the district hospitals; however establishing a network of SNCUs, NBSUs and NBCCs as a composite functional unit of newborn care continuum at the district level has lagged behind. NBSUs, the first point of referral for the sick newborn, have not received the desired attention and have remained a weak link in most districts. Other challenges include shortage of physicians, and hospital beds and absence of mechanisms for timely repair of equipment. With admission protocols not being adequately followed and a weak NBSU system, SNCUs are faced with the problem of admission overload and poor quality of care. Applying best practices of care at SNCUs, creating more NBSU linkages and strengthening NBCCs are important steps toward improving quality of FBNC. This can be further improved with regular monitoring and mentoring from experienced pediatricians, and nurses drawn from medical colleges and the private sector. In addition there is a need to further increase such units to address the unmet need of facility-based care.

AB  - India has contributed immensely toward generating evidence on two key domains of newborn care: Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) and community mobilization. In a model developed in Gadchiroli (Maharashtra) in the 1990s, a package of Interventions delivered by community health workers during home visits led to a marked decline in neonatal deaths. On the basis of this experience, the national HBNC program centered around Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) was introduced in 2011, and is now the main community level program in newborn health. Earlier in 2004, the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) program was rolled out with inclusion of home visits by Anganwadi Worker as an integral component. IMNCI has been implemented in 505 districts in 27 states and 4 union territories. A mix of Anganwadi Workers, ASHAs, auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs) was trained. The rapid roll out of IMNCI program resulted in improving quality of newborn care at the ground field. However; since 2012 the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare decided to limit the IMNCI program to ANMs only and leaving the Anganwadi component to the stewardship of the Integrated Child Development Services. ASHAs, the frontline workers for HBNC, receive four rounds of training using two modules. There are a total of over 900-000 ASHAs per link workers in the country, out of which, only 14% have completed the fourth round of training. The pace of uptake of the HBNC program has been slow. Of the annual rural birth cohort of over 17 million, about 4 million newborns have been visited by ASHA during the financial year 2013-2014 and out of this 120 000 neonates have been identified as sick and referred to health facilities for higher level of neonatal care. Supportive supervision remains a challenge, the role of ANMs in supervision needs more clarity and there are issues surrounding quality of training and the supply of HBNC kits. The program has low visibility in many states. Now is the time to tap the missed opportunity of miniscule coverage of HBNC; that at least half of the country's birth cohort should be covered by this program by 2016, coupled with rapid scale up of the community-based treatment of neonates with pneumonia or sepsis, where referral is not possible.

AB  - This paper provides HIV estimation methodology used in India and key HIV estimates for 2010-2011. We used a modified version of the Spectrum tool that included an Estimation and Projection Package as part of its AIDS Impact Module. Inputs related to population size, age-specific pattern of fertility, gender-ratio at birth, age and gender-specific pattern of mortality, and volume and age-gender distribution of net migration were derived from census records, the Sample Registration System and large-scale demographic health surveys. Epidemiological and programmatic data were derived from HIV sentinel surveillance, large-scale epidemiological surveys and the programme management information system. Estimated adult HIV prevalence retained a declining trend in India, following its peak in 2002 at a level of 0.41% (within bounds 0.35-0.47%). By 2010 and 2011, it levelled at estimates of 0.28% (0.24-0.34%) and 0.27% (0.22-0.33%), respectively. The estimated number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) reduced by 8% between 2007 and 2011. While children accounted for approximately 6.3% of total HIV infections in 2007, this proportion increased to about 7% in 2011. With changing priorities and epidemic patterns, the programme has to customise its strategies to effectively address the emerging vulnerabilities and adapt them to suit the requirements of different geographical regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To prospectively evaluate the surgical complications of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma surgery and assess perioperative hemodynamic outcomes in terms of risk for intraoperative vasodilator use and risk for postoperative vasopressor requirements in these patients.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS This was an institutional review board-approved prospective observational study of patients undergoing pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma surgery. Operative and recovery data for all patients undergoing open, laparoscopic, and robotic surgery were analyzed for surgical complications on the modified Clavien-Dindo classification. The need for intraoperative vasodilators for pressure spikes of greater than 180 mmHg and vasopressor support after surgery was recorded. Factors predictive of these parameters were assessed.
   RESULTS Forty patients underwent 45 procedures including five bilateral adrenalectomies over the 2-year study period. This included 40 adrenalectomies and 5 paraganglioma excisions. Twenty-nine patients had minimally invasive surgery (25 laparoscopic, 4 robot-assisted) and 11 had open surgery. Sixty percent of patients required intraoperative vasodilators for hypertensive crisis, and this was significantly related to the size of the tumor (P = .02). The need for postoperative vasopressors was related to the number of intraoperative pressure spikes (P = .007). Five percent of the patients suffered a complication greater than grade 2 on the Clavien-Dindo classification.
   CONCLUSION Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma surgeries are associated with minimal postoperative morbidity. Larger tumors may be associated with greater intraoperative pressure surges, but this does not impact patient outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Biomass cooking fuels are commonly used in Indian households, especially by the poorest socioeconomic groups. Cataract is highly prevalent in India and the major cause of vision loss. The evidence on biomass fuels and cataract is limited.
   Objectives: To examine the association of biomass cooking fuels with cataract and type of cataract.
   Methods: We conducted a population-based study in north and south India using randomly sampled clusters to identify people >= 60 years old. Participants were interviewed and asked about cooking fuel use, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors and attended hospital for digital lens imaging (graded using the Lens Opacity Classification System III), anthropometry, and blood collection. Years of use of biomass fuels were estimated and transformed to a standardized normal distribution.
   Results: Of the 7,518 people sampled, 94% were interviewed and 83% of these attended the hospital. Sex modified the association between years of biomass fuel use and cataract; the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a 1-SD increase in years of biomass fuel use and nuclear cataract was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.23) for men and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.48) for women, p interaction= 0.07. Kerosene use was low (10%). Among women, kerosene use was associated with nuclear (OR= 1.76, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.97) and posterior subcapsular cataract (OR= 1.71, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.64). There was no association among men.
   Conclusions: Our results provide robust evidence for the association of biomass fuels with cataract for women but not for men. Our finding for kerosene and cataract among women is novel and requires confirmation in other studies.

AB  - To determine the prevalence and distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis genovars in patients with infertility by PCR-RFLP and ompA gene sequencing. Prevalence of other etiological agents (viz., Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis) were also assessed. Endocervical swabs were collected from 477 women and urine was collected from 151 men attending the Infertility Clinic. The samples were screened for C. trachomatis by cryptic plasmid, ompA gene and nested ompA gene PCR. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Samples were screened for Ureaplasma spp. and M. hominis. The prevalence of C. trachomatis in infertile women and their male partners were 15.7% (75 of 477) and 10.0% (15 of 151) respectively. Secondary infertility was significantly associated with chlamydial infection. Genovar E was the most prevalent followed by genovar D and F. Twenty-four C. trachomatis strains were selected for ompA gene sequencing. No mixed infection was picked. Variability in ompA sequences was seen in 50.0%. Both PCR-RFLP and ompA gene sequencing showed concordant results. High prevalence of C. trachomatis in infertile couples warrants routine screening for C. trachomatis infection in all infertile couples. Genotyping of the ompA gene of C. trachomatis may be a valuable tool in understanding the natural history of C. trachomatis infection.

AB  - About 0.75 million neonates die every year in India, the highest for any country in the world. The neonatal mortality rate (NMR) declined from 52 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 28 per 1000 live births in 2013, but the rate of decline has been slow and lags behind that of infant and under-five child mortality rates. The slower decline has led to increasing contribution of neonatal mortality to infant and under-five mortality. Among neonatal deaths, the rate of decline in early neonatal mortality rate (ENMR) is much lower than that of late NMR. The high level and slow decline in early NMR are also reflected in a high and stagnant perinatal mortality rate. The rate of decline in NMR, and to an extent ENMR, has accelerated with the introduction of National Rural Health Mission in mid-2005. Almost all states have witnessed this phenomenon, but there is still a huge disparity in NMR between and even within the states. The disparity is further compounded by rural-urban, poor-rich and gender differentials. There is an interplay of different demographic, educational, socioeconomic, biological and care-seeking factors, which are responsible for the differentials and the high burden of neonatal mortality. Addressing inequity in India is an important cross-cutting action that will reduce newborn mortality.

TI  - Fatal Superior Sagittal Sinus and Torcular Thrombosis After Vestibular Schwannoma Surgery: Report of a Rare Complication and Review of the Literature
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
KW  - Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
KW  - Retromastoid approach
KW  - Superior sagittal sinus
KW  - Vestibular schwannoma
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare condition with the potential to cause severe morbidity and mortality. CVST can also occur after vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery with the thrombosis of transverse and sigmoid sinus. However, there is not a single report of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis after VS surgery reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman presented to our center with large left-sided solid cystic VS. On admission she was dehydrated, and after clinical stabilization, she underwent gross total excision of tumor through left retromastoid suboccipital craniotomy after cerebrospinal fluid drainage through an external ventricular drain. Surgery was uneventful, but postoperatively she had an episode of seizure. Immediate postoperative computed tomography (CT) brain scan was normal with good operative cavity. However, 24 hours later, she developed left-sided motor deficit, and a repeat CT scan showed right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension. On further evaluation, magnetic resonance venography showed entire SSS thrombosis, with patent bilateral transverse and sigmoid sinuses. She was not started on the anticoagulants in view of intracranial hemorrhage. Subsequently, she underwent rightsided decompressive craniectomy because there was progressive deterioration in her Glasgow Coma Scale, and she succumbed despite all efforts. Retrospectively, dehydration and intracranial hypotension could be likened to her sinus thrombosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the significance of adequate optimization of the patients prior to surgery, besides adequate operative skills to avoid this rare but serious complication of SSS and torcular thrombosis after VS surgery.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effect of withholding maintenance phenobarbitone on breakthrough seizures.
   Design: A double blind randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Level II neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a teaching hospital in Northern India.
   Participants: 152 term and near term neonates (34 weeks of gestation age) with admission weight kg >= 2 with clinically apparent seizures who received intravenous (IV) loading dose of 20 mg/kg of phenobarbitone.
   Interventions: After 12 hours of seizure free period of the initial loading dose of phenobarbitone, one group received IV maintenance therapy and other 'no maintenance' (saline as placebo).
   Main outcome measure: Breakthrough seizures from randomization till discharge.
   Results: Baseline variables were comparable in the two groups. Breakthrough seizures occurred in 30 (40%) subjects in placebo group and 24 (31.2%) in phenobarbitone group with RR (95% CI) of 1.28 (0.83-1.97) (P=0.19). Seizure re-currence, re-hospitalisation, mortality and abnormal neurological assessment until 3 months were comparable in the two groups (P>0.05). Babies in either group with breakthrough seizures were more likely to be neurologically abnormal at 1 month than babies who did not have breakthrough seizures, but this difference decreased by 3 months.
   Conclusion: In term and near-term neonates, those who respond to loading. dose of phenobarbitone after a single seizure episode, withholding of phenobarbitone maintenance may not significantly increase the risk of breakthrough seizures.

AB  - Objectives To determine the prevalence of hypophosphatemia in critically ill children and its association with clinical outcomes; to determine risk factors and mechanism of hypophosphatemia.
   Methods Levels of serum phosphate, phosphate intake, renal phosphate handling indices and blood gases were measured on days 1, 3, 7 and 10 of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay. Hypophosphatemia was defined as any serum phosphorus < 3.8 mg/dl for children younger than 2 y and < 3.5 mg/dl for children 2 y or older. Renal phosphate loss was assessed using the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate (TmP) to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [TmP/GFR].
   Results Prevalence of hypophosphatemia was 71.6 % (95 % CI: 64.6-78.6). On adjusted analysis, hypophosphatemia was associated with prolonged PICU length of stay (PICU LOS > 6 d) (adjusted OR: 3.0 [95 % CI: 1.4-6.7; p = 0.005]) but not associated with increased mortality. Renal phosphate threshold was significantly lower on all the days in hypophosphatemic group compared to that of non-hypophosphatemic group. No statistically significant difference in the amount of phosphate intake was seen in both the groups.
   Conclusions Hypophosphatemia is highly prevalent in critically ill children and is associated with prolonged PICU LOS. Increased phosphate loss in urine is one of the mechanism responsible for hypophosphatemia in critically ill children.

AB  - Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer mortality among men in India and incidence is increasing, but actually, they are largely preventable diseases. In India, advanced stage at the time of presentation is responsible for high mortality and morbidity and early detection is the only way to reduce it. The purpose of this study is to know the level of awareness of various aspects of lung cancer among college teachers and impact of awareness programmes in its prevention and early detection. This assessment was part of Pink Chain Campaign-a campaign on cancer awareness. During the cancer awareness events in 2011-2013 at various women colleges in different parts in India, pre-test related to lung cancer was followed by awareness programme. Post-test using the same questionnaire was conducted at the end of interactive session, at 6 months and 1 year. A total of 872 out of 985 teachers participated in the study (overall response rate was 88.5 %). Mean age of the study population was 41.6 years (range 26-59 years). There was a significant increase in the level of knowledge regarding lung cancer at 6 months, and this was sustained at 1 year. Among teachers who were just asked yes or no question, 117 teachers (13.4 %) were smokers and 241 teachers (27.6 %) were alcoholics. Magazines and newspapers were sources for knowledge in 50-60 % of teachers, whereas approximately 30 % of teachers were educated by TV and Internet regarding various aspects of lung cancer. Post awareness at 6 months and 1 year, Pink Chain Campaign was the major source of knowledge related to lung cancer in more than 90 % of teachers by continuous and timely update on subject. Post awareness at 6 months and 1 year, there was a significant change in alcohol and smoking habits. Major reasons for not going for check-up were ignorance (83.1 %), fear (30.1 %) and lethargic attitude (29.3 %) initially, but over time, lack of time, lethargic attitude and hesitation became important factors after knowing various aspects of lung cancer. Knowledge of lung cancer was very low among teachers. Overall awareness of risk factors, sign and symptoms, screening modalities of lung cancer has improved in a year along with practices related to smoking and alcohol, but there was not much improvement in people undergoing regular check-ups. To inculcate safe practices in the lifestyle of people, awareness programmes such as the Pink Chain Campaign should be conducted more widely and frequently.

AB  - The rapid population growth in urban India has outpaced the municipal capacity to build essential infrastructures that make life in cities safe and healthy. Local and national governments alike are grappling with the challenges of urbanization with thousands migrating from villages to cities. Thus, urbanization in India has been accompanied by a concentration of poverty and urban public healthcare has emerged as one of the most pressing priorities facing our country. Newborn mortality rates in urban settings are lower than rural areas, early neonatal deaths account for greater proportion than late neonatal deaths. The available evidence suggests that socio-economic inequalities and poor environment pose major challenges for newborn health. Moreover, fragmented and weak public health system, multiplicity of actors and limited capacity of public health planning further constrain the delivery of quality and affordable health care service. Though healthcare is concentrated in urban areas, delay in deciding to seek health care, reaching a source of it and receiving appropriate care affects the health outcomes disproportionately. However, a few city initiatives and innovations piloted in different states and cities have brought forth the evidences of effectiveness of different strategies. Recently launched National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) provides an opportunity for strategic thinking and actions to improve newborn health outcomes in India. There is also an 'opportunity for coalescence of activities around National Health Mission (NHM) and Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health+Adolescent (RMNCH+A) strategy to develop feasible and workable models in different urban settings. Concomitant operational research needs to be carried out so that the obstacles, approaches and response to the program can be understood.

AB  - Background objectives: The N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene encodes an enzyme which both activates and deactivates arylamine and other drugs and carcinogens. This study was aimed to investigate the role of NAT2 gene polymorphism in anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH).
   Methods: In this prospective study, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism results for NAT2 gene were compared between 185 tuberculosis patients who did not develop DIH and 105 tuberculosis patients who developed DIH while on anti-tuberculosis drugs.
   Results: Frequency of slow-acetylator genotype was commonly encountered and was not significantly different between DIH (82.8%) and non-DIH (77.2%) patients. However, the genotypic distribution of variant NAT2FNx015/FNx017 amongst slow-acetylator genotypes was significantly higher in DIH (56%) group as compared to non-DIH (39%) group (odds ratio 2.02; P=0.006).
   Interpretation conclusions: The present study demonstrated no association between NAT2 genotype and DIH in the north Indian patients with tuberculosis.

AB  - With advancements in imaging techniques, neurosurgical procedures are becoming highly precise and minimally invasive, thus demanding development of new ergonomically aesthetic instruments. Conventionally, neurosurgical instruments are manufactured using subtractive manufacturing methods. Such a process is complex, time-consuming, and impractical for prototype development and validation of new designs. Therefore, an alternative design process has been used utilizing blue light scanning, computer-aided designing, and additive manufacturing direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) for microsurgical instrument prototype development. Deviations of DMLS-fabricated instrument were studied by superimposing scan data of fabricated instrument with the computer-aided designing model. Content and concurrent validity of the fabricated prototypes was done by a group of 15 neurosurgeons by performing sciatic nerve anastomosis in small laboratory animals. Comparative scoring was obtained for the control and study instrument. T test was applied to the individual parameters and P values for force (P < .0001) and surface roughness (P < .01) were found to be statistically significant. These 2 parameters were further analyzed using objective measures. Results depicts that additive manufacturing by DMLS provides an effective method for prototype development. However, direct application of these additive-manufactured instruments in the operating room requires further validation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: 5-Hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are the most commonly used drugs for postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis. Dexamethasone is another antiemetic with proven efficacy in reducing PONV. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the combination of dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist versus a 5-HT3 antagonist alone as prophylaxis of PONV in laparoscopic surgical patients.
   METHODS: PubMed, PubMed Central, and CENTRAL databases were searched to identify those randomized trials that compared a 5-HT3 antagonist with the 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone combination for PONV prophylaxis after laparoscopic surgeries.
   RESULTS: Data from 17 RCTs that evaluated 1402 patients were included. Results from our meta-analysis show that the combination of dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is more effective in preventing PONV than the 5-HT3 antagonist alone (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-0.54; number needed to treat = 6.6), with no statistical heterogeneity (I-2 = 0) among studies. The need for rescue antiemetic is also decreased in patients receiving the combination (odds ratio 0.21, 99% CI 0.10-0.46; number needed to treat = 6), although data are insufficient to detect any significant difference in incidence of adverse effects. In addition, patients in the combination group complained of less pain after 24 hours (Weighted Mean Difference -0.67, 99% CI -1.27 to -0.08).
   CONCLUSION: Combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone is significantly more effective than 5-HT3 antagonist alone in preventing PONV after laparoscopic surgeries, with possible improvement in postoperative analgesia.

AB  - Background & objectives: Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines are commonly maintained on inactivated feeder cells, in the medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). However, limited availability of feeder cells in culture, and the high cost of growth factors limit their use in scalable expansion of hESC cultures for clinical application. Here, we describe an efficient and costeffective feeder and bFGF-free culture of hESCs using conditioned medium (CM) from immortalized feeder cells.
   Methods: KIND-1 hESC cell line was cultured in CM, collected from primary mouse embryonic fibroblast, human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) and immortalized HFF (I-HFF). Pluripotency of KIND-1 hESC cell line was confirmed by expression of genes, proteins and cell surface markers.
   Results: In culture, these cells retained normal morphology, expressed all cell surface markers, could differentiate to embryoid bodies upon culture in vitro. Furthermore, I-HFF feeder cells without supplementation of bFGF released ample amount of endogenous bFGF to maintain stemness of hESC cells.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The study results described the use of CM from immortalized feeder cells as a consistent source and an efficient, inexpensive feeder-free culture system for the maintenance of hESCs. Moreover, it was possible to maintain hESCs without exogenous supplementation of bFGF. Thus, the study could be extended to scalable expansion of hESC cultures for therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Surgical management of epilepsy is an established safe and effective way in improving patients' seizure frequency and overall morbidity. A robust array of options is available to carry out an in-depth evaluation of a surgical candidate in epilepsy. However, underutilisation of the available options may seriously challange post-operative outcomes. In this paper, we discuss the different aspects of various non-invasive and invasive procedures available to evaluate a surgical candidate of epilepsy and discuss their relative advantages and position in the diagnostic algorithm.

AB  - Background The study was conducted to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0-35.0 kg/m(2). Possible mechanisms, including alterations in gastric emptying time (GET), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), ghrelin and leptin, were evaluated. Methods Twenty obese patients with T2DM and with a BMI of 30.0-35.0 kg/m(2) underwent LSG during March 2012 to February 2015. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and GET were measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after surgery. Fasting and post-prandial levels of serum GLP-1, ghrelin and leptin were measured pre-operatively and after 3 and 6 months. Results The average duration of follow-up was 17.6 months, and 10 patients had completed 2 years of follow-up. After 2 years, the average BMI decreased from 33.4+/-1.2 to 26.7+/-1.8 kg/m(2). The mean HbA1c decreased from 8.7+/-1.6 to 6.7+/-1.5 %, respectively. Ten patients achieved complete remission. Insulin could be stopped in all six patients who were on it pre-operatively. Meal-stimulated GLP-1 response and serum insulin at 30 min showed a significant increase following surgery. There was a significant decrease in GET. Conclusions This prospective study confirms the positive impact of LSG on diabetic status of non-morbidly obese patients. The possible mechanisms include the rise in post-prandial GLP-1 level induced by accelerated gastric emptying, leading to an increase in insulin secretion. LSG also leads to decreased ghrelin and leptin levels which may have a role in improving glucose homeostasis after surgery.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the discriminatory ability of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in identifying the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors in Asian Indians. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 509 subjects (278 males and 231 females) aged 20-60 years from New Delhi, India. Measurements included complete clinical examination, blood pressure, weight, height, WC, BMI, WHR and WHtR, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, and fasting insulin levels. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to compare predictive validity of various adiposity measures against the cardiometabolic risk factors (dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome). The odds ratio for the presence of individual cardiometabolic risk factors in the presence of overweight, abdominal obesity, and high WHtR were calculated using logistic regression analysis. Results: WC had the highest area under ROC for all other cardiometabolic risk factors except hyperinsulinemia in males and for dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome and presence of at least one cardiometabolic risk factor in females. For metabolic syndrome, WC, followed by WHtR, was observed to be the better predictor than other measures of adiposity, and WHtR appeared to be the best predictor for hypertension in both genders, particularly in women. Conclusions: In the northern Asian Indian population with high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors, a combination of WC and WHtR appeared to be having better clinical utility than BMI and WHR in identifying individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) dose measurements near thin high-Z materials placed in a water-like medium by using a polymer gel dosimeter (PGD) when the medium was irradiated with high energy photon beams.
   Methods: PGD is potentially a useful tool for this application because it can record the dose around a small object made of a high-Z material in a continuous 3D medium. In this study, the authors manufactured a methacrylic acid-based normoxic PGD, nMAG. Two 0.5 mm thick lead foils (1x1 cm) were placed in foil supports with 0.7 cm separation in a 1000 ml polystyrene container filled with nMAG. The authors used two foil configurations, i.e., orthogonal and parallel. In the orthogonal configuration, two foils were placed in the direction orthogonal to the beam axis. The parallel configuration had two foils arranged in parallel to the beam axis. The phantom was irradiated with an 18 MV photon beam of 5x5 cm field size. It was imaged with a three-Tesla (3 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanned using the Car-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence. The spin-spin relaxation time (R2) to-dose calibration data were obtained by using small vials filled with nMAG and exposing to known doses. The DOSXYZnrc Monte Carlo (MC) codewas used to get the expected dose distributions. More than 35x10(6) of histories were simulated so that the average errorwas less than 1%. Anin-house MATLAB-based softwarewas used to obtain the dose distributions from the measured R2 data as well as to compare the measurements and the MC predictions. The dose change due to the presence of the foils was studied by comparing the dose distributions with and without foils (or the reference).
   Results: For the orthogonal configuration, the measured dose along the beam axis showed an increase in the upstream side of the first foil, between the foils, and on the downstream side of the second foil. The range of increased dose area was 1.1 cm in the upstream of the first foil. However, in the downstream of the second foil, it was 0.2 cm, beyond which the dose fell below the reference dose by 10%. The dose profile between the foils showed a well-like shape with the minimum dose still larger than the reference dose by 1.8%. The minimum dose point was closer to the first foil than to the second foil. For the parallel configuration, the dose between foils was the largest at the center. The increased dose area opposite to the gap between foils extended outward to 1 cm. The spatial dose distributions of PGD and MC showed the same geometrical patterns except for the points inside the foils for both orthogonal and parallel foil arrangements.
   Conclusions: The authors demonstrated that the nMAG PGD with MRI could be used to measure the 3D dosimetric structures at the mm-scale in the vicinity of the foil. The current study provided more accurate 3D spatial dose distribution than the previous studies. Furthermore, the measurements were validated by the MC simulation.

AB  - Targeted nano-delivery vehicles were developed from genetically modified Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) capsid by ligands bioconjugation for efficient drug delivery in cancer cells. RNA binding (N 1-25aa) and beta-hexamer forming (N 27-41aa) domain of capsid was selectively deleted by genetic engineering to achieve the efficient in vitro assembly without natural cargo. Two variants of capsids were generated by truncating 41 and 26 amino acid from N terminus (N Delta 41 and N Delta 26) designated as F-1 and F-2 respectively. These capsid were optimally self-assembled in 1: 2 molar ratio (F1: F2) to form a monodisperse nano-scaffold of size 28 nm along with chemically conjugated modalities for visualization (fluorescent dye), targeting (folic acid, FA) and anticancer drug (doxorubicin). The cavity of the nano-scaffold was packed with doxorubicin conjugated gold nanoparticles (10 nm) to enhance the stability, drug loading and sustained release of drug. The chimeric system was stable at pH range of 4-8. This chimeric nano-scaffold system showed highly specific receptor mediated internalization (targeting) and similar to 300% more cytotoxicity (with respect to FA(-) delivery system) to folate receptor positive Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF7) cell lines. The present system may offer a programmable nano-scaffold based platform for developing chemotherapeutics for cancer.

AB  - Endemic fluorosis is a worldwide environmental problem due to excessive fluoride, commonly due to increased drinking water fluoride levels but sometimes due to other sources such as food with high fluoride content. In India, 21 of the 35 states are known to have health problems associated with fluoride toxicity. The present report is a case of a 50-year-old female who was seen with progressive spinal complications and a MRI of the spine suggestive of multiple myeloma. The MRI of the lumbosacral spine showed a diffuse and heterogeneous marrow signal of the lower dorsal and lumbosacral vertebrae. The MRI was also suggestive of coarse trabeculation and appeared predominantly hypointense on the T1W image and had mixed signal intensity on the T2W image. These findings were suggestive of neoplastic bone marrow infiltration and the presence of a proliferative disorder, with multiple myeloma being the most likely. During the patient workup, it was found that other family members were also having similar complications and, after investigation of these family members, it was found that they are suffering from systemic fluorosis. The patient was then evaluated for skeletal fluorosis, and this condition was found to be present. Multiple myeloma was ruled out by the finding of a negative serum protein electrophoresis. The spinal complications appeared to be mainly due to the compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots by protruding osteophytes, thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and thickening of the ligamentum flavum resulting in a compressive myeloradiculopathy and compressive myelopathy. The finding of multiple myeloma-like findings on the spinal MRI in association with skeletal fluorosis was considered to be a very rare event. This case report underlines the need to consider the presence of spinal skeletal fluorosis when evaluating spinal complications with unusual pseudo-multiple myeloma-like changes on the spinal MRI.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the causes and associations of missed retinal breaks (MRBs) and posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).
   METHODS: Case sheets of patients undergoing vitreo retinal surgery for RRD at a tertiary eye care centre were evaluated retrospectively. Out of the 378 records screened, 253 were included for analysis of MRBs and 191 patients were included for analysis of PVD, depending on the inclusion criteria. Features of RRD and retinal breaks noted on examination were compared to the status of MRBs and PVD detected during surgery for possible associations.
   RESULTS: Overall, 27% patients had MRBs. Retinal holes were commonly missed in patients with lattice degeneration while missed retinal tears were associated with presence of complete PVD. Patients operated for cataract surgery were significantly associated with MRBs (P = 0.033) with the odds of missing a retinal break being 1.91 as compared to patients with natural lens. Advanced proliferative vitreo retinopathy (PVR) and retinal bullae were the most common reasons for missing a retinal break during examination. PVD was present in 52% of the cases and was wrongly assessed in 16%. Retinal bullae, pseudophakia/aphakia, myopia, and horse shoe retinal tears were strongly associated with presence of PVD. Traumatic RRDs were rarely associated with PVD.
   CONCLUSION: Pseudophakic patients, and patients with retinal bullae or advanced PVR should be carefully screened for MRBs. Though Weiss ring is a good indicator of PVD, it may still be over diagnosed in some cases. PVD is associated with retinal bullae and pseudophakia, and inversely with traumatic RRD.

AB  - Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may enhance recovery from stroke through neuroprotective mechanisms if administered early, or neurorepair if given later. Several small trials suggest administration is safe but effects on efficacy are unclear. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing G-CSF in patients with hyperacute, acute, subacute or chronic stroke, and asked Investigators to share individual patient data on baseline characteristics, stroke severity and type, end-of-trial modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index, haematological parameters, serious adverse events and death. Multiple variable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline severity and time-to-treatment. Individual patient data were obtained for 6 of 10 RCTs comprising 196 stroke patients (116 G-CSF, 80 placebo), mean age 67.1 (SD 12.9), 92% ischaemic, median NIHSS 10 (IQR 5-15), randomised 11 days (interquartile range IQR 4-238) post ictus; data from three commercial trials were not shared. G-CSF did not improve mRS (ordinal regression), odds ratio OR 1.12 (95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.96, p = 0.62). There were more patients with a serious adverse event in the G-CSF group (29.6% versus 7.5%, p = 0.07) with no significant difference in all-cause mortality (G-CSF 11.2%, placebo 7.6%, p = 0.4). Overall, G-CSF did not improve stroke outcome in this individual patient data meta-analysis.

AB  - Background: Myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide despite the availability of current therapeutic modalities. Kaempferol (KMP), a dietary flavonoid, possesses good antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic properties and has been evaluated in the present study for its role in mitigating myocardial injury following MI.
   Purpose: In this study, the ability of KMP to protect heart against isoproterenol (ISO) induced oxidative stress and myocardial infarction was evaluated.
   Material and methods: Male Wistar rats (n=48) were administered KMP (5, 10 & 20 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or vehicle for 15 days with ISO, 85 mg/kg, subcutaneously, for 2 consecutive days was also administered at 24 h interval on the 13th and 14th days. On the 15th day, rats were anaesthetized and right coronary artery was cannulated to record hemodynamic parameters. Later on blood sample was collected and heart was removed to estimate biochemical, histopathological, ultrastructural and immuohistochemical studies respectively.
   Results: ISO-treated rats showed a significant reduction in arterial pressure, maximum rate of development of left ventricular pressure and increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Also, there was a significant decrease in antioxidant enzyme levels such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione and increase in the level of malondialdehyde and serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. In addition, the cardiac injury markers such as creatine kinase-MB and lactate dehydrogenase were increased in the serum. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the myocardium. KMP (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) dose dependently restored hemodynamic, left ventricular functions, decreased cardiac injury marker enzymes in serum, increased antioxidant levels, reduced lipid peroxidation and TNF-a level and apoptosis. Histopathological and ultrastructural studies support the protective effect of KMP in ISO induced myocardial infarcted rats.
   Conclusion: Thus, the present study revealed that KMP mitigates myocardial damage in ISO-induced cardiac injury by maintaining hemodynamic and biochemical parameters and reducing inflammation owing to its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. It may be concluded that a diet containing KMP may be beneficial in those who are at the risk of myocardial injury. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine sequence types of 34 S. haemolyticus strains isolated from a variety of infections between 2013 and 2016 in India by MLST. The MEGA5.2 software was used to align and compare the nucleotide sequences. The advanced cluster analysis was performed to define the clonal complexes. MLST analysis showed 24 new sequence types (ST) among S. haemolyticus isolates, irrespective of sources and place of isolation. The finding of this study allowed to set up an MLST database on the PubMLST. org website using BIGSdb software and made available at http://pubmlst.org/shaemolyticus/. The data of this study thus suggest that MLST can be used to study population structure and diversity among S. haemolyticus isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few contemporary data on the mortality and morbidity associated with rheumatic heart disease or information on their predictors. We report the 2-year follow-up of individuals with rheumatic heart disease from 14 low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia.
   METHODS: Between January 2010 and November 2012, we enrolled 3343 patients from 25 centers in 14 countries and followed them for 2 years to assess mortality, congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, recurrent acute rheumatic fever, and infective endocarditis.
   RESULTS: Vital status at 24 months was known for 2960 (88.5%) patients. Two-thirds were female. Although patients were young (median age, 28 years; interquartile range, 18-40), the 2-year case fatality rate was high (500 deaths, 16.9%). Mortality rate was 116.3/1000 patient-years in the first year and 65.4/1000 patient-years in the second year. Median age at death was 28.7 years. Independent predictors of death were severe valve disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-3.11), congestive heart failure (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.70-2.72), New York Heart Association functional class III/IV (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.32-2.10), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10-1.78), and older age (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02 per year increase) at enrollment. Postprimary education (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.85) and female sex (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.80) were associated with lower risk of death. Two hundred and four (6.9%) patients had new congestive heart failure (incidence, 38.42/1000 patient-years), 46 (1.6%) had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (8.45/1000 patient-years), 19 (0.6%) had recurrent acute rheumatic fever (3.49/1000 patient-years), and 20 (0.7%) had infective endocarditis (3.65/1000 patient-years). Previous stroke and older age were independent predictors of stroke/transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism. Patients from low- and lower-middle-income countries had significantly higher age- and sex-adjusted mortality than patients from upper-middle-income countries. Valve surgery was significantly more common in upper-middle-income than in lower-middle- or low-income countries.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with clinical rheumatic heart disease have high mortality and morbidity despite being young; those from low- and lower-middle-income countries had a poorer prognosis associated with advanced disease and low education. Programs focused on early detection and the treatment of clinical rheumatic heart disease are required to improve outcomes.

AB  - Background: Ever since Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] discovered in India, several outbreaks of this disease have been recorded in Gujarat State, India. During the year 2011 to 2015 several districts of Gujarat and Rajasthan state (Sirohi) found to be affected with CCHF including the positivity among ticks and livestock. During these years many infected individuals succumbed to this disease; which subsequently led to nosocomial infections. Herein, we report CCHF cases recorded from Rajasthan state during January 2015. This has affected four individuals apparently associated with one suspected CCHF case admitted in a private hospital in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
   Case presentation: A 30-year-old male was hospitalized in a private hospital in Jodhpur, Rajasthan State, who subsequently had developed thrombocytopenia and showed hemorrhagic manifestations and died in the hospital. Later on, four nursing staff from the same hospital also developed the similar symptoms (Index case and Case A, B, C). Index case succumbed to the disease in the hospital at Jodhpur followed by the death of the case A that was shifted to AIIMS hospital, Delhi due to clinical deterioration. Blood samples of the index case and Case A, B, C were referred to the National institute of Virology, Pune, India for CCHF diagnosis from the different hospitals in Rajasthan, Delhi and Gujarat. However, a sample of deceased suspected CCHF case was not referred. Subsequently, blood samples of 5 nursing staff and 37 contacts (Case D was one of them) from Pokhran area, Jaisalmer district were referred to NIV, Pune.
   Conclusions: It clearly indicated that nursing staff acquired a nosocomial infection while attending the suspected CCHF case in an Intensive Care Unit of a private hospital in Jodhpur. However, one case was confirmed from the Pokhran area where the suspected CCHF case was residing. This case might have got the infection from suspected CCHF case or through other routes. CCHF strain associated with these nosocomial infections shares the highest identity with Afghanistan strain and its recent introduction from Afghanistan cannot be ruled out. However, lack of active surveillance, unawareness among health care workers leads to such nosocomial infections.

AB  - Background Cardiac valvular calcification is associated with the overall coronary plaque burden and considered an independent cardiovascular risk and prognostic factor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the presence of valvular calcification and plaque morphology and/or vulnerability.
   Methods Transthoracic echocardiography was used to assess valvular calcification in 280 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound (Virtual Histology IVUS, VH-IVUS). A propensity score-matched cohort of 192 patients (n = 96 in each group) was analyzed. Thin-capped fibroatheroma (TCFA) was defined as a necrotic core (NC) >10% of the plaque area with a plaque burden >40% and NC in contact with the lumen for >= 3 image slices. A remodeling index (lesion/reference vessel area) >1.05 was considered to be positive.
   Results Patients were divided into two groups: any calcification in at least one valve (152 patients) vs. no detectable valvular calcification (128 patients). Groups were similar in terms of age, risk factors, clinical diagnosis, and angiographic analysis after propensity score-matched analysis. Gray-scale IVUS analysis showed that the vessel size, plaque burden, minimal lumen area, and remodeling index were similar. By VH-IVUS, % NC and % dense calcium (DC) were greater in patients with valvular calcification (p = 0.024, and p = 0.016, respectively). However, only % DC was higher at the maximal NC site by propensity scorematched analysis (p = 0.029). The frequency of VH-TCFA occurrence was higher depending on the complexity (p = 0.0064) and severity (p = 0.013) of valvular calcification.
   Conclusions There is a significant relationship between valvular calcifications and VH-IVUS assessment of TCFAs. Valvular calcification indicates a greater atherosclerosis disease complexity (increased calcification of the coronary plaque) and vulnerable coronary plaques (higher incidence of VH-TCFA).

AB  - Introduction: Early Onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD) is genetically heterogeneous. PARK2 mutations are the commonest cause of autosomal recessive EOPD followed by PINK1.DJ1 mutations is rare and there is scarce literature on its phenotype and long term outcome.
   Objectives: We undertook a retrospective study to determine the prevalence of DJ1 mutation(s) in an Indian population and describe the clinical features and long term outcome of EOPD patients with these mutations.
   Methods: One hundred EOPD patients and 114 controls were evaluated. All the seven coding exons of DJ1 gene were screened for novel and reported mutations by PCR- Sanger sequencing.
   Results: A novel homozygous missense mutation (c.313 A > T, p. Ile105Phe) in exon 5 was seen in one patient and four unrelated patients had a homozygous missense single nucleotide variant rs71653619 (c.293 G > A, p.Arg98Gln). The clinical phenotype comprised of asymmetrical onset, slowly progressive Parkinsonism with levodopa induced motor restlessness in a patient with the novel mutation (c.313 A > T, p. Ile105Phe) while subjects with c.293 G > A, p.Arg98Gln had early onset levodopa responsive symmetrical Parldnsonism.
   Conclusion: DJ1 mutations account for similar to 5% of EOPD patients from the Indian population. This study further adds to the clinical spectrum of EOPD with DJ1 mutations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To assess the efficacy of intra-amniotic administration of surfactants in reducing the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and the need for postnatal endotracheal surfactant during preterm delivery. Methods: A prospective pilot study enrolled pregnant women at 28-34 weeks of pregnancy between July 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014 who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a control group or to receive intra-amniotic surfactant (3 mL) administered under ultrasonography guidance within 2-8 hours of expected delivery. The primary outcomes, the incidence and severity of RDS, and the need for postnatal surfactants, were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: The study enrolled 20 patients to each group. The incidence of RDS did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.110). Severe RDS was more common in the control group (P = 0.018) and postnatal surfactants were required more frequently in the control group (P = 0.02). Conclusion: Intra-amniotic administration of surfactants reduced RDS severity and the need for postpartum endotracheal surfactants.

AB  - Study objective: This study was designed to know whether addition of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) or diltiazem to total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) (propofol) aided reduction in blood loss during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). The secondary outcomes measured were surgeon's assessment of the surgical field and hemodynamics.
   Design: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.
   Setting: Operating room.
   Patients: Forty-five American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II adult patients (18-60 years) undergoing FESS.
   Interventions: All groups received propofol-fentanyl TIVA. Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 groups (MgSO4 group, n = 15; diltiazem group, n = 15; saline group, n = 15).
   Measurements: Intraoperative bleeding was quantified, and quality of surgical field was graded. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded.
   Main results: Addition of both MgSO4 and diltiazem significantly reduced blood loss (240 and 350 mL) in comparison to control group (415 mL) (P = .003). The surgical field was significantly better in the MgSO4 group compared with the diltiazem (P = .028) and saline groups (P = .0001).
   Conclusion: It was concluded that the addition of both MgSO4 and diltiazem to TIVA propofol results in significant reduction in blood loss and significant improvement in the quality of surgical field during FESS without causing any adverse effects on the hemodynamics or on the recovery from anesthesia. The surgical field in the MgSO4 group was significantly better than that in the diltiazem group (P = .04). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To describe the clinical and genotypic features of Dent disease in children diagnosed at our center over a period of 10 years.
   Design: Case series.
   Setting: Pediatric Nephrology Clinic at a referral center in Northern India.
   Methods: The medical records of patients with Dent disease diagnosed and followed up at this hospital from June 2005 to April 2015 were reviewed. The diagnosis of Dent disease was based on presence of all three of the following: (i) low molecular weight proteinuria, (ii) hypercalciuria and (iii) one of the following: nephrolithiasis, hematuria, hypophosphatemia or renal insufficiency, with or without mutation in CLCN5 or OCRL1 genes.
   Results: The phenotype in 18 patients diagnosed with Dent disease during this period was characterized by early age at onset (median 1.8 y), and polyuria, polydipsia, salt craving, hypophosphatemic rickets and night blindness. Rickets was associated with severe deformities, fractures or loss of ambulation in six patients. Nephrocalcinosis was present in three patients, while none had nephrolithiasis. Generalized aminoaciduria was seen in 13 patients, two had glucosuria alone, and one had features of Fanconi syndrome. Over a median follow up of 2.7 years, one patient developed renal failure. Genetic testing (n=15) revealed 5 missense mutations and 3 nonsense mutations in CLCN5 in 13 patients. Five of these variations (p.Met504Lys, p.Trp58Cys, p.Leu729X, p.Glu527Gln and p.Gly57Arg) have not been reported outside the Indian subcontinent.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest a severe phenotype in a cohort of Indian patients with Dent disease.

AB  - Grafting of quaternary nitrogen atoms into the backbone of polymer is an efficient way of developing new generation antimicrobial polymeric wound dressing. In this study, an elastic, non-adhesive and antimicrobial transparent hydrogel based dressing has been designed, which might be helpful for routine observation of wound area without removing the dressing material along with maintaining a sterile environment for a longer period of time. Green synthesized silver nanoparticles have been loaded into the quaternized PVA hydrogel matrix to improve its antimicrobial property. Silver nanoparticles loaded quaternized PVA hydrogel showed enhanced mechanical and swelling properties compared to native quaternized PVA hydrogel. Release kinetics evaluated by atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that the release mechanism of silver nanoparticles from the hydrogel follows Fickian diffusion. Antimicrobial efficacy of the hydrogels was evaluated by disk diffusion test on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. After 96 h of release in phosphate buffer, the growth inhibition zone created by silver nanoparticless loaded quaternized PVA hydrogel is comparable to that created by ampicillin. These observations assert that the silver nanoparticles loaded quaternized PVA hydrogel acts as a reservoir of silver nanoparticles, which helps in maintaining a sterile environment for longer time duration by releasing Ag nanocrystallite in sustained manner.

TI  - Tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trial
T2  - LANCET GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY
AB  - Background The novel prodrug tenofovir alafenamide delivers the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir to target cells more efficiently at a lower dose than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, thereby reducing systemic exposure. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two drugs in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a non-inferiority study.
   Methods In this ongoing randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority study in 105 centres in 17 countries, patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV were randomly assigned (2:1) by a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size six), stratified by plasma HBV DNA concentration and previous treatment status, to receive once-daily oral doses of tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, each with matching placebo. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection (with plasma HBV DNA concentrations of >20 000 IU/mL), serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations of greater than 60 U/L in men or greater than 38 U/L in women and at no more than ten times the upper limit of normal, and estimated creatinine clearance of at least 50 mL/min (by the Cockcroft-Gault method). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48 in those who received at least one dose of study drug; the study was powered to show non-inferiority with a 10% efficacy margin of tenofovir alafenamide compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Bone and renal safety, and key secondary safety endpoints were assessed sequentially. The study will be conducted for a total of 3 years as a double-blind comparison to assess the longer term response to treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01940341.
   Findings Between Sept 12, 2013, and Oct 31, 2014, 426 patients were randomly assigned (285 assigned to tenofovir alafenamide and 141 assigned to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; one patient assigned to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not receive the treatment. 268 (94%) of 285 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48 versus 130 (93%) of 140 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (difference 1.8% [95% CI -3.6 to 7.2]; p=0.47), which demonstrates non-inferiority. Patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide had significantly smaller mean percentage declines in bone mineral density than those receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (hip -0.29% [95% CI -0.55 to -0.03] vs -2.16% [-2.53 to -1.79], adjusted percentage difference 1.87% [95% CI 1.42 to 2.32; p<0.0001]; spine -0.88% [-1.22 to -0.54] vs -2.51% [-3.09 to -1.94], adjusted percentage difference 1.64% [95% CI 1.01 to 2.27]; p<0.0001). At week 48, mean change in serum creatinine was small in both groups (tenofovir alafenamide 0.01 mg/dL [95% CI 0.00 to 0.02] vs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 0.02 mg/dL [0.00 to 0.04], adjusted percentage difference -0.01 mg/dL [95% CI -0.03 to 0.01]; p=0.32), but patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide had a smaller reduction in creatinine clearance (median change in estimated glomerular filtration rate -1.8 mL/min [IQR -7.8 to 6.0] vs -4.8 mL/min [-12.0 to 3.0]; p=0.004). Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity in the two treatment groups. The most common adverse events overall were headache (tenofovir alafenamide 40 [14%] patients vs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 14 [10%] patients), nasopharyngitis (30 [11%] vs 15 [11%]), and upper respiratory tract infection (35 [12%] vs ten [7%]). 14 (5%) patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and nine (6%) patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate had serious adverse events, none of which was deemed by investigators to be related to study treatment; one patient in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group died, but this was not deemed to be related to study treatment.
   Interpretation In patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV, the efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and had improved bone and renal effects. Longer term follow-up is needed to better understand the clinical impact of these changes.

AB  - Background Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel prodrug formulated to deliver the active metabolite to target cells more efficiently than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at a lower dose, thereby reducing systemic exposure. In patients with HIV, tenofovir alafenamide was as efficacious as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with reduced bone and renal toxic effects. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two drugs in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a non-inferiority study.
   Methods We did this ongoing double-blind, non-inferiority study in 161 outpatient centres in 19 countries. Patients with chronic HBV infection who were positive for the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with matching placebo. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size six) stratified by plasma HBV DNA concentration and previous treatment experience. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48 in all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug using a missing-equals-failed approach. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was 10%. Key prespecified safety endpoints were bone and renal parameters at week 48. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01940471.
   Findings Of the 1473 patients screened from Sept 11, 2013, to Dec 20, 2014, 875 eligible patients were randomly assigned and 873 received treatment (581 with tenofovir alafenamide and 292 with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 371 (64%) patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48, which was non-inferior to the 195 (67%) of patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL (adjusted difference -3.6% [95% CI -9.8 to 2.6]; p=0.25). Patients given tenofovir alafenamide had a significantly smaller decrease in bone mineral density at hip (mean change -0.10% [95% CI-0.29 to 0.09] vs -1.72% [-2.02 to -1.41]; adjusted difference 1.62 [1.27 to 1.96]; p<0.0001) and at spine (mean change -0.42% [-0.66 to -0.17] vs -2.29% [-2.67 to -1.92]; adjusted difference 1.88 [1.44 to 2 .31]; p<0.0001) as well as smaller mean increases in serum creatinine at week 48 (0 . 01 mg/dL [0.00-0.02] vs 0.03 mg/dL [0.02-0.04]; p=0.02). The most common adverse events overall were upper respiratory tract infection (51 [9%] of 581 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide vs 22 [8%] of 292 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), nasopharyngitis (56 [10%] vs 16 [5%]), and headache (42 [7%] vs 22 [8%]). 22 (4%) patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 12 (4%) patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate experienced serious adverse events, none of which was deemed by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 187 (32%) of 581 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group and 96 (33%) of 292 patients in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group had grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities, the most common of which were elevations in ALT (62 [11%] of 577 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 36 [13%] of 288 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and AST (20 [3%] of 577 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 19 [7%] of 288 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).
   Interpretation In patients with HBeAg-positive HBV infection, tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and had improved bone and renal effects. Longer term follow-up is needed to better understand the clinical impact of these changes.

AB  - Background: Trichoscopy is an office tool used in the diagnosis of alopecia but its utility has not been assessed. Objectives: To compare the trichoscopic characteristics of different types of alopecia, identify features of diagnostic value, and to determine the utility of trichoscopy in the diagnosis of alopecia. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in patients with alopecia. After clinical assessment and relevant investigations, trichoscopy was performed using a non-polarized trichoscope (x10). The utility of trichoscopy in difficult cases of alopecia was assessed statistically. Results: One hundred and twenty patients of alopecia (90 non-cicatricial, 30 cicatricial) were recruited. The diagnosis was made on the basis of a detailed history and clinical examination, and confirmed by biopsy and relevant investigations in difficult cases. Yellow dots (63.3%) were the most common trichoscopic feature followed by thin hair (40.8%). Among the 21 difficult cases of alopecia, trichoscopy was diagnostic in 19 (90.5%). Statistically significant features on intergroup comparison included black dots (Fischer's exact test, P < 0.001), cadaverized hair (P = 0.024), exclamation mark hair (P < 0.001) in alopecia areata; diameter diversity more than 20% (P < 0.001) and thin hair (P < 0.001) in androgenetic alopecia; broken hair of different lengths (P < 0.001), frayed hair (P < 0.001), split ends (P < 0.001) in trichotillomania; comma hair (P < 0.001) in tinea capitis and arborizing blood vessels in discoid lupus erythematosus (P = 0.012). Limitations: The small number of patients in some types of alopecia was a limiting factor. Conclusions: Trichoscopy is useful in the differential diagnosis of alopecia. Among the various trichoscopic findings, those of diagnostic value were identified.

AB  - Background: Severity of villous atrophy in celiac disease (CeD) is the cumulative effect of enterocyte loss and cell regeneration. Gluten-free diet has been shown to benefit even in patients having a positive anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody titre and mild enteropathy.
   Aim: We explored the balance between mucosal apoptotic enterocyte loss and cell regeneration in mild and advanced enteropathies.
   Methods: Duodenal biopsies from patients with mild enteropathy (Marsh grade 0 and 1) (n = 26), advanced enteropathy (Marsh grade >= 2) (n = 41) and control biopsies (n = 12) were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for end-apoptotic markers (M30, H2AX); markers of cell death (perforin, annexin V); and cell proliferation (Ki67). Composite H-scores based on the intensity and distribution of markers were compared.
   Results: End-apoptotic markers and marker of cell death (perforin) were significantly up-regulated in both mild and advanced enteropathies, in comparison to controls; without any difference between mild and advanced enteropathies. Ki67 labelling index was significantly higher in crypts of mild enteropathy, in comparison to controls, suggesting maintained regenerative activity in the former.
   Conclusions: Even in patients with mild enteropathy, the rate of apoptosis is similar to those with advanced enteropathy. These findings suggest the necessity of reviewing the existing practice of not treating patients with mild enteropathy. (C) 2016 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Gait speed, maximum grip strength and thirty seconds chair stand test are quick, reliable measures of functional capacity in older adults. The objective of this study was to develop normative data of the said parameters, which is lacking in older Indians.
   Methodology: In a cross sectional study, 723 participants of >= 60 years without any morbidity, were recruited with written consent at Geriatric Medicine clinic of All India Institute of Medical sciences, New Delhi. Time taken to walk comfortably (4 m) was taken as Gait speed. Maximum grip strength was assessed by using dynamometer by pressing it for 3 times in each hand, and the best of six values noted. Thirty second chair stand was assessed by the number of repetitions to stand and sit from a chair in thirty second.
   Result: The Cut-off (25th percentile) of gait speed for both male and female in all age group was 0.6 m/s. The Cut-off for maximum grip strength in 60-65 years, 66-70 years and >70 years for male were 20, 15 and 15 and for females were 8, 6 and 6 in kg, respectively. The Cut-off for thirty second chair stand test in 60-65 years, 66-70 years and >70 years for male were 10, 9 and 8 and for females was 8, 8 and 7, respectively.
   Conclusion: These normative data would be useful to the clinicians and researcher as Indian reference value, which is less as compared to western data. Community based multi-centre study is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - American Diabetes Association defines gestational diabetesmellitus (GDM) as diabetes which is diagnosed in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy and is not clearly overt diabetes. GDM, ifmissed or not treated properly can result in maternal and foetal complications, short as well as long term. Screening for overt diabetes, especially for high risk women should be done at the earliest in pregnancy and for GDM, universally at 24-28 weeks of gestation. One step screening by IADPSG (75 gram OGTT), has been recently adopted bymost of professional bodies to achieve uniformity. IADPSG criteria have resulted in increase in prevalence of GDM, and consequently increase pressure on health care services as well as on patients. This has resulted in discordance of view on universal adoption of the criteria. Many feel this criteria results in over diagnosis without clear benefits. This brief review will provide the answers to some of the important questions pertaining to screening for GDM.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are genetically and clinically heterogeneous axonopathies primarily affecting upper motor neurons and, in complex forms, additional neurons. Here, we report two families with distinct recessive mutations in TFG, previously suggested to cause HSP based on findings in a single small family with complex HSP. The first carried a homozygous c.317G>A (p.R106H) variant and presented with pure HSP. The second carried the same homozygous c.316C>T (p.R106C) variant previously reported and displayed a similarly complex phenotype including optic atrophy. Haplotyping and bisulfate sequencing revealed evidence for a c.316C>T founder allele, as well as for a c.316_317 mutation hotspot. Expression of mutant TFG proteins in cultured neurons revealed mitochondrial fragmentation, the extent of which correlated with clinical severity. Our findings confirm the causal nature of bi-allelic TFG mutations for HSP, broaden the clinical and mutational spectra, and suggest mitochondrial impairment to represent a pathomechanistic link to other neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - AimIn this study, efficacy, tolerability and safety of biosimilar adalimumab (Exemptia; Zydus Cadila) was compared with reference adalimumab (Humira; AbbVie) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   MethodIn this multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, active controlled parallel arm study, 120 patients with moderate to severe RA were given 40mg of either test adalimumab (Exemptia) or reference adalimumab (Humira) by subcutaneous route every other week for 12weeks. The primary endpoint was proportion of responders in two tretament groups by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) at week 12. The secondary endpoints were change in Disease Activity Score of 28 joints - C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) and proportion of patients with an ACR50 and ACR70 response in two treatment groups at week 12. Safety outcomes were also assessed.
   ResultsAfter 12weeks, patients treated every other week with test adalimumab (Zydus Cadila) had statistically similar response rates as compared to reference adalimumab (AbbVie): ACR20 (82% vs. 79.2%; P>0.7); ACR50 (46%, vs. 43.4%; P>0.7); ACR70 (14% vs. 15.1%; P>0.8). The change in DAS28-CRP score was -2.11.09 and -2.1 +/- 1.21, in test and reference products, respectively. It was statistically significant compared to baseline, but not significantly different between the two products. Three serious adverse events and no death was reported during the study. Both adalimumab preparations were safe and well tolerated in this study.
   ConclusionThe results demonstrated biosimilarity with respect to efficacy, tolerability and safety of test adalimumab (Exemptia) and reference adalimumab (Humira) in patients with moderate to severe RA.

AB  - Background & objectives: Since our previous study in 2006, several new modalities for localization of cause of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia such as multiphasic computed tomography (CT), multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), intraoperative ultrasound, and intra-arterial calcium infusion with arterial stimulation venous sampling (ASVS) have become available. Therefore, to evaluate the relative usefulness of various imaging modalities to guide future management in terms of diagnosis and patient care, we analyzed presentation and management of patients of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia.
   Methods: In this retrospective study, medical records of patients admitted with endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia were retrieved. Data pertaining to clinical features, diagnosis, imaging, surgery and patient outcome were extracted. The localization of insulinoma by preoperative imaging techniques was compared with the findings at surgery to assess the accuracy of localization.
   Results: Fasting hypoglycaemia was present in all, and post-prandial hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose <= 50 mg/dl within four hours of meal) in 25.8 per cent. Mean duration of symptoms before reaching a diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia was 3.9 years. Mean duration of provocative fast was 21.8 h (range 6-48 h). Among the currently used imaging modalities, the sensitivity of localizing tumour was 79.3 per cent for multiphasic CT, 85 per cent for multiphasic MRI and 95 per cent for EUS. EUS detected tumour missed by both CT and MRI. All, except one of the operated patients, were cured by surgery.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with insulinoma have a varied presentation. Multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI/CT scan, EUS and ASVS may be complimentary in pre-operative localization.

AB  - Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is an uncommon malignancy with a dismal outcome, which responds poorly to multimodality therapies. Animal studies have revealed Cyclin D1 as a possible therapeutic target. The addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors to chemotherapeutic regimens has shown promising results in pediatric central nervous system tumors. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overexpression has been implicated in various cancers, including medulloblastomas. H3K27me3 is a new marker for pediatric high-grade gliomas. However, their role in AT/RT has not been evaluated sufficiently. We retrieved cases of AT/RT, and reviewed their clinical data and histopathologic features. Immunohistochemistry for Cyclin D1, VEGF, EZH2, and H3K27me3 was performed. Follow-up was noted when available. Fourteen cases of AT/RT were identified (mean age, 3.4 y; range, 10 mo to 8 y). Cyclin D1 immunopositivity was noted in all cases [labeling index (LI): 5% to 98%; mean, 41.3%]. VEGF positivity was seen in 83.3% of the cases. All cases showed EZH2 overexpression (mean LI, 74.3%; range, 32% to 96%). Reduction of H3K27me3 expression was noted in 63% of the cases, with no correlation with EZH2 LI. Two patients died of postoperative complications. Of the rest, follow-up was available for 7 (range, 7 to 120 wk): 1 achieved clinical remission, whereas 6 developed progressive disease, including 3 deaths. Varying degrees of immunoreactivity to Cyclin D1, VEGF, and EZH2 were noted in the majority of the AT/RTs, and detection of these markers may be of value in the development of novel therapeutic agents and in determining which patients can benefit from them. AT/RTs show reduction in H3K27me3 expression, independent of EZH2 expression, indicating that their interaction requires further evaluation.

AB  - Central nervous system germ cell tumors (CNS GCTs) are relatively rare neoplasms. Incidence of CNS GCTs in Western literature is low (0.3-0.6 %) as compared to East Asia (3-4 %). No large study is available on CNS GCTs from India.
   Intracranial GCT cases were retrieved from databases of three tertiary care institutes in India; clinicopathological data was reviewed.
   Ninety-five intracranial GCT cases were identified, accounting for 0.43 % of CNS tumors. Median age was 12 years (range, birth to 48 years); male preponderance was noted (66 %). Most patients (86.3 %) were aged < 18 years. Pineal location was most common (45 %) and was associated with male gender and age > 14 years. Germinoma was the commonest histopathological type (63.2 %), followed by teratoma (20 %). Suprasellar location was associated with germinoma histology. Follow-up was available for 71 patients (median, 15 months). Of these, 48 received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. At the last follow-up, 44 patients showed no evidence of disease. Age > 10 years, male gender, pineal location, and germinoma histology were associated with favorable outcome.
   This is the first multicentric study from India establishing that incidence of CNS GCT in India is similar to that in the West and differs from that in East Asian countries. However, similar to both, germinoma is the commonest histological type, and pineal location is most frequent. Studies on molecular alterations based on ethnicity and geographical location are necessary to provide clarity on differences in incidence. Attention needs to be focused on decreasing treatment heterogeneity and minimizing treatment-related morbidity and mortality, improving the cure rate of these highly treatable tumors.

   Methods: Sequencing for BRAF V600E mutation, analysis of BRAF copy number by qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry for mTOR (p-S6, p-4EBP1) and MAPK ( p-MAPK) pathways were performed.
   Results: Sixty-four DNTs were identified, accounting for 15.1% of patients with drug-refractory epilepsy(mean age: 15.5 years). Duration of seizures ranged from 1 to 22 years. BRAF V600E mutation was identified in 3.7% of DNTs, while BRAF copy number gain was observed in 33.3%. mTOR-pathway activation indicated by p-S6 or p-4EBP1 immunopositivity was seen in 89.7% cases. Interestingly, p-S6 positivity was also seen in adjacent dysplastic cortex. p-MAPK immunopositivity was seen in 50% cases. MAPK and mTOR pathway activation was independent of BRAF alterations. All patients that underwent incomplete resection had Engel grade II-III outcomes (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: BRAF alterations are frequent in DNTs, particularly BRAF copy number gain which is being reported for the first time in these tumors. Evidence of activation of mTOR and MAPK pathways suggestsa role for altered signalling in DNT pathogenesis, and will pave the way for development of targeted therapies, particularly relevant for patients having persistent seizures after incomplete resection.

AB  - Endocrine function is closely interlinked with pregnancy. Maternal and foetal outcomes can be improved if optimal endocrine function is achieved, and maintained prior to conception. This needs a systematic approach which includes rational screening, appropriate management, and pragmatic counseling. This review describes aspects of pre conception management related to various endocrine glands. Pre conception management of diabetes and thyroid will be covered in later articles.

AB  - Neuro-stimulation techniques have gradually evolved over the decades and have emerged potential therapeutic modalities for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, especially treatment refractory cases. The neuro stimulation techniques involves modalities like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and others, This review discusses the role of neuro stimulation techniques in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The various modalities of neuro stimulation techniques are briefly discussed. The evidence base relating to use of these techniques in the treatment of anxiety disorders is discussed further, The review then highlights the challenges in conducting research in relation to the use of neuro stimulation techniques with reference to patients with anxiety disorders. The review provides the future directions of research and aimed at expanding the evidence base of treatment of anxiety disorders and providing neuro stimulation techniques as promising effective and acceptable alternative in select cases.

AB  - Cisplatin (Cis-diaminedichloroplatinum II) is a chemotherapeutic agent having well documented adverse effect as nephrotoxicity. This study was designed to evaluate the nephroprotective role of Boerhaavia diffusa in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Wistar rats (n = 6) were allocated into six groups constituting normal control, cisplatin-induced, Boerhaavia diffusa root extract in doses 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg and Boerhaavia diffusa per se group, administered orally for a period of ten days. Intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin was administered on day 7, to all groups except normal control and Boerhaavia diffusa per se group. On day 10, cisplatin resulted in substantial nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats with significant (p < 0.001) elevation in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, decline in the concentrations of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase, elevation in TNF-alpha level in renal tissues. Boerhaavia diffusa at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight significantly (p < 0.001) ameliorates increased in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. In parallel to this, it also exhibits antiapoptotic activity through the reduction of active caspase-3 expression in kidneys. Findings indicate that Boerhaavia diffusa is effective in mitigating cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and thus, for this the acute and sub-acute toxicity studies conducted to evaluate the safety profile of Boerhaavia diffusa. The no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of tuberous roots of Boerhaavia diffusa root extract was 1000 mg/kg. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cryptosporidiosis is predominantly a gastrointestinal disease of humans and other animals, caused by various species of protozoan parasites representing the genus Cryptosporidium. Detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in human clinical samples is central to the prevention, surveillance and control of cryptosporidiosis, particularly given that there is presently no broadly applicable treatment regimen for this disease. A non-radioactive, genus specific DNA dot blot hybridization assay was developed using Digoxigenin (DIG) labelled probes to detect Cryptosporidium DNA in human clinical samples. Four hundred fifty (n = 450) clinical samples were subjected to microscopic examination, Polymerase Chain Reaction assay (PCR), Dot blot hybridization assay and Real Time PCR assay. A total of forty-one (n = 41) samples were positive by microscopy, forty-two (n = 42) by both PCR assay and dot blot hybridization assay and forty-three (n = 43) by Real Time PCR assay. Dot blot hybridization assay with a sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 99.75% could be an ideal choice for routine investigation of a large number of samples in a clinical setting as well as field.

KW  - Stillbirth
KW  - Foetal cardiomyopathy
AB  - Diabetes in pregnancy starts affecting the foetus even in the pre-conception period. The complications encountered in third trimester are foetal macrosomia and intrauterine foetal demise; birth of a macrosomic baby further leads to shoulder dystocia, birth trauma, brachial plexus injury. Additionally, pregnancies with overt/pre-gestational diabetes may be complicated with foetal growth restriction, congenital abnormalities diagnosed in third trimester and foetal hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Even minor degrees of hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Optimizing maternal glycaemic control and foetal surveillance is crucial for optimizing the perinatal outcome and minimizing aforesaid complications. The management of macrosomia is controversial regarding timing and mode of delivery, but most authorities agree for primary caesarean if estimated foetal weight at the end of pregnancy is 4500 gram or more.

AB  - Maternal complications of diabetes in pregnancy include obstetric complications such as pre-eclampsia, preterm labour, polyhydramnios, increased operative delivery and increased infective morbidity. These can be minimized with optimal glycaemic control. Additionally, pregnancies with overt/pregestational diabetes may have diabetes related complications such as hypoglycaemia, worsening of retinopathy, nephropathy and diabetic ketoacidosis. Women with pre-existing diabetic vasculopathy should be managed with multi-disciplinary approach with maternal and foetal surveillance to detect any deterioration. Such patients have a poor pregnancy outcome. Gastropathy and coronary artery disease in diabetics is a contraindication to pregnancy.

AB  - Background & objectives: Treatment of inflammatory pain with opioids is accompanied by unpleasant and, at times, life-threatening side effects. Cannabis produces antinociception as well as psychotropic effects. It was hypothesized that peripheral cannabinoid receptors outside the central nervous system could be selectively activated for relief of pain. This study was undertaken to measure the antinociceptive effect of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1r) agonist arachidonylcyclopropylamide (ACPA) in a rat model of inflammatory pain after intrawound administration and the effects were compared with lignocaine.
   Methods: Wounds were produced under controlled conditions by an incision in the right hind paw in rats. ACPA (10, 30 or 100 mu g/10 mu l) was administered directly into the wound. Antinociception was evaluated by guarding, allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. This was compared to lignocaine (30 mu g/10 mu l). Reversal of ACPA (30 mu g)-mediated antinociceptive effect was attempted by intrawound AM251 (100 mu g), a CB1r antagonist. Antinociception was also evaluated after contralateral administration of ACPA (30 mu g). Primary afferent nociceptive input to the spinal cord was investigated by c-Fos expression after ACPA treatment (100 mu g).
   Results: ACPA, but not lignocaine, inhibited guarding behaviour, which was locally mediated. Conversely, lignocaine, but not ACPA, inhibited thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. ACPA-mediated inhibitory effect was reversible and dose dependent. It was associated with a decreased c-Fos expression. Locomotor activity was unaffected following ACPA (100 mu g) treatment.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Lignocaine attenuated evoked pain behaviour whereas ACPA decreased guarding score. This difference was likely due to blockade of sodium ion channels and the activation of peripheral CB1r, respectively. Central side effects were absent after ACPA treatment. Further studies need to be done to assess the effect of ACPA treatment in clinical conditions.

AB  - Economic prosperity and increasing connectivity have made Asia an emerging centre of growth in health care, including in the field of urology. Large and varied patient populations, the availability of a trained workforce, the use of English as a common communication language, and overall low costs have contributed to this change. Rapid growth of regional urological associations and journals has fuelled the aspirations and abilities of Asian urologists to not only keep abreast of but often lead the change in urological disease management. Asian urology has immense potential to expand in areas in which it currently lags behind, the most important being research. The increasing ability to travel aids in developing networks for collaboration. However, Asian urologists will need to look at sustainable models of engagement and temper the need for short-term results if these opportunities are to reach their maximal potential.

AB  - Picrorhiza kurroa is an important medicinal plant in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. The root and rhizome of this plant are used for the treatment of various liver and inflammatory conditions. In the present study, we sought to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of P. kurroa rhizome extract against carrageenan-induced paw edema and cotton pellet implantation-induced granuloma formation in rats. In addition, its immunomodulatory activity was evaluated in Complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced stimulation of a peritoneal macrophage model and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 murinemacrophages. Pretreatment with P. kurroa rhizome extract inhibited carrageenan-induced pawedema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation in a dose-dependent manner. This was associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6) accompanied with increased anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in the serum and peritoneal macrophages. Additionally, P. kurroa rhizome extract inhibited inflammatory TNF-receptor 1 and cyclooxygenase-2 in Complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced activated peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, P. kurroa rhizome ex-tract treatment significantly inhibited iNOS and suppressed the activation of NF-kappa B through inhibition of its phosphorylation and by blocking the activation of I kappa B kinase alpha in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that P. kurroa has anti-inflammatory activity that is mediated through the suppression of macrophage-derived cytokine and mediators via suppression of NF-kappa B signaling.

AB  - Valproic acid (VPA) has been associated with coagulation factors deficiency, platelet dysfunction and hemorrhagic complications. We investigated 169 patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE), who underwent surgery, to look for clinical implications of VPA associated bleeding problems. All patients had normal preoperative coagulation profile. VPA was a part of polytherapy in 54% of patients (Group A), however 46% patients were not on VPA (Group B). The groups were comparable with mean age of 17.3 +/- 10.3 years. Mean duration of surgery in group A and B were 255 +/- 70 and 250 +/- 60 min respectively (p = 0.26). Average blood loss in group A was 399 +/- 254 and 389 +/- 228 ml in group B. (p = 0.62). The percentage of total blood volume lost was 12.7% (Group A) and 17.7% (Group B) respectively (p = 0.7). There were no bleeding complications in either group. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy occurred in 4 patients postoperateively requiring withdrawal or dose reduction of VPA. No mortality was recorded.
   We conclude that VPA does not increase clinically relevant perioperative haemorrhagic complications in patients having normal coagulation screen and platelet counts. However, hyperammonemic encephalopathy is observed in 4% of patients in perioperative period, favorably responding to discontinuation of VPA. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/purpose: Pineal parenchymal tumor constitutes less than 1% of all CNS tumors. Pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation is a rare tumor arising from the pineal parenchyma lying between the spectrum of Pineocytoma and Pineoblastoma.
   Methods and materials: We performed PubMed search with the following MesH terms: "pineal parenchymal tumor, pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation, pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation AND treatment, and pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation AND survival" to find all possible publications pertaining to PPTID. Individual patient data on "age, gender, surgery, type of surgery, radiation and type of radiation, chemotherapy, recurrence, and survival" were tabulated.
   Results: A total of 29 studies were found eligible with 127 patients. Median age was 33 years (range: 4.5-75 years). The male: female ratio was 1:1.6. Median MIB labeling index was 7 (range: 1-30). Adjuvant radiation was used in 46 (36.2%) of the patients and chemotherapy was used in 29 (22.8%) patients. Of the patients who had recurrence 62.5% experienced spinal or leptomeningeal recurrence while 37.5% had local recurrence. The median progression free survival and overall survival were 5.17 and 14 years respectively. Univariate analysis revealed female sex and the use of adjuvant radiation to be associated with better overall survival.
   Conclusion: PPTIDs are associated with a moderate outcome with a median progression free survival of 5.17 years and median overall survival of 14 years. Patients with a sub total resection should be treated with adjuvant radiotherapy as addition of radiation is associated with better survival outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) causes significant morbidity among children of low and middle-income countries. We aimed to assess characteristics and outcomes of Indian children enrolled in a tertiary care hospital RHD registry.
   Methods: Pediatric patients (<= 18 years) were prospectively enrolled over three years. We evaluated their clinical and echocardiographic characteristics, valvular interventions, adherence to penicillin prophylaxis, and mortality.
   Results: 451 patients were enrolled in the registry (mean age 12.2 +/- 3.2 years, 34% females). Females had greater burden of exercise intolerance than males (26.8% NYHA classes III-IV versus [vs] 13.8%, p < 0.01). Among 388 patients with no prior interventions, mitral regurgitation was the most common lesion (48.7%). 279 patients (71.9%) had severe valvular disease and this proportion was higher in females than males (80.9% vs. 67.6%, p < 0.01). 248 patients received AHA/ACC class I recommendation for valvular interventions and 53 (21.4%) underwent an intervention during 11 month (median) follow-up. Age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.36), NYHA classes III-IV (aOR 4.96, 95% CI 2.51-9.60), mitral stenosis (aOR 37.01, 95% CI 6.96-196.74), and mixed mitral valve disease (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.03-7.56) were predictive of undergoing an intervention. Mean adherence to penicillin prophylaxis among 274 patients with clinic follow-up was 93.6%. 14 patients (3.1%) died during follow-up.
   Conclusions: Females had greater disease severity in an Indian pediatric RHD registry. Adherence to penicillin prophylaxis in the cohort was good. After 11 months follow-up, one in five patients underwent a guideline-recommended intervention. Mortality was high during this short follow-up period. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective To study if chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.
   Methods Through a cohort and a case-control study design, CP and other important risk factors including smoking, diabetes, alcohol, obesity, and genetic mutations were studied for their association with pancreatic cancer.
   Results In the cohort study, 402 patients with CP were included. During 3967.74 person-years of exposure, 5 of the 402 patients (4 idiopathic CP, 1 hereditary CP) developed pancreatic cancer after 16.60 3.51 years of CP. The standardized incidence ratio was 121. In the case-control study, 249 pancreatic cancer patients and 1000 healthy controls were included. Of the 249 patients with pancreatic cancer, 24 had underlying idiopathic CP, and none had alcoholic pancreatitis. SPINK1 gene mutation was present in 16 of 26 patients with idiopathic CP who had pancreatic cancer. Multivariable analysis showed CP (odds ratio [OR], 97.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.69-751.36), diabetes (>4 years duration) (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.79-5.18), smoking (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.38-2.69) as significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The population attributable risk was 9.41, 9.06, and 9.50 for diabetes, CP, and smoking, respectively.
   Conclusions Genetically determined CP but not alcoholic CP is a strong risk factor for pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Humans have limited capacity of processing just up to 4 integrated items of information in the working memory. Thus, it is inevitable to commit more errors when challenged with high memory loads. However, the neural mechanisms that determine the accuracy of response at high memory loads still remain unclear. High temporal resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) technique makes it the best tool to resolve the temporal dynamics of brain networks. EEG-defined microstate is the quasi-stable scalp electrical potential topography that represents the momentary functional state of brain. Thus, it has been possible to assess the information processing currently performed by the brain using EEG microstate analysis. We hypothesize that the EEG microstate preceding the trial could determine its outcome in a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task. Twenty-four healthy participants performed a high memory load VSWM task, while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. Four microstate maps were found to represent the functional brain state prior to the trials in the VSWM task. One pre-trial microstate map was found to determine the accuracy of subsequent behavioural response. The intracranial generators of the pre-trial microstate map that determined the response accuracy were localized to the visuospatial processing areas at bilateral occipital, right temporal and limbic cortices. Our results imply that the behavioural outcome in a VSWM task could be determined by the intensity of activation of memory representations in the visuospatial processing brain regions prior to the trial.

AB  - Earlier studies reported accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations in ageing and age-related macular degeneration. To know about the mitochondrial status with age, we examined immunoreactivity (IR) to markers of mitochondria (anti-mitochondrial antibody and voltage-dependent anion channel-1) and complex I-V (that mediate oxidative phosphorylation, OXPHOS) in donor human retinas (age: 19-94 years; N = 26; right eyes). In all samples, at all ages, IR to anti-mitochondrial antibody and voltage-dependent anion channel-1 was prominent in photoreceptor cells. Between second and seventh decade of life, strong IR to complex I-V was present in photoreceptors over macular to peripheral retina. With progressive ageing, the photoreceptors showed a decrease in complex I-IR (subunit NDUFB4) at eighth decade, and a weak or absence of IR in 10 retinas between ninth and tenth decade. Patchy IR to complex III and complex IV was detected at different ages. IR to ND1 (complex I) and complex II and V remained unaltered with ageing. Nitrosative stress (evaluated by IR to a nitro-tyrosine antibody) was found in photoreceptors. Superoxide dismutase-2 was found upregulated in photoreceptors with ageing. Mitochondrial ultra structure was examined in two young retinas with intact complex IR and six aged retinas whose counterparts showed weak to absence of IR. Observations revealed irregular, photoreceptor inner segment mitochondria in aged maculae and mid-peripheral retina between eighth and ninth decade; many cones possessed autophagosomes with damaged mitochondria, indicating age-related alterations. A trend in age-dependent reduction of complexI-IR was evident in aged photoreceptors, whereas patchy complex IV-IR (subunits I and II) was age independent, suggesting that the former is prone to damage with ageing perhaps due to oxidative stress. These changes in OXPHOS system may influence the energy budget of human photoreceptors, affecting their viability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite signifi cant advances in the treatment of systemic cancers, progress in the treatment of primary brain tumors has been quite modest. In addition, an increasing proportion of patients with systemic cancers are presenting with brain-only metastases. These observations highlight the critical role that the blood-brain barrier plays in preventing antineoplastic therapies from reaching the central nervous system in therapeutic concentrations. This review describes the anatomy of the blood-brain barrier and currently available methods to quantify the entry of therapeutic compounds into the brain. It also summarizes data from a variety of approaches designed to improve drug delivery to the central nervous system. These include: 1) directly placing drugs inside the blood-brain barrier (polymeric implants, convection-enhanced delivery, and intraventricular administration), 2) modifying systemic chemotherapy (by using high-dose methotrexate and intra-arterial drug administration), 3) temporary disruption of the blood-brain barrier (via use of intra-arterial mannitol, focused ultrasound, or pharmacologic agents), and 4) designing drugs that can pass through the blood-brain barrier. Given that lymphocytes readily traverse the blood-brain barrier, immunotherapy represents a novel approach to cancer therapy that is of particular interest to practitioners in the field of neurooncology. The efficacy of vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors is currently being actively investigated in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors, as well as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The challenge of delivering effective antineoplastic therapies to the central nervous system remains a primary obstacle to improving outcomes in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors.

AB  - ObjectivesTo review the success and technical aspects of pulmonary valve (PV) perforation using chronic total occlusion (CTO) hardware in patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS).
   BackgroundInterventional therapy is possible in selected patients with PA-IVS. Among the various interventional options available, radiofrequency and laser assisted perforation may be more successful, but require expertise and may be substantially costly.
   MethodsWe describe the technique of mechanical catheter PV perforation using currently available coronary hardware meant for coronary CTO in nine cases with PA-IVS. After complete echocardiographic evaluation and informed parental consent was obtained, patients were electively intubated, mechanically ventilated, adequately heparinized and were placed on intravenous prostaglandin infusion. Basic steps involved werelocalizing the atretic segment and accomplishing coaxial alignment of catheters using biplane fluoroscopy, crossing the atretic segment with the soft end of perforating guidewire, stabilizing the assembly and performing graded balloon dilatation with the balloon size never exceeding 130% of pulmonary annulus diameter. For crossing the atretic PV, a retrograde approach was used in one patient where the antegrade approach was not possible.
   ResultsThe procedure was successful in 8/9 cases (89%). Valve opening was achieved in all eight patients with immediate fall in right ventricular (RV) systolic pressures. One neonate died following surgery after catheter induced RV perforation. All surviving cases were discharged from the hospital in good general condition with no evidence of heart failure and a room air oxygen saturation of >85%. No patient required an additional pulmonary irrigation procedure.

AB  - The study presents the design of a 32-channel field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for ultrasound instruments working at high frame rates of the order of 1000 fps. The FPGA does multiline acquisition and Ethernet framing of the received data stream from the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The study also presents implementation of innovative methods of moving window algorithm, critical window capture, and envelope detection in the FPGA, for data rate reduction to aid video processing in laptops. The FPGA has serial peripheral interfacing bus interface towards microcontroller. FPGA also has data interface towards ADCs and Gigabit Ethernet MAC device. The microcontroller has in-line management interface with Gigabit Ethernet MAC through the FPGA. The FPGA dataflow consists of received signal processing of captured ultrasound data from ADCs, temporary storage in FPGA, and forwarding to external Ethernet devices after Ethernet framing. All the functional blocks are integrated and synchronized with an external clock. Internal clock and control signal generation modules generate the requisite timing clocks. The FPGA design has been realized in prototype hardware. The prototype hardware has microcontroller-based control from a MATLAB-based graphical user interface for device configurations and image processing. The captured packets as well as the acquired image results are shown. The design is modular, flexible, have large-scale integration, cost-effective, and can be easily replicated.

AB  - Oxidative stress-induced PARP activation has been recognized to be a main factor in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Accumulating literature has revealed that ACE inhibitors may exert beneficial effect in several disease models via preventing PARP activation. Based on this hypothesis, we have evaluated the renoprotective effect of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and its underlying mechanism(s) in cisplatin-induced renal injury in rats. Male Albino Wistar rats were orally administered normal saline or enalapril (10, 20 and 40mg/kg) for 10 days. Nephrotoxicity was induced by a single dose of cisplatin (8mg/kg; i.p.) on the 7th day. The animals were thereafter sacrificed on the 11th day and both the kidneys were excised and processed for biochemical, histopathological, molecular, and immunohistochemical studies. Enalapril (40mg/kg) significantly prevented cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction. In comparison to cisplatin-treated group, the elevation of BUN and creatinine levels was significantly less in this group. This improvement in kidney injury markers was well substantiated with reduced PARP expression along with phosphorylation of MAPKs including JNK/ERK/p38. Enalapril, in a dose-dependent fashion, attenuated cisplatin-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by augmented GSH, SOD and catalase activities, reduced TBARS and oxidative DNA damage (8-OHDG), and Nox-4 protein expression. Moreover, enalapril dose dependently inhibited cisplatin-induced inflammation (NF-B/IKK-/IL-6/Cox-2/TNF- expressions), apoptosis (increased Bcl-2 and reduced p53, cytochrome c, Bax and caspase-3 expressions, and TUNEL/DAPI positivity) and preserved the structural integrity of the kidney. Thus, enalapril attenuated cisplatin-induced renal injury via inhibiting PARP activation and subsequent MAPKs/TNF-/NF-B mediated inflammatory and apoptotic response.

AB  - Introduction: In the Lower-Middle Income Country setting, we validate trauma severity scoring systems, namely Injury Severity Score (ISS), New Injury Severity Scale (NISS) score, the Kampala Trauma Score (KTS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS) score and the TRauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) using Indian trauma patients.
   Patients and methods: From 1 September 2013 to 28 February 2015, we conducted a prospective multicentre observational cohort study of trauma patients in four Indian university hospitals, in three megacities, Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi. All adult patients presenting to the casualty department with a history of injury and who were admitted to inpatient care were included. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality within 30-days of admission. The sensitivity and specificity of each score to predict inpatient mortality within 30 days was assessed by the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Model fit for the performance of individual scoring systems was accomplished by using the Akaike Information criterion (AIC).
   Results: In a registry of 8791 adult trauma patients, we had a cohort of 7197 patients eligible for the study. 4091 (56.8%) patients had all five scores available and was the sample for a complete case analysis. Over a 30-day period, the scores (AUC) was TRISS (0.82), RTS (0.81), KTS (0.74), NISS (0.65) and ISS (0.62). RTS was the most parsimonious model with the lowest AIC score. Considering overall mortality, both physiologic scores (RTS, KTS) had better discrimination and goodness-of-fit than ISS or NISS. The ability of all Injury scores to predict early mortality (24 h) was better than late mortality (30 day).
   Conclusion: On-admission physiological scores outperformed the more expensive anatomy-based ISS and NISS. The retrospective nature of ISS and TRISS score calculations and incomplete imaging in LMICs precludes its use in the casualty department of LMICs. They will remain useful for outcome comparison across trauma centres. Physiological scores like the RTS and KTS will be the practical score to use in casualty departments in the urban Indian setting, to predict early trauma mortality and improve triage.

AB  - Anaemia during pregnancy is most commonly observed and highly prevalent in South-East Asia. Various effective programmes have been laid down for its management, mainly daily supplementation of iron folic acid (IFA) tablets. Following the same, standard obstetrical practice has included the IFA supplementation without requiring the determination of iron deficiency. In this study, a total of 120 primigravida (N = 60; non-anaemic (Hb > 11 g/dl) and N = 60 anaemic (Hb = 8-11 g/dl)) were selected among those attending the Antenatal Clinic in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India. They were supplemented with daily and weekly IFA tablets till 6 weeks postpartum. Corresponding changes in haemoglobin level on advance of pregnancy, side effects and compliance associated with daily and weekly IFA supplementation and its associations with iron status markers were studied. The inflammatory markers were also estimated. The statistical significance level (p< 0.05) between the groups were assessed by applying unpaired t-test using SPSS (version 16.0). The obtained results publicized the salutary role of daily IFA supplementation in improving the haemoglobin level and iron status markers in anaemic pregnant women though the levels could not reach up to the non-anaemic haemoglobin levels. However, weekly IFA supplementation seems to be a better approach in non-anaemic pregnant women where almost comparable results were obtained in terms of haematological parameters, gestation length and birth weight.
   Conclusion: Weekly IFA supplementation found to be as effective as daily supplementation in iron sufficient non-anaemic pregnant women whereas anaemic pregnant women should be prescribed daily IFA supplementation irrespective of iron replete/deplete state.

AB  - Foetal monitoring in antenatal period and during labour is done to detect foetal distress and to take necessary action timely in order to improve perinatal outcome. Maternal awareness of foetal movement is routinely recommended in all pregnancies after 28 weeks gestation. In high risk pregnancies like diabetes, foetal growth restriction, macrosomia, additional means of foetal surveillance should be used like antenatal cardiotocography, non stress test, biophysical profile or Doppler studies. Diabeticmothers are at increased risk for sudden intrauterine foetal demise, thereby mandating the need of cardiotocography and ultrasound biophysical profile testing weekly or twice weekly in such patients. Foetal surveillance in diabetic patients in low resource settings demands for frequent antenatal visits and non stress test if possible. During labour also, there should be continuous electronic foetal monitoring in diabetic mothers in both first and second stages of labour for early detection of foetal hypoxic stress and timely intervention.

AB  - Purpose: This study was planned to develop and evaluate a simple, easy-to-understand variation of the modified Atkins diet, for use by parents with low levels of literacy in children with refractory epilepsy.
   Methods: This study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, a simplified version of the modified Atkins diet was developed. In the second phase this was evaluated in children aged 2-14 years who had daily seizures despite the appropriate use of at least two anticonvulsant drugs, in an open-label randomized controlled-trial. Children were randomized to receive either the simplified modified Atkins diet or no dietary intervention for a period of 3 months with the ongoing anticonvulsant medications being continued unchanged in both the groups. Reduction in seizure frequency was the primary outcome-measure. Data was analyzed using intention to treat approach. Adverse effects were also studied. (Clinical trial identifier NCT0189989).
   Results: Forty-one children were randomly assigned to the diet-group, and 40 were assigned to the control-group. Two patients discontinued the diet during the study period. The proportion of children with > 50% seizure reduction was significantly higher in the diet group as compared to the control group( 56.1% vs 7.5%, p < 0.0001). The proportion of children with 90% seizure reduction was also higher in the diet group (19.5% vs 2%, p = 0.09). Six children in the diet group were seizure free at 3 months compared with two in the control group (p = 0.26). At 3 months, 6 children had constipation and 5 had weight loss.
   Conclusion: A simplified version of the modified Atkins diet was developed for use by parents with low levels literacy. This diet was found to be feasible, efficacious and well tolerated in children with refractory epilepsy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate predictors of visual outcomes and microbial profile in endophthalmitis.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, interventional case series at a tertiary eye care center. Of the 207 patients included, 83 had post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis (PCE), 84 had post-traumatic endophthalmitis (PTE), and 16 had endogenous endophthalmitis. Vitreous samples were evaluated for microbial profile, and all patients received similar empirical antibiotic therapy. Main outcome measures were good visual acuity, defined as better than 20/400, and microbial profile with drug resistance.
   RESULTS: Final visual acuity better than 20/400 was seen in 88% patients previously treated with intra-vitreal antibiotics (P < .001), 89% with presenting vision of less than 3.3 LogMAR units (P < .001), 61% without retinal detachment (RD) (P < .001), 58% without retained intraocular foreign body (RIOFB) (P = .007), 88% without extensive media haze (P = .007), 71% of culture-negative patients (P = .007), and 65% with gram-positive bacteria (P = .03). On multivariate analysis, presenting visual acuity of less than 3.3 LogMAR units was found to have the highest adjusted odds ratio, 26.28 (95% CI, 9.13-75.6), for better visual outcome. Culture positivity was nearly 37%. Gram-positive bacteria were the most common in both PCE (90%) and PTE (55%) groups, whereas hyphae form fungus was the most common organism grown in endogenous endophthalmitis (50%) (P < .001). In patients without extensive media haze, hyphae form fungus was the most common grown organism (42%) (P = .03). PTE was predominant (60%) in the patients with antibiotic resistance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Presenting visual acuity better than hand motions close to face is the single most common indicator of good visual prognoses. Fungal infections are associated with RD, RIOFB, trauma, and absence of extensive media haze. Microbial resistance may be an important concern in PTE patients.

AB  - Purpose: Levetiracetam (LEV) is often chosen early in the treatment of refractory epilepsy; however, its adverse effects have largely been studied as part of clinical trials. Oxcarbazepine and valproate (VPA) are the other commonly used AEDs and, hence, serve as good comparators. This study was conducted to evaluate behavioral abnormalities and somnolence among patients with epilepsy being treated with LEV and/or OXC compared with those receiving VPA.
   Method: Data of consecutive patients attending our intractable epilepsy clinic over a 2 1/2-year period were reviewed, and patients with at least one seizure a month, who had been initiated on either or a combination of LEV, VPA, or OXC, were included for analysis. Data regarding behavioral adverse effects, daytime somnolence (EDS), and weight changes were collected apart from those regarding any major effect necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation of the AED.
   Results: Among a total of 445 patients screened, 292 (93 F, median age: 21 years [range: 8-54]; 237 focal and 55 generalized epilepsy) fulfilled inclusion criteria. Median epilepsy duration was 11 years. Levetiracetam had been introduced in 114 patients, VPA in 134, and OXC in 151 during the study period. Twenty-three were on LEV + OXC, 27 on LEV + VPA, and 33 on VPA + OXC. Behavioral disturbances (irritability, obsessive manifestations, aggressiveness, and frank psychosis) were observed in 43 patients; 23 on introduction of LEV (20.2%); LEV was discontinued in 10 (9%). Daytime somnolence was reported by 28 patients, 15 on OXC (10%); 8 received oral modafinil for the same, while none discontinued this AED. Only one patient on LEV and 3 on VPA reported EDS. Menstrual disturbances were reported by 9, weight gain by 3, and severe hair loss by 2 females on VPA.
   Conclusion: Behavioral disturbances with levetiracetam are common among patients with refractory epilepsy while somnolence is common with oxcarbazepine. Antiepileptic drugs should be selected with this in perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epigenetic silencing of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) through DNA methylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Present study investigates the contribution of PTEN promoter methylation and its associated protein expression in sporadic breast cancer patients from North India.
   A total of 360 paired breast carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue samples from 180 sporadic breast cancer patients were included in the present study and examined for PTEN promoter methylation status by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry method was used for determining PTEN protein expression. Molecular findings were statistically correlated with various clinicopathological parameters to identify associations of clinical relevance.
   Presence of PTEN promoter methylation (39.44 %) significantly correlated with its expression downregulation (45.56 %) in breast tumors (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, their interaction with various clinical parameters was evidenced in stratified analysis. Correlation of PTEN promoter methylation with histologically more malignant grade and PTEN expression loss with triple negative tumor status remained significant even after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.003).
   Results implicate promoter methylation to be a mechanism partially responsible for PTEN silencing in sporadic breast cancer for North Indian women. Besides, methylation and expression loss of PTEN exhibited promising potential as candidate biomarkers of risk assessment in subcategorized breast tumors with critical pathologic parameters.

AB  - In suicide pact, two or more victims mutually agree and execute to end their lives together by predetermined method, preferably by hanging, drowning, gunshot, or poisoning. The victims are usually spouses, lovers, or friends, and the reasons behind such steps are various. In this reported suicide pact, husband-wife duo jumped from the terrace of a 12-meter-high building with their wrist bound to each other. Although they jumped together, the injury patterns were completely different. The man landed on head sustaining mainly craniocerebral injuries, and the wife landed on feet sustaining long bone injuries. They left a suicide note pointing out sudden demise of their only child as the reason for the suicide, and it was signed by both of them. Jumping from a height in suicide pact has not been reported in the scientific literature yet.

AB  - Introduction: Palonosetron is a second-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with proposed higher efficacy and sustained action for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONY).
   Methods: Randomized controlled trials involving adult population undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia comparing palonosetron to placebo, ramosetron, granisetron, and ondansetron were included. Data were extracted for vomiting incidence (VI), complete response (no nausea/vomiting; Complete Response [CR]), and rescue antiemetic need. This was categorized as early phase (24 hours postoperative for ramosetron and 6 hours for rest) and delayed phase (48 hours for ramosetron and 24 hours for rest). VI and CR were used as markers of drug efficacy. Any adverse effects were evaluated.
   Results: Twenty-two trials (4 with 3 groups) were included (comparing palonosetron to placebo in 5, ramosetron in 5, granisetron in 4, and ondansetron in 12 subgroups). Palonosetron demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo for VI and CR, both early/delayed PONY prevention. For delayed phase, palonosetron surpassed ramosetron in all 3 variables; however, none of the variables attained statistical significance during early phase. In early phase, palonosetron had better VI and CR than did granisetron; however, variables other than CR (better for palonosetron) failed to achieve statistical significance for delayed phase. All 3 outcomes were significantly better for palonosetron compared with ondansetron in delayed phase, but statistical superiority could only be demonstrated for VI in early phase. Being inconsistently documented across trials, nausea scores could not be evaluated.
   Conclusion: Palonosetron is as safe as and more effective than placebo, ramosetron, granisetron, and ondansetron in preventing delayed PONY. For early PONY, it has higher efficacy over placebo, granisetron, and ondansetron. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer of the retina that commonly occurs in early childhood and mostly affects the children before the age of 5. It occurs due to the mutations in the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) which inactivates both alleles of the RB1. RB1 was first identified as a tumor suppressor gene, which regulates cell cycle components and associated with retinoblastoma. Previously, genetic alteration was known as the major cause of its occurrence, but later, it is revealed that besides genetic changes, epigenetic changes also play a significant role in the disease. Initiation and progression of retinoblastoma could be due to independent or combined genetic and epigenetic events. Remarkable work has been done in understanding retinoblastoma pathogenesis in terms of genetic alterations, but not much in the context of epigenetic modification. Epigenetic modifications that silence tumor suppressor genes and activate oncogenes include DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modification and noncoding RNA-mediated gene silencing. Epigenetic changes can lead to altered gene function and transform normal cell into tumor cells. This review focuses on important epigenetic alteration which occurs in retinoblastoma and its current state of knowledge. The critical role of epigenetic regulation in retinoblastoma is now an emerging area, and better understanding of epigenetic changes in retinoblastoma will open the door for future therapy and diagnosis.

AB  - Objective To study the prevalence of Celiac disease (CD) in first-degree relatives (FDR) of CD children.
   Methods This observational study was performed in FDR (parents and siblings) of consecutive newly diagnosed cases of CD enrolled from January 2011 through March 2012. Screening for CD in FDR was done using IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels in serum and the seropositive subset underwent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy and biopsy to confirm the disease. In addition, HLA analysis for CD was performed in most of the index cases and FDR.
   Results Of 202 FDR of the 64 index cases with CD, 17.3 % (35/202) were seropositive for IgA tTG while confirmed biopsy proven CD was diagnosed in 10.2 % (8/78) of children and 8.1 % (10/124) of adults. HLA DQ2/DQ8 was positive in 96.7 % of the index cases and all FDR with confirmed CD.
   Conclusions The prevalence of CD among FDR is 9 fold higher than the general population. High prevalence of CD in presence of anemia and short stature in seropositive FDR in index study indicates need of targeted screening of this subgroup for the presence of CD. CD is unlikely in the absence of HLADQ2/DQ8.

AB  - Background: Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) is a rare extranodal and systemic lymphoma derived from cytotoxic T cells usually of gamma delta T cell receptor type. It is characterized by primary extranodal disease with typical sinusoidal infiltration of liver, spleen, and bone marrow by medium-sized lymphoid cells.
   Case report: A 29-year-old man, with no significant prior medical history, presented with fever and massive splenomegaly. A diagnosis of HSTL was established by histologic examination and immunohistochemistry. Staging workup demonstrated bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. In addition, the patient was found to have hepatitis B infection. The association of these 2 entities has been described rarely.
   Conclusions: Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is a distinct T cell lymphoma associated with an aggressive clinical course, a poor response to conventional treatment, and an exceedingly high mortality rate. An association of HSTL with hepatitis B as seen in the present case is exceedingly rare, with few cases reported in the literature.

AB  - Background: Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare disorder characterized by encephalopathy following a febrile illness, mostly viral. Most cases are sporadic; however, recurrent and familial cases have been linked to RANBP2 mutation.
   Description of the case: This is a description of a three and half years old girl with recurrent ANE with RANBP2 mutation (c.1754 C > T (p.T585M)). She had two episodes of encephalopathy, each following a short non-specific febrile illness. Neuroradiologically, she had typical findings involving bilateral thalami during the first episode and involving bilateral temporal and occipital lobes, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem during the second episode. She was managed with intravenous gamma globulin and dexamethasone during both the episodes. She recovered significantly with residual deficits in her cognitive and language domains.
   Conclusions: In relevant clinic-radiological scenarios both isolated and recurrent ANE should be considered because of treatment and long-term outcome related implications. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - In developing countries, where patients present late, the atrial switch operation is still a preferred palliation for d-transposition of great arteries (d-TGA). In this report, we present our experience in patients with d-TGA who were 5 years of age or older.
   Twenty-seven patients underwent an atrial switch procedure between January 2004 and December 2014. The standard technique consisted of a combination of the Senning and Mustard's repair with Schumacker's in situ modification for construction of the pulmonary venous baffle.
   The median age was 8 years (mean: 9.42 +/- 4.9, range: 5-26 years). Anatomical variations were dextrocardia (n = 3), situs inversus (n = 3), juxtaposed atrial appendages (n = 4) and left superior vena cava (n = 6). Median aortic cross-clamp and bypass times were 63 and 105 min, respectively. The median ventilator support duration was 15 h (mean: 13.7 +/- 4.3, range: 6-24 h). The median intensive care unit stay was 2 days (mean: 2.38 +/- 0.69, range: 2-4 days). The median hospital stay was 6 days (mean: 6.3 +/- 1.7, range: 4-12 days). There were no early or late deaths. The median follow-up duration was 46 months (mean: 55.15 +/- 34.71, range: 1-124 months). There were no deaths or re-operations. One patient had mild systemic venous obstruction after 4 years; one underwent embolization of aortopulmonary collaterals after 5 years. The event-free survival rate at 124 months was 90.9 +/- 6.13% (95% CI: 68.3-97.65).
   The atrial switch operation using the described technique is low risk, carries acceptable results and is a valuable management option in older patients with d-TGA and a regressed LV.

AB  - Background: Laboratory experiments indicate that changes in retinal image size result in adaptive recalibration or suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Myopia correction with spectacles or contact lenses also leads to retinal image size changes, and may bring about similar vestibulo-ocular reflex alterations.
   Methods: A hypothesis-generating preliminary investigation was conducted. In this cross-sectional study, findings of electronystagmography including bithermal caloric testing were compared between 17 volunteer myopes using spectacles or contact lenses and 17 volunteer emmetropes (with no refractive error).
   Results: Bilateral hypoactive caloric responses were demonstrated in 6 of 11 spectacle users, in 1 of 6 contact lens users and in 1 of 17 emmetropes. Hypoactive caloric responses were significantly more likely in spectacle users than in emmetropes (p < 0.01; relative risk = 9.3).
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of myopes using spectacles have vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression, as demonstrated by the caloric test. This has implications for the interpretation of electronystagmography and videonystagmography results, and highlights spectacle use as a possible cause of vestibular impairment. Further corroboration of these findings is warranted, with more precise and direct vestibulo-ocular reflex tests such as rotational tests and the head impulse test.

T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - INTRAVITREAL INJECTION
AB  - Background. Bevacizumab is widely used for ophthalmic purposes. Recently, counterfeit bevacizumab has become a matter of concern. We analysed samples of suspected counterfeit formulations of bevacizumab and assessed the possibility of using simple tests in the clinic by ophthalmologists to prevent the use of counterfeit preparations in patients.
   Methods. We did a protein analysis using Bradford assay and SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of bevacizumab in 16 samples -6 suspected and 10 others. The samples were also subjected to physicochemical analysis such as osmolarity, chloride content and pH. The samples tested negative for protein were analysed by mass spectrometry to detect drugs used in place of bevacizumab. We standardized the method of frothing and precipitation analysis for Identifying authentic samples of bevacizumab before their clinical use.
   Results. Five of the 16 samples tested were negative for the presence of bevacizumab. The physicochemical parameters also supported the protein analysis test. However, no ionizable organic compound (other drug[s]) was detected by mass spectrometry.
   Conclusion. Ophthalmic use of counterfeit bevacizumab can be prevented by simple methods such as the frothing and precipitation tests. These can identify the absence of an active drug.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the utility of perfusion CT (PCT) in differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from mass forming chronic pancreatitis (MFCP).
   Methods: In this ethically approved study, PCT was performed in 122 patients with pancreatic masses of which 42 patients had pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 13 had MFCP on histopathology. Perfusion parameters studied included blood flow (BF), blood volume (By), permeability surface area product (PS), time to peak (TTP), peak enhancement intensity (PEI) and mean transit time (MIT). Twenty five controls with no pancreatic pathology were also studied.
   Results: Amongst the perfusion parameters BF and BV were found to be the most reliable for differentiating between adenocarcinoma and mass forming pancreatitis. Although they were reduced in both pancreatic adenocarcinoma (BF-16.6 +/- 13.1 ml/100 ml/min and BV-5 +/- 3.5 m1/100 ml) and MFCP (BF 30.4 +/- 8.7 m1/100 ml/min and BV-8.9 +/- 3.1 ml/100 ml) as compared to normal controls (BF-94.1 +/- 24 ml/ 100 ml/min and BV-36 +/- 10.7 m1/100 ml) but the extent of reduction was greater in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in MFCP. Based on ROC analysis cut off values of 191 ml/100 ml/min for BF and 5 ml/100 ml for BV yielded optimal sensitivity and specificity for differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from MFCP.
   Conclusions: PCT may serve as an additional paradigm for differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from mass forming chronic pancreatitis and a useful tool for detecting masses which are isodense on conventional CT. (C) 2016 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - MicroRNAs are reported to have a crucial role in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. Hypoxia has been identified as a key biophysical element of the stem cell culture milieu however, the link between hypoxia and miRNA expression in stem cells remains poorly understood. We therefore explored miRNA expression in hypoxic human embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells (hESCs and hMSCs). A total of 50 and 76 miRNAs were differentially regulated by hypoxia (2% O-2) in hESCs and hMSCs, respectively, with a negligible overlap of only three miRNAs. We found coordinate regulation of precursor and mature miRNAs under hypoxia suggesting their regulation mainly at transcriptional level. Hypoxia response elements were located upstream of 97% of upregulated hypoxia regulated miRNAs (HRMs) suggesting hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF) driven transcription. HIF binding to the candidate cis-elements of specific miRNAs under hypoxia was confirmed by Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with qPCR. Role analysis of a subset of upregulated HRMs identified linkage to reported inhibition of differentiation while a downregulated subset of HRMs had a putative role in the promotion of differentiation. MiRNA-target prediction correlation with published hypoxic hESC and hMSC gene expression profiles revealed HRM target genes enriched in the cytokine: cytokine receptor, HIF signalling and pathways in cancer. Overall, our study reveals, novel and distinct hypoxia-driven miRNA signatures in hESCs and hMSCs with the potential for application in optimised culture and differentiation models for both therapeutic application and improved understanding of stem cell biology.

AB  - Esophageal cancer is an aggressive malignancy associated with dismal treatment outcomes. Presence of two distinct histopathological types distinguishes it from other gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment in locally advanced esophageal cancer (T2 or greater or node positive); however, a high rate of disease recurrence (systemic and loco-regional) and poor survival justifies a continued search for optimal therapy. Various combinations of multimodality treatment (preoperative/perioperative, or postoperative; radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy) are being explored to lower disease recurrence and improve survival. Preoperative therapy followed by surgery is presently considered the standard of care in resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer as postoperative treatment may not be feasible for all the patients due to the morbidity of esophagectomy and prolonged recovery time limiting the tolerance of patient. There are wide variations in the preoperative therapy practiced across the centres depending upon the institutional practices, availability of facilities and personal experiences. There is paucity of literature to standardize the preoperative therapy. Broadly, chemoradiotherapy is the preferred neo-adjuvant modality in western countries whereas chemotherapy alone is considered optimal in the far East. The present review highlights the significant studies to assist in opting for the best evidence based preoperative therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) for locally advanced esophageal cancer.

TI  - Mild Bleeders: Diagnosis is Elusive in Large Number of Patients
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: Bleeding is a common clinical presentation. Even patients with mild bleeding disorders are extensively investigated for ascertaining the cause. The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the extent of the possibility of diagnosis in mild bleeding disorders.
   Material and Methods: This was a prospective study of patients referred for work up of mild bleeding for a period of 13 months. A complete blood count, peripheral smear examination, Prothrombin time, Partial Thromboplastin time and Thrombin Time, Platelet Aggregometry test, tests for von Willebrand's disease and Platelet Factor 3 availability were measured.
   Results: 164 patients presented with mild bleeding, in 114 of the patients a single site of bleeding was present. Epistaxis was the most common presentation (39%). Cutaneous bleeding (petechiae and purpura) was the next common site. History of a major bleeding tendency in the family was present only in 11 patients. The investigations showed that VWD (17/164), followed by clotting disorders (CD) mainly mild hemophilia (15/164) were the most common diagnosable cause. There were also 4 cases of hypofibrinogenemia. The disorders of platelets (Platelet function defects/PFD) were the least common (9/164). Rest 123 (75%) patients could not be diagnosed on the basis of these investigations and were labeled as Bleeding disorders - Unclassified (BDC).
   Conclusion: n our study, 75% of the patients with mild bleeding remained undiagnosed even after extensive laboratory workup, thus raising a very pertinent question that is it necessary that all mild bleeders submit to a broad battery of investigations, as the diagnosis continues to be elusive despite extensive workup.

AB  - Background: The stem bark of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight and Am. (Arjuna) is used in Indian system of medicine (Ayurveda) for treatment of various cardiac diseases, including heart failure. However, well designed clinical trials exploring its efficacy and safety in chronic heart failure (CHF) are lacking.
   Purpose: To ascertain the add-on efficacy and safety of a standardized water extract of stem bark of Arjuna (Arjuna extract) in CHF patients on standard pharmacotherapy.
   Study design: Double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled add-on clinical trial.
   Methods: After approval of institutional ethics committee, 100 patients of CHF of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II on standard pharmacotherapy having an echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <= 40% were consecutively recruited with informed consent and randotnized 1:1 to Arjuna extract 750 mg or matching placebo twice daily. The primary outcome measure was change in LVEF at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included changes in (i) NYHA functional class, (ii) distance covered in 6 min walk test (6MWT), (iii) quality of life (QoL), as determined by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), (iv) plasma brain natriuretic peptide, (v) plasma cytokines (interleukin-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor-alpha) and (vi) oxidative stress markers [serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TEARS), red blood cell (RBC) superoxide dismutase (SOD), RBC catalase and RBC glutathione (GSH)] at 6 and 12 weeks. Safety assessment was done by adverse event monitoring and laboratory investigations. Results were expressed as mean +/- SD or median (interquartile range) and analysed with intention-to-treat principle using appropriate two-sided statistical tests. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: Arjuna extract was well-tolerated, but did not change LVEF (24.3 +/- 7.1 versus 25.5 +/- 7.7%; p = 0.4) or secondary outcome measures except preservation of RBC catalase activity [1275(104, 10350) versus 1243.5(104, 10350) U/g haemoglobin; p = 0.01] compared to placebo. Significantly, greater percentage increases occurred in distance covered in 6 MWT, RBC-SOD, RBC catalase, RBC GSH and in symptom severity and stability domains of KCCQ in patients on Arjuna extract versus those on placebo, on a post-hoc analysis, between subgroups of patients who improved in these outcomes.
   Conclusion: Arjuna extract did not improve LVEF in CHF patients over 12 weeks, although there was improvement in functional capacity, antioxidant reserves and symptom-related QoL domains in some patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis and a high case-fatality rate. The reasons for poor prognosis are low rates of curative resection due to local infiltration and distant metastasis. To increase survival rates of patients with pancreatic cancer, early detection through surveillance and screening is important. However, screening could only be cost-effective in high-risk populations. Identification of significant risk factors therefore assumes significance. Risk factors could be non-modifiable or modifiable. Non-modifiable risk factors include increasing age, familial cancer syndromes, Afro-American race, hereditary and other forms of chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and non-O blood group. Important modifiable risk factors include smoking, obesity, dietary factors such as non-vegetarian diet, and toxins. Preventive strategies at the population level and an effective screening program targeted at high-risk people may help in prevention and early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

AB  - Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.
   Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57.8% (95% CI 56.6-58.8) of global deaths and 41.2% (39.8-42.8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211.8 million [192.7 million to 231.1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148.6 million [134.2 million to 163.1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143.1 million [125.1 million to 163.5 million]), high BMI (120.1 million [83.8 million to 158.4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113.3 million [103.9 million to 123.4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103.1 million [90.8 million to 115.1 million]), high total cholesterol (88.7 million [74.6 million to 105.7 million]), household air pollution (85.6 million [66.7 million to 106.1 million]), alcohol use (85.0 million [77.2 million to 93.0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83.0 million [49.3 million to 127.5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Healthy life expectancy (HALE) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) provide summary measures of health across geographies and time that can inform assessments of epidemiological patterns and health system performance, help to prioritise investments in research and development, and monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development.
   Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate.
   Findings Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs off set by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of NCDs, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2.9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2.9-3.0) for men and 3.5 years (3.4-3.7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0.85 years (0.78-0.92) and 1.2 years (1.1-1.3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs.
   Interpretation Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.

AB  - Background In September, 2015, the UN General Assembly established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015).
   Methods We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices.
   Findings In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59.3 (95% uncertainty interval 56.8-61.8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85.5 (84.2-86.5) in Iceland to 20.4 (15.4-24.9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r(2) = 0.88) and the MDG index (r(2) = 0.92), whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r(2) = 0.79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7.9 (IQR 5.0-10.4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10.0 [6.7-13.1]) exceeded that of the nonMDG index (a median change of 5.5 [2.1-8.9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened.
   Interpretation GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the health-related SDGs.

AB  - Background Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract from the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes affecting children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015.
   Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores.
   Findings We generated 9.3 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17.2 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15.4-19.2 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2.39 billion, 2.30-2.50 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2.36 billion (2.35-2.37 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20-30% of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
   Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.

AB  - Background Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures.
   Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography-year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
   Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61.7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61.4-61.9) in 1980 to 71.8 years (71.5-72.2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11.3 years (3.7-17.4), to 62.6 years (56.5-70.2). Total deaths increased by 4.1% (2.6-5.6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55.8 million (54.9 million to 56.6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17.0% (15.8-18.1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14.1% (12.6-16.0) to 39.8 million (39.2 million to 40.5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13.1% (11.9-14.3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42.1%, 39.1-44.6), malaria (43.1%, 34.7-51.8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29.8%, 24.8-34.9), and maternal disorders (29.1%, 19.3-37.1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000-183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000-532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death.
   Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

AB  - Background Established in 2000, Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) catalysed extraordinary political, financial, and social commitments to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. At the country level, the pace of progress in improving child survival has varied markedly, highlighting a crucial need to further examine potential drivers of accelerated or slowed decreases in child mortality. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides an analytical framework to comprehensively assess these trends for under-5 mortality, age-specific and cause-specific mortality among children under 5 years, and stillbirths by geography over time.
   Methods Drawing from analytical approaches developed and refined in previous iterations of the GBD study, we generated updated estimates of child mortality by age group (neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1-4 years, and under 5) for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational geographies, from 1980-2015. We also estimated numbers and rates of stillbirths for these geographies and years. Gaussian process regression with data source adjustments for sampling and non-sampling bias was applied to synthesise input data for under-5 mortality for each geography. Age-specific mortality estimates were generated through a two-stage age-sex splitting process, and stillbirth estimates were produced with a mixed-effects model, which accounted for variable stillbirth definitions and data source-specific biases. For GBD 2015, we did a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in child mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and annualised rates of decrease for under-5 mortality and stillbirths as they related to the Soci-demographic Index (SDI). Second, we examined the ratio of recorded and expected levels of child mortality, on the basis of SDI, across geographies, as well as differences in recorded and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality. Third, we analysed levels and cause compositions of under-5 mortality, across time and geographies, as they related to rising SDI. Finally, we decomposed the changes in under-5 mortality to changes in SDI at the global level, as well as changes in leading causes of under-5 deaths for countries and territories. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 child mortality estimation process, as well as data sources, in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
   Findings Globally, 5.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5.7-6.0) children younger than 5 years died in 2015, representing a 52.0% (95% UI 50.7-53.3) decrease in the number of under-5 deaths since 1990. Neonatal deaths and stillbirths fell at a slower pace since 1990, decreasing by 42.4% (41.3-43.6) to 2.6 million (2.6-2.7) neonatal deaths and 47.0% (35.1-57.0) to 2.1 million (1. 8-2.5) stillbirths in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 mortality decreased at an annualised rate of decrease of 3. 0% (2.6-3.3), falling short of the 4.4% annualised rate of decrease required to achieve MDG4. During this time, 58 countries met or exceeded the pace of progress required to meet MDG4. Between 2000, the year MDG4 was formally enacted, and 2015, 28 additional countries that did not achieve the 4.4% rate of decrease from 1990 met the MDG4 pace of decrease. However, absolute levels of under-5 mortality remained high in many countries, with 11 countries still recording rates exceeding 100 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. Marked decreases in under-5 deaths due to a number of communicable diseases, including lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and malaria, accounted for much of the progress in lowering overall under-5 mortality in low-income countries. Compared with gains achieved for infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, the persisting toll of neonatal conditions and congenital anomalies on child survival became evident, especially in low-income and low-middle-income countries. We found sizeable heterogeneities in comparing observed and expected rates of under-5 mortality, as well as differences in observed and expected rates of change for under-5 mortality. At the global level, we recorded a divergence in observed and expected levels of under-5 mortality starting in 2000, with the observed trend falling much faster than what was expected based on SDI through 2015. Between 2000 and 2015, the world recorded 10.3 million fewer under-5 deaths than expected on the basis of improving SDI alone.
   Interpretation Gains in child survival have been large, widespread, and in many places in the world, faster than what was anticipated based on improving levels of development. Yet some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still had high rates of under-5 mortality in 2015. Unless these countries are able to accelerate reductions in child deaths at an extraordinary pace, their achievement of proposed SDG targets is unlikely. Improving the evidence base on drivers that might hasten the pace of progress for child survival, ranging from cost-effective intervention packages to innovative financing mechanisms, is vital to charting the pathways for ultimately ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

AB  - Kevlar (R) fabric reinforced plastics (KFRPs) are specialized composites with multiple layers of fabrics ( ranging from 20 to 50 layers) designed for high impact applications. In this work, Kevlar-129 fiber was reinforced with polyetherimide (PEI) and polypropylene (PP) to obtain two groups of laminates in three configurations i.e. 16, 24 and 30 layers. Holes of diameter 11.6 mm were profile cut using fiber laser machining system operating at 1070 nm wavelength. Effects of polymeric matrix on the failure of the Kevlar - polyetherimide (K-PEI) and Kevlar - polypropylene (K-PP) laminates were characterized by studying the following: (i) threshold laser power required to make the holes (ii) surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy (iii) damage zone along the laser cut path using scanning acoustic microscopy and optical microscopy. K-PEI laminates underwent material separation at much lesser line energy (ratio of laser power to velocity) than K-PP laminates during laser machining. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to further analyze the laser cut surfaces. A prominent observation on the laser-irradiated surface was: less recast/resolidified polymer covered the Kevlar fabric in K-PEI as compared to a thicker polymeric layer in K-PP. Heat affected zone and damage factors were evaluated using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Surface roughness and kerf width were also analyzed to understand the effect of laser machining of Kevlar laminates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) utilizes several mechanisms to survive in the host cells and one of the main pathways being autophagosome formation. Humic acid (HA), one of the major components of Mineral pitch, is an Ayurvedic medicinal food, commonly used by the people of the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India for various body ailments. We hypothesized that HA could induce cell death and inhibit HBV-induced autophagy in hepatic cells. Incubation of Hep G2.2.1.5 cells (HepG2 cells stably expressing HBV) with HA (100 mu M) inhibited both cell proliferation and autophagosome formation significantly, while apoptosis induction was enhanced. Western blot results showed that HA incubation resulted in decreased levels of beclin-1, SIRT-1 and c-myc, while caspase-3 and beta-catenin expression were up-regulated. Western blot results showed that HA significantly inhibited the expression of HBx (3-fold with 50 mu M and 5-fold with 100 mu M) compared to control cells. When HA was incubated with HBx-transfected Hep G2 cells, HBx-induced autophagosome formation and beclin-1 levels were decreased. These data showed that HA induced apoptosis and inhibited HBV-induced autophagosome formation and proliferation in hepatoma cells.

AB  - Emblica officinalis Gaertn, belonging to family Euphorbiaceae is commonly known as Indian gooseberry or "Amla" in India. It is used as a 'rejuvenating herb' in traditional system of Indian medicine. It has been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Thus, on the basis of its biological effects, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of the dried fruit extract of the E. Officinalis (EO) in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats and also to evaluate the mechanism of its nephroprotection. The study was done on male albino Wistar rats. They were divided into six groups (n = 6) viz, control, cisplatin-control, cisplatin and EO (150, 300, and 600 mg/kg; p.o. respectively in different groups) and EO only (600 mg/kg; p.o. only). EO was administered orally to the rats for a period of 10 days and on the 7th day, a single injection of cisplatin (8 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered to the cisplatin control and EO treatment groups. The rats were sacrificed on the 10th day. Cisplatin-control rats had deranged renal function parameters and the kidney histology confirmed the presence of acute tubular necrosis. Furthermore, there were increased oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation along with higher expression of MAPK pathway proteins in the rat kidney from the cisplatin control group. Contrary to this, EO (600 mg/kg) significantly normalized renal function, bolstered antioxidant status and ameliorated histological alterations. The inflammation and apoptosis were markedly lower in comparison to cisplatin-control rats. Furthermore, EO (600 mg/kg) inhibited MAPK phosphorylation which was instrumental in preserving renal function and morphology. In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrated that EO attenuated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats through suppression of MAPK induced inflammation and apoptosis.

TI  - Possible role of aprepitant for intractable nausea and vomiting following whole brain radiotherapy-a case report
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE

KW  - ANTIEMETICS

KW  - PREVENTION
AB  - Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) is one of the most distressing symptoms that adversely affects quality of life (QOL) as well as the ongoing management plan of cancer patients. Although there are protocols for management of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) but such guidelines are still lacking for RINV. Various agents like 5-hydroxy tryptophan 3 (5-HT3) antagonist, dexamethasone, metoclopramide and haloperidol are used in clinical practice for RINV but the results are not very encouraging. Because of proposed similarity in the mechanism of nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy and radiotherapy, aprepitant, a substance P neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist can be an optimal agent for RINV on account of its unique pharmacological property. We report a case of metastatic carcinoma breast with bilateral cerebellar metastasis. She presented with complaints of headache and intractable nausea and vomiting. A single fraction whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was given for bilateral cerebellum metastasis which further precipitated her symptoms. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of antiemetic used for RINV may be enhanced by adding aprepitant before starting radiotherapy in high risk cases as in ours.

AB  - Legionella pneumophila is one of the important pathogen responsible for community-acquired pneumonia attributing for 1-5% of cases. Since early and accurate therapy reduces mortality, rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed. A total of 134 samples of blood, urine and respiratory tract fluids were collected. Blood was tested for IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies using commercially available kits. A total of 8 (6%) samples were found to be positive for L. pneumophila by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), compared to conventional PCR where 6 (4.4%) samples were positive. Serology was positive in a total of 32 (23%) cases though only 3 (2.2%) of the PCR-positive cases were positive by serology as well. These results suggest that real-time PCR can detect Legionella infection early in the course of the disease before serological response develops.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of this study is to establish a normative database of subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT) in healthy young Indians using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT). Evaluation and comparison of CT of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and fellow eyes were also performed. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study. It included 112 normal eyes of 112 healthy volunteers who had no evidence of ocular or systemic disease, 84 CSC eyes with acute, treatment-naive CSC, and 69 fellow eyes with no evidence of neurosensory detachment or pigment epithelium detachment on SD OCT. Complete history, examination, and SD OCT were performed in all eyes. Results: The mean age of 81 patients (84 eyes) with CSC was 35.04 +/- 8.86 years, 69 fellow eyes was 34.61 +/- 8.71 years, and 112 healthy volunteers (112 eyes) was 33.16 +/- 9.4 years (P < 0.05). The mean subfoveal CT of CSC eyes was 429 +/- 74.18 mu, fellow eyes was 360 +/- 57.99 mu, and normal eyes was 301.80 +/- 46.59 mu (P < 0.001). Conclusion: CT varies not only with age, axial length, and refractive error but also with races. Therefore, it is important to establish a normative database in a particular population before carrying out further research in diseased states. CT in CSC eyes is significantly thicker than fellow eyes, and CT of fellow eyes is significantly thicker than normal eyes. This reinforces the fact that choroidal permeability is increased in both eyes of patients with CSC.

AB  - Background: Since a majority of population in India does not drive automobiles, one item on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) requires modification and validation. In addition, data collected by us indicated that a majority of rural and urban Indians regularly spend time in prayer/spiritual activity. The main purpose of this study was to develop a cross-cultural adaptation of the ESS for a North Indian population, in Hindi language (ESS-I). The study also provides evidence of reliability and validity of the modified version. Methodology: The subjects included were normal volunteers aged 18-75 years (Group 1) (n = 70), compared with patients with complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness, who had undergone polysomnography (Group 2) (n = 22) and patients who had undergone multiple sleep latency test (Group 3) (n = 10). The study was carried out in four phases: Translation and retranslation of the original scale with modification of item 8 (mainly addition of option of question on "while offering prayers or in spiritual activity"); reliability (test-retest) (n = 30); internal consistency (using Cronbach's alpha index) (n = 102); and sensitivity to change (n = 8). Results: Group 1 showed spiritual activity as a significantly more commonly practiced activity than driving. The Cronbach's alpha for the modified version was 0.892 (excellent), and this was not improved by removing the modified item. The alpha value for Group 1 versus Groups 2 and 3 was 0.667 and 0.892, respectively. The scale was reliable over time (test-retest), and it was sensitive to sleepiness change in patients with obstructive sleep apnea during treatment. Conclusion: The ESS-I, is comparable to the original scale. It is reliable, valid, and change-sensitive. It is proposed that the modified version can be very useful for detecting sleepiness among Indian population, especially those who do not drive their own vehicles.

AB  - Inconsistent data exist on long-term visual outcomes in survivors of retinoblastoma. No studies have been reported on role of ocular coherence tomography (OCT) in predicting visual acuity. We assessed visual acuity in patients with retinoblastoma treated at our center in whom affected eyes were preserved.
   Patients who had completed a 2-year follow-up and were more than 5 years of age at assessment were included. Clinical data were obtained from database and factors predicting visual acuity were analyzed. OCT was performed in these patients to assess central macular thickness (CMT).
   Visual outcomes were assessed in 45 eyes of 43 patients, of which 38 (88 %) had bilateral retinoblastoma. The median age at diagnosis was 12 months. Sixty percent (27/45) had International classification of retinoblastoma group C or D disease with 40 % eyes showing macular lesions. The far visual acuity was better than 6/12 in 53 % (24/45), 6/12 to 6/60 in 40 % (18/45) and 6/60 in 7 % (6/60). Macular location and International classification of retinoblastoma predicted poor vision (p = 0.06 and 0.07, respectively). CMT was less than 200 mu m in 3 of 36 eyes (8 %) and 1 eye showed epiretinal membrane. Radiotherapy was associated with foveal thinning (p = 0.003). Two of 3 eyes with foveal thinning had a vision of 6/60.
   Good visual outcomes were observed in half of retinoblastoma patients treated with eye preservation. Macular location and International classification of retinoblastoma group C and D predicted poor visual acuity, while previous radiotherapy predicted foveal thinning, which was associated with poor visual acuity.

AB  - The knowledge gained from echocardiography is paramount for the clinician in diagnosing, interpreting, and treating various forms of disease. While cardiologists traditionally have undergone training in this imaging modality during their fellowship, many other specialties are beginning to show interest as well, including intensive care, anesthesia, and primary care trainees, in both transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography. Advances in technology have led to the development of simulation programs accessible to trainees to help gain proficiency in the nuances of obtaining quality images, in a low stress, pressure free environment, often with a functioning ultrasound probe and mannequin that can mimic many of the pathologies seen in living patients. Although there are various training simulation programs each with their own benefits and drawbacks, it is clear that these programs are a powerful tool in educating the trainee and likely will lead to improved patient outcomes.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the prevalence of pharmacological resistance to aspirin therapy by measuring platelet functions using the technique of light transmission aggregometry.
   BackgroundAspirin is the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a substantial proportion of patients manifest breakthrough thrombotic events despite regular intake of aspirin suggesting therapeutic resistance to aspirin.
   MethodsWe prospectively studied 126 patients with stable coronary artery disease at a tertiary center, who were recruited after ensuring compliance with a single formulation of aspirin (enteric coated aspirin 150 mg). Platelet aggregation was measured using light transmission aggregometry with ADP (10 mu M) and Arachidonic acid (0.5 mg/mL). Pharmacological aspirin resistance was defined as the combined demonstration of mean platelet aggregation of 70% with 10 mu M ADP and a mean aggregation of 20% with 0.5 mg/mL A.A. Patients satisfying either one of the above criteria were defined as semi-responders. Patients satisfying neither criterion were defined as aspirin responders.
   ResultsOut of 126 patients with stable CAD, 64 % were responders, 36% were non responders (semi-responders=34% and resistant=2%). Of the laboratory parameters, only the total leukocyte count was significantly associated with the presence of aspirin resistance (P<0.03).
   ConclusionPharmacological resistance to aspirin is noted in 36% (semi-responders=34% and resistant=2%) of Asian Indian patients with stable CAD. Long-term follow up of these patients will assist in determining the clinical importance of this phenomenon. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Sepsis is one of the most common causes of neonatal deaths globally. Most sepsis-related deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, where the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis remains poorly understood. Most of these countries lack proper surveillance networks, hampering accurate assessment of the burden of sepsis, implementation of preventive measures, and investment in research. We report results of neonates born in hospital from a multicentre collaboration on neonatal sepsis.
   Methods In this cohort study, dedicated research teams prospectively followed up neonates born in one of three tertiary care centres in Delhi, India (Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College, Maulana Azad Medical College, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences [coordinating centre]) and subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit. Neonates were followed up daily until discharge or death. On clinical suspicion, neonates underwent sepsis work-up including blood cultures. The isolated organisms were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. We defined Gram-negative isolates resistant to any three of five antibiotic classes (extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam) as multidrug resistant.
   Findings 13 530 neonates of 88 636 livebirths were enrolled between July 18, 2011, and Feb 28, 2014. The incidence of total sepsis was 14.3% (95% CI 13.8-14.9) and of culture-positive sepsis was 6.2% (5 .8-6.6). Nearly two-thirds of total episodes occurred at or before 72 h of life (defined as early onset; 1351 [83%] of 1980). Two-thirds (645 [64%]) of 1005 isolates were Gram-negative including, Acinetobacter spp (22%), Klebsiella spp (17%), and Escherichia coli (14%). The pathogen mix in early-onset sepsis did not differ from that of late-onset sepsis (ie, after 72 h). High rates of multidrug resistance were observed in Acinetobacter spp (181/222, 82%), Klebsiella spp (91/169, 54%), and Escherichia coli (52/137, 38%) isolates. Meticillin resistance prevailed in 61% (85/140) of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 38% (43/114) of Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Nearly a quarter of the deaths were attributable to sepsis. The population-attributable risks of mortality were 8.6% in culture-negative sepsis, 15.7% in culture-positive sepsis by multidrug-resistant organisms, and 12.0% in culture-positive sepsis by non-multidrug-resistant organisms.
   Interpretation The high incidence of sepsis and alarming degree of antimicrobial resistance among pathogens in neonates born in tertiary hospitals underscore the need to understand the pathogenesis of early-onset sepsis and to devise measures to prevent it in low-income and middle-income countries.

AB  - The authors report the use of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) (DRI OCT Triton; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) to localize, characterize, and confirm the presence of a choroidal neovascular membrane in a patient of focal choroidal excavation (FCE) with recent-onset metamorphopsia and visual blurring. En face OCTA images just above the level of the retinal pigment epitheliumBruch's membrane complex typically showed the presence of a glomerulus-like neovascular network with an adjacent dark area suggestive of a Type 2 choroidal neovascularization (CNV). OCTA was found to be a very useful, noninvasive, and quick imaging modality to detect secondary CNV formation in a case of FCE.

AB  - Congenital retinal macrovessels (CRM) are rarely reported, aberrant, large branches of retinal vessels that can be both arteries and veins; however, they are more commonly veins that cross the horizontal raphe to either supply or drain the macula. In this brief report, the authors discuss optical coherence tomography angiography features of CRM in a 12-year-old male patient presenting with low visual acuity in the right eye since childhood. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such report published in the literature.

AB  - Introduction: Injection drug use (IDU) is intricately linked to preventive aspects for human immunodeficiency virus from a public health perspective. No large-scale data are yet available for injectable drug use among children and adolescents in India, apart from few anecdotal reports.
   Aims and Methods: The present paper reports on the profile and substance use pattern of 509 child IDU users, among a total sample of over 4000 children using substances across 100 sites from 27 states and 2 UTs in India. It was undertaken in 2012-2013 by the National Commission of Protection for Child Rights in collaboration with the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. For inclusion, participants had to be 18 years or less, should have used at least one other substance besides tobacco in the last 1 year, and should be living at home/street, in or out of school. Data were gathered using a 95-item semi-structured questionnaire.
   Results: A large proportion of ever users of IDU also reported use in the past year (96.5%) and past month (92.7%). Apart from IDU, tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and pharmaceutical opioids were the most common substances of abuse in order of frequency. There was an interval of about 3 years from the initiation of tobacco to the initiation of IDU. Average age of onset for IDU was a year lesser in males than female users. The street children initiated IDU earlier than out-of-school and schoolgoing children. No quit attempt was made by more than half of the children. More than 40% had frequent familial conflicts, more than half had a familial history of substance use, and three-fourths had drug-using peers.
   Conclusion: The paper highlights the profile and pattern of children and adolescents using IDU across many parts of India, dispelling the myth that IDU is largely an adult phenomenon in India. There is a clear need to promote different harm reduction and preventive strategies across the "hard-to-reach" younger age groups using injecting drugs.

AB  - Background and AimEndobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and endoscopic ultrasound with an echobronchoscope-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) are useful modalities in the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in adults; however, there is sparse data in children. The aim of this multicenter study is to describe the efficacy and safety of EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA in children with mediastinal lymphadenopathy of undefined etiology.
   MethodsRetrospective analysis of consecutive pediatric (<18 years) subjects who underwent EBUS-TBNA or EUS-B-FNA for the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The demographic characteristics, indications, procedural details, pathological, cytological and microbiological diagnosis, diagnostic yield, and complications are presented.
   ResultsOf the 3,424 EBUS/EUS-B-FNA procedures, 67 (1.9%) were performed in the pediatric (3-17 years) population. Of these, 19 (28.4%) were performed in children 12 years of age. Overall, EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA were performed in 53 and 12 subjects, respectively. In two subjects, no significant lymph node was seen on EBUS. The procedure was performed under moderate sedation in spontaneously breathing subjects in 54 (80.6%) instances. An adequate sample was obtained in 60 (92.3%) subjects while a diagnostic sample was obtained in 37 (56.9%) of the 65 subjects. The diagnostic yield was not significantly different (P=0.59) between EBUS-TBNA (58.5%) and EUS-B-FNA (50%). The sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA/EUS-B-FNA was 79.1% and led to a change in diagnosis in 28 (41.8%) subjects. Complications, all minor were encountered in six (8.9%) subjects.
   ConclusionsEBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA are safe techniques with a good diagnostic yield in the evaluation of children with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:1031-1039. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to determine the pre-biopsy diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) characteristics of patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and perform follow-up studies in these patients to assess the clinical implications.
   Materials and methods: One hundred sixteen men with prostate specific antigen between 4 and 10 ng/ml underwent pre-biopsy MR examinations. Nine of them had HGPIN lesions without concomitant prostate cancer (PCa) on biopsy. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and metabolite ratio [Citrate/(Choline + Creatine)] were calculated and these 9 patients were followed to determine the clinical outcomes.
   Results: Mean ADC for HGPIN foci was 1.01 +/- 0.16 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s while for the normal peripheral zone it was 1.69 +/- 0.25 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (p < 0.005). Mean metabolite ratio for voxels in the HGPIN region of initial biopsy was 0.24 +/- 0.16 while for the normal peripheral zone the value was 2.66 +/- 1.57 (p < 0.005). Four of 5 patients who were available for follow-up were detected to have prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. No significant change in metabolite ratio and PSA was observed while ADC showed further reduction on follow-up.
   Conclusion: HGPIN foci have ADC and metabolite ratio values similar to adenocarcinoma prostate, indicating that such patients have a high likelihood of developing cancer. DWI may help identify such men who may be candidates for close follow-up. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neonatal infections are estimated to account for a quarter of the 2.8 million annual neonatal deaths, as well as approximately 3% of all disability-adjusted life-years. Despite this burden, few data are available on incidence, aetiology, and outcomes, particularly regarding impairment. We aimed to develop guidelines for improved scientific reporting of observational neonatal infection studies, to increase comparability and to strengthen research in this area. This checklist, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for Newborn Infection (STROBE-NI), is an extension of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement. STROBE-NI was developed following systematic reviews of published literature (1996-2015), compilation of more than 130 potential reporting recommendations, and circulation of a survey to relevant professionals worldwide, eliciting responses from 147 professionals from 37 countries. An international consensus meeting of 18 participants (with expertise in infectious diseases, neonatology, microbiology, epidemiology, and statistics) identified priority recommendations for reporting, additional to the STROBE statement. Implementation of these STROBE-NI recommendations, and linked checklist, aims to improve scientific reporting of neonatal infection studies, increasing data utility and allowing meta-analyses and pathogen-specific burden estimates to inform global policy and new interventions, including maternal vaccines.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism, typically a disease of the middle aged and the old, is less commonly seen in children. In children the disease has a bimodal age distribution with calcium sensing receptor mutation presenting in infancy as hypercalcemic crises and parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia presenting later in childhood with bone disease. The childhood parathyroid adenomas are often familial with multiglandular disease and manifest with severe bone disease unlike adults. We report a series of four male patients with juvenile primary hyperparathyroidism, three of whom presented with bone disease masquerading as rickets-osteomalacia. One patient had asymptomatic hypercalcemia with short stature. Parathyroid adenoma was detected in all the four cases and all of them underwent resection of parathyroid adenomas confirmed on histopathology. Post-surgery all the cases had initial hypocalcaemia followed by normocalcemia. One case developed pancreatitis after surgery even after achieving normocalcemia. We conclude that parathyroid adenomas, although uncommon in children, are an important cause of skeletal disease that may initially be confused with hypovitaminosis D.

AB  - Aim: There is a paucity of information on vitamin D status of women with twin pregnancy and their newborns. This case-control study compared maternal and neonatal vitamin-D status in twin versus singleton pregnancies. Methods: Subjects included 50 women with twin pregnancy delivering at > 28 weeks and 50 gestational-agematched women with singleton pregnancy delivering during the same period. Maternal and neonatal serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D] was compared between the two groups using the independent Student's ttest on log values. Serum albumin-adjusted calcium, inorganic phosphate, and intact parathormone levels were also compared. Results: Maternal vitamin-D deficiency (VDD; serum 25(OH) D < 30 nmol/L) was present in 90% of twin and 88% of singleton pregnancies. The prevalence of neonatal VDDwas 89% in twin and 74% in singleton pregnancies (P= 0.03). Maternal serum25(OH) Dwas lower in the twin group as compared to the singleton group (14.3 +/- 10.47 vs 18.5 +/- 12.36 nmol/L; P = 0.02). Mean serumcalcium, intact parathormone, and inorganic phosphate were comparable between the women in the two groups. Maternal and neonatal 25(OH) D showed positive correlation in the two groups (P < 0.001). Mean cord blood 25(OH) Dwas significantly lower in the twins than in singleton newborns (14.8 +/- 12.63 vs 22.6 +/- 16.68 nmol/L; P = 0.002). The difference persisted even after adjustment for birthweights and maternal serum 25(OH) D. Mean serum calcium was significantly lower in the twins. Conclusion: Twin newborns and their mothers have higher VDD as compared to singleton newborns and their mothers in the VDD population.

AB  - Propofol is a popular anesthetic sedative employed in colonoscopy. It is known to increase the patient satisfaction and improve throughput. However, there are concerns among the clinicians with regard to the depth of sedation, as a deeper degree of sedation is known to increase the incidence of aspiration and other adverse events. So we planned to compare the depth of sedation between propofol and non-propofol based sedation in patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopy, as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) based monitor SEDLine monitor (SedlineInc., San Diego, CA). The non-randomized prospective observational study was performed in the outpatient gastroenterology suite of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Patients included ASA class I-III aged more than 18 years scheduled for colonoscopy under Propofol or non-propofol based sedation. After an institutional review board approval, a written consent was obtained from prospective patients. Sedation (propofol or non-propofol based) was administered by either a certified nurse anesthetist under the supervision of an anesthesiologist (propofol) or a registered endoscopy nurse under the guidance of the endoscopist performing the procedure (non-propofol sedation). Depth of sedation was measured with an EEG based SEDLine monitor. The sedation providers were blinded to the patient state index-the indicator of depth of sedation. PSI (patient state index-SEDLine reading) was documented at colonoscope insertion, removal and at the return of verbal responsiveness after colonoscope withdrawal. Sedation spectrum was retrieved from the data stored on the SEDLine monitor. Patients sedated with propofol experience significantly deeper degrees of sedation at all times during the procedure. Additionally, during significant part of the procedure, they are at PSI levels associated with deep general anesthesia. The group that received propofol was more deeply sedated and had lower PSI values. Lighter propofol titration protocols may lead to improved patient care such as lowering risk of aspiration and hypotension. The role of processed EEG monitors such as the SEDLine monitor to improve sedation protocols remains to be determined.
   Trial registration We obtained an ethical clearance from the Institute. No trial registration was mandated, as no interventional drug or investigational device were used during the study.

AB  - This study attempted to evaluate religious coping and its correlates among patients presenting with self-harm to an emergency setting and compared it with a healthy control group. Religious coping was assessed using brief RCOPE. Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Scale for Suicidal Ideations and Irritability Depression Anxiety scale were used to assess for hopelessness, depression, impulsiveness, suicidal ideations and irritability respectively. The study included 32 subjects with depression and 77 subjects without any psychiatric diagnosis who presented with self-harm and 50 healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, those with self-harm irrespective of presence or absence of psychiatric diagnosis less often used positive religious coping and more often used negative religious coping. Further, among those without psychiatric diagnosis (with self harm), there was positive correlation of negative religious coping with impulsivity and hopelessness. Among those without psychiatric diagnosis with self-harm, both positive and negative religious coping correlated positively with depressive scores, severity of suicidal ideations, anxiety and irritability, but associations were stronger for negative religious coping than that for positive religious coping. The findings of the present study suggest that those who indulge in self harm have lower use of positive religious coping and higher use of negative religious coping.

AB  - To evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of growing rod (GR) in the management of Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) with intraspinal anomalies.
   The effect of repeated distractions following GR, in the presence of intraspinal anomalies has not been studied.
   During 2007-2012, 46 patients underwent fusionless surgery. Out of these 46 patients, 13 patients had one or more intraspinal anomalies. 11 patients had undergone prior neurosurgical procedure while 2 (filum terminale lipoma and syringomyelia) did not. A total of 88 procedures were conducted during the treatment period; 13 index surgeries, 74 distractions of GR and 1 unplanned surgery.
   The age at surgery was 6.8 +/- 2.5 years (3.5-12 years). 11 patients had congenital scoliosis and 2 had idiopathic scoliosis. A total of 19 (41.30 %) intraspinal anomalies [Tethered Cord Syndrome (TCS) 08, Split Cord Malformation (SCM) 08, Syringomyelia 01, Meningomyelocele 01, Filum terminale Lipoma 01] were seen. The average lengthening procedures per patient were 5.7 (4-9) with distraction interval of 6.7 (6-7.25) months. Pre-operative Cobb angle was 78.50 +/- 18.1 (54-114A degrees) and improved to 53.10 +/- 16.70 (36-84A degrees) at final follow-up. A total of 15 complications related to implant (9), wound (2), anesthesia (2) and neurological (2) occurred in 7 patients. Among the two neurological complications, one patient sustained fall in the post-op period and reported to the emergency department with paraplegia and broken proximal screw. While other patient experienced MEP changes during index procedure. None of the patients had any neurological complications during repeated lengthening procedures.
   The most common cord anomalies associated with EOS in our study are TCS and SCM. Although presence of previous intraspinal anomaly does not seem to increase the incidence of neurological deficit, use of neuromonitoring is advisable for all index procedure and selected distractions.

AB  - Glioneuronal tumor with neuropil-like islands (GTNI) is a rare, recently described neoplasm, whose pathogenesis has not been studied extensively. The role of ATRX mutations, a class-defining alteration in diffuse astrocytic neoplasms, has not been assessed in GTNIs previously. We therefore aimed to assess the status of ATRX, along with IDH1, 1p/19q and p53, in cases of GTNI in order to evaluate the molecular profile of these tumors. All cases of GTNI diagnosed at our Institute were retrieved and clinicopathological features were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for ATRX, IDH1 and p53 was performed. We identified four cases of GTNI, majority of which occurred in young adults. Loss of ATRX immunoexpression, a surrogate marker for ATRX mutation, was seen in all four cases. All cases were immunopositive for p53, while IDH1 positivity was seen in all three cases assessed. 1p/19q codeletion was absent in the three cases analyzed. These results indicate that the molecular pathogenesis of GTNIs similar to that of diffuse astrocytic tumors. Further, the loss of ATRX expression is seen in both the glial as well as neuronal components, indicating that both arise from the same tumor stem/progenitor cell and that the latter may be a metaplastic change. Thus, loss of ATRX immunoexpression, shown for the first time in these tumors, along with immunopositivity for p53 and IDH1, indicates that these tumors are molecular astrocytomas, and their clinical behaviour is likely to recapitulate that of ATRX-mutant and IDH-mutant diffuse astrocytomas of the same grade.

AB  - A variety of injectable therapies are now available for use in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus, when metformin alone proves inadequate. These injectable therapies include basal insulins, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), co-formulations of basal insulin with GLP1RA, and premixed or co-formulated dual action insulins. This article helps choose appropriate first injectable therapy in a rational manner, and achieve glycaemic control in an efficient way. The discussion utilizes the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of various injectable drugs tomatch them with various clinical situations. It highlights a glucophenotypic approach, utilizing readily available anthropometric measurements, glycaemic patterns, and other bio psychosocial parameters, to create a simple model which facilitates correct choice of first injectable therapy in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Sentinel node biopsy helps in assessing the involvement of axillary lymph node without the morbidity of full axillary lymph node dissection, namely arm and shoulder pain, paraesthesia and lymphoedema. The various methods described in the literature identify the sentinel lymph nodes in approximately 96 % of cases and associated with a false negativity rate of 5 to 10 %. A false negative sentinel node is defined as the proportion of cases in whom sentinel node biopsy is reported as negative, but the rest of axillary lymph node(s) harbours cancer cells. The possible causes of a false negative sentinel lymph node may be because of blocked lymphatics either by cancer cells or following fibrosis of previous surgery/radiotherapy, and an alternative pathway opens draining the blue dye or isotope to another uninvolved node. The other reasons may be two lymphatic pathways for a tumour area, the one opening to a superficial node and the other in deep nodes. Sometimes, lymphatics do not relay into a node but traverse it going to a higher node. In some patients, the microscopic focus of metastasis inside a lymph node is so small-micrometastasis (i.e. between 0.2 and 2 mm) or isolated tumour cells (i.e. less than 0.2 mm) that is missed by the pathologist. The purpose of this review is to clear some fears lurking in the mind of most surgeons about the false negative sentinel lymph node (FNSLN).

AB  - Introduction: Anti-TNF agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) not responding to 5-aminosalisylic acid, corticosteroids, immunmodulators and for patients dependent on corticosteroids. There is a therapeutic gap of 30%-60% with infliximab and adalimumab, which is required to be bridged by newer agents. The present review summarizes the literature on the role of golimumab, a new anti TNF agent, in ulcerative colitis.
   Areas covered: Literature search was done on PubMed using the search terms 'golimumab' AND ulcerative colitis' from inception till March 2016. Golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, was approved by FDA for clinical use in UC in 2013. In vitro studies showed golimumab to be better than infliximab and adalimumab in terms of affinity and neutralization of TNF-alpha and its conformational stability. Golimumab was found to be effective and safe in inducing and maintaining clinical remission, clinical response and mucosal healing in patients with UC in the two registration trials.
   Expert commentary: Although there is no difference in terms of efficacy between golimumab, infliximab and adalimumab, golimumab is better than infliximab in terms of route of administration (subcutaneous vs intravenous) and better than adalimumab in terms of frequency of dosing (4weeks vs 2weeks).

KW  - Mutation screening
AB  - Background: A novel homozygous missense mutation (c.773G > A, p.Arg258Gln) in Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1, 21q22.2) has recently been reported in two Italian and one Iranian consanguineous families with autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (ARJP). Contribution of this synaptic gene related to Parkinsonism phenotypes in other populations still remains unidentified.
   Methods: An ARJP family with two affected siblings characterized by frequent tremor with bradykinesia and rigidity was recruited in this study. Both siblings showed intense dyskinesia and dystonia on administration of Syndopa. The family was analyzed for both mutations and exon dosage variations in PARKIN, PINK1 and DJ1. Further, whole exome sequencing was performed in two affected and one unaffected sibling in the family.
   Results: We identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.1376C > G, p.Arg459Pro) in SYNJ1 segregating in this family. This p.Arg459Pro mutation was not observed in 285 additional Parkinson disease (PD) samples (32 familial, 81 early onset and 172 late onset) screened by PCR-Sanger-sequencing. It was also absent in dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, ExAC, NHLBI-ESP database and in >250 ethnically matched exomes available in our laboratory. The arginine residue is highly conserved across species and predicted to be damaging by several in silica tools. As with the previous mutation p.Arg258Gln, p.Arg459Pro is also present in Sac 1 domain of SYNJ1 wherein p.Arg258Gln mutation has already been described to impair the phosphatase activity.
   Conclusions: We report another novel mutation in SYNJ1 of an Indian consanguineous ARJP family. Finding an additional mutation in this gene further supports the involvement of SYNJ1 in PD pathogenesis across different ethnicities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To compare two commonly used methods of temporary hemiepiphysiodesis (staples and figure of eight plate) in the management of coronal plane deformities of the knee in skeletally immature children.
   This prospective study was conducted between November 2012 and November 2015. A total of 40 patients with 67 affected knee joints, having at least 1 year of skeletal growth remaining, were included in the study. Angular correction was measured by recording the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA), and anatomical tibio-femoral angle (TFA) (for the overall alignment of lower limbs). Implant removal was done after 5A degrees of overcorrection was achieved. The rate of correction (A degrees A per month) and complications related to each technique were recorded.
   The most common diagnosis was idiopathic genu valgum. The overall rate of correction (TFA) was 1.2A degrees for staples and 1.4A degrees for eight plate (p = 0.70, not statistically significant). The correction in mLDFA was statistically better in the eight plate group, whereas an opposite trend was recorded in mMPTA. Implant-related complications were present in two cases of the staples group.
   Although the overall correction rate was similar in both groups, implant-related complications were lower with figure of eight plate. In idiopathic genu valgum (the most common diagnosis), the correction was statistically better in the eight plate group. We recommend figure of eight plate over staples in managing these deformities.

AB  - Early assessment of the pyramidal tracts is important for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients in order to decide the optimal treatment or to assess appropriate rehabilitation strategies, and management of patient expectations and goals. The purpose of this study was to systematically review and summarize the current available literature on the value of Fractional Anisotropy (FA) parameter of the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in predicting upper extremity (UE) motor recovery after subacute ICH.
   PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL searches were conducted from 1 January 1950 to 31 March 2016 which were supplemented with relevant articles identified in the references. Pooled estimate using correlation between DTI parameter FA and UE motor recovery was done using comprehensive meta-analysis software.
   Out of 97 citations, only eight studies met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review and six studies were included in the meta-analysis. A random effects model revealed that DTI parameter FA is a significant predictor for UE motor recovery after subacute ICH (correlation coefficient = 0.56; 95 % confidence interval 0.44 to 0.65, P value < 0.001). However, moderate heterogeneity was observed between the studies (Tau-squared = 0.28, I-squared = 70.3).
   The studies reported so far on correlation between FA parameter of DTI and UE motor recovery in ICH patients are few with small sample sizes. This meta-analysis suggests a strong correlation between DTI parameter FA and UE motor recovery in ICH patients. Further well-designed prospective studies embedded with larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Glorisa superba (GS) is a medicinal plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present study was carried out to investigate the antiarthritic activity of Glorisa superba hydroalcoholic extract (GSHE) in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. Arthritis was induced by sub-plantar administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and GSHE (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 21 consecutive days. Joint diameter was measured on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21. GSHE dose dependently attenuates the increased joint diameter and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- level following induction of arthritis by adjuvant. This attenuation was well substantiated with reduced mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, TNF-, and NF-B. Additionally, GSHE inhibited phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway as there was decreased protein expression of MAPK (p-p38/p38 and p-ERK/ERK p-JNK/JNK ratio). Moreover, GSHE in a dose-dependent fashion normalized the redox status of ankle joint (GSH, malonaldialdehyde [MDA], and NO levels and superoxide dismutase [SOD] and catalase [CAT] activities) and displayed decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in histopathological findings. Taken together, these findings indicate that GSHE protects against AIA by modulating MAPK.

AB  - CC-NBS-LRR (CNL) plant proteins are related with highly conserved family of disease resistance protein distinguished by a coiled-coil domain, which plays an important role in innate immunity. The present study reports the purification and identification of CNL like protein fragment (CNL-LPF) by two step chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/MS), respectively. Furthermore, current study also illustrated the development of polyclonal antibody against purified CNL-LPF, which was used for immunolocalization of CNL-LPF in cytoplasm of cotyledon, using Fluorescence microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy. Lastly, present study also demonstrates in vitro oligomerization of purified CNL-LPF with multiple bands on 4-10 % gradient native-PAGE; each band representing a small fraction of each oligomer population as evident by immunoblots. In conclusion, the current study deals with the purification and polyclonal antibody development against CNL-LPF.

AB  - Purpose: The role of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is controversial.
   Methods: This meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has been designed to compare HFNO with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and conventional oxygen therapy in such patients.
   Results: Initial database searching revealed 336 RCTs, of which 7 were included in this meta-analysis. Five RCTs compared HFNO with standard oxygen therapy, one compared HFNO with NIV, and one compared all three. HFNO did not decrease the requirement of higher respiratory support compared with control group. HFNO was associated with improved respiratory rate and dyspnea score, and better comfort in 3 RCTs, whereas other studies did not find any difference.
   Conclusion: High-flow nasal oxygen does not offer any benefit over NIV or conventional oxygen therapy in terms of requirement of higher respiratory support. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common solid tumors worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that a population of cancer cells, called cancer stem cells (CSCs), is responsible for tumor heterogeneity, invasion, metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence of CRC. The isolation and characterization of CSCs using cell surface markers have been reported previously with varying results. In this study, we investigated a panel of four putative CSC markers, CD44, CD24, CD166, and EpCAM, to define CRC-CSC. Paraffin embedded tissue samples from different grades of primary, untreated CRC were analyzed for the expression of four CSC markers CD44, CD326, CD24, and CD166, using immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometric analysis of CRC-CSC from HT29 (low grade) and HCT116 (high grade) human colorectal cancer cell lines was done. Marker-based isolation of CSC and non-CSC-bulk-tumor cells from HT29 was done using FACS, and tumor sphere assay was performed. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the expression of CD44, CD326, and CD166 between cases and controls. A novel cutoff distribution of CD44 and CD166 was suggested to help for better immunohistochemical analysis of CRC. Higher prevalence of CSC was seen in high-grade CRC as compared to low-grade CRC. Sorted and cultured CD44 + CD166+ cells formed tumor spheres, suggesting that these cells, having properties of self renewal and anchorage independent proliferation, were in fact CSC. Hence, CD44 and CD166 may serve as good CRC-CSC markers when used together with novel cutoff immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression levels.

AB  - Introduction: Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are a medical challenge. There is considerable apprehension among clinicians regarding pathogens reported as carrying New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM) and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) genes from their patients. In the face of extremely high rates of antimicrobial resistance, it is essential to gauge the clinical significance of isolation of pathogens carrying these genes from clinical samples. This study compares the outcome of patients infected with pathogens carrying NDM/KPC genes versus those without these genes. Methods: The study was conducted over a 1-year period at a Level-1 trauma centre. Hospital-acquired infections were diagnosed on the basis of CDC's criteria. The correlation of isolation of a multi-resistant pathogen carrying KPC or NDM genes with the clinical outcome was ascertained. Results: A total of 276 consecutive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Units/wards of the JPNA Trauma Centre were included in this study. Of the 371 isolates recovered from these patients, 116 were from patients who had a fatal outcome. The difference in prevalence of bla(NDM) and bla(KPC) was not significant in any genera of Gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients who survived versus those who had a fatal outcome. Conclusion: Isolation of MDR pathogens carrying NDM/KPC genes from clinical samples is not always a harbinger of a fatal outcome. Efforts should be made to prevent cross-transmission of these pathogens.

TI  - Health in times of uncertainty in the eastern Mediterranean region, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013

AB  - Background The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013.
   Methods GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically.
   Findings The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90.3 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17.2% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186.7 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26 . 9% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83 . 3% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60-80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3.7% to 7.5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred.
   Interpretation Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the conflicts. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ObjectiveThe effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and intraright ventricular dyssynchrony (IRVD) is questionable. Furthermore, it is unclear whether baseline IRVD and RVEF influences response to CRT. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of CRT on RVEF and IRVD and to investigate whether baseline IRVD and RVEF impacts response to CRT.Patients and methodsEquilibrium radionuclide angiography and clinical evaluation were performed in 32 nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy patients before and 3 months after CRT implantation. SD of the right ventricle mean phase angle expressed in degrees was used to quantify right intraventricular synchrony. RVEF was also evaluated.ResultsThere was no significant change in the RVEF and IRVD between the baseline and at 3 months after CRT equilibrium radionuclide angiography studies (RVEF: 40.510.6 vs. 40.4 +/- 10.4%, P=0.75; IRVD: 36.6 +/- 13.7 vs. 36.3 +/- 13.3 degrees, P=0.35). Of 32 patients, 6/14 (43%) patients with baseline IRVD responded compared with 16/18 (89%) without baseline IRVD (P=0.02).ConclusionCRT did not cause any significant change in RVEF and IRVD. Patients with IRVD are less likely to respond to CRT.Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ependymomas are gliomas that recapitulate the ependymal cells microscopically and ultrastructurally. They commonly occur along the ventricular surfaces and central canal of the brain and spinal cord. Intracranial extra-axial ependymoma (IEAE) is a rare entity and is commonly misdiagnosed clinically and radiologically as a meningioma. The histogenesis of such IEAEs is obscure. A novel recurrent oncogenic fusion involving the C11orf95 and RELA genes was recently described in supratentorial ependymomas. A 9-year-old girl presented with a dural based parafalcine mass that, in addition to exhibiting classical immunohistochemical features of an ependymoma, also demonstrated C11orf95-RELA fusion, characteristic of supratentorial ependymomas. We suggest that IEAEs share their histogenesis with their intra-axial counterparts, arising either from dural extension of subcortical, subependymal rests or directly from ectopic dural rests.

AB  - Myoepitheliomas (MEs) are uncommon tumours of the soft tissue with an intermediate biological behaviour and uncertain differentiation. Primary intra-osseous MEs are rare and occur predominantly in the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton in middle-aged patients. The morphological variation of the tumour cells and stromal metaplasia may cause considerable diagnostic confusion, especially when it occurs in an unusual location. A wide panel of immunohistochemical markers is required to exclude other histological mimics. A 37-year-old male presented with a recurrent swelling in the right middle finger for 1-month duration. Radiographic images showed an expansile, lytic, intra-osseous lesion with high signal intensity on T2W fat-suppressed MR images in the proximal phalanx of the right middle finger without cortical breach, highly suggestive of an enchondroma. Histopathology revealed a lobulated tumour comprising of polygonal to spindle cells in groups and cords in a chondromyxoid stroma. No cellular atypia was noted. The tumour cells were immunopositive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), p63, S100 and smooth muscle actin (SMA), compatible with the diagnosis of an intraosseous ME. The proximal phalanx of the right middle finger was excised, revealing a similar tumour, and the patient has been on regular follow-up for the last 18 months without any recurrence. Primary intra-osseous MEs are extremely rare, and this is the second reported occurrence in small bones. A differential diagnosis of ME should be kept for enchondroma-like lesions of the bone for proper histopathological assessment and accurate diagnosis. Documentation of such cases and follow-up will enhance our understanding of their clinical course and prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with unresectable esophageal cancer require palliation for dysphagia. Placement of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) is the procedure of choice for palliation of dysphagia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an indigenous fully-covered SEMS in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: Eligible patients with unresectable esophageal cancer requiring palliation for dysphagia were included in the study. An indigenous fully covered SEMS of appropriate length was placed under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. Outcome measures assessed were adverse events and improvement in dysphagia. RESULTS: Twenty one patients (mean age 57.71 +/- 13.14 years; 17 males) were included. After stenting, dysphagia score decreased from 3.2+0.4 to 0.35+0.74 at 4 weeks. Adverse events included retrosternal pain, respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia in 12, 2 and 1 patients respectively. Five patients required repeat stenting due to stent migration in 4 (following radiotherapy in 3) and tumour ingrowth in 1. There was primary stent malfunction in one patient. The median survival of patients was 140 (76-199) days, which was higher in those who received radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: The stent was reasonably safe and effective to relieve dysphagia due to unresectable esophageal cancer.

AB  - Recent data have provided overwhelming evidence in favor of benefits of emergent endovascular intervention in large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS). India with its large population has a huge burden of AIS. Hence, neurologists need to gear up to the new challenge of providing interventional care to huge populations of AIS in the country. The best way to cover this unprecedented unmet need is to encourage neurologists to take up interventional subspecialty interests through new but sound training pathways.

Further, there is very limited literature to guide such decisions. We report a case of a clozapine-stabilized, treatment-resistant bipolar disorder patient with ovarian carcinoma requiring chemotherapy. The clinical challenges are discussed in light of a brief review of the available reports.

AB  - Background: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is of great importance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are important pathogens and emergence of resistance in these have increased the morbidity and mortality rates. This surveillance study was initiated by the Government of India - Indian Council of Medical Research. The aim of this study is to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and to characterise the enzyme mediated antimicrobial resistance such as extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases among multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Materials and Methods: A multi-centric study was conducted from January 2014 to December 2015 with a total number of 240 MDR P. aeruginosa and 312 MDR A. baumannii isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory, pus, urine and intra-abdominal infections. Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion was done to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Further, MDR isolates were characterised by multiplex polymerase chain reaction to determine the resistance genes for ESBLs and carbapenemases. Results: Among the ESBLs, bla VEB (23%), bla TEM (5%) and bla SHV (0.4%) in P. aeruginosa and bla PER (54%), bla TEM (16%) and bla SHV (1%) in A. baumannii were the most prevalent. Likewise, bla VIM (37%), bla NDM (14%), bla GES (8%) and bla IMP (2%) in P. aeruginosa and bla OXA-23 like (98%), bla OXA-58 like (2%), bla NDM (22%) and bla VIM (3%) in A. baumannii were found to be the most prevalent carbapenemases. bla OXA-51 like gene, intrinsic to A. baumannii was present in all the isolates tested. Conclusion: The data shown highlight the wide difference in the molecular mechanisms of AMR profile between P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. In P. aeruginosa, plasmid-mediated mechanisms are much lesser than the chromosomal mediated mechanisms. In A. baumannii, class D oxacillinases are more common than other mechanisms. Continuous surveillance to monitor the trends in AMR among MDR pathogens is important for implementation of infection control and to guide appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - Neurenteric cysts (NEC) are uncommon, benign, congenital lesions. Ventral foramen magnum (FM) location is very rare. The difficulties in diagnosis and management aspects are detailed with a review of the pertinent literature. We report four new cases of ventral FM NEC, all managed surgically and present a literature review of ventral FM NEC. A retrospective analysis of histopathologically confirmed cases of ventral FM NEC, operated from 2010-2013 at our institute, was performed. For review, only those cases of NEC extending from the lower clivus to the C2 level constituting the foramen magnum were included. Including our four cases, a total of 47 cases were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.2:1. Mean age was 33.5 years (range 1-60 years). Neck pain and occipital headache were the most common symptoms, followed by limb weakness and cranial nerve paresis. Recurrent meningitis was noted in three cases. Hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences with absent enhancement was the most common finding on MRI. Surgical approaches were as follows: suboccipital (n = 21), far/extreme lateral (n = 18), retrosigmoid (n = 6), and transoral (n = 4). The extent of resection was as follows: total, 26; near total, 6; subtotal, 9; and partial, 3 cases. Cerebrospinal fluid diversion was done in four cases for intracranial hypertension. Mean follow-up duration was 26.8 months (range 1 month-9 years). Recurrence was noted in four (8.5 %) cases. One (2 %) case had malignant transformation. Mortality rate was 4 %. Foramen magnum neurenteric cysts are rare, benign tumors of the central nervous system. Accurate preoperative diagnosis can often be established with MRI. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice. Complete excision is ideal but often not possible. Near total removal would suffice with good progression-free periods. A long-term follow-up with radiological studies is necessary as delayed recurrences can occur.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Of the intracranial schwannomas, those arising from the vestibular nerves are the most common. Abducens nerve (AN) schwannomas are very rare, and there is limited literature on their optimal management. Therapeutic options include surgery and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in these sixth cranial nerve (CN) schwannomas.
   METHODS The authors performed a retrospective analysis of patients who had undergone GKRS for intracranial tumors at their institute in the period from 2003 to 2010. Inclusion criteria were as follows: isolated AN paresis on presentation, a lesion along the course of the sixth CN, and imaging features characteristic of a schwannoma. Patients with other CN deficits and neurofibromatosis Type 2 were excluded. Symptomatic improvement was defined as the resolution of or an improvement in diplopia noted on a subjective basis or as an improvement in lateral eyeball excursion noted objectively on follow-up. A reduction in tumor volume by at least 20%, as noted by comparing the pre- and post-GKRS images, was deemed significant.
   RESULTS Six patients with a mean age of 37.1 years (range 17-55 years) underwent primary GKRS. There were 2 prepontine cistern, 3 cavernous sinus, and 1 cisterno-cavernous tumor. The mean duration of symptoms was 6.1 months (range 3-12 months). The mean tumor volume was 3.3 cm(3) (range 1.5-4.8 cm(3)). The mean tumor margin radiation dose was 12.5 Gy (range 12-14 Gy), while the median margin dose was 12 Gy (50% isodose line). The median number of isocenters used was 5 (range 4-8). The brainstem received an average 8.35-Gy radiation dosage (range 5.5-11 Gy). The mean follow-up duration was 44.3 months (range 24-78 months). Symptoms remained stable in 1 patient, improved in 3, and resolved in 2 (total improvement 83%). Magnetic resonance imaging at the last follow-up showed a stable tumor size in 3 patients (50%) and a reduction in the other 3. Thus, the tumor control rate achieved was 100%. No new CN deficits were noted.
   CONCLUSIONS Abducens nerve schwannomas are rare intracranial tumors. They can be cavernous, cisternal, or cisterno-cavernous in location. Excellent tumor control rates and symptomatic improvement can be achieved with GKRS, which appears to be a safe and effective, minimally invasive modality for the treatment of such lesions. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider GKRS as the initial treatment of choice for this rare pathology. Long-term follow-up will be essential for further recommendations.

AB  - Intracranial lipomas are rare developmental lesions, predominantly occurring in the interhemispheric location. Osteochondrolipoma is an extremely rare variant of lipoma with osseous and chondroid differentiation. We present a case of interhemispheric osteochondrolipoma, in a 2.5-years-old male child which was detected antenatally, in association with corpus callosum agenesis. The lesion progressively increased in size with resulting compression of surrounding structures, and was subjected to microsurgical decompression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of intracranial interhemispheric osteochondrolipoma in the existing medical literature. Peculiarities of this case and the diagnostic and surgical challenges are discussed.

AB  - Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)-deficient Niemann-Pick disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the SMPD1 gene. To date, around 185 mutations have been reported in patients with ASM-deficient NPD world-wide, but the mutation spectrum of this disease in India has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to ascertain the mutation profile in Indian patients with ASM-deficient NPD. We sequenced SMPD1 in 60 unrelated families affected with ASM-deficient NPD. A total of 45 distinct pathogenic sequence variants were found, of which 14 were known and 31 were novel. The variants included 30 missense, 4 nonsense, and 9 frameshift (7 single base deletions and 2 single base insertions) mutations, 1 indel, and 1 intronic duplication. The pathogenicity of the novel mutations was inferred with the help of the mutation prediction software MutationTaster, SIFT, Polyphen-2, PROVEAN, and HANSA. The effects of the identified sequence variants on the protein structure were studied using the structure modeled with the help of the SWISS-MODEL workspace program. The p. (Arg542*) (c.1624C>T) mutation was the most commonly identified mutation, found in 22% (26 out of 120) of the alleles tested, but haplotype analysis for this mutation did not identify a founder effect for the Indian population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study on mutation analysis of patients with ASM-deficient Niemann-Pick disease reported in literature and also the first study on the SMPD1 gene mutation spectrum in India.

AB  - In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the geographical bias in immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene usage lead us to analyze IGHV gene usage and B-cell receptor stereotypy in 195 patients from India. IGHV3, IGHV4, and IGHV1 families were the most frequently used. 20.5% sequences had stereotyped BCR and were clustered in 12 pre-defined and 6 novel subsets. Unmutated IGHV was significantly associated with reduced time to first treatment (p<0.033) and poor overall survival (OS; p = 0.01). We observed a significant difference in OS between IGHV1, IGHV3, and IGHV4 family cases (p = 0.045) in early stage patients. Regarding subfamily usage, only IGHV1-69 expression was found to have statistically significant poor outcome (p = 0.017). Our results from the analysis of various molecular and clinical features suggest that the expression of specific IGHV gene influences the outcome in early stage CLL, and hence its assessment may be added to the clinical leukemia laboratory armamentarium.

AB  - Background: Surgical difficulty in laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma increases with tumor size. We compared single surgeon outcomes of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas in patients with tumors smaller or greater than 4 cm to assess safety of the procedure.
   Methods: A retrospective review was performed of laparoscopic adrenalectomies for pheochromocytoma by a single surgeon over a 3-year period. All patients underwent lateral transperitoneal surgery. Operative and outcome data was retrieved and compared for tumors >4 cm versus smaller tumors.
   Results: We performed 28 laparoscopic adrenalectomies on 24 patients including four simultaneous bilateral surgeries. Fifteen tumors were greater than 4 cm in size (mean 6.3 cm) while 13 were smaller (mean 2.9 cm). Both groups had similar operating time (138 vs. 116 min; P=0.2) and blood loss (181 vs. 143 mL; P=0.41). The small tumor group had four Clavien-Dindo grade 1 and one grade 3a complication while the large tumor group had three grade 1 complications. There were no conversions to open surgery. Eighteen patients (75%) did not require any anti-hypertensive medications post-operatively.
   Conclusions: Tumor size does not impact outcomes of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas. Larger tumors are associated with similar operative time, blood loss and complications as smaller ones.

AB  - Treatment of depression, a common comorbidity in patients with epilepsy, is restricted as certain antidepressants are considered to be proconvulsants. In contrast, anticonvulsant effects have been reported with some antidepressants. In the present study, the effect of tianeptine, an antidepressant, was evaluated against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Tianeptine was administered in three doses (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) 30 min before PTZ (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). MK801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, and naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, were administered with tianeptine to evaluate the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate and opioid receptors, respectively. Morris water maze, elevated plus maze and passive avoidance tests were performed for behavioural assessment. Brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated as markers of oxidative stress. Tianeptine showed dose-dependent protection against PTZ seizures. Coadministration of tianeptine with MK801 potentiated the anticonvulsant effect of tianeptine. The protective effect of tianeptine against PTZ seizures was mitigated when tianeptine was administered with naloxone. Impairment of learning and memory by PTZ was prevented by tianeptine. Tianeptine also attenuated the seizure-induced increased oxidative stress. Thus, tianeptine showed an anticonvulsant effect along with amelioration of seizure-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress. Hence, tianeptine could be a useful drug in epileptic patients with depression, with the advantage of having both antidepressant and antiepileptic effects.

AB  - Background: Stiffness is common following fractures around knee. Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) is the initial noninvasive procedure usually performed for such patients. Though MUA has been extensively evaluated for knee arthroplasty, there is paucity of literature regarding its benefits in trauma cases. The purpose of this study was to define the role of manipulation in post traumatic stiff knees.
   Methods: Hospital inpatient and outpatient records from January 2010 to June 2014 were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients undergoing MUA at our institution. Patients with more than one year follow up and adequate data were included. Clinical and radiographic parameters were analyzed to assess outcomes, complications, effect of timing on flexion gain as well as identify risk factors associated with failure.
   Results: Out of 45 patients undergoing manipulation, 41 patients with 48 knees (34 unilateral and 7 bilateral) met inclusion criteria. Thirty six manipulations were successful while 3 were abandoned due to tight tissues and 9 developed complications. Successful MUA resulted in immediate gain of 62.36 degrees of flexion which decreased to 49.86 degrees at 1year. There was statistically significant loss of flexion of 12.5 degrees over a year (p value 0.0013). Arc of motion improved from 48.5 degrees to 106.1 degrees at 1 year (p value <0.0001). Significant improvement was also seen in extension and fixed flexion deformity (p value <0.0001). No significant difference could be detected between early (<3 months) and late (>3 months) groups with respect to outcomes (p value 0.883) or complications (p value 0.3193). Failed group had significantly lower pre MUA flexion and pre MUA range of motion (p value 0.003). Univariate analysis showed that extensor mechanism ruptures during injury (p value <0.0001) and knees with Flexion <40 degrees (p value 0.0022) or ROM<30 degrees (p value 0.0002) were significantly associated with failures.
   Conclusion: MUA is a suitable non invasive treatment option for post traumatic stiffness. There is no effect of timing on outcome and late manipulation also results in good outcome. Extensor mechanism rupture and pre manipulation ROM <30 degrees or flexion <40 degrees are associated with failure and such cases should be considered for alternative options for better outcome.

T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
KW  - Catatonia
KW  - Diagnosis
KW  - ICD10
KW  - DSM5
KW  - RATING-SCALE
AB  - Background and aims: The present study aimed to assess inter-rater reliability and prevalence of catatonia according to four diagnostic methods: Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) both screening and complete scale, Braunig's Catatonia Rating Scale (CRS), ICD 10 and DSM5.
   Methods: For inter-rater reliability, different raters evaluated patients using the definitions provides by the four scales: BFCRS Screen and Total, CRS, ICD10 and DSM5. Kippendorff alpha was used to compute the inter-rater reliability. Concordance between different systems was assessed using spearman correlation. Prevalence of catatonia was studied using the four definitions in a clinical sample of consecutive adult admissions in a psychiatry ward of a tertiary care hospital.
   Results: The inter-rater reliability was found to be good for BFCRS Total (alpha = 0.779), moderate for DSM5 and BFCRS screen (alpha = 0.575 and alpha = 0.514 respectively) and low for CRS and ICD10 (alpha = 0.111 and alpha = 0.018 respectively). BFCRS Total and DSM5 definitions of catatonia had highest concordance (r(s) = 0.892 p < 0.001). In the prevalence sample of consecutive hospital admissions, the prevalence was found to be highest with the definitions of BFCRS Screen and ICD 10 (10.3%, confidence intervals [CI] 3.9% to 16.7%), followed by BFCRS Total and DSM5 definitions 6.9%, CI 1.6% to 12.2%) and while CRS yielded the lowest prevalence rate (3.4%, CI 0% to 7.2%).
   Conclusion: Different methods used to determine catatonia in the clinical sample yield different prevalence of this condition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - INSULIN-SECRETION
AB  - Background: Hyperinsulinemia is the commonest cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy. Inactivating mutations in the genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 are the commonest cause. Mutation in the HADH gene, which encodes the short-chain-L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, is a rare cause. Case characteristics: Two Indian sisters who presented with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. Observation/Intervention: A novel homozygous missense mutation in the HADH gene was identified in both the sisters, while the parents were found to be heterozygous carriers. Outcome: Establishment of molecular diagnosis, optimization of therapy and counseling of parents regarding risk of recurrence in future pregnancy. Messages: HADH mutations are rare causes of hypoglycemia and can be mitigated with diazoxide and appropriate dietary therapy if identified early.

AB  - Glutamate when microinjected at the medial preoptic area (mPOA) influences brain temperature (T-br) and body temperature (T-b) in rats. Glutamate and its various receptors are present at the mPOA. The aim of this study was to identify the contribution of each of the ionotropic glutamatergic receptors at the mPOA on changes in T-br and T-b in freely moving rats. Adult male Wistar rats (n=40) were implanted with bilateral guide cannula with indwelling styli above the mPOA. A telemetric transmitter was implanted at the peritoneum to record T-b and locomotor activity (LMA). A precalibrated thermocouple wire implanted near the hypothalamus was used to assess T-br. Specific agonist for each ionotropic glutamate receptor was micro-injected into the mPOA and its effects on temperature and LMA were measured in the rats. The rats were also microinjected with the respective ionotropic receptor antagonists, 15 min prior to the microinjection of each agonist. Amongst amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid, AMPA increased T-b and LMA when injected at the mPOA. Specific antagonists for AMPA receptors was able to attenuate this increase (p < 0.005). Pharmacological blockade of NMDA was able to lower T-br only. Microinjection of kainic acid and its antagonist had no effect on the variables. The finding of the study suggests that activation of the AMPA receptors at the mPOA, leads to the rise in body temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze etiologies and frequency of hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures (OFs) and outcome of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) at 10 tertiary centers in India.
   Methods: In this retrospective study (2011-2014), patients satisfying Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver definition of ACLF were included. Etiology of acute precipitating insult and chronic liver disease and outcomes were assessed. Occurrence and severity of OF were assessed by chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment score.
   Results: The mean (+/- SD) age of 1049 consecutive ACLF patients was 44.7 +/- 12.2 years; Eighty-two percent were men. Etiology of acute precipitants included alcohol 35.7%, hepatitis viruses (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis E) 21.4%, sepsis 16.6%, variceal bleeding 8.4%, drugs 5.7%, and cryptogenic 9.9%. Among causes of chronic liver disease, alcohol was commonest 56.7%, followed by cryptogenic and hepatitis viruses. Predictors of survival were analyzed for a subset of 381 ACLF patients; OF's liver, renal, coagulation, cerebral, respiratory, and failure were seen in 68%, 32%, 31.5%, 22.6%, 14.5%, and 15%, respectively. Fifty-seven patients had no OF, whereas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 OFs were recorded in 126, 86, 72, 28, and 12 patients, respectively. The mortality increased progressively with increasing number of OFs (12.3% with no OF, 83.3% with five OFs). During a median hospital stay of 8 days, 42.6% (447/1049) of patients died. On multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazard model, elevated serum creatinine (hazard ratio [HR] 1.176), advanced hepatic encephalopathy (HR 2.698), and requirement of ventilator support (HR 2.484) were independent predictors of mortality.
   Conclusions: Alcohol was the commonest etiology of ACLF. Within a mean hospital stay of 8 days, 42% patients died. OFs independently predicted survival.

   Study designRetrospective analysis.
   SettingTertiary care hospital.
   Main outcome measuresOverall treatment time (OTT), acute radiation morbidity and treatment completion rate without prolongation of overall treatment time of more than 2 days.
   ResultsThree hundred and seventy-eight head and neck carcinoma patients treated with radical CRT with 70 Gy/35 fractions of radiotherapy with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) were included in the study. Median age was 52 years (range 22-77 years), oropharynx was most commonly (54%) involved site, and 55% were in stage IV disease. Majority (86%) of patients were able to complete cancer-directed therapy, median OTT was 52 days (46-140 days). Nineteen per cent of patients completed treatment without prolongation of OTT beyond 2 days and 68% of patients there completed treatment prolongation of OTT beyond 7 days. Nearly, sixty-six of the patients experienced grade II or higher acute radiation morbidities.
   ConclusionsDelivery of weekly low-dose concurrent CRT is safe and feasible. Two-thirds of the patients experienced treatment prolongation of more than 2 days and 14% could not complete treatment. Results within in the study suggest to a greater need to lay emphasis on continuity of a course of radical CRT for HNSCC.

AB  - Introduction: Recent years have seen a rise of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from common contaminants to agents of nosocomial blood stream infections (BSI's). Molecular typing and establishing a correlation with antibiotic resistance is essential particularly in countries like India where genotyping studies for drug-resistant CoNS are sparse. Methods: A prospective study was done over 18 months, wherein 42,693 blood samples were received, and 59 patients with BSI due to CoNS were evaluated. The isolates recovered were identified by a biochemical test panel and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing by Kirby-Baur disc diffusion method and E-test strips. Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) element was characterised by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for all methicillin-resistant (MR) isolates. Results: The majority of CoNS isolated were constituted by Staphylococcus haemolyticus (47.5%) followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (33.9%), Staphylococcus hominis (11.86%), Staphylococcus cohnii (5.08%) and Staphylococcus warneri (1.69%). Among all isolates 57.6% were MR with statistically significant higher resistance versus methicillin sensitive-CoNS. This difference was significant for erythromycin (76% vs. 44%, P = 0.011), rifampicin (50% vs. 12%, P = 0.002) and amikacin (26.5% vs. 4%, P = 0.023), ciprofloxacin (64.7% vs. 20%, P = 0.001) and cotrimoxazole (55.9% vs. 20%, P = 0.006). SCCmec type I was predominant (61.8%, P = 0.028) and exhibited multidrug resistance (76.2%). Coexistence of SCCmec type I and III was seen in 8.82% MR isolates. Conclusion: CoNS exhibit high antimicrobial resistance thereby limiting treatment options. The presence of new variants of SCCmec type in hospital-acquired CoNS may predict the antibiotic resistance pattern. This is the first evaluation of the molecular epidemiology of CoNS causing BSI from India and can serve as a guide in the formulation of hospital infection control and treatment guidelines.

AB  - ObjectivesWe compared dual-source CT (DSCT) and conventional angiography (CA) in evaluation of chronic total occlusion (CTO) of coronary arteries.
   BackgroundPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in CTO is technically difficult and has comparatively lower success rate than intervention in non-occluded artery. Accurate assessment of lesion morphology is an important determinant of PCI success in CTO.
   MethodsNineteen symptomatic patients (18 men, age: 58.610.6 years) with a CTO on CA were subjected to a DSCT (Definition, Siemens, Germany). Heart rate (HR) control was not performed. Dedicated post-processing software was used for lesion analysis on both modalities. Presence of bridging collaterals, stump morphology, calcification, side branch, proximal tortuosity, occlusion length, distal vessel interpretability, and distal lesions were statistically compared.
   ResultsThere were 20 CTOs. HR during DSCT ranged from 53 to 131 bpm. Bridging collaterals were seen in 3/20 (15%) lesions on CA and in none on DSCT. Stump anatomy and side branch were identified equally well. Plaque calcification was identified in 5/20 (25%) lesions on CA and in 12/20 (60%) lesions on DSCT (P=0.025). Nature and extent of calcification were better visualized on DSCT. No proximal tortuosity was noted. Distal vessel was better interpretable on DSCT (15/20; 75%) compared to CA (9/20; 45%) (P=0.05). No significant difference in lesion length was noted.
   ConclusionDSCT performs as well as CA for most features of CTO. Avoidance of need to control HR, ability to better detect and characterize calcium and to interpret distal vessels make it a useful pre-intervention investigation. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which has captured the attention of not only pediatricians but also the parents. From the symptoms until the final diagnosis, parents undergo a diagnostic odyssey that involves a battery of tests without much yield. This has led to an increase in the referrals to the clinical geneticists to rule out the possible genetic etiology that can have implications for the parents for future pregnancy. This chapter focuses on the various genetic causes and their appropriate application in the evaluation of a child with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs).

AB  - The study presents a retrospective analysis of 64 cases of death resulting from ingestion of corrosive substances. The cases represented approximately 0.4% of all autopsies conducted and 13.6% of all fatal poisonings studied during the 10-year period from January 2005 to December 2014 at the Department of Forensic Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. The data was analyzed with regard to age, sex, nature and source of corrosive substance used, survival period, cause and manner of death. Males (64.06%) outnumbered females (35.94%), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.78:1. The most common age group involved was 21-30 years (35.94%). Sulfuric acid (68.75%) presented as the most common corrosive substance ingested. Household cleaning substances (39.06%) were identified as a common source of such type of corrosive substance, but the exact source could not be identified in 56.26% of cases. In the majority of cases (46.88%) death was due to perforation peritonitis. Most of the victims (54.69%) succumbed to their injuries within a day of ingestion. In 87.5% of cases, the corrosive substance was consumed for suicidal purposes. A strict regulatory framework is required for the production, distribution, storage and use of corrosive substances. Preventive guidelines and creating awareness among the masses will go a long way towards curbing such unfortunate incidents.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Experimental studies in acute pancreatitis (AP) suggest a strong association of acinar cell injury with cathepsin B-dependent intracellular activation of trypsin. However, the molecular events subsequent to trypsin activation and their role, if any, in cell death is not clear. In this study, we have explored intra-acinar events downstream of trypsin activation that lead to acinar cell death. METHODS: Acinar cells prepared from the pancreas of rats or mice (wildtype, trypsinogen 7, or cathepsin B-deleted) were stimulated with supramaximal cerulein, and the cytosolic activity of cathepsin B and trypsin was evaluated. Permeabilized acini were used to understand the differential role of cytosolic trypsin vs cytosolic cathepsin B in activation of apoptosis. Cell death was evaluated by measuring specific markers for apoptosis and necrosis. RESULTS: Both in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that during AP cathepsin B leaks into the cytosol from co-localized organelles, through a mechanism dependent on active trypsin. Cytosolic cathepsin B but not trypsin activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through cleavage of bid and activation of bax. Finally, excessive release of cathepsin B into the cytosol can lead to cell death through necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: This report defines the role of trypsin in AP and shows that cytosolic cathepsin B but not trypsin activates cell death pathways. This report also suggests that trypsin is a requisite for AP only because it causes release of cathepsin B into the cytosol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding second-line therapy in children with acute asthma who fail to the standard therapy. Ketamine had bronchodilator property and may be useful in the treatment of acute asthma.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ketamine as compared to aminophylline in children with acute asthma who respond poorly to the standard therapy.
   METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included patients with acute asthma having Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) score >= 5 at 2 h of standard therapy. The enrolled patients received either intravenous (IV) ketamine or IV aminophylline. Primary outcome measure was change in PRAM score at the end of intervention. Secondary outcome measures included adverse effects, change in PO2 and PCO2, need for mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.
   RESULTS: The trial included 24 patients each in ketamine and aminophylline groups. The baseline parameters were similar between the groups. The primary outcome was similar in both the groups with a change in PRAM score of 4.00 +/- 1.25 and 4.17 +/- 1.68 (P = 0.699) in ketamine and aminophylline groups, respectively. The secondary outcomes were not different between the groups.
   CONCLUSION: Ketamine and aminophylline were equally effective for children with acute asthma who responded poorly to the standard therapy.

AB  - Purpose To report outcomes of autologous simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) performed for unilateral limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) at multiple centres worldwide.
   Methods In this retrospective, multicentre, interventional case series, records of patients who had undergone autologous SLET for unilateral LSCD, with a minimum of 6months of follow-up, were reviewed. The primary outcome measure was clinical success, defined as a completely epithelised, avascular corneal surface. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and survival probability was calculated. A Cox proportional hazards analysis was done to assess association of preoperative characteristics with risk of failure. Secondary outcome measures included the percentage of eyes achieving visual acuity of 20/200 or better, percentage of eyes gaining two or more Snellen lines and complications encountered.
   Results 68 eyes of 68 patients underwent autologous SLET, performed across eight centres in three countries. Clinical success was achieved in 57 cases (83.8%). With a median follow-up of 12months, survival probability exceeded 80%. Presence of symblepharon (HR 5.8) and simultaneous keratoplasty (HR 10.8) were found to be significantly associated with a risk of failure. 44 eyes (64.7%) achieved a visual acuity of 20/200 or better, and 44 eyes (64.7%) gained two or more Snellen lines. Focal recurrences of pannus were noted in 21 eyes (36.8%) with clinical success.
   Conclusion Autologous SLET is an effective and safe modality for treatment of unilateral LSCD. Clinical success rates and visual acuity improvement are equal to or better than those reported with earlier techniques.

TI  - Effectiveness of weekly azathioprine pulse in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis: an open-label study
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
KW  - PEMPHIGUS
AB  - BackgroundAzathioprine is a potent immunosuppressive drug that has been used in many immune-mediated diseases. There are a few reports of its use in psoriasis; however, azathioprine weekly pulse doses have not been evaluated in this disease.
   AimThe objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of weekly oral pulse doses of azathioprine for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, and to determine the side effects of this regimen both clinically and biochemically.
   MethodsIn this open-label clinical trial, a 300mg bolus dose of azathioprine was given once every week orally for 24weeks to patients with chronic plaque psoriasis having body surface area involvement of 10% and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 10. Patients were evaluated every 4weeks for 24weeks to determine the response to treatment and any adverse effects (AEs), and then followed up for a further period of 12weeks to determine any relapse of the disease.
   ResultsThere were 50 patients in the study, of whom 28 (56%) completed the 24weeks of treatment and 27 (54%) completed the 12-week post-treatment follow-up. Azathioprine 300mg weekly pulse was effective in achieving PASI 75 in 42% of patients, PASI 90 in 36% of patients and PASI 100 in 22% of patients. In five patients (10%), the therapy had to be withdrawn due to AEs.
   ConclusionWeekly azathioprine pulse appears to be an effective treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis, and can be used as an alternative therapy to other available therapeutic agents.

AB  - Rheumatic fever is caused by an abnormal immune reaction to group A streptococcal infection. Secondary prophylaxis with antibiotics is recommended for people after their initial episode of rheumatic fever to prevent recurrent group A streptococcal infections, recurrences of rheumatic fever and progression to rheumatic heart disease. This secondary prophylaxis must be maintained for at least a decade after the last episode of rheumatic fever. Benzathine penicillin G is the first line antibiotic for secondary prophylaxis, delivered intramuscularly every 2 to 4 weeks. However, adherence to recommended secondary prophylaxis regimens is a global challenge. This paper outlines a consultation with global experts in rheumatic heart disease on the characteristics of benzathine penicillin G formulations which could be changed to improve adherence with secondary prophylaxis. Characteristics included dose interval, pain, administration mechanism, cold chain independence and cost. A sample target product profile for reformulated benzathine penicillin G is presented.

AB  - Background: Hepatocyte Paraffin 1 ( Hep Par 1) was being extensively used to recognize the hepatocellular carcinomas, until recognition of its expression in tumors without hepatocellular differentiation. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze if Hep Par 1 stain can serve as a specific marker of the small intestinal ( SI) adenocarcinomas, versus other gastrointestinal tract ( GIT) primary tumors. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, normal GIT mucosa ( n - 60), corresponding adenocarcinomas ( n - 60) and nodal metastatic foci ( n - 60) from the same patients, including 10 cases each from the esophagus, stomach, SI periampullary region, colon, rectum, and gall bladder were included. H-score was calculated by multiplying the stain distribution and intensity scores. The H-scores were compared with other clinical and histological parameters. Results: While normal SI mucosa showed diffuse strong Hep Par 1 staining, normal esophageal and gastric epitheliums were negative and normal colon, rectal, and biliary epithelium showed weak focal positivity. Adenocarcinomas from all these sites, however, showed Hep Par 1 expression, irrespective of the tumor type, site or origin, and tumor stage. The corresponding metastatic sites also showed variable Hep Par 1 positivity, without any site specificity. Conclusion: Hep Par 1 stain cannot help to determine the exact site of origin of primary GIT tumors. Its expression in adenocarcinomas across the GIT and their metastatic foci proves that it cannot be regarded as a marker of SI differentiation, especially in malignancy.

Polymeric carriers can be used to overcome these problems. The present study is focused on the use of polyhydroxybutyrate as a potential nanovehicle for the delivery of anticancer peptides. PHB (72 kDa) was produced by thermal treatment of high molecular weight PHB (300 kDa) under melt conditions and then conjugated with PEG (4 kDa) by Steglich esterification reaction. Anticancer peptide NuBCP-9 (FSRSLHSLL) encapsulated PHB72K-PEG(4K) NPs were prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. PHB72K-PEG(4K) NPs showed encapsulation efficiency of 61% and exhibited sustained release of peptide over a period of 26 days at physiological pH. NuBCP-9 loaded PHB72K-PEG(4K) NPs showed an IC50 value of 2.2 mu M & 1.6 mu M in MCF-7 cells in 48 h and 72 h respectively. Confocal laser microscopy confirmed efficient cellular uptake and induction of apoptosis by peptide loaded NPs in a time dependent manner. In vivo intraperitonial administration of 20 mg/kg NuBCP-9/NPs twice a week for three weeks triggered 90% tumor regression in Ehrlich syngeneic mouse model. Our results illustrated the potential of PHB72K-PEG(4K) based nanoformulation as a tool for targeting intracellular proteins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A number of factors like alcohol consumption, stress, use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acidity are well known to increase the risk of development of gastric ulcers. The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of artesunate against gastric injury induced in rats by oral administration of ethanol and by pylorus ligation in independent sets of experiments. The groups included in each set (n = 6 per group) were normal control, experimental control and drug treated groups: artesunate 50 and 150 mg/kg (ART 50 and ART 150) and famotidine 20 mg/kg (FAM 20). Artesunate and famotidine were given orally 1 h before induction of gastric ulceration and the macroscopic changes, median ulcer score, gastric juice parameters (volume, pH and acidity), markers of oxidative stress and inflammation (GSH, SOD, TBARS and MPO) and tissue histology were evaluated in both the models. The study was extended further for determination of tissue levels of TNE-alpha and expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and NF kappa B (p65) in ethanol induced gastric ulcer model. The results of the present study show that pretreatment with artesunate significantly decreased hemorrhagic lesions and mucosal damage with marked reduction in median ulcer score in both the models. The protective effect of artesunate was concomitant with dose-dependent normalization of gastric juice parameters, markers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The ameliorative effect of artesunate was also supported by restoration of histological architecture. Furthermore, artesunate pretreatment also alleviated the gastric mucosal inflammation as revealed by significant decrease in the tissue level of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, (p < 0.01) and tissue expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and NF kappa B (p65). The protective effect of artesunate was found to be comparable to that of famotidine. Conclusively, artesunate afforded significant gastroprotection in rat due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties with transcription factor NF kappa B(p65) and its downstream inflammatory cascade as a plausible target for its action.

AB  - Elucidation of molecular mechanisms of receptor-ligand biology during host-parasite interaction helps in developing therapeutic targets. Several Pv-fam-a family proteins of Plasmodium vivax bind to host erythrocytes but their erythrocyte receptors remains to be explored. Here, we show that three merozoite proteins (PvTRAg36, PvATRAg74, and PvTRAg38) of this family interact with Band 3 on human erythrocytes through its three exofacial loops (loop 1, loop 3, and loop 6). These parasite proteins also interfered with the parasite growth in in-vitro, and the inhibition rate seems to be associated with their binding affinity to Band 3. This redundancy in receptor-ligand interaction could be one of the probable mechanism parasite utilizes to invade the host erythrocyte more efficiently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer is one of the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide and increasing rapidly in developing countries. In the present study, we investigated the potential role and association of HSP70-2 with breast cancer.
   Methods: HSP70-2 expression was examined in 154 tumor and 103 adjacent non-cancerous tissue (ANCT) specimens and breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT-474, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231) by RT-PCR, quantitative-PCR, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, flow cytometry and indirect immunofluorescence. Plasmid driven short hairpin RNA approach was employed to validate the role of HSP70-2 in cellular proliferation, senescence, migration, invasion and tumor growth. Further, we studied the effect of HSP70-2 protein ablation on signaling cascades involved in apoptosis, cell cycle and Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition both in culture as well as in-vivo human breast xenograft mouse model.
   Results: HSP70-2 expression was detected in majority of breast cancer patients (83 %) irrespective of various histotypes, stages and grades. HSP70-2 expression was also observed in all breast cancer cells (BT-474, MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3) used in this study. Depletion of HSP70-2 in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells resulted in a significant reduction in cellular growth, motility, onset of apoptosis, senescence, cell cycle arrest as well as reduction of tumor growth in the xenograft model. At molecular level, down-regulation of HSP70-2 resulted in reduced expression of cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases, anti-apoptotic molecules and mesenchymal markers and enhanced expression of CDK inhibitors, caspases, pro-apoptotic molecules and epithelial markers.
   Conclusions: HSP70-2 is over expressed in breast cancer patients and was involved in malignant properties of breast cancer. This suggests HSP70-2 may be potential candidate molecule for development of better breast cancer treatment.

AB  - Rapid detection and enumeration of pathogens is essential for monitoring contamination and spoilage of food products to ensure improved quality control management. Functionalized polymeric magnetic nanoconstructs (FPMNCs) were developed as an effective immunomagnetic separator and sensing platform for the selective capturing of Salmonella typhimurium. Novel FPMNCs were prepared in three stages involving synthesis of iron oxide (IO) dispersion, capping with sodium oleate and encapsulation of preformed IO nanoparticles by in-situ free radical emulsion polymerization of styrene (St), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and acetoacetoxy ethylmethacrylate (AAEM). PMMA improves the stability of FPMNCs by bridging extremely hydrophobic PS and hydrophilic PAAEM. Core-shell morphology of hydrophobic core of IO, PS & PMMA and hydrophilic shell of PAAEM was demonstrated by SEM, TEM and FTIR studies. FPMNCs with surface functionalized acetoacetoxy groups were covalently attached with polyclonal antibodies against Salmonella common structural antigen (CSA-1-Ab) without using any linker and catalyst. Colorimetric readout signal was acquired using CSA-1-Ab-HRP as secondary antibody after formation of sandwich immunocomplex with bacteria where the optical density of the samples were recorded using ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. The developed immunoassay was specific and selective which captures only targeted S. typhimurium with a detection limit of 10 cells/mL lower than infectious dose of salmonellosis infection. Minimal interference of food matrix with high signal to noise ratio was shown by various food samples. In addition, the performance of developed FPMNC based immunoassay was superior to commercially available immunomagnetic microbeads demonstrating undisputed advantage for capturing and detecting specific bacteria without any pre-enrichment of sample.

AB  - Background: Discovery of sessile mode of microbial existence (Biofilm state) focussed much interest, during the recent years, on the study of biofilms in many recurring and chronic infections. However, the exact role of microbial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis and orbital cellulitis were not elucidated earlier. The purpose of the present study was to look for the adherent property and biofilm producing ability of the clinical isolates in chronic rhinosinusitis and orbital cellulitis, and to look for the effects of antimicrobial agents on these biofilms by colorimetric assay and ultrastructural analysis.
   Methods: Organisms were isolated and identified from various clinical samples in patients with chronic sinusitis and orbital cellulitis. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was carried out by the standard protocol. Biofilms were developed; quantified and antimicrobial drug perfusion through the biofilm model was evaluated by the earlier devised procedure. Electronmicroscopic study of the biofilm was performed by the recommended technique.
   Results: Of the total of 70 clinical samples processed, 48 i.e. 68.5 % grew bacteria and 13 i.e.(18.6 %) fungi. Staphylococcus aureus (20), S epidermidis (16) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6) accounted for the majority of the bacterial isolates. Aspergillus flavus (8), however was the commonest amongst the fungi. A total of 40 bacteria and 8 fungi could be tested for biofilm production. Eighteen (45 %) of the 40 bacterial isolates and 4(50 %) out of the 8 A flavus isolates were found to be biofilm producers. In vitro adherence testing revealed that majority i.e. 16 (88.8 %) of the 18 biofilm positive bacteria were adherent to artificial surfaces. Antimicrobial drug perfusion through the biofilm model was poor. Antimicrobial treatment was totally ineffective against strong biofilm producers, whose electron microscopic picture was quite similar to that observed for biofilm producers without any antimicrobial pre-treatment.
   Conclusions: Filamentous fungi, like bacteria were capable of forming biofilms, which could be one of the important virulence factors in determining the pathogenic potential of these organisms in causing chronic rhinosinusitis and orbital cellulitis.

AB  - Background: Achievement of diabetes care goals is suboptimal globally. Diabetes-focused quality improvement (QI) is effective but remains untested in South Asia.
   Objective: To compare the effect of a multicomponent QI strategy versus usual care on cardiometabolic profiles in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.
   Design: Parallel, open-label, pragmatic randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01212328)
   Setting: Diabetes clinics in India and Pakistan.
   Patients: 1146 patients (575 in the intervention group and 571 in the usual care group) with type 2 diabetes and poor cardiometabolic profiles (glycated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)] level >= 8% plus systolic blood pressure [BP] >= 140 mm Hg and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDLc] level >= 130 mg/dL).
   Intervention: Multicomponent QI strategy comprising nonphysician care coordinators and decision-support electronic health records.
   Measurements: Proportions achieving HbA(1c) level less than 7% plus BP less than 130/80 mm Hg and/or LDLc level less than 100 mg/dL (primary outcome); mean risk factor reductions, healthrelated quality of life (HRQL), and treatment satisfaction (secondary outcomes).
   Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Median diabetes duration was 7.0 years; 6.8% and 39.4% of participants had preexisting cardiovascular and microvascular disease, respectively; mean HbA(1c) level was 9.9%; mean BP was 143.3/81.7mmHg; and mean LDLc level was 122.4 mg/dL. Over a median of 28 months, a greater percentage of intervention participants achieved the primary outcome (18.2% vs. 8.1%; relative risk, 2.24 [95% CI, 1.71 to 2.92]). Compared with usual care, intervention participants achieved larger reductions in HbA(1c) level (-0.50% [CI, -0.69% to -0.32%]), systolic BP (-4.04 mm Hg [CI, -5.85 to -2.22 mm Hg]), diastolic BP (-2.03 mm Hg [CI, -3.00 to -1.05 mm Hg]), and LDLc level (-7.86 mg/dL [CI, -10.90 to -4.81 mg/dL]) and reported higher HRQL and treatment satisfaction.
   Limitation: Findings were confined to urban specialist diabetes clinics.
   Conclusion: Multicomponent QI improves achievement of diabetes care goals, even in resource-challenged clinics.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID)/Global developmental delay (GDD) is a diverse group of disorders in terms of cognitive and non-cognitive functions and can occur with or without associated co-morbidities. It affects 1-3% of individuals globally and in at least 30-50% of cases the etiology remains unexplained. The widespread use of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in a clinical setting has allowed the identification of submicroscopic copy number variations (CNVs), throughout the genome, associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes including ID/GDD. In this study we investigated the utility of CMA in the detection of CNVs in 106 patients with unexplained ID/DD, dysmorphism with or without multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). CMA study was carried out using Agilent 8 x 60 K chips and Illumina Human CytoSNP-12 chips. Pathogenic CNVs were found in 15 (14.2%) patients. In these patients, CNVs on single chromosome were detected in 10 patients while 5 patients showed co-occurrence CNVs on two chromosomes. The size of these CNVs ranged between 322 kb to 13 Mb. The yield of pathogenic CNVs was similar for both mild and severe ID/GDD cases. One patient described in this paper is considered to harbour a likely pathogenic CNV with deletion in 17q22 region. Only few cases have been described in literature for 17q22 deletion and patient reported here was found to have an atypical deletion in 17q22 region (Case 90).
   This study re-affirms the view point that CMA is a powerful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of idiopathic ID/GDD patients irrespective of the degree of severity. Identifying pathogenic CNVs helps in counseling and prenatal diagnosis if desired. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enteric fever is an invasive infection predominantly caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A. The pathogens have evolved from other nontyphoidal salmonellaeto become invasive and host restricted. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in typhoidal salmonellae in some countries is a major therapeutic concern as the travelers returning from endemic countries carry resistant strains to non endemic areas. In order to understand the epidemiology and to design disease control strategies molecular typing of the pathogen is very important. We performed Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) of 251 S. Typhi and 18 S. Paratyphi strains isolated from enteric fever patients from seven centers across India during 2010-2013 to determine the population structure and prevalence of MLST sequence types in India. MLST analysis revealed the presence of five sequence types (STs) of typhoidal salmonellae in India namely ST1, ST2 and ST3 for S. Typhi and ST85 and ST129 for S. Paratyphi A. S. Typhi strains showed monophyletic lineage and clustered in to 3 Sequence Types-ST1, ST2 and ST3 and S. Paratyphi A isolates segregated in two sequence types ST85 and ST129 respectively. No association was found between antimicrobial susceptibility and sequence types. This study found ST1 as the most prevalent sequence type of S. Typhi in India followed by ST2, which is in concordance with previous studies and MLST database. In addition a rare sequence type ST3 has been found which is reported for the first time from the Indian subcontinent. Amongst S. Paratyphi A, the most common sequence type is ST129 as also reported from other parts of world. This distribution and prevalence suggest the common spread of the sequence types across the globe and these findings can help in understanding the disease distribution.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) prevents major cardiovascular events is uncertain.
   METHODS
   After a 1-week run-in period during which the participants used sham CPAP, we randomly assigned 2717 eligible adults between 45 and 75 years of age who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary or cerebrovascular disease to receive CPAP treatment plus usual care ( CPAP group) or usual care alone ( usual-care group). The primary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient ischemic attack. Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, health-related quality of life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood.
   RESULTS
   Most of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and minimal sleepiness. In the CPAP group, the mean duration of adherence to CPAP therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea-hypopnea index ( the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour at baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group ( 17.0%) and in 207 participants in the usual-care group ( 15.4%) ( hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P = 0.34). No significant effect on any individual or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Therapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and established cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Background: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is one of most common genitourinary malignancy and the spectrum of disease ranges from in situ lesions to muscle-invasive cancers. The non muscle-invasive lesions have tendency to recur or progress to muscle-invasive disease. The study of the immune profile may identify immune determinants associated with high-grade, recurrence, and invasion in patients with UC.
   Methods: Pathway-focused RT2 profiler arrays were used to screen patients with UC for dysregulation of candidate genes of Th1-Th2-Th3 and NF kappa B pathways, which were then validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction on tumor samples and correlated with grade, recurrence, and invasion of tumors to identify their role in predicting behavior of the tumor. The cytokines found associated with recurrence were then validated in urine of patients with UC.
   Results: IFN gamma, IL2, IL4, IL10, IL17, CCL7, CTLA4, and SPP1 of the cytokine pathway and TLR4, TLR3, RELA, NF kappa B1, and MYD88 of the NF kappa B pathway were found differentially expressed in patients with urothelial cancer by array and quantative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among these, IL10 and SPP1 were found consistently up-regulated in high-grade, invasive, and recurrent cases and up regulated IL10 and CTLA4 were found associated with a short recurrence-free survival time (P = 0.001 and P = 0.065). Urinary IL10 concentration was significantly higher in both patients with cancer and cystitis compared with healthy controls, but the difference in concentration between patients with cancer and cystitis patients was not statistically significant. However, urinary CTLA4 concentrations were found to be significantly higher in urothelial cancer patients compared with healthy controls and cystitis cases and found to be associated with poor recurrence-free survival.
   Conclusion: The study indicates that high urinary CTLA4 concentration raises the index of suspicion of recurrence in a known case of urothelial cancer and may be used as a surveillance marker. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of dual energy computed tomography (DECT) for diagnosing gout compared with a composite gold standard (CGS) comprising joint aspiration and/or American College of Rheumatology clinico-radiographic criteria.
   Methods: Ninety patients of suspected gout underwent radiography and DECT of bilateral feet and knees. Radiographs and non-contrast CT (NCCT) were assessed for morphological characteristics, following which DECT was used to identify urate deposits.
   Results: With CGS as a reference (n = 90), sensitivity of radiographs was 15% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6-27%) while specificity was 100% (95% CI: 90-100%). Sensitivity of NCCT was 26% (95% CI: 15-40%) while specificity was 97% (95% CI: 85-99%). Sensitivity of DECT was 82% (95% CI: 68-90%) while specificity was 89% (95% CI: 73-96%). Fifty-five patients underwent joint aspiration. Sensitivity and specificity of radiographs and NCCT with aspiration as a reference (n = 55) were not much different from that of CGS. However, DECT showed a higher sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86-100%) and a lower specificity of 48% (95% CI: 28-68%) with aspiration alone.
   Conclusions: Dual energy computed tomography had higher sensitivity compared to conventional imaging with CGS as a reference; however, its specificity dropped with aspiration as a reference. It may be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of gout, especially in the acute and inter-critical stage.

AB  - Plasmodium tryptophan rich proteins play important role in host parasite interaction. Earlier, we have described that one of the merozoite expressed Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg35.2 binds to the host erythrocytes, have conserved sequences in parasite population, and generates humoral as well as cellular immune responses in humans during this parasitic infection. Here, we show that PvTRAg35.2 interferes with the parasite growth in a heterologous Plasmodium falciparum culture system. This probably suggests the recognition of the common erythrocyte receptor(s) by certain merozoite ligands of these two parasite species. We have mapped the erythrocyte binding activity of PvTRAg35.2 to its two different regions positioned at amino acid residues 155-190 and 263-283. Binding of these peptide domains to the erythrocytes was inhibited by anti-PvTRAg35.2 antibodies either raised in rabbit or produced by the P. vivax patients. The cross-competition between peptides of PvTRAg35.2 and PvTRAg33.5 or PvTRAg38 during erythrocyte binding assay suggested sharing of host cell receptors by these PvTRAgs. Further studies on these receptor ligand interactions may lead to the development of therapeutic agents for P. vivax malaria. (C) 2016 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Circulating megakaryocytic cells abound in chronicmyeloid leukemia (CML) seen in India and uniquely provide a setting for observing megakaryocytic maturation in the peripheral blood, a milieu not native to megakaryocytes. Peripheral blood megakaryocytic cells were studied in 324 cases of CML (235 chronic, 65 accelerated and 24 blastic phases). Two maturation themes were evident. Megakaryocytic blasts, especially in some cases of blast crisis, precociously make a foray into platelet formation and end up producing huge agranular or poorly granular cytoplasmic lobulated masses, that break off and come to lie in the circulation. This evidence of unsuccessful effort may exist, in a considerably attenuated form in chronic phase, alongside of the second major theme of megakaryocytic maturation centered around the familiar micromegakaryocyte, characteristic of the chronic phase. This cell is regarded as dysplastic, but produces morphologically normal platelets. The possibility that this occurs via a hitherto unstudied alternative path of platelet maturation that plays out in the peripheral blood, and the contrasting disorderly premature attempt of blasts to form platelets, represent exciting maturation processes that need further study. Our observations fortuitously constitute a revisit of the insightful exposition on the subject by George Minot nearly a century ago. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery can be moderate to severe, interfering with return to normal activity. The study aimed to assess the efficacy of bilateral ultrasound-guided (USG) transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for relieving acute pain after laparoscopic hernia repair as T10-L1 nerve endings are anesthetized with this block.
   Methods: Seventy-one American Society of Anesthesiologists I to II patients, aged 18 to 65 years, undergoing unilateral/bilateral laparoscopic hernia repair were randomized to port site infiltration (control, 36) and TAP block groups (35). All patients received general anesthesia (fentanyl 2 mu g/kg intravenously at induction, 0.5 mu g/kg on 20% increase in heart rate or mean blood pressure) and paracetamol 6 hourly. Postintubation, TAP group received bilateral USG TAP block (15-20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine, maximum 3 mg/kg) with 18-G Tuohy needle. Control group had 20 to 30 mL 0.5% ropivacaine infiltrated preincision, at port sites from skin to peritoneum. Postoperative patient-controlled analgesia fentanyl was provided for 6 hours; pain was assessed using 0 to 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours and telephonically at 1 week and 3 months.
   Results: Demographic profile of the 2 groups was comparable. Significantly more number of patients required intraoperative fentanyl in the control group (24/36) than in the TAP group (13/35); VAS at rest was lower in TAP than control patients in postanesthesia care unit at 0, 2, 6, and 24 hours (median VAS TAP group: 0, 0, 0, and 0; control: 10, 20,10, and 10; P=.002, P=.001, P=.001, and P=.006, respectively); P<.01 was considered statistically significant. TAP group had significantly lower VAS on deep breathing at 6 hours and on knee bending and walking at 24 hours and lesser patient-controlled analgesia fentanyl requirement. No significant difference in pain scores was observed at 1 week and 3 months.
   Conclusion: TAP block reduced postoperative pain up to 24 hours after laparoscopic hernia repair. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Pregnancy with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered to be high risk. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of pregnancy on CKD and the fetomaternal outcome in these patients.
   Study design: A retrospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of medical sciences, New Delhi over a period of 11 years. A total number of 80 pregnant patients with CKD were reviewed. Staging of CKD was done according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Maternal demographic profile, stage of CKD, biochemical profile, antenatal and neonatal records were analyzed. The course of pregnancy was then reviewed and note was made of any maternal or fetal complication. At the time of analysis, patients were divided into early (Stage 1, 2) and late stage (Stage 3-5) disease. All the variables were compared between two groups. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS software version 20.0.
   Results: There was significantly increased incidence of preeclampsia (p = 0.001) and moderate to severe anemia (p = 0.001) in late stage disease as compared to early stage. The renal parameters including mean GFR and serum creatinine deteriorated with pregnancy in both the groups. Among fetal complications, the patients in late stage had significantly increased incidence of small for gestational age, low 5 min Apgar score and increased NICU admissions. The overall preterm delivery rate was 57.5%. There was an overall increase in the incidence of caesarean section (CS) rate (64%).
   Conclusions: Despite advances in antenatal care, incidence of adverse events in mother and fetus remain high in these women of CKD as compared to the rates expected in the general population. In all patients of CKD planning for pregnancy, the pre-existing disease should be optimized before conception. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Cardiac arrest is associated with very high mortality and causes neurological dysfunction in the survivors. Therapeutic hypothermia is one of the recommended modality in the postarrest management. However, recent findings question its benefit in postarrest management. This meta-analysis has been conceptualized to quantify clinical benefit of therapeutic hypothermia in post cardiac arrest patients.
   Methods: Prospective, randomized, and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia in post cardiac arrest adult population with a post cardiac arrest management protocol that does not include therapeutic hypothermia were included in this meta-analysis. Two authors independently searched PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, and Central Register of Clinical Trials of the Cochrane Collaboration for potentially eligible trials.
   Results: Data of 1399 patients from 6 controlled trials have been included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Therapeutic hypothermia does not provide any benefit in favorable neurological outcome (P =.06; odds ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-3.35; n = 1384), in survival at hospital discharge (P =.58; odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.69-1.96; n = 1399), and in long-term survival (P =.36; odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.73-2.39; n = 1292). Therapeutic hypothermia also increases incidence of pneumonia (P =.02; odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.64; n = 1204; number needed to harm, 15).
   Conclusion: Therapeutic hypothermia in the post cardiac arrest management protocol does not provide any benefit in favorable neurological outcome, survival to hospital discharge, and long term survival. Incidence of pneumonia may be increased with the use of therapeutic hypothermia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Both chronological aging and chronic hypoxia stress have been reported to cause degeneration of hippocampal CA3 neurons and spatial memory impairment through independent pathways. However, the possible occurrence of precocious biological aging on exposure to single episode of global hypoxia resulting in impairment of learning and memory remains to be established. The present study thus aimed at bridging this gap in existing literature on hypoxia induced biological aging. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to simulated hypobaric hypoxia (25,000 ft) for different durations and were compared with aged rats. Behavioral studies in Morris Water Maze showed decline in learning abilities of both chronologically aged as well as hypoxic rats as evident from increased latency and pathlength to reach target platform. These behavioral changes in rats exposed to global hypoxia were associated with deposition of lipofuscin and ultrastructural changes in the mitochondria of hippocampal neurons that serve as hallmarks of aging. A single episode of chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposure also resulted in the up-regulation of pro-aging protein, S100A9 and down regulation of Tau, SNAP25, APOE and Sod2 in the hippocampus similar to that in aged rats indicating hypoxia induced accelerated aging. The present study therefore provides evidence for role of biological aging of hippocampal neurons in hypoxia induced impairment of learning and memory. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Resection of large Vestibular Schwannomas (VSs) can be associated with postoperative facial nerve injury. Diffusion-based tractography has emerged as a powerful tool for three-dimensional imaging and reconstruction of white matter fibers; however, tractography of the cranial nerves has not been well studied. In this prospective study, we aim to predict the position of facial nerve in large VSs (3 cm) using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography and correlate it with the intraoperative finding of the position of facial nerve. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with a large VS (3 cm) undergoing surgery were subjected to preoperative DTI to predict the position of the facial nerve in relation to the tumor. The surgeon was blinded to the results of the preoperative DTI tractography. A comparative analysis was then made during operation. The location of the facial nerve in relation to the tumor was recorded during surgery using facial nerve stimulator. Results: Of the 20 patients who underwent DTI tractography, it was not possible to preoperatively identify facial nerve in one patient. In another patient, although DTI tractography predicted the position of facial nerve, it was not identified intraoperatively. In the remaining 18 patients, DTI tractography accurately predicted the facial nerve position. The predicted position was in synchronization with the intraoperative facial nerve position in 16 patients (89% concordance). It was discordant in two patients (11%), but this was not found to be statistically significant (P = 0.3679). Conclusion: This study validates the reliability of facial nerve DTI-based fiber tracking for prediction of the facial nerve position in patients with large VSs. The reliable preoperative visualization of facial nerve location in relation to the VS will allow surgeons to plan tumor removal accordingly and may increase the safety of surgery.

KW  - SURVIVAL
AB  - Purpose: To compare the efficacy of 2 chemotherapeutic drug combinations as part of multimodal therapy for orbital retinoblastoma.
   Design: Prospective, comparative, study.
   Participants: Patients with stage III retinoblastoma (International Retinoblastoma Staging System).
   Methods: Demographic and clinical features were recorded at presentation. Treatment consisted of a multimodal protocol with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, enucleation, orbital external-beam radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. For chemotherapy, patients were randomized into 2 groups: group A patients were treated with vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin (VEC) and group B patients were treated with carboplatin and etoposide, alternating with cyclophosphamide, idarubicin, and vincristine. Treatment outcomes and adverse effects were recorded. Efficacy parameters were compared between the groups.
   Main Outcome Measures: Survival probability, cause of death, and chemotherapy-related toxicity.
   Results: A total of 54 children were recruited (27 in each group). The mean +/- SD follow-up was 21.3 +/- 11.34 months. The overall Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.89) and 42% (95% CI, 0.24-0.59) at 1 year and 4 years, respectively. There were 9 deaths in group A and 15 deaths in group B. The Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 1 year was similar between the groups: 81% (95% CI, 0.60-0.91) and 79% (95% CI, 0.58-0.9) for groups A and B, respectively. At 4 years, the survival probability for group A was higher (63% [ 95% CI, 0.41-0.79] vs. 25% [ 95% CI, 0.08-0.46] for groups A and B, respectively), with a strong trend of better survival in group A over time (P = 0.05). The major cause of death was central nervous system relapse (8 patients in group A and 7 patients in group B). Two patients in group B died of sepsis after febrile neutropenia. Grade 3 and grade 4 hematologic toxicities were more common in group B, with a significant difference in grade 4 neutropenia (P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: This study compared the outcomes of VEC chemotherapy with a 5-drug combination of vincristine and carboplatin, alternating with cyclophosphamide, idarubicin, and vincristine, for stage III retinoblastoma. The VEC combination was found to bemore effective and may be recommended as neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. (C) 2016 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

AB  - Filarial thioredoxin and transglutaminase are enzymes that are secreted throughout the lifecycle of the parasites which are mandatory for the survival of the parasite. They are reported to be promising vaccine candidates, yet the limitation factors of these proteins to be developed as vaccines is their homology they share with the host proteins. Hence immunodonninant epitopes from these proteins were constructed as peptides and immunised in mice model with Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) as adjuvant. Immunodominant epitopic portions from Filarial thioredoxin and transglutaminase which are non-homologous with host proteins were constructed as Multi Antigen Peptide (MAP) and assembled in an inert lysine core. The synthesised MAP was immunised with MDP as adjuvant in Balb/c mice model, humoral and cellular immune response were studied. Antibody titre levels for TT MAP with MDP was in par with alum as adjuvant in mice models. T cell responses of TT MAP with MDP showed a balanced T(H)1/T(H)2 response. The T(H)1 cytokines namely IL-2 and IFN-gamma were also higher in TT MAP immunised groups with MDP as adjuvant whereas alum immunised groups was T(H)2 biased. TT MAP admixed with MDP as adjuvant proves to be safe in mice model. Further vaccination studies are underway in permissive animal models to determine the role of TT MAP with MDP as adjuvant in protective immunity against W bancrofti and B. malayi infections.

AB  - Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and yield of semiological features from home videos and compare them to those inferred from history provided by the caregiver of a person with epilepsy (PWE). A comparison of the accuracy of classification of epilepsy based on home videos and medical history was also done.
   Methods: We enrolled PWEs who were awaiting admission for video electroencephalography (VEEG) to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) in this prospective observational study. In phase I of the study, we encouraged caregivers to make home videos which were analyzed. A structured questionnaire dealing with 29 different semiological features was completed based on the information gathered from home videos. In phase II of the study, the questionnaire was administered to the patient's caregivers. In phase III the patients underwent VEEG recording, and the semiology from VEEG was analyzed to complete the same questionnaire. We also classified epilepsy type using home videos and medical history and compared it to that using VEEG finding. The information gathered from VEEG was considered the gold standard. Accuracy was calculated for the different semiological signs comparing medical history to VEEG findings.
   Results: A total of 340 PWE fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and their caregivers completed the questionnaire. Home videos were collected from 312 patients and 624 seizures were analyzed. The mean number of signs of semiology recorded after analysis of home videos was 3.3 +/- 2.2, and from the medical history was 2.1 +/- 1.1 (P < 0.01). A total of 572 seizures in 282 patients admitted in the EMU were evaluated on VEEG. Bilateral generalized clonic movements of limbs, motor movement around mouth, fear, visual phenomenon, hemisensory phenomenon, and post-ictal unilateral weakness had the highest accuracy. The overall agreement of semiological signs inferred from medical history versus VEEG was 0.75 and between home video recordings versus VEEG was 0.92. A larger number of patients were correctly categorized into the focal epilepsy group when home videos were used to classify compared to when medical history was used.
   Conclusions: Home videos are more reliable in picking up semiological signs and classifying epilepsy type than history provided by caregivers of PWEs. Home videos are a complementary tool in a developing country like India. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS), an important cause of acute kidney injury, is characterized by dysregulation of the complement pathway, frequent need for dialysis, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Autoantibodies against complement factor H (FH), the main plasma regulatory protein of the alternative pathway of the complement system, account for a considerable proportion of children with aHUS. The autoantibodies are usually associated with the occurrence of a homozygous deletion in the genes encoding the FH-related proteins FHR1 and FHR3. High levels of autoantibodies, noted at the onset of disease and during relapses, induce functional deficiency of FH, whereas their decline, in response to plasma exchanges and/or immunosuppressive therapy, is associated with disease remission. Management with plasma exchange and immunosuppression is remarkably effective in inducing and maintaining remission in aHUS associated with FH autoantibodies, whereas terminal complement blockade with eculizumab is considered the most effective therapy in other forms of aHUS. Anti-FH autoantibodies are also detected in a small proportion of patients with C3 glomerulopathies, which are characterized by chronic glomerular injury mediated by activation of the alternative complement pathway and predominant C3 deposits on renal histology.

AB  - The most common causes of renal mass with malignant venous thrombosis are Wilms' tumor and renal cell carcinoma. Although renal involvement may occur in disseminated lymphomas, primary renal Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is rare. Vascular tropism is not a usual feature of lymphoma; thus, primary renal BL with venous extension is distinctly unusual. However, it is important to diagnose this entity because such patients respond well to medical management and may not require surgery. We report a pediatric case of primary renal BL with malignant vascular thrombus and systemic dissemination where biopsy was diagnostic and enabled appropriate treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Azathioprine (AZA) is commonly used in myasthenia gravis (MG). Treatment may be prolonged, entailing significant risks and avoidable costs. Methods: We reviewed remission, relapse, and side-effect profiles in MG patients on AZA during treatment and after tapering off. We conducted an ambispective study and analyzed remission, relapse rates, and side-effect profiles in 117MG patients on AZA. Results: Thirty-nine patients (33.3%) achieved remission, and 36 (30.8%) achieved complete stable remission (CSR), with a 33% relapse rate. No AZA side effects were seen in 95 (81%) patients. Only duration of disease of >10 years (odds ratio 9.5, 95% confidence interval 2.4-36.9, P=0.001) was significantly associated with remission. Conclusions: AZA is well tolerated by MG patients, and about 30% go into CSR on long-term AZA. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve54: 405-412, 2016

AB  - Background and aims: Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in stroke survivors. Observational studies have reported an association of low vitamin D levels with greater stroke severity, poststroke mortality and functional disability. Randomised clinical trials are lacking. We sought to assess the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in ischaemic stroke survivors with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency on disability/mortality outcomes.
   Methods: In this randomised controlled open-label trial, 73 patients of acute ischaemic stroke were screened for serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. A total of 53 patients with baseline 25(OH)D <75 nmol/L were randomised into two arms. One received vitamin D and calcium supplementation along with usual care (n=25) and the other received usual care alone (n=28). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a good outcome [modified Rankin Scale score 0-2] at 6 months and all cause mortality at 6 months.
   Results: The age (mean +/- SD) of participants was 60.4 +/- 11.3 years, 69.8% were males. The proportion of patients achieving good outcome was higher in the intervention arm (Adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.6-6.4; P=.31). The survival probability was greater in the intervention arm (83.8%, CI 62.4-93.6) as compared with the control arm (59.5%, CI 38.8-75.2; P=.049) with adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.9; P=.03).
   Conclusions: This is the first randomised controlled study assessing the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on ischaemic stroke outcomes and points towards a potential benefit. Findings need to be validated by a larger trial.

TI  - H1N1 influenza presenting as severe acute pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Acute pancreatitis (AP) is caused by inflammation of the pancreas. Diagnosis requires 2 of the following 3 criteria: abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and imaging consistent with the diagnosis by using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging [1]. Etiology of AP includes gallstone, alcohol, drugs, hypertriglyceridemia, trauma, post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, hypercalcemia, hereditary pancreatitis, and vascular. Viral illnesses cause pancreatitis in less than 1% of cases, mainly by mumps, HIV, Coxsackie, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and others [2]. Few case reports are there in the literature where mild AP was the initial clinical presentation of H1N1 virus infection [3,4]. Severe AP with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI) with hyperglycemia, like in our case, is the first of its kind in the medical literature.

AB  - Objectives: Cardiometabolic diseases are increasing disproportionately in South Asia compared with other regions of the world despite high levels of vegetarianism. This unexpected discordance may be explained by differences in the healthfulness of vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets in South Asia compared with the United States. The aim of this study was to compare the food group intake of vegetarians with non-vegetarians in South Asia and the United States and to evaluate associations between vegetarianism and cardiometabolic disease risk factors (overweight/obesity, central obesity, diabetes, hypertension, high triacylglycerols, high low-density lipoprotein, low high-density lipoprotein, and high Framingham Heart Score).
   Methods: Using cross-sectional data from adults (age 20-69 y) in South Asia (Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South-Asia [CARRS] 2010-2011; N = 15 665) and the United States (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006; N = 2159), adherence to a vegetarian diet was assessed using food propensity questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and predicted margins (e.g., adjusted prevalence of the outcomes).
   Results: One-third (33%; n = 4968) of adults in the South Asian sample were vegetarian compared with only 2.4% (n = 59) in the US sample. Among South Asians, vegetarians more frequently ate dairy, legumes, vegetables, fruit, desserts, and fried foods than non-vegitarians (all P < 0.05). Among Americans, vegetarians more frequently ate legumes, fruit, and whole grains, and less frequently ate refined cereals, desserts, fried foods, fruit juice, and soft drinks than non-vegetarians (all P < 0.05). After adjustment for confounders (age, sex, education, tobacco, alcohol, and also city in CARRS), South Asian vegetarians were slightly less frequently overweight/obese compared with non-vegetarians: 49% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45%-53%) versus 53% (95% CI, 51%-56%), respectively; whereas US vegetarians were considerably less frequently overweight/obese compared with non-vegetarians: 48% (95% CI, 32%-63%) versus 68% (95% CI, 65%-70%), respectively. Furthermore, US vegetarians were less likely to exhibit central obesity than non-vegetarians: 62% (95% CI, 43%-78%) versus 78% (95% CI, 76%-80%), respectively.
   Conclusions: There is greater divergence between vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets in the United States than in South Asia, and US vegetarians have more consistently healthier food group intakes than South Asian vegetarians. Vegetarians in both populations have a lower probability of overweight/obesity compared with non-vegetarians. The strength of this association may be stronger for US vegetarian diets, which were also protective against central obesity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resistance to drugs, which is aggravated by hypoxia, is a well-known feature of tumors. The combination of drug exposure and hypoxia can give rise to several survival strategies in the exposed cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most hypoxic of solid tumors, and we have used glial cells to identify a drug combination that would be synergistically effective in these cells under both normoxia and hypoxia. Cisplatin (CP) and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), which have been used for second-line therapy and for preclinical research, are relatively ineffective as single agents. During in vitro experiments with A172 and LN229 cells, there was increased resistance to both drugs under hypoxia. However, the combination of CP and 2-DG showed a synergistic effect in reducing cell viability under both normoxia and hypoxia, with a combination index of less than 1. Increased autophagy is a distinct feature of the response to 2-DG. However, autophagic markers were reduced, and apoptotic markers were upregulated by the combination, indicating a switch over from autophagic to apoptotic pathways with reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combination also resulted in a decrease of pAKT levels. The effect of CP in the combination was replicated by the prototype AKT inhibitor LY294002, further supporting the role of AKT inhibition in the synergism. Combination of 2-DG with CP, or possibly an AKT inhibitor, can prove to be an effective rational combination for reducing chemoresistance under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in gliomas.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a radiation-free imaging modality with excellent contrast resolution and multiplanar capabilities. Since ionizing radiation is an important concern in the pediatric population, MRI serves as a useful alternative to computed tomography (CT) and also provides additional clues to diagnosis, not discernible on other investigations. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), urography, angiography, enterography, dynamic multiphasic imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging provide wealth of information. The main limitations include, long scan time, need for sedation/anesthesia, cost and lack of widespread availability. With the emergence of newer sequences and variety of contrast agents, MRI has become a robust modality and may serve as a one-stop shop for both anatomical and functional information.

AB  - Weight loss is a well known systemic manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A Gly80Ser mutation on human group IID secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA(2)) enhances expression of the cytokines that are responsible for weight loss. In this study, we seek to establish a structural correlation of wild type sPLA2 and the Gly80Ser mutation with function. sPLA2 with glycine and serine at the 80th positions and the M-type receptor were modelled. The enzymes were docked to the receptor and molecular dynamics was carried out to 70 ns. Structural analysis revealed the enzymes to comprise three helices (H1-H3), two short helices (SH1 and SH2), and five loops including a calcium binding loop (L1-L5), and to be stabilized by seven disulfide bonds. The overall backbone folds of the two models are very similar, with main chainRMSD of less than 1 angstrom. The active site within the substrate binding channel shows a catalytic triad of water His67-Asp112, showing a hydrogen bonded network. Major structural differences between wild type and mutant enzymes were observed locally at the site of the mutation and in their global conformations. These differences include: (1) loop-L3 between H2 and H3, which bears residue Gly80 in the wild type, is in a closed conformation with respect to the channel opening, while in the mutant enzyme it adopts a relatively open conformation; (2) the mutant enzyme is less compact and has higher solvent accessible surface area; and (3) interfacial binding contact surface area is greater, and the quality of interactions with the receptor is better in the mutant enzyme as compared to the wild type. Therefore, the structural differences delineated in this study are potential biophysical factors that could determine the increased potency of the mutant enzyme with macrophage receptor for cytokine secreting function, resulting in exacerbation of cachexia in COPD.

AB  - Cinnamon is one of the most widely used herbal medicines with diverse bioactive effects. However, there is no report in regard to the potential anti-proliferative effects of cinnamon on myeloma cells. In this study, the authors investigated the anti-proliferative potential of cinnamon bark powder extract (CBPE) on myeloma cells specifically focusing on its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. The authors observed inhibition of myeloma cell proliferation by CBPE along with anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects in a human myeloma cell line RPMI 8226. After 24 h of treatment, CBPE caused approximately 50% inhibition of cell growth in RPMI 8226 cells at a concentration of 72 mu g/mL (IC50), compared with the untreated controls. CBPE treatment strongly inhibited expression of angiogenic factors and cyclooxygenase at mRNA as well as at protein level in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with the CBPE resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase in a time-dependent manner. CBPE besides altering growth kinetics of cells, induces DNA fragmentation resulting in apoptosis. In the treated group, DNA fragmentation increased in a time dependent manner with maximum intensity of labeled nucleotides in cells treated for 72 h as compared to 24 h and 48 h. In conclusion, the anticancer effects of cinnamon extract appear to be mediated by multiple mechanisms. These include inhibition of angiogenesis, inflammation and induction of apoptosis in myeloma cells. CBPE could be considered as a promising candidate for restricting the growth of myeloma cells. Hence, CBPE could lead to the development of an effective anti-cancer agent or herbal medicine for the treatment of MM. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - In cervical cancer (CC), uorine18-uorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has been proven to be benecial for patient management. Positron emission tomography/CT is useful in pretreatment evaluation due to the ability to evaluate disease extent and to assess regional lymph nodes as well as distant sites for metastases. PET/CT has an impact on treatment planning as well as it is incorporated in radiation therapy planning, resulting in more appropriate and eective treatment with less cost and radiation dose to normal tissues. Positron emission tomography/CT is used to predict early treatment response and to assess treatment response after completion of concurrent chemoradiation therapy. PET/CT has been used for surveillance after treatment as well as for restaging in suspected recurrent or metastatic disease. Qualitative PET/CT imaging findings as well as quantitative parameters such as maximum stan-dardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) are useful to predict prognosis and clinical outcome. Moreover, PET imaging using other radiotracers to detect and quantify hypoxia may help to identify aggressive tumors and predict treatment outcome even though it is not widely clinical used. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) ins-truments are now available, which may potentially improve evaluation of primary tumors and metastatic sites given the improved soft tissue contrast resolution of MRI relative to CT. This article reviews the role of F-18-FDG PET/CT, hypoxia agent PET/CT, and F-18-FDG PET/MRI in the management of patients with CC.

AB  - Background: Previous epidemiological studies suggest an association between psoriasis and metabolic syndrome and risk of subclinical atherosclerosis. However, there is a paucity of data in the Indian population on these associations. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis compared to healthy controls and to correlate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome with severity of psoriasis. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was performed on 140 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and 140 controls. Psoriasis was categorized as mild, moderate and severe based on psoriasis area and severity index (<10, 10-14 and >= 15, respectively) and as disease of short (<1 year), intermediate (1-3 years) and long duration (>3 years). In all patients and controls, body mass index was calculated, blood pressure and waist circumference were measured and fasting blood sugar and lipid profile were estimated. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed by the presence of 3 or more of the modified National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. A subset of 30 psoriatic patients and 30 healthy controls were selected by the systematic sampling method for cardiac evaluation including electrocardiography, echocardiography and carotid intima-media thickness measurement. Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was significantly more in psoriatic patients than in controls (39.3% vs. 17.1%, odds ratio = 3.13). Psoriatic patients also had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, abdominal obesity and diabetes. There was a significant trend to increase in prevalence of metabolic syndrome, hypertension and type 2 diabetes with increased severity and longer duration of the psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis had significantly higher carotid intima-media thickness (mean 0.61 mm +/- 0.01 mm vs. 0.37 mm +/- 0.01 mm) than controls. Limitation: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study with a relatively small sample size. A prospective study with a larger sample would have validated the results further. Conclusion: There is a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in psoriasis patients as compared to controls; the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components increases with severity and duration of psoriasis. There is a higher prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with psoriasis thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. We suggest that patients with moderate to severe psoriasis be screened routinely for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease and encouraged to correct modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ventriculitis is a serious infection associated with high mortality even when both intravenous (IV) and intrathecal (IT) antibiotics are administered. Poor outcome in patients with ventriculitis indicates the need to be more aggressive in our attempts to expeditiously eradicate the infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of endoscopic lavage (EL) in patients with severe purulent ventriculitis, unresponsive to IV and IT antibiotics.
   METHODS: All consecutive patients with severe ventriculitis caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, undergoing EL after failure of prolonged courses of IV and IT antibiotics, were included in the study. The outcome in all these patients was otherwise expected to be uniformly dismal.
   RESULTS: There were 5 males and 2 females. The age range was one month to 45 years. All patients had frank intraventricular pus. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common organism grown in cultures. Two patients had multiple bacterial growth in cerebrospinal fluid cultures. The duration of pre-EL IV/IT antibiotics ranged from 3 to 8 weeks. Microbiological cure was achieved in all (7/7) and clinical cure in 86% of patients (6/7). One patient died despite achieving cerebrospinal fluid sterilization 3 months later as a result of progressive white matter edema.
   CONCLUSIONS: The addition of IT antibiotics has resulted in improved outcome in patients with ventriculitis; however, some patients continue to be unresponsive to antibiotics. EL can play a complementary role in eradicating such recalcitrant infections. EL should be considered in any patient with ventriculitis, if infection persists even after similar to 7-10 days of IV and IT antibiotics.

KW  - CELLS
AB  - Lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway has emerged to have a role in carcinogenesis. There is an evidence that both 12-LOX and 5-LOX have procarcinogenic role. We have previously reported the elevated level of serum 12-LOX in breast cancer patients. This study evaluated the serum level of 5-LOX in breast cancer patients and its in vitro inhibition assessment with peptide inhibitor YWCS. The level of 5-LOX was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The peptide inhibitor of 5-LOX was designed by molecular modeling and kinetic assay was performed by spectrophotometry. The siRNA mediated 5-LOX gene silencing was performed to investigate the effect on proliferation of MDA-MB-231, breast cancer cell line. The serum 5-LOX level in breast cancer (5.69 +/- 1.97ng/A mu l) was almost 2-fold elevated compared to control (3.53 +/- 1.0ng/A mu l) (P < 0.0001). The peptide YWCS had shown competitive inhibitory effects with IC50, 2.2 A mu M and dissociation constant (K (D)), 4.92x10(-8) M. The siRNA mediated knockdown of 5-LOX, resulted in the decreased gene expression for 5-LOX and increased cell death in MDA-MB-231 cell line and thereby play a key role in reducing tumor proliferation. Thus, it can be concluded that 5-LOX is one of the potential serum protein marker for breast cancer and a promising therapeutic target for the same.

AB  - Background: Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) are slow-growing benign intraventricular tumors, the pathogenesis of which is debated. Recent studies have shown that tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and TSC2 genes are linked to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell signaling pathway. We aimed to analyze TSC1 and TSC2 gene mutation, hamartin and tuberin protein expression, and protein expression of mTOR signaling cascade in a series of SEGA to determine their role in pathogenesis. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight SEGA cases were retrieved from archival material. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using antibodies against tuberin, hamartin, phospho-p70S6 kinase, S6 ribosomal protein, phospho-S6 ribosomal protein, phospho-4E-BP1, Stat3, and phospho-Stat3. Mutation analysis of TSC1 (exons 15 and 17) and TSC2 (exons 33, 39, and 40) was done by DNA sequencing. Results: Loss of immunoexpression of either hamartin or tuberin was found in 19 cases (68%). Pathogenic point mutations in selected exons of TSC1 and TSC2 genes were present in 5 of 20 cases studied. Robust expression of mTOR downstream signaling molecules phospho-p70S6 kinase (100%), S6 ribosomal protein (82%), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (64%), phospho-4E-BP1 (64%), and Stat3 (100%) was seen. Four cases (14%) showed immunopositivity for phospho-Stat3. There was no significant correlation of these markers with immunoloss of tuberin and hamartin. Significance: There is a definite role for TSC1 and TSC2 genes in the pathogenesis of SEGA as evidenced by loss of protein expression and presence of mutations. Strong expression of mTOR downstream signaling proteins indicates activation of mTOR pathway in these tumors, suggesting that proteins in this pathway may have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets in these patients.

AB  - Study Objective: i-gel is a single-use supraglottic airway device that has a gastric drain tube similar to laryngeal mask airway (LMA) ProSeal. Randomized trials, when compared i-gel with LMA ProSeal, reported a differing results. Primary objective of this study is to compare LMA ProSeal and i-gel in terms of oropharyngeal leak pressure.
   Design: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials where i-gel has been compared to LMA ProSeal in adult airway management during general anesthesia.
   Setting: Teaching institutions.
   Measurements: PubMed, PubMed Central, and Cochrane databases were searched with search words "i-gel," "i-gel laryngeal mask airway," "i-gel ProSeal," and "i-gel LMA ProSeal' to find out the randomized controlled trials that compared i-gel with LMA ProSeal in terms of safety and efficacy. A total of 10 prospective randomized trials have been included in this meta-analysis. Main
   Results: LMA ProSeal provides higher oropharyngeal leak pressure than i-gel (mean difference, 3.37 cm H2O; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-4.95 cm H2O; P<.0001). Time to insert the device, first insertion success rate, and ease of gastric tube insertion are similar with both the devices, but i-gel may be easier to insert. Although the reported complications are not frequent and not very serious, a significantly higher blood staining on the mask has been noted with LMA ProSeal (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.56; P=.0004).
   Conclusion: LMA ProSeal may still remain the supraglottic device of choice over i-gel in adult patients during general anesthesia as it provided better seal against leak pressure with comparable device insertion characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oral mucositis (OM) is a major limiting acute side effect of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. The spectrum of problems associated with mucositis includes oral pain, odynophagia, reduced oral intake, and secondary infections. Incidence of mucositis is increased with addition of concurrent chemotherapy as well as altered fractionation schedules. This leads to treatment interruption and suboptimal disease control. Hence, prevention as well as timely management of OM is necessary for optimum tumor control. We reviewed the English literature with key words "Radiation induced mucositis, Mucositis, Oral Mucositis" to find relevant articles describing incidence, pathophysiology, prophylaxis, and treatment of oral mucositis. Prevention and treatment of OM is an active area of research. Maintenance of oral hygiene is an important part in prevention of OM. A battery of agents including normal saline and alkali (soda bicarbonate) mouth washes, low level laser therapy, and benzydamine (non-steroidal analgesic and anti-inflammatory) have effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of radiation induced oral mucositis. Chlorhexidine mouth gargles are recommended for prevention of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis but is not recommended for radiotherapy associated mucositis. Treatment of co-existing infection is also important and both topical (povidone iodine) and systemic anti fungals should be used judiciously. Radiation induced oral mucositis is a common problem limiting the efficacy of radiation by increasing treatment breaks. Adequate prophylaxis and treatment may limit the severity of radiation mucositis and improve compliance to radiation which may translate in better disease control and survival.

AB  - Data on prognostic factors in patients with metastatic osteosarcoma treated with uniform chemotherapy protocol are lacking. The objective of this study was to analyze demographic data, treatment outcome and prognostic factors for patients with metastatic osteosarcoma at our center treated with a uniform chemotherapy protocol without high dose methotrexate.
   This is a single-institutional data review of patients treated between June 2003 and December 2012 with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, local site surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and metastasectomy at completion of adjuvant chemotherapy.
   102 patients of metastatic osteosarcoma were treated with a median age of 18 years (range 8-48 years), male to female ratio of 3.3:1 and median symptom duration of 4 months. EFS and OS at 5 years were 12.7 +/- A 0.1 and 28.1 +/- A 0.1 %, respectively. On multivariate analysis, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.001) and number of metastasis > 3 (p = 0.04) were predictive of lower EFS, whereas elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.01), number of metastasis > 3 (p = 0.05), and margin positivity (p < 0.001) were predictive of lower OS.
   This is the largest data on metastatic osteosarcoma treated with a uniform chemotherapy protocol without high dose methotrexate. The data showed prognostic factors similar to what have been observed previously such as elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and > 3 metastatic lesions in lung predicting inferior outcome. Notably our survival was comparable to data from other studies despite our practice of delaying metastasectomy to completion of chemotherapy rather than performing the same along with local site surgery.

AB  - The antidiabetic drug, metformin, in, can inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators in several disease conditions. The present study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of metformin in ameliorating edema formation, oxidative stress, mediator release and vascular changes associated with acute inflammation in the rat carrageenan model. Metformin dose-dependently inhibited paw swelling induced by carrageenan and normalized the tissue levels of the inflammatory markers myeloperoxidase and nitrite. It also maintained oxidative homeostasis as indicated by near normal levels of the oxidative stress markers glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, catalase and superoxide dismutase. The histopathology of the paw tissue in metformin-treated animals was similar to that in normal paw and had similar effects to diclofenac. In a rat peritonitis model, metformin reduced vascular permeability and cellular infiltration. In conclusion, this study shows that metformin has a potential for use in treating various inflammatory conditions. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) hydrolyses short malto-oligosaccharides from the reducing end releasing glucose and maltose in Escherichia coli. MalZ is a highly aggregation prone protein and molecular chaperonins GroEL and GroES assist in the folding of this protein to a substantial level. The N-terminal region of this enzyme appears to be a unique domain as seen in sequence comparison studies with other amylases as well as through homology modelling. The sequence and homology model analysis show a probability of disorder in the N-Terminal region of MaIZ. The crystal structure of this enzyme has been reported in the present communication. Based on the crystallographic structure, it has been interpreted that the N-terminal region of the enzyme (Met1-Phe131) might be unstructured or flexible. To understand the role of the N-terminal region of MaIZ in its enzymatic activity, and overall stability, a truncated version (Ala111-His616) of MaIZ was created. The truncated version failed to fold into an active enzyme both in E. coli cytosol and in vitro even with the assistance of chaperonins GroEL and GroES. Furthermore, the refolding effort of N-truncated MaIZ in the presence of isolated N-terminal domain didn't succeed. Our studies suggest that while the structural rigidity or orientation of the N-terminal region of the MalZ protein may not be essential for its stability and function, but the said domain is likely to play an important role in the formation of the native structure of the protein when present as an integral part of the protein.

AB  - We had earlier demonstrated a neurofilament-rich plexus of axons in the presumptive human auditory cortex during fetal development which became adult-like during infancy. To elucidate the origin of these axons, we studied the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) 1 and 2 in the human auditory cortex at different stages of development. While VGLUT-1 expression predominates in intrinsic and cortico-cortical synapses, VGLUT-2 expression predominates in thalamocortical synapses. Levels of VGLUT-2 mRNA were higher in the auditory cortex before birth compared to postnatal development. In contrast, levels of VGLUT-1 mRNA were low before birth and increased during postnatal development to peak during childhood and then began to decrease in adolescence. Both VGLUT-1 and VGLUT-2 proteins were present in the human auditory cortex as early as 15GW. Further, immunohistochemistry revealed that the supra- and infragranular layers were more immunoreactive for VGLUT-1 compared to that in Layer IV at 34GW and this pattern was maintained until adulthood. As for VGLUT-1 mRNA, VGLUT-1 synapses increased in density between prenatal development and childhood in the human auditory cortex after which they appeared to undergo attrition or pruning. The adult pattern of VGLUT-2 immunoreactivity (a dense band of VGLUT-2-positive terminals in Layer IV) also began to appear in the presumptive Heschl's gyrus at 34GW. The density of VGLUT-2-positive puncta in Layer IV increased between prenatal development and adolescence, followed by a decrease in adulthood, suggesting that thalamic axons which innervate the human auditory cortex undergo pruning comparatively late in development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE There has been increased interest in the potential importance of biochemical parameters as predictors of outcome in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI).
   METHODS Of 107 patients with sTBI (age 18-65 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4-8 presenting within 8 hours after injury) who were randomized for a placebo-controlled Phase II trial of progesterone with or without hypothermia, the authors serially analyzed serum biomarkers (S100-B, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], neuron-specific enolase [NSE], tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 [IL-6], estrogen [Eg], and progesterone [Pg]). This analysis was performed using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique at admission and 7 days later for 86 patients, irrespective of assigned group. The long-term predictive values of serum biomarkers for dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score, functional independence measure, and survival status at 6 and 12 months were analyzed using an adjusted binary logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic curve.
   RESULTS A favorable GOS score (4-5) at 1 year was predicted by higher admission IL-6 (above 108.36 pg/ml; area under the curve [AUC] 0.69, sensitivity 52%, and specificity 78.6%) and Day 7 Pg levels (above 3.15 ng/ml; AUC 0.79, sensitivity 70%, and specificity 92.9%). An unfavorable GOS score (1-3) at 1 year was predicted by higher Day 7 GFAP levels (above 9.50 ng/ml; AUC 0.82, sensitivity 78.6%, and specificity 82.4%). Survivors at 1 year had significantly higher Day 7 Pg levels (above 3.15 ng/ml; AUC 0.78, sensitivity 66.7%, and specificity 90.9%). Nonsurvivors at 1 year had significantly higher Day 7 GFAP serum levels (above 11.14 ng/ml; AUC 0.81, sensitivity 81.8%, and specificity 88.9%) and Day 7 IL-6 serum levels (above 71.26 pg/ml; AUC 0.87, sensitivity 81.8%, and specificity 87%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of outcome at 1 year were serum levels of Day 7 Pg (favorable GOS OR 3.24, CI 1.5-7, p = 0.003; and favorable survival OR 2, CI 1.2-3.5, p = 0.01); admission IL-6 (favorable GOS OR 1.04, CI 1.00-1.08, p = 0.04); and Day 7 GFAP (unfavorable GOS OR 0.79, CI 0.65-0.95, p = 0.01; and unfavorable survival-OR 0.80, CI 0.66-0.96, p = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS Serial Pg, GFAP, and IL-6 monitoring could aid in prognosticating outcomes in patients with acute sTBI. A cause and effect relationship or a mere association of these biomarkers to outcome needs to be further studied for better understanding of the pathophysiology of sTBI and for choosing potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Adenosine deaminase (ADA) which degrades adenosine to inosine, is known to be pro-inflammatory molecule in many diseases. Adenosine suppresses the functioning of the immune system and thus promotes dissemination of the parasite. In our previous finding, the level of soluble ADA in serum of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was found to be increased as compared to healthy controls. However, it cannot be fairly interpreted unless their level is demonstrated at the disease site, where the parasite resides. We designed this study to correlate the level of soluble ADA (sADA) with parasitic load at the disease site i.e. bone marrow (BM). We found increased levels of sADA in BM as compared to the unaffected BM. Furthermore, a significant inverse correlation is observed between the parasite load and level of sADA at the disease site.

AB  - Diabetes is a prevalent health problem in developing as well developed countries. Previous study advocates for diabetes self-management education (DSME) among diabetics. In this study, we have examined the association of sociodemographics and technology use with health literacy among type 2 diabetic individuals. This exploratory cross-sectional study was performed by enrolling a convenient sample of 100 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Individuals of age 18 years or above were enrolled during regular outpatient visit to the diabetic clinic of Saveetha Medical College in Chennai, a metropolitan city in southern state of India in August 2013. A modified version of previously validated questionnaires was used for gathering information on sociodemographic characteristics, technology use assessments, diabetes-related information, health literacy, and health information-seeking behavior. Results of the study showed that majority of the individuals had received some form of diabetes education from their doctor at the time of diagnosis. However, 56 % of the participants had difficulty (sometimes to always) in understanding the health information provided by the healthcare professional. Individuals who had access to computer and Internet at home or work required less support for reading instructions, pamphlets, or other written material from the doctor or pharmacy. Individuals having access to technology had higher health literacy as compared to individuals with no access. Technology can act as potential enabler for improving the health literacy. Future research is warranted to identify most cost-effective, feasible, and accessible technology medium for providing diabetes self-care management education.

AB  - Pregnane & Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR) acts as a xenosensing transcriptional regulator of many drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters of the 'detoxification machinery' that coordinate in elimination of xenobiotics and endobiotics from the cellular milieu. It is an accepted view that some individuals or specific populations display considerable differences in their ability to metabolize different drugs, dietary constituents, herbals etc. In this context we speculated that polymorphisms in PXR gene might contribute to variability in cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolizing enzymes of phase I, drug metabolizing components of phase II and efflux components of the detoxification machinery. Therefore, in this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive functional analysis of seventeen naturally occurring non-synonymous variants of human PXR. When compared, we observed that some of the PXR SNP variants exhibit distinct functional and dynamic responses on parameters which included transcriptional function, sub-cellular localization, mitotic chromatin binding, DNA-binding properties and other molecular interactions. One of the unique SNP located within the DNA-binding domain of PXR was found to be functionally null and distinct on other parameters. Similarly, some of the non-synonymous SNPs in PXR imparted reduced transactivation function as compared to wild type PXR. Interestingly, PXR is reported to be a mitotic chromatin binding protein and such an association has been correlated to an emerging concept of 'transcription memory' and altered transcription output. In view of the observations made herein our data suggest that some of the natural PXR variants may have adverse physiological consequences owing to its influence on the expression levels and functional output of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The present study is expected to explain not only the observed inter-individual responses to different drugs but may also highlight the mechanistic details and importance of PXR in drug clearance, drug-drug interactions and diverse metabolic disorders.

AB  - We report a case of Chlamydia trachomatis serovar G urogenital tract infection in a 33-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) seropositive Indian bisexual male. This case highlights the emergence of a new serovar in India. The patient was tested positive for C. trachomatis by both cryptic plasmid and ompA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On further characterization using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and ompA gene sequencing, the strain was found to be C. trachomatis serovar G. His spouse was also found to be infected with C. trachomatis serovar G. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the clinical isolates obtained from both partners and were found to be identical to the isolates available in GenBank. The sexual network could not be traced further. Detection of a new genotype suggests importation of a new strain into the population probably by sexual contact with a person from a geographical area where the strain is common. Identifying circulating genotypes in the community can assist in developing strategies for improved sexually transmitted disease control.

AB  - Diazepam ingestion along with ethanol is encountered commonly in drug overdose cases. In the present study, the effect of pH and ethanol on the adsorption of diazepam in the simulated gastric fluid and the simulated intestinal fluid onto activated charcoal was determined in vitro. The adsorption behaviors of diazepam in both simulated gastric and intestinal pH onto activated charcoal were studied. In the adsorption study with ethanol, some of the gastric or intestinal fluid was replaced with an equivalent volume of 10 and 25% ethanol, respectively. The unabsorbed diazepam in simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid (with and without ethanol) was determined by UV spectrophotometer at wavelengths 289 and 256 nm, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities (at 95% confidence limits) of activated charcoal were 25 (18.42; 31.5) mg and 200 (175.158; 224.84) mg diazepam/g activated charcoal at pH values 1.2 and 6.8, respectively. In case of 10 and 25% ethanol, adsorption in the simulated gastric fluid were 19.20 (21.23; 18.00) mg and 0.268 (0.286; 0.26) mg diazepam/g activated charcoal, respectively. Surprisingly, in the simulated intestinal fluid, the adsorption patterns were not affected due to presence of 10% ethanol while it was reduced to 76.92 (78.179; 74.84) mg/g activated charcoal at 25% ethanol concentration. Under the simulated gastrointestinal environmental condition, the activated charcoal adsorbed a sufficient amount of diazepam (200 mg/g-25 mg/g) with maximum at intestinal pH. Our results show that standard dose of 50 g of activated charcoal as provided in general poisoning cases is sufficient to prevent diazepam intoxication with or without ethanol.

AB  - Background: Rac proteins play a major role in tumorogenesis. We quantified Rac1 and Rac1b in serum of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
   Methods: The blood of 77 NSCLC patients and 52 healthy controls were collected and quantified the concentration of Rac1 and Rac1b mainly by surface plasmon resonance and it was verify by Western blot analysis.
   Results: Rac1 and Rac1b were found to be significantly over expressed in serum of NSCLC patients compare to healthy controls. The level of Rac proteins were found to be increased in all stages of cancer. Despite the low survival rate, we managed to collect serum sample of the 18 follow up patients after the therapy, where 11 patients' of CR + PR group showed down regulation of the Rac protein after chemotherapy and unfortunately 80% patients died during the study period.
   Conclusion: The high specificity and sensitivity obtained from ROC analysis for Rac1 and Rac1b envisaged it to be used as a serum diagnostic marker in the early stage of cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive molecule that can modulate immune cell activation. The role of HLA-G in tuberculosis, an immune-mediated and chronic bacterial disease remains to be elucidated. We investigated the expression profile of soluble and membrane bound HLA-G in pulmonary TB (PTB), TB pleural effusion (TB-PE, localized disease) and Miliary TB (disseminated form). The expression of HLA-G receptor, ILT-2 was also determined on the immune cells. We observed that the plasma sHLA-G levels were significantly increased in Miliary TB than in TB-PE patients. In contrast, immunophenotyping revealed that the percent frequency of CD3(+) T cells expressing HLA-G was significantly reduced in Miliary TB as compared to TB-PE, whereas frequency of CD14(+) monocytes expressing HLA-G was significantly higher in TB-PE patients. Strikingly in the TB-PE cases, comparison of disease site, i.e. pleural effusion with peripheral blood showed increased expression of both soluble and surface HLA-G, whereas ILT-2 expressing cells were reduced at the local disease site. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in TB-PE cases, HLA-G expression on CD3(+) T cells was influenced by broad spectrum MMP inhibitor. Thus, differential expression of HLA-G could potentially be a useful biomarker to distinguish different states of TB disease. (C) 2016 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

AB  - Context: Telemedicine is a major effort to tackle the uneven availability of facilities for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. We present a telestroke model introduced in a small hilly state of Himachal Pradesh in India. Aims: To provide acute ischemic stroke treatment with tissue plasminogen activator in all district hospitals of Himachal Pradesh with computerized axial tomographic scan facility through Telemedicine. Settings and Design: Smartphone-based hub and spoke telestroke model was used with two tertiary care hospitals (with neurologists) as hub and 17 district hospitals (without onsite neurologists) as spokes. Subject and Methods: The telestroke project was launched in the state of Himachal Pradesh in April 2014. Medical officers in district hospitals (Medicine graduates and Internal Medicine postgraduates) were trained in the treatment of stroke through workshops. Tissue plasminogen activator was made available at all these centers, free of cost through hospital pharmacies. Four neurologists at two tertiary care centers were made available for consultation on phone. Results: Between June 2014 and May 2015, a total of 26 patients received thrombolysis under the telestroke project at nine district hospitals without onsite presence of a neurologist. Eight patients were females and 18 males. The age of patients ranged from 26 to 80 years. Only 2 patients developed an intracranial bleed following thrombolysis, and both were nonfatal. Conclusions: Smartphone-based telestroke services may be a much cheaper alternative to video-conferencing-based telestroke services and are more portable with less technical glitches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first telestroke model being reported from India. It seems to be the way forward in providing timely treatment in acute ischemic stroke in underserved and resource poor settings.

AB  - The current treatment therapies available for malignant gliomas are inadequate. There is an urgent need to develop more effective therapies by characterizing the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Over expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) ligands and receptors have been reported in malignant gliomas. Platelet-derived growth factor associated protein-1 (PDAP-1) is reported to modulate the mitogenic activity of PDGF ligands, but to date, there is no information concerning its role in PDGF-mediated glioma cell proliferation. This study aimed to characterize the role of PDAP-1 in PDGF-mediated glioma proliferation. The expression of PDAP-1 was observed to be significantly increased (p<0.05) in grade IV glioma tissue and cell lines compared to grade III. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDAP-1 reduced the expression of PDGF-B and its downstream genes (Akt1/Protein kinase B (PKB) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) by up to 50%. In PDAP-1 knockdown glioma cells, more than a twofold reduction was also observed in the level of phosphorylated Akt. Interestingly, knockdown of PDAP-1 in combination with PDGF-B antibody inhibited glioma cell proliferation through activation of Caspase 3/7 and 9. We also demonstrate that PDAP-1 co-localizes with PDGF-B in the cytoplasm of glioma cells, and an interaction between both of the proteins was established. Collectively, these findings suggest that the expression of PDAP-1 is associated with disease malignancy, and its inhibition reduced the proliferation of malignant glioma cells through down-regulation of PDGF-B/Akt/PDK1 signaling. Thus, this study establishes PDAP-1 as an effecter of PDGF signaling in glioma cells and suggests that it could also be a promising therapeutic target. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Patterns of injury among motorized two-wheeler pillion riders in New Delhi, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
KW  - Pillions
KW  - Pattern of injury
KW  - Two-wheeler
AB  - Background: Motorized two-wheelers (MTWs) such as scooters and motorcycles place drivers and passengers at significant risk of injury and death in the event of a road traffic accident. In India, where road traffic is poorly regulated and consists of vehicles ranging from semitrucks to animal carts, the MTW pillion rider (backseat passenger) is particularly vulnerable. Annually, approximately 140,000 Indians are injured or killed in MTW road traffic accidents. In 2011, the city of New Delhi renewed a mandatory helmet use exemption for its 8 million women. We sought to identify the patterns of injury among MTW pillion riders in the city of New Delhi, including differences between helmeted and unhelmeted male and female pillion riders.
   Methods: All records of incoming trauma patients to the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center, New Delhi, were reviewed for the 23-mo period from April 1, 2009 until March 1, 2011. More than 3000 charts were reviewed selecting for patients who were MTW pillion riders involved in road traffic accidents. Data including Glasgow Coma Scale score, number of surgical procedures performed, length of stay, and demographic information were collected from charts that met the criteria. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables and KruskaleWallis test for continuous variables.
   Results: A total of 466 charts of MTW pillions in road traffic accidents were identified with 108 helmeted males, 161 unhelmeted males, three helmeted females, and 194 unhelmeted females. Females, both unhelmeted and helmeted, were more likely to have head and neck injury than unhelmeted males or helmeted males (66.0% and 66.7% versus 53.4% and 27.8%, P < 0.001). Unhelmeted females were most likely to suffer inhospital mortality (17.6%, P = 0.008) and require intensive care unit admission (40.0%, P = 0.004). Unhelmeted pillions, both male and female, had significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores than helmeted pillions (12.6 and 12.8 versus 13.8 and 15, P = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Female pillions are more likely to have head and neck injury than male pillions, and unhelmeted pillions are more likely to have injuries resulting in their death. This firmly establishes the protective benefit of helmet use for pillions. Encouraging helmet use among all pillions may prevent a significant number of injuries and deaths, and mandatory helmet laws may decrease morbidity and mortality of MTW road traffic accidents for the women of New Delhi and all of India.

AB  - Identifying seizure patterns in complex electroencephalography (EEG) through visual inspection is often challenging, time-consuming and prone to errors. These problems have motivated the development of various automated seizure detection systems that can aid neurophysiologists in accurate diagnosis of epilepsy. The present study is focused on the development of a robust automated system for classification against low levels of supervised training. EEG data from two different repositories are considered for analysis and validation of the proposed system. The signals are decomposed into time-frequency sub bands till sixth level using dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). All details and last approximation coefficients are used to calculate features viz. energy, standard deviation, root-mean-square, Shannon entropy, mean values and maximum peaks. These feature sets are passed through a general regression neural network (GRNN) for classification with K-fold cross-validation scheme under varying train-to-test ratios. The current model yields ceiling level classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity & specificity) in all combinations of datasets (ictal vs non-ictal) in less than 0.028 s. The proposed scheme will not only maximize hit-rate and correct rejection rate but also will aid neurophysiologists in the fast and accurate diagnosis of seizure onset. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Overactive bladder is a syndrome of urinary frequency and urgency, with or without urge incontinence, in the absence of local pathological factors. Since multiple causes are responsible for OAB, it requires proper diagnosis and comprehensive management. For decades, flavoxate is a globally used and accepted molecule by the urologists and the general physicians for the symptomatic treatment of OAB. In spite of its extensive use in OAB, a meta-analysis of the available publications for efficacy, safety and tolerability of flavoxate has not been conducted. This paper evaluates the strength of evidence of clinical effectiveness of safety and tolerability of flavoxate in the symptomatic treatment of OAB.
   METHODS: Review articles, original studies and case reports on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Scirus, internal repository, etc. were searched using the keyword "flavoxate". For the primary outcome, the comparative data of flavoxate versus comparator was extracted for following parameters-overall efficacy and its side effect profile. Similarly as for secondary outcome, data were extracted for flavoxate per se for overall efficacy, frequency, urinary incontinence, mixed incontinence, nocturia, unpleasant urination, stranguria and its side effect profile and were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.0.
   RESULTS: In the current meta-analysis, 43 relevant published studies were considered which clearly demonstrated that flavoxate had improved clinical efficacy than placebo, emepronium, propantheline, and phenazopyridine.
   CONCLUSIONS: Amongst all the interventions studied, flavoxate was effective and well-tolerated, with almost negligible side effects, making it worthy of consideration for the treatment of OAB.

AB  - Background and Aims: EUS-guided FNA or biopsy sampling is widely practiced. Optimal sonographic visualization of the needle is critical for image-guided interventions. Of the several commercially available needles, bench-top testing and direct comparison of these needles have not been done to reveal their inherent echogenicity. The aims are to provide bench-top data that can be used to guide clinical applications and to promote future device research and development.
   Methods: Descriptive bench-top testing and comparison of 8 commonly used EUS-FNA needles (all size 22 gauge): SonoTip Pro Control (Medi-Globe); Expect Slimline (Boston Scientific); EchoTip, EchoTip Ultra, EchoTip ProCore High Definition (Cook Medical); ClearView (Conmed); EZ Shot 2 (Olympus); and BNX (Beacon Endoscopic), and 2 new prototype needles, SonoCoat (Medi-Globe), coated by echogenic polymers made by Encapson. Blinded evaluation of standardized and unedited videos by 43 EUS endoscopists and 17 radiologists specialized in GI US examination who were unfamiliar with EUS needle devices.
   Results: There was no significant difference in the ratings and rankings of these needles between endosonographers and radiologists. Overall, 1 prototype needle was rated as the best, ranking 10% to 40% higher than all other needles (P < .01). Among the commercially available needles, the EchoTip Ultra needle and the ClearView needle were top choices. The EZ Shot 2 needle was ranked statistically lower than other needles (30%-75% worse, P < .001).
   Conclusions: All FNA needles have their inherent and different echogenicities, and these differences are similarly recognized by EUS endoscopists and radiologists. Needles with polymeric coating from the entire shaft to the needle tip may offer better echogenicity.

AB  - Background During the last two decades, an increasing number of bariatric surgical procedures have been performed worldwide. There is no consensus regarding optimal perioperative care in bariatric surgery. This review aims to present such a consensus and to provide graded recommendations for elements in an evidence-based "enhanced'' perioperative protocol.
   Methods The English-language literature between January 1966 and January 2015 was searched, with particular attention paid to meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. Selected studies were examined, reviewed and graded. After critical appraisal of these studies, the group of authors reached a consensus recommendation.
   Results Although for some elements, recommendations are extrapolated from non-bariatric settings (mainly colorectal), most recommendations are based on good-quality trials or meta-analyses of good-quality trials.
   Conclusions A comprehensive evidence-based consensus was reached and is presented in this review by the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) Society. The guidelines were endorsed by the International Association for Surgical Metabolism and Nutrition (IASMEN) and based on the evidence available in the literature for each of the elements of the multimodal perioperative care pathway for patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

AB  - Objective: To carry out surveillance of central line associated bloodstream infections in a Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and determine associated risk factors.
   Methods: This prospective study was conducted over 1.5 years in the PICU. CDC definitions for these infections were followed and associated risk factors were identified.
   Results: Of 265 enrolled children with central line, 13 developed blood stream infections (incidence density 5.03/1000 central-line days). Significant risk factors included changing the central-line, especially triple lumen, and frequently accessing the central-line.
   Conclusion: Central-line associated bloodstream infections are preventable primary bacteremias and intervention strategies for prevention should be based on evidence generated to devise future protocols.

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to compare planar technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m-DMSA) cortical scintigraphy with Tc-99m-DMSA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the detection of renal cortical scars in patients with chronic kidney disease stage-3 (CKD-3).Patients and methodsData of 40 patients (mean age: 43.715.3 years, 29 men, 11 women) who underwent planar Tc-99m-DMSA along with regional Tc-99m-DMSA SPECT for the detection of renal cortical scars were prospectively evaluated. All the patients had CKD-3, with a mean serum creatinine level of 2.231.85g/dl. Planar and SPECT Tc-99m-DMSA images were evaluated by two nuclear medicine readers independently. Each kidney was divided into 12 cortical segments. A cortical segment was recorded as abnormal if it had reduced or absent radiotracer activity. The linear correlation coefficient (r value) for the number of abnormal segments detected between readers was calculated for planar imaging, SPECT, and between the two techniques for both the readers.ResultsFor both observers, the average correlation coefficient for SPECT (r=0.87) and planar imaging (r=0.90) was high (P<0.0001). A moderately strong linear correlation was also observed between readers for planar imaging and SPECT (r=0.78 and 0.71, P<0.0001). There was no significant difference in the average number of abnormal segments detected by planar versus SPECT imaging: 2.1 for planar imaging and 2.8 for SPECT (P=0.06, two-tailed). In 15% of patients, SPECT detected cortical defects not appreciated on planar imaging.Conclusion(99m)Tc-DMSA renal cortical imaging using dual-head SPECT offers no statistically significant diagnostic advantage over planar imaging for the detection of cortical defects in patients with CKD-3.

TI  - Intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging and Assessment of the Macula During Cataract Surgery: A Novel Technique
T2  - OPHTHALMIC SURGERY LASERS & IMAGING RETINA
AB  - The authors describe a technique to qualitatively analyze the posterior segment during cataract surgery using intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT). Macular iOCT can be done before and after intraocular lens implantation after the media is rendered clear following phacoemulsification. A handheld irrigating planoconcave contact lens is placed over the cornea with the operating microscope in retroillumination mode. After focusing the microscope and upon getting a clear view of the posterior segment, iOCT is switched on, centered at the macula, and focused. This technique enables the surgeon to intraoperatively analyze and document the macular morphology and vitreoretinal interface. Potential uses of this technique include intraoperative decision-making regarding concurrent use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents or steroids in cases with dense cataracts where preoperative OCT is difficult.

AB  - Disease caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is clinically characterized by sudden-onset of fever and severe arthralgia, which may persist for weeks, months, or years after acute phase of the infection. CHIKV is spreading globally; in India it first appeared in the 1960s followed by a quiescent period and then a full-blown remergence in 2006 and sporadic persistence since then. Despite a large number of commercially available diagnostic kits for CHIKV, clinical preparedness and diagnostics suffer from sub-optimal assays. An international diagnostic laboratory survey suggested that there is a critical need for improved CHUN diagnostics especially in the early acute phase of illness. With the recent studies indicating that a vast majority of human humoral response in CHIKV infection is directed against E2 protein, this supports strong interest to develop CHIKV E2 based serological tests. However, methods to produce large amounts of CHIKV protein are limited. Here we report cloning, expression and purification methods for obtaining a truncated 37 kDa Chikungunya E2 protein at a high yield of 65-70 mg/I. We found that this purified protein can be reliably used in ELISA and western blot to detect CHIKV specific antibodies in sera from patients who were PCR or IgM positive. Thus, using this protocol, laboratories can make large quantities of purified protein that can be potentially used in CHIKV serological analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The comparative effect of filler combinations on the quasi-static and thermo-mechanical properties of light cured acrylate based restorative composites is addressed in the study. Two series of acrylate based restorative composites filled with hydroxyapatite (Hap) and silica/Hap combination were prepared. FTIR spectroscopy showed the filler-assisted functional interference with the chemical structure of the resin, whereas SEM-EDX revealed the state of micro-dispersion/ distribution morphology of the filled composites. The silica/Hap combination filled (micro-hybrid) composites with 30 wt.-% filler showed highest compressive strength (CS) and composites with 20 wt.-% filler showed highest diametral tensile strength (DTS) as well as flexural strength (FS). Dynamic mechanical properties revealed reinforcement effectiveness correlated to extent of filler immobilization effects estimated from Kerner equation. Our study conceptually establishes the possibility of manipulating the mechanical and thermomechanical strength requirements, by catering to the extent of filler induced bulk hardening contributions, as characterized by immobilized volume fraction of the polymer chains. It was imperatively deduced that at very high amount of overall filler content (e.g. > 50 wt.-%) the reinforcement effectiveness is filler-controlled whereas the same extent of effectiveness may be obtained by manipulating the filler induced immobilization effects (e.g. < 20 wt. - %).

AB  - AIM: To assess the anatomical and visual outcome of idiopathic macular holes greater than 1000 pm using the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique.
   METHODS: This retrospective case series included 5 eyes of 5 patients with idiopathic macular hole with base diameter greater than 1000 mu M who underwent inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique along with standard 23G pars plans vitrectomy with posterior hyaloid detachment and fluid gas exchange with 12%-14% perfluoropropane (C3F8). Preoperative and postoperative visual acuity and spectral domain optical coherence tomography images were evaluated. The main outcome measures were visual outcome and macular hole closure.
   RESULTS: Mean age was 63.2 +/- 8.4y with all 5 subjects being females. Mean duration of symptoms was 11 +/- 14mo with a mean postoperative follow up of 13.2 +/- 13mo. The mean base diameter of the macular holes was 1420 +/- 84.8 mu m (1280-1480 mu m). Type 1 closure was achieved in four out of five patients, while one patient had type 2 closure using the inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique. Median baseline BCVA was 0.79 logMAR (Snellen's equivalent 20/120) and median final BCVA 0.6 logMAR (Snellen's equivalent 20/80) with mean visual improvement of approximately three lines improvement. No complications related to surgical procedure were noted.
   CONCLUSION: The inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique may be promising for very large macular holes with high rate of macular closure and good visual outcome.

AB  - Background: Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation, have a mortality rate of up to 30-fold higher than the general aged-matched population, and severely impaired quality of life. Symptoms such as fatigue and pain are prevalent and debilitating. Children with CKD are at risk of cognitive impairment, and poorer educational, vocational, and psychosocial outcomes compared with their well peers, which have consequences through to adulthood. Treatment regimens for children with CKD are long-term, complex, and highly intrusive. While many trials have been conducted to improve outcomes in children with CKD, the outcomes measured and reported are often not relevant to patients and clinicians, and are highly variable. These problems can diminish the value of trials as a means to improve the lives of children with CKD. The Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology-Children and Adolescents (SONG-Kids) study aims to develop a core outcome set for trials in children and adolescents with any stage of CKD that is based on the shared priorities of all stakeholders.
   Methods/Design: SONG-Kids involves five phases: a systematic review to identify outcomes (both domains and measures) that have been reported in randomised controlled trials involving children aged up to 21 years with CKD; focus groups (using nominal group technique) with adolescent patients and caregivers of paediatric patients (all ages) to identify outcomes that are relevant and important to patients and their family and the reasons for their choices; semistructured key informant interviews with health professionals involved in the care of children with CKD to ascertain their views on establishing core outcomes in paediatric nephrology; an international three-round online Delphi survey with patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, policy-makers, and members from industry to develop consensus on important outcome domains; and a stakeholder workshop to review and finalise the set of core outcome domains for trials in children with CKD (including nondialysis-dependent, dialysis, and kidney transplantation).
   Discussion: Establishing a core outcome set to be reported in all trials conducted in children with any stage of CKD will enhance the relevance, transparency, and impact of research to improve the lives of children and adolescents with CKD.

AB  - Background: Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living ubiquitous protozoans capable of causing Acanthamoeba meningitis/meningoencephalitis (AME) of the central nervous system in humans. Acanthamoeba spp. are divided into 20 different genotypes (T1-T20) on the basis of variation in nucleotide sequences of the 18S rRNA gene. The objective of this study was to identify the genotypes of Acanthamoeba spp. in patients of Acanthamoeba meningitis/meningoencephalitis (AME) using 18S rRNA gene-based PCR assay. The present study provides information regarding the involvement of the most prevalent and predominant genotype of Acanthamoeba spp. in Acanthamoeba meningitis/meningoencephalitis infections in India.
   Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from 149 clinically suspected Acanthamoeba meningitis/meningoencephalitis (AME) patients reporting to the outpatient department/causality services of the Neurosciences Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi, India during the past five years. Samples were inoculated onto 2 % non-nutrient agar plates overlaid with E. coli and incubated at 30 degrees C for 14 days. Among 149 suspected patients, ten were found culture-positive for Acanthamoeba spp. out of which six isolates were established in axenic culture for molecular analysis. DNA was isolated and a PCR assay was performed for amplification of the Diagnostic fragment 3 (DF3) (similar to 280 bp) region of the 18S rRNA gene from axenic culture of six Acanthamoeba spp. isolates. Rns genotyping was performed on the basis of the variation in nucleotide sequences of DF3 region of the 18S rRNA gene.
   Results: In the phylogenetic analysis, all of the six Acanthamoeba spp. isolates were found to belong to genotype T4. The sequence homology search for these six isolates in the NCBI databank showed homology with the available strains of Acanthamoeba spp. The newly generated sequences are available in the GenBank database under accession numbers KT004416-KT004421.
   Conclusions: In the present study, genotype T4 was found as the most prevalent and predominant genotype in Acanthamoeba meningitis/meningoencephalitis infections. Hence further studies are needed to develop optimal therapeutic strategy against Acanthamoeba spp. of genotype T4 to combat against the infections.

AB  - Owing to the reports of microcephaly as a consistent outcome in the fetuses of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Brazil, Zika virus (ZIKV) microcephaly etiomechanistic relationship has recently been implicated. Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favor of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker "retinoic acid" in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5'-AGGTCA-3') in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses for RARE consensus sequence repeats is positive only for those known to display neurotropism and cause fetal brain defects (for which maternal-fetal transmission during developing stage may be required). The numbers of RARE sequence repeats appeared to match with the virulence of screened positive viruses. Although, bioinformatic evidence and embryological features are in favor of our hypothesis, additional studies including animal models are warranted to validate our proposition. Such studies are likely to unfold ZIKV-microcephaly association and may help in devising methods to combat it.

AB  - The genetic architecture of common traits, including the number, frequency, and effect sizes of inherited variants that contribute to individual risk, has been long debated. Genome-wide association studies have identified scores of common variants associated with type 2 diabetes, but in aggregate, these explain only a fraction of the heritability of this disease. Here, to test the hypothesis that lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies. Comprehensive enumeration of sequence variation is necessary to identify functional alleles that provide important clues to disease pathophysiology, but large-scale sequencing does not support the idea that lower-frequency variants have a major role in predisposition to type 2 diabetes.

AB  - DevR/DosR is a well-characterized regulator in Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is implicated in various processes ranging from dormancy/persistence to drug tolerance. DevR induces the expression of an similar to 48-gene dormancy regulon in response to gaseous stresses, including hypoxia. Strains of the Beijing lineage constitutively express this regulon, which may confer upon them a significant advantage, since they would be 'pre-adapted' to the environmental stresses that predominate during infection. Aerobic DevR regulon expression in laboratory-manipulated overexpression strains is also reported. In both instances, the need for an inducing signal is bypassed. While a phosphorylation-mediated conformational change in DevR was proposed as the activation mechanism under hypoxia, the mechanism underlying constitutive expression is not understood. Because DevR is implicated in bacterial dormancy/persistence and is a promising drug target, it is relevant to resolve the mechanistic puzzle of hypoxic activation on one hand and constitutive expression under 'non-inducing' conditions on the other. Here, an overexpression strategy was employed to elucidate the DevR activation mechanism. Using a panel of kinase and transcription factor mutants, we establish that DevR, upon overexpression, circumvents DevS/DosT sensor kinase-mediated or small molecule phosphodonor-dependent activation, and also cooperativity-mediated effects, which are key aspects of hypoxic activation mechanism. However, overexpression failed to rescue the defect of C-terminal-truncated DevR lacking the alpha 10 helix, establishing the alpha 10 helix as an indispensable component of DevR activation mechanism. We propose that aerobic overexpression of DevR likely increases the concentration of alpha 10 helix-mediated active dimer species to above the threshold level, as during hypoxia, and enables regulon expression. This advance in the understanding of DevR activation mechanism clarifies a long standing question as to the mechanism of DevR overexpression-mediated induction of the regulon in the absence of the normal environmental cue and establishes the alpha 10 helix as an universal and pivotal targeting interface for DevR inhibitor development.

AB  - Chlamydia and ocular adnexal lymphomas: an Indian experience: Ocular adnexal lymphomas (OALs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies, majority being extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Different geographical regions have reported association of Chlamydia with OALs (MALT type). In India, role of Chlamydia in OALs remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to detect Chlamydia and to correlate with clinicopathological features of OALs in India. The clinicopathological features of 41 OAL cases were studied prospectively. Chlamydia DNA was detected by genus specific PCR amplifying major outer membrane protein (MOMP) gene followed by DNA sequencing. Chlamydia immunoexpression was evaluated by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. The results were correlated with clinicopathological features including follow-up and survival. Chlamydia genome was detected in 3/41 (7.3%) OAL cases by PCR. Direct sequencing revealed C trachomatis in 3 positive cases. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry showed Chlamydia antigen in 5/41 and 1/41 cases respectively. Immunofluorescence demonstrated higher sensitivity than immunohistochemistry. A significant association was observed between Chlamydia positivity and orbital location (P = 0.05). Follow-up revealed relapse in 2 Chlamydia positive cases (P = 0.056). Our results demonstrate for the first time presence of C. trachomatis genome in 73% OAL cases in India. As no other reports are documented, more detailed studies from different regions within India are needed to explore status of Chlamydia in OALs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The authors report a case of congenital chloride diarrhea with molecular confirmation of diagnosis. A 10-mo-old boy presented with failure to thrive, voluminous diarrhea, dehydration, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis and history of maternal polyhydramnios. The diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea was based on high fecal and low urinary chloride excretion, in addition to biochemical abnormalities. Genetic testing revealed a novel homozygous mutation in exon 4 of the SLC26A3 gene that encodes the protein regulating chloride bicarbonate absorption in distal ileum and colon. Therapy with oral fluids and electrolytes led to decrease in stool frequency and improvement in growth parameters.

AB  - Objective: Human growth is an elementary process which starts at conception and continues through different stages of development under the influence of growth hormone (GH) secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Variation affecting the production, release and functional activity of GH leads to growth hormone deficiency (GHD), which is of two types: isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) and combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). IGHD may result from mutations in GH1 and GHRHR while CPHD is associated with defects in transcription factor genes PROP1, POU1F1 and HESX1. The present study reports on the molecular screening of GHRHR and GH1 in IGHD patients.
   Methods: A total of 116 clinically diagnosed IGHD patients and 100 controls were enrolled for the study after taking informed consent. Family history was noted and 5 ml blood sample was drawn. Anatomical and/or morphological pituitary gland alterations were studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DNA from blood samples was processed for screening the GHRHR and GH1 by Sanger sequencing.
   Results: Mean age at presentation of the 116 patients (67 males and 49 females) was 11.71 +/- 3.5 years. Mean height standard deviation score (SDS) and weight SDS were -4.5 and -3.5 respectively. Nine (7.8%) were familial and parental consanguinity was present in 21 (19.8%) families. Eighty-three patients underwent MRI and morphological alterations of the pituitary were observed in 39 (46.9%). GH1 and GHRHR screening revealed eleven variations in 24 (21%) patients of which, four were novel deleterious, one novel non-pathogenic and six reported changes.
   Conclusions: GHRHR contributed more to IGHD in our patients which confirmed that GHRHR should be screened first before GH1 in our population. Identification of GH1 and GHRHR variations helped in defining our mutational spectrum which will play a crucial role in providing predictive and prenatal genetic testing to the patients.

AB  - Objective: Purpose of the study is to verify the Gamma Knife Extend (TM) system (ES) based fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery with newly developed head-thorax phantom.
   Methods: Phantoms are extensively used to measure radiation dose and verify treatment plan in radiotherapy. A human upper body shaped phantom with thorax was designed to simulate fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery using Extend (TM) system of Gamma Knife. The central component of the phantom aids in performing radiological precision test, dosimetric evaluation and treatment verification. A hollow right circular cylindrical space of diameter 7.0 cm was created at the centre of this component to place various dosimetric devices using suitable adaptors. The phantom is made of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), a transparent thermoplastic material. Two sets of disk assemblies were designed to place dosimetric films in (1) horizontal (xy) and (2) vertical (xz) planes. Specific cylindrical adaptors were designed to place thimble ionization chamber inside phantom for point dose recording along xz axis. EBT3 Gafchromic films were used to analyze and map radiation field. The focal precision test was performed using 4 mm collimator shot in phantom to check radiological accuracy of treatment. The phantom head position within the Extend (TM) frame was estimated using encoded aperture measurement of repositioning check tool (RCT). For treatment verification, the phantom with inserts for film and ion chamber was scanned in reference treatment position using X-ray computed tomography (CT) machine and acquired stereotactic images were. transferred into Leksell Gammaplan (LGP). A patient treatment plan with hypo-fractionated regimen was delivered and identical fractions were compared using EBT3 films and in-house MATLAB codes.
   Results: RCT measurement showed an overall positional accuracy of 0.265 mm (range 0.223 mm -0.343 mm). Gamma index analysis across fractions exhibited close agreement between LGP and film measured dose with >= 90% (max 93%) pixel pass rate at 1 mm of spatial and 1% of dosimetric tolerances. The focal precision test showed the variation of 0.465 mm between radiological and planned iso-centre.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrated the suitability of newly developed head-thorax phantom for dosimetric verification of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery using Extend (TM) system of Gamma Knife. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Pain following neurosurgery has never been given due attention. Objective: This was a prospective study to assess pain following various neurosurgical procedures. Methods: Patients underwent pain assessment on 11-point scale(0-10) for 24 hours following neurosurgery, and analyzed in relation to various factors. Results: Among total 159 patients, 88(55%), 58(37%) and 13(8%) had undergone cranial, spinal and peripheral nerve procedures respectively. The mean pain score within 12 hours was 3.51(SD +/- 2.53), which increased significantly during 13-24 hours to 5.06(SD +/- 2.6)(P<0.001). During 13-24 hours, the pain score among those who underwent infratentorial procedures (8.02 +/- 2.77) was significantly higher than among those who underwent supratentorial procedures (3.48 +/- 1.99)(P<0.001). The pain score of patients who underwent lumbar surgery (6.5 +/- 1.93) was significantly higher than of those who underwent cervical surgery (4.04 +/- 2.43)(P<0.001). Age and gender did not show any significant influence on pain. Conclusion: Pain is significantly greater during 13-24 hours after neurosurgery, especially after infratentorial and lumbar surgical procedures, compared to others.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the role of a single 18-FDG positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) scan in comparison to multiple organ-directed conventional investigations (CI) as a staging tool in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) to detect regional and distant metastasis.
   All eligible patients were subjected to CI (chest X-ray, abdominal sonography, and bone scintigraphy) followed by a single 18-FDG PET-CT scan. Standard imaging criteria were used for diagnosis of metastasis. Histopathological confirmation was undertaken for suspicious lesions. An exploratory analysis was done to assess the impact of PET-CT on the staging of LABC and how it resulted in a change in management.
   The study included 79 patients of LABC. PET-CT detected distant metastasis in 36 (45.5 %) patients while CI could identify distant metastasis in 20 (25.3 %) patients. Two of the 36 patients in whom PET-CT detected distant metastasis were false positive. Overall PET-CT upstaged the disease in 38 (48.1 %) patients as compared to CI: stage III to stage IV migration in 14 (17.7 %) patients due to identification of additional sites of distant metastasis, and within stage III upstaging in 24 (30.3 %) patients due to identification of additional regional lymphadenopathy. PET-CT led to a change in management plan in 14 (17.7 %) patients.
   PET-CT has a role in identifying additional sites of regional lymphadenopathy and distant metastasis to upstage the disease in a significant number of LABC patients in comparison to CI; this would help in accurate staging, selecting optimal treatment, and better prognostication of disease.

AB  - Objective: The indigenous food environment, dietary intake and nutritional status of women in the Santhal tribal community of Jharkhand were assessed. Contribution of indigenous foods to nutritional status and nutrient intakes was explored.
   Design: Exploratory cross-sectional study with a longitudinal dietary intake assessment component. Household and dietary surveys were conducted to elicit information on socio-economic and demographic profile and food consumption patterns at household level. A 24 h dietary recall for two consecutive days (repeat surveys in two more seasons) and anthropometric assessments were carried out on one woman per household.
   Setting: Households (n 151) with at least one woman of reproductive age in four villages of Godda district of Jharkhand, India.
   Subjects: Women aged 15-49 years.
   Results: Almost all households owned agricultural land and grew fruits and vegetables in backyards for household consumption. A wide variety of indigenous foods were reported but dietary recalls revealed low intake. Women consumed adequate energy and protein but micronutrient intake was inadequate (less than 66% of recommended) in the majority (more than 50%) for Ca, Fe, vitamin B-2, folate and vitamin B-12. Women consuming indigenous foods in the past 2 d had significantly higher intakes of Ca (P= 0.008) and Fe (P= 0.010) than those who did not. Varying degrees of underweight were observed in 50% of women with no significant association between underweight and consumption of indigenous foods.
   Conclusions: Promotion of preferential cultivation of nutrient-dense indigenous food sources and effective nutrition education on their importance may facilitate better micronutrient intakes among women in Santhal community of Jharkhand.

AB  - Purpose of review
   More than 25% of the procedures necessitating an anesthesia provider's involvement are performed outside the operating room. As a result, it is imperative that the expansion of anesthesia services to any new nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) location takes into account the challenges and safety considerations associated with such a transformation.
   Recent findings
   Although the adverse events encountered in the NORA suite are similar to those met in the operating room, the frequency and implications are different. In addition, many adverse events are site specific. Hypoxemia events, including cardiac arrest continue to dominate all areas of NORA practice. Challenges posed by new minimally invasive procedures continue to grow. Electronic documentation is rapidly expanding into the NORA suite, which brings both advantages and challenges.
   Summary
   Involvement of anesthesia providers at the development stage and an understanding of the administrative and clinical challenges are essential elements in the building of a NORA practice.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the utility of measuring phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (phIGFBP-1) in cervical secretions to predict preterm birth among women with premature uterine contractions. Methods: A prospective study was conducted between September 27, 2013, and February 28, 2014, at a tertiary center in India. Participants with symptoms of preterm labor at 24-36 weeks underwent testing for phIGFBP-1 in cervical secretions. Cervical length was measured by ultrasonography. Results: Cervical swab samples tested positive for phIGFBP-1 among 34 (57%) of the 60 participants. Mean cervical length was 2.15 +/- 0.63 cm among the 46 (77%) women who delivered preterm and 2.54 +/- 0.47 cm among the 14 (23%) women who delivered at term. Of the 46 preterm deliveries, 29 (63%) women tested positive for phIGFBP-1 and 17 (37%) tested negative. Mean length of pregnancy at delivery was 32.11 +/- 4.09 weeks and 35.77 +/- 1.68 weeks among women who tested positive and negative for phIGFBP-1, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of phIGFBP-1 to predict preterm birth were 86.96%, 35.29%, 64.52%, and 66.67%, respectively. Conclusion: A rapid bedside test measuring phIGFBP-1 identified women at high risk of preterm delivery. (C) 2016 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to discuss the underlying etiology of raised intracranial pressure and its sequel after unilateral internal jugular vein ligation. In addition, the management protocol for such rare cases has been discussed along with literature review.
   MethodsPubMed and Google were used to search the literature for cases of raised intracranial pressure with complications after unilateral internal jugular vein (IJV) ligation. Twelve case reports with 17 patients were identified.
   ResultsThere were 13 male and 4 female patients ranging between the ages of 26 and 61 years. Headache (n = 12/17; 70.5%), diplopia (n = 10/17; 58.8%), impaired vision (n = 9/17; 52.9%), and aplasia or hypoplasia of the transverse sinus were seen in these patients.
   ConclusionAlthough very rare, this potential complication after unilateral IJV ligation should be kept in mind. Magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) is the investigation of choice to ascertain the underlying etiology. Conservative management should be started immediately. Surgical options are reserved for patients with progressive symptoms. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016 (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:E2475-E2478, 2016

AB  - Evaluation of brain cluster activation using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was sought in strabismic amblyopes. In this hospital-based case-control cross-sectional study, fMRI and DTI were conducted in strabismic amblyopes before initiation of any therapy and after visual recovery following the administration of occlusion therapy. FMRI was performed in 10 strabismic amblyopic subjects (baseline group) and in 5 left strabismic amblyopic children post-occlusion therapy after two-line visual improvement. Ten age-matched healthy children with right ocular dominance formed control group. Structural and functional MRI was carried out on 1.5T MR scanner. The visual task consisted of 8 Hz flickering checkerboard with red dot and occasional green dot. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was analyzed using statistical parametric mapping and DTI on NordicIce (NordicNeuroLab) softwares. Reduced occipital activation was elicited when viewing with the amblyopic eye in amblyopes. An 'ipsilateral to viewing eye' pattern of calcarine BOLD activation was observed in controls and left amblyopes. Activation of cortical areas associated with visual processing differed in relation to the viewing eye. Following visual recovery on occlusion therapy, enhanced activity in bilateral hemispheres in striate as well as extrastriate regions when viewing with either eye was seen. Improvement in visual acuity following occlusion therapy correlates with hemodynamic activity in amblyopes.

AB  - AimsSebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) is a malignancy associated with the pilosebaceous unit, and occurs at ocular or non-ocular sites. Cyclooxygenases (COXs) are enzymes that are crucial for lipid metabolism. COX-2 is overexpressed in various cancers, and its inhibition by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is known to reduce the risk of many cancers. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)- is a transcription factor involved in adipogenesis. PPAR- is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of malignant tumours, including colon carcinoma. The aim of this study was to explore the status of COX-2 and PPAR- as prognostic markers in human eyelid SGC.
   Methods and resultsThe immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 and PPAR- was evaluated in 31 SGC cases. Cytoplasmic expression of COX-2 was detected in 80% of the SGC cases, and nuclear expression of PPAR- in 87%. There were significant correlations of PPAR- expression with well-differentiated SGC [19/21 (90%)] and of COX-2 overexpression with reduced disease-free survival (P = 0.0441, log rank analysis). COX-2 expression [odds ratio (OR) 3.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-14.33, P = 0.046] and lymph node metastasis (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.65, P = 0.009) emerged as significant risk factors in the univariate analysis. However, COX-2 expression did not emerge as a significant independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.
   ConclusionsCOX-2 is a potential marker for identifying high-risk SGC patients. Expression of PPAR- in eyelid SGC cases reflects terminal sebaceous differentiation. Inhibitors of COX-2 signalling and PPAR- agonists are both prospective novel therapeutic targets in the management of eyelid SGC patients.

AB  - AimsPrimary skull bone tumors, benign or malignant, are rare, and include a vast repertoire of lesions. These tumors are not reported systematically in the literature, with most studies being on individual entities or as single case reports.
   MethodsPrimary bone tumors diagnosed over a period of 12 years were retrieved, histological diagnoses reviewed, and clinical parameters noted.
   ResultsWe identified 125 primary skull bone tumors. The mean age at diagnosis was 32 years (range: 2-65 years). Majority of patients were adults (82.4%); male preponderance was noted (72.8%). Malignant tumors were more frequent than benign tumors. Most common malignant tumor was chordoma (n=37), while most common benign tumor was osteoma (n=7). Tumors were most frequently located at the skull base, of which clivus was most common location. Chordomas accounted for majority of clival tumors, while chondrosarcoma predominated at other skull base locations. Benign tumors were extremely rare in skull base. Tumors of the vault bones were infrequent; with chondrosarcoma and osteoma being the most common malignant and benign tumors, respectively.
   ConclusionsThis is the largest series of primary skull bone tumors from India. Documentation of such a series will aid in approaching differential diagnosis of skull tumors in a systematic manner.

AB  - Incidence of back pain among children and adolescents is gradually increasing. Children undergo extensive diagnostic workup that ultimately results in a nonconfirmative diagnosis. A good history and clinical examination can, to a large extent help differentiate non-specific from organic causes of backache. Diagnostic workup may be initiated if symptoms are severe and/or persistant. The authors review some of the common causes of back pain in pediatric population, clinical presentations, and the relevant investigations along with their management.

AB  - Objective: To describe women who attended two delivery huts in rural Haryana, India. Methods: The present observational study assessed routinely collected service provision data from two delivery huts located at primary health centers in the district of Faridabad. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, prenatal care, use of free transport services, and maternal and neonatal indicators at delivery were assessed for all pregnant women who used the delivery hut services from January 2012 to June 2014. Results: During the study period, 1796 deliveries occurred at the delivery huts. The mean age of the mothers was 23.3 +/- 3.3 years (95% confidence interval 23.1-23.5). Of 1648 mothers for whom data were available, 1039 (63.0%) had travelled less than 5 km to the delivery hut. The proportion of mothers who belonged to a lower caste increased from 31.0% (193/622) in 2012 to 41.1% (162/394) in 2014. The proportion of mothers who were illiterate also increased, from 8.1% (53/651) in 2012 to 26.4% (104/394) in 2014. Conclusion: Belonging to a disadvantaged social group (in terms of caste or education) was not an obstacle to use of delivery hut services. The delivery huts might have satisfied some unmet needs of community members in rural India. (C) 2016 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Two-component systems, comprising histidine kinases and response regulators, empower bacteria to sense and adapt to diverse environmental stresses. Some histidine kinases are bifunctional; their phosphorylation (kinase) and dephosphorylation (phosphatase) activities toward their cognate response regulators permit the rapid reversal of genetic responses to an environmental stimulus. DevR-DevS/DosR-DosS is one of the best-characterized two-component systems of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The kinase function of DevS is activated by gaseous stress signals, including hypoxia, resulting in the induction of similar to 48-genes DevR dormancy regulon. Regulon expression is tightly controlled and lack of expression in aerobic Mtb cultures is ascribed to the absence of phosphorylated DevR. Here we show that DevS is a bifunctional sensor and possesses a robust phosphatase activity toward DevR. We used site-specific mutagenesis to generate substitutions in conserved residues in the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer domain of DevS and determined their role in kinase/phosphatase functions. In vitro and in vivo experiments, including a novel in vivo phosphatase assay, collectively establish that these conserved residues are critical for regulating kinase/phosphatase functions. Our findings establish DevS phosphatase function as an effective control mechanism to block aerobic expression of the DevR dormancy regulon. Asp-396 is essential for both kinase and phosphatase functions, whereas Gln-400 is critical for phosphatase function. The positive and negative functions perform opposing roles in DevS: the kinase function triggers regulon induction under hypoxia, whereas its phosphatase function prevents expression under aerobic conditions. A finely tuned balance in these opposing activities calibrates the dormancy regulon response output.

AB  - Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) predisposes to accelerated atherosclerosis that is measured by carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Information on the association of these parameters with dyslipidemia in pre-dialysis pediatric CKD is limited.
   Eighty patients aged 9.9 +/- 3.2 years, with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 38.8 +/- 10.8 ml/1.73 m(2)/min, and 42 pediatric controls underwent cross-sectional analysis of lipid profile, cIMT, and brachial artery FMD. Significant differences in these parameters between patients and controls were analyzed using Student's t test. Predictors of cIMT and dyslipidemia were assessed using linear and logistic regression respectively.
   Patients had elevated blood levels of triglyceride and of total and LDL cholesterol than controls (P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001); 73.8 % were dyslipidemic. Mean cIMT was higher (0.421 +/- 0.054 mm vs 0.388 +/- 0.036 mm, P = 0.001) and brachial artery FMD was reduced (10.6 +/- 4.9 % vs 18.9 +/- 4.1 %, P < 0.0001) in patients compared with controls. On multivariate analysis, hypertension (OR 3.68, P = 0.044) and male gender (OR 10.21, P = 0.004) were associated with dyslipidemia; cIMT was significantly associated with LDL cholesterol (beta = 28.36, P = 0.033).
   Dyslipidemia was prevalent and cIMT significantly elevated in pre-dialysis pediatric CKD, indicating increased cardiovascular risk. Elevated LDL cholesterol predicted increased cIMT, strengthening the association between dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in early CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a common disorder with a worldwide distribution, although the prevalence among different ethnicities varies. We aimed to measure the prevalence of duodenal villous atrophy among patients of different ethnicities throughout the United States.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of all patients who had duodenal biopsies submitted to a national pathology laboratory between January 2, 2008 and April 30, 2015. The prevalence of villous atrophy was calculated for the following ethnicities by using a previously published algorithm based on patient names: North Indian, South Indian, East Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Jewish, and other Americans.
   RESULTS: Among all patients (n = 454,885), the median age was 53 years, and 66% were female. The overall prevalence of celiac disease was 1.74%. Compared with other Americans (n = 380,163; celiac disease prevalence, 1.83%), celiac disease prevalence was lower in patients of South Indian (n = 177, 0%; P = .08), East Asian (n = 4700, 0.15%; P <= .0001), and Hispanic (n = 31,491, 1.06%; P <= .0001) ethnicities. Celiac disease was more common in patients from the Punjab region (n = 617, 3.08%) than in patients from North India (n = 1195, 1.51%; P =.02). The prevalence of celiac disease among patients of Jewish (n = 17,806, 1.80%; P = .78) and Middle Eastern (n = 1903, 1.52%; P = .33) ethnicities was similar to that of other Americans. Among Jewish individuals (n = 17,806), the prevalence of celiac disease was 1.83% in Ashkenazi persons (n = 16,440) and 1.39% in Sephardic persons (n = 1366; P = .24).
   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing duodenal biopsy, individuals from the Punjab region of India constitute the ethnic group in the United States with the highest prevalence of villous atrophy consistent with celiac disease. Compared with other Americans, villous atrophy prevalence on duodenal biopsy is significantly lower among U.S. residents of South Indian, East Asian, and Hispanic ancestry.

AB  - Introduction: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients are at high risk of loco-regional recurrence and despite the improvement in treatment strategy, 5-year survival rates are about 50%. Identification of patients at high risk of recurrence may enable rigorous personalized post-treatment management In an earlier proteomics study we observed overexpression of End Binding Protein (EB1) in OSCC. In the present study we investigated the diagnostic and prognostic significance of alterations in expression of EB1 in oral cancer.
   Methods: In this retrospective study, the expression of EB1 protein was evaluated in 259 OSCCs, 41 dysplasia, 166 hyperplasia and 126 normal tissues using immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinical-pathological parameters and prognosis of OSCC patients over a follow-up period of up to 91 months.
   Results: Significantly higher expression of cytoplasmic EB1 was observed in hyperplasia [p < 0.001, OR = 7.2,95% CI = 4.1-12.8], dysplasia (p < 0.001, OR = 21.8, Cl = 8.8-502) and OSCCs (p< 0.001, OR = 10.1, Cl = 5.8-17.4) in comparison with normal mucosa. Univariate analysis revealed cytoplasmic EB1 association with tumor grade, tumor size and recurrence of the disease. Kaplan Meier survival analysis of EB1 expression showed significantly reduced disease free survival (DFS) (p = 0.003). Notably, OSCC patients showing cytoplasmic EB1 overexpression demonstrated significantly reduced DFS (p = 0.004, HR = 2.1).
   Conclusion: EBI overexpression is an early event in oral tumorigenesis and cytoplasmic EB1 accumulation is associated with poor prognosis and tumor recurrence in OSCC patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the study was to correlate multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) grading with clinical severity and outcome in liver trauma patients without significant extrahepatic injury. Over a period of 2 years (2011-2013), all patients showing evidence of liver injury on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) abdomen and without significant extrahepatic trauma were prospectively included in the study. Correlation between the CT injury grade and outcome in terms of mortality, duration of ICU/hospital stay, fluid and blood requirements, need for intervention and complications were assessed. The significance of the difference in mortality, duration of ICU/hospital stay, fluid requirement and blood requirements among the patients with various injury grades was assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test. The significance of the difference in need for intervention and complications among the patients with various injury grades was assessed by Fisher's exact test. A total of 198 patients were found to have evidence of hepatic injury on CECT. Out of 198 patients, 117 had insignificant extrahepatic trauma. The overall mean age for these 117 patients was 25.74 +/- 15.53 (age range 2-84 years). Death rates according to AAST grades were 0 % in grades II and III, 6.89 % in grade IV and 9.09 % in grade V (p = 0.053). The mean ICU and total hospital stay for grade II was 1.32 and 5.91 days, for grade III was 1.76 and 8.48, for grade IV was 2.86 and 10.31 days and for grade V was 6.54 and 12 days, respectively (p = 0.0001 for ICU, p = 0.0003 for total stay). Mean input and fluid deficit according to various grades were 8634/2607 ml for grade II, 9535/2555 ml for grade III, 15,549/6242 ml for grade IV and 19,958/8280 ml for grade V (p value input-0.0016, output-input (fluid deficit)-0.0001). Average unit of RBC and sum of the blood products transfused were 1.73 and 2.26 for grade II, 2.18 and 2.72 for grade III, 3.03 and 6.27 for grade IV, 6.85 and 38.12 for grade V, respectively (p value RBC-0.10, total-0.037). The difference in the need of active surgical/endovascular intervention and complication rates was not significantly higher in higher injury grades. The grading of liver injury based on CECT findings can predict the clinical course in liver trauma patients with insignificant extrahepatic injuries.

AB  - Background: The efficacy of particulate and non-particulate steroids in patients receiving epidural steroid injections remains unclear.
   Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of particulate and non-particulate steroids in patients receiving epidural injections for radicular pain over 3 months.
   Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: We reviewed PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, Central Register of Clinical Trials of the Cochrane Collaboration, Google Scholar, and Directory of open access journals for trials that compared efficacy of particulate steroid with non-particulate. A meta-analysis was performed on treatment related to mean change in visual analogue score (VAS) between the particulate and non-particulate steroids. Two authors independently reviewed the data for inclusion. Results: Seven studies comprising 3,542 patients in the particulate group and 856 patients in the non-particulate group were included. Pooled mean maximum change of VAS was higher by 0.53 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.92; P = 0.007; I2 = 50.2%) in the particulate group compared to the non-particulate group. The non-particulate group had a larger proportion of patients with more than 50% pain relief than the particulate group [OR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.97, P = 0.024).
   Limitations: Limited number of trials that fit the inclusion criteria and were available for analysis.
   Conclusions: As the use of particulate steroids seems to be associated with slightly better VAS scores only, clinicians need to weigh their clinical relevance in the light of complications and recent FDA recommendations on the use of particulate steroids.

AB  - Cisplatin, a platinum compound, is used as a first-line agent against various forms of solid cancers. Nephrotoxicity is an important adverse effect of cisplatin therapy, which involves increased oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. It is well known that the bioactive compounds present in green tea are used to treat various disorders due to their biological activities. With this background, the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of epicatechin gallate (ECG), a green tea polyphenol, in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. To achieve this, ECG (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) was administered to male albino Wistar rats for the period of 10 days. On the 7th day, a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (8 mg/kg) was injected into rats to produce kidney injury and the animals were then killed on the 10th day. Cisplatin toxicity was associated with enhanced oxidative stress, impaired renal function along with marked tubular necrosis in Histopathology. Furthermore, cisplatin activated the MAPK pathway, which contributed to inflammation and apoptosis in the kidney of treated rats. In contrast, ECG (5 mg/kg) pretreatment normalized cisplatin-induced oxidative stress, renal function, and histopathological changes. ECG also prevented the activation of the MAPK pathway, and attenuated inflammation and apoptosis in rats. These findings suggest that ECG prevented cisplatin-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis by downregulating the MAPK pathway and resulted in improved renal function.

AB  - Background: Ten to 15% of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of celiac disease (CeD) patients develop CeD. Although intestinal barrier functions (intestinal permeability) are abnormal in the subset of serology-negative FDRs, what leads to the abnormal barrier function is not known.
   Goals: To study the ultrastructure and functions of tight junctions in serology-negative FDRs of CeD patients.
   Study: The intestinal permeability was measured in 97 asymptomatic and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG Ab)negative FDRs (using the lactulose mannitol ratio) and in 75 controls. The ultrastructure of tight junctions using transmission electron microscopy, and the expression of key tight junction proteins (claudin-2, claudin-3, occludin, JAM-A, and ZO-1) and zonulin using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were assessed in anti-tTG Ab-negative, HLA-DQ2/-DQ8-positive FDRs having normal villi and in disease controls. In addition, the serum zonulin level was measured in 172 anti-tTG Ab-negative FDRs and 198 controls.
   Results: The intestinal permeability was significantly increased in FDRs than in controls. Ultrastructural abnormalities such as dilatation of the tight junction (P=0.004) and loss of the pentalaminar structure (P=0.001) were more common in FDRs than in disease controls. There was significant underexpression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 (P=0.040) and occludin (P=0.041) in FDRs. There was no significant difference in the serum zonulin level between FDRs and controls (P=0.154).
   Conclusions: Even asymptomatic, anti-tTG-Ab-negative FDRs with a normal villous histology have both ultrastructural and functional abnormalities in tight junctions. These findings are indirect evidence of the presence of tight junction abnormalities before the onset of the disease and may have therapeutic implications.

AB  - Low parasitemic condition in malaria remains a diagnostic challenge; as the available diagnostic methods failed to detect. Currently, hemozoin (Hz) pigment is gaining attention in the diagnosis of malaria. The major drawback is ease of detection of Hz in routine practice. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the role of Hz pigment and to compare the performance of quantitative buffy coat assay (QBC) and PCR in such conditions. Clinically suspected cases of malaria were examined by both Giemsa stain and immunochromatographic test (ICT). Samples positive by ICT and negative by Giemsa stain were further examined by nested PCR targeting 18S rRNA and QBC for the presence of malaria parasites and pigments. Thirty blood samples fulfilled the inclusion criteria out of which 23 were Plasmodium vivax (Pv), 4 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), and 3 mixed (Pv and Pf) by immunochromatographic test. Twenty-one out of 30 (70%) were positive by nested PCR in comparison to 25/30 (83%) by QBC. Samples containing both malaria parasites and Hz pigment by QBC completely showed concordance with the PCR result. However, 61% of total samples containing only Hz pigment were observed positive by PCR. Hz pigment remains an important tool for malaria diagnosis. Identification of leukocytes containing pigments by QBC not only indicates recent malarial infections but also puts light on severity of the disease. QBC assay is a rapid, highly sensitive, and cost-effective method to detect malaria parasites and Hz pigment especially in low parasitemic conditions.

AB  - Introduction: This study provides vital insight in assessing anchorage loss when miniscrews are indirectly loaded. Methods: The study sample comprised 18 patients with bimaxillary protrusion (14 girls, 4 boys; mean age, 17.3 +/- 4.6 years) selected from a database of 89 patients treated with miniscrews. All subjects who were selected required extraction of all first premolars and maximum anchorage. After initial leveling and aligning, miniscrews were placed between the first molar and the second premolar in all 4 quadrants and loaded by the indirect method at 3 weeks after placement with 200-g nickel-titanium alloy closed-coil springs for en-masse retraction. Mean treatment duration was 29.7 +/- 6.8 months. Pretreatment and posttreatment lateral cephalograms were analyzed to measure the amount of anchorage loss, incisor retraction, and the incisors' angular change in reference to the pterygoid vertical reference line and were evaluated by the structural superimposition method. Results: The ratio of incisor retraction to molar protraction was 4.2 in the maxilla and 4.7 in the mandible. The first molars showed mean extrusion of 0.20 mm in the maxilla and 0.57 mm in the mandible; these were statistically insignificant. The mean angular change of the first molars was -2.43 degrees in the maxilla and -0.03 degrees in the mandible. The mean anchorage loss in reference to the pterygoid vertical was 1.3 mm in the maxilla and 1.1 mm in the mandible; these were statistically significant. Structural superimpositions showed mean change in molar position of 0.83 mm in the maxilla and 0.87 mm in the mandible, and 5.77 mm in the maxillary incisor and 5.43 mm in the mandibular incisor. These results were compared with the direct anchorage method reported in the literature. Conclusions: Indirect miniscrew anchorage can be a viable alternative to direct anchorage.

AB  - ObjectiveRadioiodine, in low doses, has been used as a treatment modality for hyperthyroidism worldwide for a long time. However, there is little information available on the severity of cytotoxicity of radioiodine at these low doses. The present investigation aimed to study the cytogenetic toxicity of low-dose radioiodine in hyperthyroid patients using a cytokinesis-blocked micronuclei (MN) assay.Materials and methodologyAll of the patients received radioiodine in the form of sodium iodine (oral form). Blood samples of these patients were collected before therapy and 3 months after therapy, and lymphocytes were analysed for MN assay.ResultsPeripheral blood lymphocytes were analysed in 74 hyperthyroid patients (52 men, 22 women). The results indicated a positive relationship between age and the frequency of MN. However, there was no statistically significant difference in MN frequency at 3 months after therapy in comparison with that before therapy.ConclusionThis study showed that the cytogenetic damage produced by low-dose radioiodine was transient and reversible. Thus, patients can be motivated to undergo this safe and easy procedure as a modality of treatment for hyperthyroidism.

AB  - This study aims to establish the best and simplified panel of molecular markers for prognostic stratification of glioblastomas (GBMs). One hundred fourteen cases of GBMs were studied for IDH1, TP53, and TERT mutation by Sanger sequencing; EGFR and PDGFRA amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization; NF1expression by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); and MGMT promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR. IDH1 mutant cases had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as compared to IDH1 wild-type cases. Combinatorial assessment of MGMT and TERT emerged as independent prognostic markers, especially in the IDH1 wild-type GBMs. Thus, within the IDH1 wild-type group, cases with only MGMT methylation (group 1) had the best outcome (median PFS: 83.3 weeks; OS: not reached), whereas GBMs with only TERT mutation (group 3) had the worst outcome (PFS: 19.7 weeks; OS: 32.8 weeks). Cases with both or none of these alterations (group 2) had intermediate prognosis (PFS: 47.6 weeks; OS: 89.2 weeks). Majority of the IDH1 mutant GBMs belonged to group 1 (75%), whereas only 18.7% and 6.2% showed group 2 and 3 signatures, respectively. Interestingly, none of the other genetic alterations were significantly associated with survival in IDH1 mutant or wild-type GBMs. Based on above findings, we recommend assessment of three markers, viz., IDH1, MGMT, and TERT, for GBM prognostication in routine practice. We show for the first time that IDH1 wild-type GBMs which constitute majority of the GBMs can be effectively stratified into three distinct prognostic subgroups based on MGMT and TERT status, irrespective of other genetic alterations.

AB  - Elastance is a distinguished marker in diagnosing various arterial diseases as studies have reported carotid artery-related diseases linked with stiffness index () values greater than 5. This study was to estimate elasticity of common carotid artery by measuring the diameter during systolic and diastolic phases using pixel tracing of successive frames and blood pressure. The B-mode ultrasonography video containing arterial wall motion was captured and fragmented into image frames. Each pixel on the greyscale image was converted into RGB intensity values. The diameter of the artery as well as the thickness of the wall was measured by tracing the pixel displacements from successive frames during arterial pulsation. The study was conducted on 19 subjects aged 25-40years. The systolic and diastolic carotid artery lumen diameters and carotid intima-media thickness were calculated as 7.1 +/- 0.7, 6.3 +/- 0.6 and 0.5 +/- 0.05mm (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively. The mean stiffness index (), Peterson's modulus and Young's modulus of elasticity were 5.2 +/- 1.1, 69 +/- 15kPa and 453 +/- 99kPa, respectively. The pixel displacements in tunica intima, tunica media and tunica adventitia were not homogeneous, due to varied macro-constituents such as endothelial tissues, smooth muscle cells, elastin lamina, fibrous tissue and micro-constituents such as collagen, fibroblast and elastin. We found that women have smaller arteries, and the stiffness increased during the systolic phase.

AB  - Medulloblastoma (MB) with melanotic and myogenic differentiation, previously known as melanotic medullomyoblastoma, is an extremely rare histological variant of MB showing melanocytic as well as skeletal muscle differentiation. Only 10 cases of this rare tumor have been reported in the literature to date. We report this case of a 2-year-old male child who presented with a midline cerebellar mass, which on histopathological examination showed classic MB intermixed with cells containing melanin pigment, along with rhabdomyoblasts, spindle cells and occasional strap cells, which corresponded to WNT subgroup on molecular classification. The cell of origin of this MB variant is likely to be neural crest-derived stem cells which are capable of multilineage differentiation. Significant findings from previous reports and important differential diagnoses are discussed. Documentation of these tumors is important to characterize the clinical behaviour and to identify distinct genetic features, if any.

AB  - Cerebral malaria is a well-known complication of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Over recent years, however, Plasmodium vivax also has been reported to cause cerebral malaria with or without co-infection with P. falciparum. Here, we report a boy aged 10 years presenting with acute febrile encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure to the emergency, who was later diagnosed to have P. vivax malaria. His neurological status improved gradually during 6 weeks of pediatric intensive care unit stay. We report this case to highlight the unusual radiologic findings in the patient, such as multifocal hemorrhagic infarcts in the brainstem, bilateral thalami, frontal cortex and basal ganglia, which have not been reported with P. vivax malaria.

AB  - This review addresses the effectiveness and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, the current status of its introduction in the National Immunization Programmes (NIPs) and its relevance to India, which contributes a fifth of the global burden of cervical cancer. The vast literature on efficacy, acceptability and safety of HPV vaccination and its impact after population level introduction was reviewed and discussed. The efficacy of HPV vaccines in preventing high-grade precancerous lesions caused by vaccine-targeted HPV infections was 90 per cent or higher in HPV nave women in randomized clinical trials. Two doses at 6 or 12 months apart are recommended for 9-14 yr old girls and three doses over six months to one year period for those aged above 15 yr. More than 80 countries or territories have introduced HPV vaccination in their NIPs, of which 33 are low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); in addition, 25 LMICs have introduced pilot programmes before a phased national expansion. Significant reductions in the frequency of HPV 16 and 18 infections, genital warts and cervical premalignant lesions in vaccinated cohorts and herd immunity in general populations have been reported from countries that introduced vaccination in NIPs as early as 2007. More than 280 million doses of HPV vaccines have been administered worldwide with the excellent safety profile with no serious adverse events linked to it. The high burden of cervical cancer and the high efficacy and safety of HPV vaccination justify its introduction in the Indian NIP at the earliest possibility to substantially reduce the cervical cancer burden in future.

AB  - Objective: To test the correlation of the serum erythropoietin levels, serum transferrrin receptor levels and serum ferritin levels along with other hematological parameters in normal pregnant and anemic pregnant patients.
   Study Design: In a prospective study, 120 pregnant women were recruited between 18 and 36 weeks of gestation; 53 normal pregnant patients, 67 anemic pregnant patients, in which, 17 had mild, 30 had moderate anemia, 20 had severe anemia. A blood sample was taken. The various hematological parameters, hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin, percentage saturation of iron, serum erythropoietin (SEPO) levels, serum transferrin receptors (STfRS) were performed. For statistics, Student's 't.' test, Pearson's Chi test, Mann Whitney test and Bartlett test were used as per data.
   Results and Conclusion: MCV was significantly reduced in anemic pregnancies as compared to non anemic pregnancies (80.2 +/- 9.6 vs 94.12 +/- 9.8 fl, p = 0.001), MCHC was also reduced in them (30.2 +/- 3.38% vs 34.2 +/- 2.33%, p = 0.176), TIBC was significantly increased in anemic pregnancies (343.31 +/- 28.54% vs 322.88 +/- 23.84%, p = 0.001), serum ferritin was significantly reduced (24.9 +/- 10.48 mu g/L vs 31.03 +/- 9.98 mu g/L, p = 0.001), percentage saturation of iron was also reduced (53.85 +/- 13.21% vs 62.04 +/- 15.79%, p = 0.0024), serum erythropoietin levels were significantly higher in anemic women (26.24 +/- 26.61 mU/ml vs 18.12 +/- 19.08 mU/ml, p = 0.064). The levels were significantly higher in severe anemia (46.5 +/- 46.8 mU/ml ml than in moderate anemia 27.4 +/- 28.1 mU/ml and mild anemia 22.8 +/- 22.8 mU/ml. Serum transferrin receptors were significantly higher in anemic pregnancies than in non-anemic pregnancies (1.40 +/- 0.0802 mu g/ml vs 1.08 +/- 0.641 mu g/ml, p = 0.019) with rise being higher in severe anemia (2.28 +/- 0.986 mu g/ml than in moderate (1.4 +/- 0.816 mu g/ml) and mild anemia (1.16 +/- 0.702 mu g/ml).
   Conclusion: Various hematological parameters especially sTfR, serum erythropoietin, serum ferritin and sTfR/log ferritin levels correlate with the severity of anemia. ((C)) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To compare six months versus nine months anti-tuberculous therapy in patients of female genital tuberculosis.
   Study design: It was a randomized controlled trial in a tertiary referral center teaching institute on 175 women presenting with infertility and found to have female genital tuberculosis on clinical examination and investigations. Group I women (86 women) were given 9 months of intermitted anti tuberculous therapy under directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) strategy while Group II (89 women) were given 6 months of anti-tuberculous therapy under DOTS. Patients were evaluated for primary end points (complete cure, partial response, no response) and secondary end points (recurrence rate, pregnancy rate) during treatment. All patients were followed up further for one year after completion of therapy to assess recurrence of disease and further pregnancies.
   Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between two randomized groups. There was no difference in the complete clinical response rate (95.3% vs 97.7%, p = 0.441) between 9-months and 6-months groups. Four patients in 9-months group and two patients in 6-months group had recurrence of disease and required category II anti tuberculous therapy (p = 0.441). Pregnancy rate during treatment and up to one year follow up was also similar in the two groups (23.2% vs 21.3%, p = 0.762). Side effects occurred in 27(31.4%) and 29(32.6%) in 9-months and 6-months of therapy and were similar (p = 0.866).
   Conclusions: There was no difference in complete cure rate, recurrent rate and pregnancy rate for either 6-months or 9-months of intermittent directly observed treatment short course anti-tuberculous therapy in female genital tuberculosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of topical umbilical cord serum drops (UCS) and amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in acute ocular chemical burns.
   DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
   METHODS: SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. STUDY POPULATION: Forty-five eyes with acute chemical burns of grade III, IV, and V (Dua's classification) presenting within the first week of injury were randomized into 3 groups (15 each). Patients with perforation/impending corneal perforation were excluded from the study. INTERVENTION: Groups 1, 2, and 3 received UCS with medical therapy (MT), AMT with MT, and MT alone, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to complete epithelialization.
   RESULTS: The mean time to complete epithelialization was 56.7 +/- 14.9, 22.0 +/- 10.2, and 22.9 +/- 10.1 days in MT, AMT, and UCS groups, respectively, with a significant difference between MT and AMT (P = .001) and between MT and UCS (P = .001), but not between UCS and AMT (P = .9). Improvement in pain score was better with UCS than AMT (P value: .012, .002,. and .012 on days 7, 14, and 21, respectively). Corneal clarity was better in the UCS group at 21 (P = .008) and 30 days (P = .002), but not at 3 months (P = .9). By month 3, visual outcome, symblepharon, tear film status, and lid abnormalities were comparable between the 3 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: UCS and AMT, as an adjuvant to standard medical therapy in acute chemical injury, are equally efficacious. UCS has the advantage of faster improvement in corneal clarity, better pain control, and avoidance of surgery in an inflamed eye. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An 11-year old girl admitted to the psychiatry ward with a presentation of acute psychosis was diagnosed with NMDA receptor encephalitis following neurology referral and was treated accordingly. This case highlights psychiatric manifestations in encephalitis and the need for the psychiatrist to have high index of suspicion when atypical symptoms (e.g., dyskinesia, seizure, fever etc.) present in acutely psychotic patients.

AB  - Background & objectives: Various inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are available to control the symptoms of asthma. Although beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD) are one of the oldest ICSs, their wide availability and low cost make them attractive options in developing countries. Due to lack of consensus on which of the two drugs is better for controlling mild persistent asthma, we undertook this study to compare the efficacy of these two drugs by measuring the change in percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 ) from baseline in children with mild persistent asthma.
   Methods: A double-blind, randomized, parallel group study was conducted in children 7-15 yr of age with newly diagnosed asthma. Of the 85 cases of mild persistent asthma, 42 received BUD while 43 received BDP at a dose of 400 mu g/day using pressurized metered-dose inhaler with valved spacer for two months. The outcomes measured were change in FEV1 , symptom scores and side effects.
   Results: There was a significant (P < 0.05) improvement in FEV1 in BUD group (98.43 +/- 4.63%) than in BDP group (95.65 +/- 5.66%) at the end of two months of treatment. The mean symptom scores in BUD group (0.28 +/- 1.22) and BDP group (0.43 +/- 1.52) were comparable after two months. No side effects were seen in either group.
   Interpretation conclusions: FEV1 was significantly greater in BUD group than BDP group. Improvement in symptoms and incidence of side effects were similar. Our findings indicate that both BDP and BUD can be used effectively in the management of children with mild persistent asthma.

AB  - Diabetes care involves a complex interaction between patients, physicians, the health care system, and society. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the majority of individuals with diabetes live, there is a shortage of resources and infrastructure for diabetes care. Translation of proven interventions for diabetes prevention and care from experimental settings to the real world is a major challenge, and there is limited evidence from LMICs. To curtail the diabetes burden in LMICs, it is crucial to develop and execute innovative diabetes care models that improve access to care, knowledge, and outcomes. Additionally, adequate training of local health professionals and community engagement can help LMICs become self-sufficient in delivery of diabetes care. In this paper, we reviewed the existing models of diabetes care and prevention in LMICs and provided recommendations to guide the development of a comprehensive and effective future model for diabetes care in LMICs.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to enhance the proliferation of cancer cells. NADPH oxidases (NOX4) are a major intracellular source of ROS and are found to be associated with cancer and tumor cell invasion. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of NOX4 protein in human retinoblastoma.
   Immunohistochemical expression of NOX4 protein was analyzed in 109 specimens from prospective cases of retinoblastoma and then correlated with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. Western blotting confirmed and validated the immunoreactivity of NOX4 protein.
   In our study we found a male preponderance (55.9 %), and 25/109 (22.9 %) were bilateral. Massive choroidal invasion was the histopathological high-risk factor (HRF) most frequently observed, in 42.2 % of the cases. NOX4 protein was expressed in 67.88 % (74/109) of primary retinoblastoma cases and was confirmed by Western blotting. NOX4 was statistically significant with massive choroidal invasion and pathological TNM staging. There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival in patients with NOX4 expression (p = 0.0461).
   This is the first study to show the expression of NOX4 protein in retinoblastoma tumors. Hence, a retinoblastoma tumor may exhibit greater ROS stress. This protein may prove to be useful as a future therapeutic target for improving the management of retinoblastoma.

AB  - Objective: To assess the role of progesterone (P) on [human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) day]/oocyte ratio rather than a single cut-off value of serum P on hCG day to predict in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes.
   Materials and Methods: A Retrospective, single center, cohort study in 687 infertile women undergoing fresh IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment with long agonist protocol. The data was categorized into three groups according to serum P levels (Group A < 1.0, Group B: 1.0-1.5, Group C >= 1.5) and two groups on the basis of P/oocyte ratio (Group A <= 0.15; Group B > 0.15) determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC). For comparing categorical data, chi(2)/Fishers exact test was carried out as appropriate. ROC analysis was performed to determine cut-off value for P and P/oocyte, which may discriminate between pregnancy and nonpregnancy.
   Results: The mean age of participants was 31.6 +/- 3.7 years and overall pregnancy rate was 26.1%. Elevation of both serum P levels and P/oocyte ratio was found to significantly reduce the pregnancy potential in IVF without affecting fertilization and cleavage rates. The detrimental cut-off value for P and P/oocyte was found to be >1.0 ng/mL (sensitivity 56%; specificity 52%) and >0.15 (sensitivity 62%; specificity 61%) respectively. Pregnancy rate (35.3%) among the patients having <= 0.15 P/oocyte ratio was significantly higher (p < 0.001) compared with 18.8% observed among the patients having value >0.15.
   Conclusion: P/oocyte ratio may be considered as a valuable tool to predict IVF outcomes when compared with serum P levels alone, but more evidence from randomized studies is required. Copyright (C) 2016, Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The number of procedures performed in the out-of-operating room setting under sedation has increased many fold in recent years. Sedation techniques aim to achieve rapid patient turnover through the use of short-acting drugs with minimal residual side-effects (mainly propofol and opioids). Even for common procedures, the practice of sedation delivery varies widely among providers. Computer-based sedation models have the potential to assist sedation providers and offer a more consistent and safer sedation experience for patients.
   Recent findings
   Target-controlled infusions using propofol and other short-acting opioids for sedation have shown promising results in terms of increasing patient safety and allowing for more rapid wake-up times. Target-controlled infusion systems with real-time patient monitoring can titrate drug doses automatically to maintain optimal depth of sedation. The best recent example of this is the propofol-based Sedasys sedation system. Sedasys redefined individualized sedation by the addition of an automated clinical parameter that monitors depth of sedation. However, because of poor adoption and cost issues, it has been recently withdrawn by the manufacturer.
   Summary
   Present automated drug delivery systems can assist in the provision of sedation for out-of-operating room procedures but cannot substitute for anesthesia providers. Use of the available technology has the potential to improve patient outcomes, decrease provider workload, and have a long-term economic impact on anesthesia care delivery outside of the operating room.

AB  - Recent studies have observed the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). One hundred and seven sTBI patients (18-65 years old, presenting within 8 hours of injury) were randomised for a placebo controlled phase II trial of progesterone with or without hypothermia. We serially analysed blood mitochondrial enzymes (Complex I [C1], Complex IV [C4] and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [PDH]) using a dipstick assay at admission and 7 days later for 37 patients, irrespective of assigned group. Favorable Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 1 year was associated with admission Cl levels above 0.19 mu g, admission C4 levels above 0.19 mu g and day 7 C1 levels above 0.17 mu g, all per 25 mu l of blood. Unfavorable GOS at 1 year was associated with admission serum PDH levels above 0.23 mu g/25 mu l of blood. Survivors at 1 year had significantly higher admission serum C1 levels above 0.19 mu g/25 mu l and day 7 C1 levels above 0.17 mu g/25 mu l. To our knowledge this is the first clinical trial associating blood mitochondrial enzymes with long-term outcome in sTBI. Serial monitoring and optimisation of blood C1, C4 and PDH levels could aid in prognostication and potentially guide in using mitochondrial targeted therapies. Blood mitochondrial enzymatic assay might suggest global reduction-oxidation status. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Mapping of the fascicular anatomy of the brachial plexus could provide the nerve surgeon with knowledge of fascicular orientation in spinal nerves of the brachial plexus. This knowledge might improve the surgical outcome of nerve grafting in brachial plexus injuries by anastomosing related fascicles and avoiding possible axonal misrouting. The objective of this study was to map the fascicular topography in the spinal nerves of the brachial plexus.
   METHODS The entire right-sided brachial plexus of 25 adult male cadavers was dissected, including all 5 spinal nerves (C5-T1), from approximately 5 mm distal to their exit from the intervertebral foramina, to proximal 1 cm of distal branches. All spinal nerves were tagged on the cranial aspect of their circumference using 10-0 nylon suture for orientation. The fascicular dissection of the C5-T1 spinal nerves was performed under microscopic magnification. The area occupied by different nerve fascicles was then expressed as a percentage of the total cross-sectional area of a spinal nerve.
   RESULTS The localization of fascicular groups was fairly consistent in all spinal nerves. Overall, 4% of the plexus supplies the suprascapular nerve, 31% supplies the medial cord (comprising the ulnar nerve and medial root of the median nerve [MN]), 27.2% supplies the lateral cord (comprising the musculocutaneous nerve and lateral root of the MN), and 37.8% supplies the posterior cord (comprising the axillary and radial nerves).
   CONCLUSIONS The fascicular dissection and definitive anatomical localization of fascicular groups is feasible in plexal spinal nerves. The knowledge of exact fascicular location might be translatable to the operating room and can be used to anastomose related fascicles in brachial plexus surgery, thereby avoiding the possibility of axonal misrouting and improving the results of plexal reconstruction.

AB  - Background The known genetic determinants of Parkinson's disease (PD) do not explain all cases investigated to date. Contemporary sequencing technologies hold promise for enhanced causal variant discovery. We attempted to identify the putative causal variant in an Indian PD family by whole exome sequencing (WES).
   Methods WES data generated for two affected cousins from a 14-member PD family with some non-motor phenotypes were analysed. Variants prioritised were checked for segregation with disease by targeted sequencing. An independent PD cohort (n=280) was screened for additional mutations in the prioritised gene. Variants were functionally validated in PC12 cells differentiated into neurons.
   Results A heterozygous mutation c.169C>A, p.P57T in RIC3 acetylcholine receptor chaperone (11p15) segregated with disease in the family confirming an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance. Another heterozygous mutation c. 502G>C, p.V168L was detected in an unrelated PD case. Both mutations were absent in 144 healthy control and in 74 non-PD WES data available in-house and in 186 age and sex-matched controls screened by PCR sequencing. RIC3 is a known chaperone of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7 (CHRNA7). Dominant negative effect of RIC3 mutants in transfected PC12 cells was reflected by the reduced levels of endogenous CHRNA7 in the membrane fractions in western blots and lower colocalisation profiles in confocal micrographs.
   Conclusion The novel demonstration of a chaperone-mediated receptor density alteration due to RIC3 mutants provides strong evidence for the role of cholinergic pathway for the first time in PD aetiology. This may also be insightful for some non-motor symptoms and personalised treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retinal shortening with ultrasound (USG) in patients with retinal detachment (RD).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a pilot, prospective, investigative study. Ten consecutive patients undergoing surgery for total RD with anterior or posterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) graded more than grade C1 were included. Longitudinal USG B-scan was done for all patients to calculate retinal-to-choroidal length ratio (RCR). Quadrant-based RCRs and mean RCRs were calculated. All patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 months for unexplained recurrent retinal detachment.
   RESULTS: Mean duration of RD was 14.2 months and a mean of 2.8 retinal quadrants had epiretinal PVR, subretinal PVR, or both. Mean RCR was 0.81 and was the least in superior temporal quadrant. Seven patients developed recurrent RD, five at the first weekly visit. All of these patients had an RCR of less than 0.8 in at least one quadrant, whereas none of the remaining three patients had a quadrantic RCR of less than 0.8 (P =.008). Mean RCR was less than 0.8 in four of seven patients with recurrent RD (P =.2)
   CONCLUSION: Retinal shortening can be measured objectively with USG based RCRs. Low RCR in any retinal quadrant is a serious concern deserving appropriate patient counseling.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: p27 is a cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor whose presence in nucleus is associated with good prognosis. Recent studies propose that when localized to cytoplasm, it functions as an oncogene and confers a poorer prognosis. This study aimed at analysing the subcellular localization of p27 and its prognostic significance in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs).
   METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for p27 was carried out on 60 cases of OSCC (30 cases each of those with lymph node metastasis [LN+ve SCC] and without lymph node metastasis [LN-ve SCC]) and 30 normal mucosa. The relationship between p27 localization and prognosis was analysed statistically.
   RESULTS: Nuclear immunopositivity was seen in 15%, 23%, 7% and 60%, while cytoplasmic immunopositivity was seen in 80%, 63%, 97% and 43% of all SCC, LN+ve OSCC, LN-ve SCC cases and normal mucosa, respectively. There was a significant inverse correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic p27 immunopositivity (P = 0.001). Nodal status and tumour stage were the only two parameters that correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) in OSCC cases. However, in LN+ve SCC, a significantly shortened DFS was seen in cases with cytoplasmic p27 expression compared to those without (P = 0.02). Conversely, LN+ve SCC with nuclear p27 had longer DFS on comparison with those without (P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse cytoplasmic localization of p27 in OSCC and correlate with prognosis. Cytoplasmic localization is associated with poor prognosis in OSCC with lymph node metastasis allowing the consideration of cytoplasmic p27 in predicting prognosis and targeted therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the conjunctival microbial flora in cases of ocular Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) in a tertiary eye care center.
   Methods: This prospective study comprised 176 eyes of 88 patients with ocular SJS compared with 124 eyes of normal subjects. The conjunctival swabs were collected and sent for microbiological analysis for bacterial isolation and antibiotic sensitivity examination. The type of bacteria isolated and its antibiotic sensitivity pattern were studied.
   Results: Of 176 eyes, 104 (59%) had positive cultures for bacteria in cases of SJS and 16 (12.9%) had positive culture in the control group, the difference being statistically significant (P = 0.001). In the SJS group, 14 different types of bacterial isolates were identified. The most common isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (30/104, 28.8%) followed by Corynebacteria species (35/104, 33.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (19/104, 18.2%). More than 1 bacteria were isolated in 7 eyes (6.7%). Most of the isolates showed resistance to ciprofloxacin with no resistance to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. In the control group, only 2 bacteria were isolated, which included CNS (14/16, 87.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2/16, 12.5%). CNS showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, and S. pneumoniae was resistant to tobramycin and gentamycin.
   Conclusions: Ocular SJS is associated with alteration of the normal microbial flora residing in the conjunctival sac. The study of which is vital in cases of infection in these eyes with compromised ocular surface. Mixed flora are seen more often in cases of ocular SJS as compared with controls.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) as a susceptibility locus for the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), which is characterized by exaggerated Th2/Th17 response. Studies have shown that vitamin A (VA) reduces disease progression by promoting FOXP3 T cells and curbing Th17 cells. In this study, we explored the association of colonic IL-23R and FOXP3 expression in fifty-one UC patients (23 in remission and 28 with active disease) with serum VA levels and disease activity. We observed that decreased serum VA levels were associated with increased disease activity. However, there was no significant difference in mucosal IL-23R and FOXP3 expression in UC patients with moderate-to-severe disease activity compared to those in remission. Also, no significant correlation was drawn between serum VA levels and mucosal IL-23R and FOXP3 expression. Our study suggests that even after an established role of VA in inhibiting Th17 responses in mice models and humans, serum VA levels and disease activity do not correlate with FOXP3 and IL-23R expression in colonic mucosa of UC patients.

AB  - In the development of osteoarthritis, aggrecan degrades prior to cartilage destruction. Aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) is considered to be the major enzyme responsible for cleaving the Glu373-Ala374 bond in the interglobular domain of aggrecan in humans. Therefore, inhibitors of ADAMTS-4 have therapeutic potential in the treatment of osteoarthritis. In the present work, we developed a chemical feature based pharmacophore model of ADAMTS-4 inhibitors using the HipHop module within the Catalyst program package in order to elucidate the structure-activity relationship and to carry out in-silico screening. The Maybridge database was screened using Hypo1 as a 3D query, and the best-fit hits that followed Lipinski's rule of five were subsequently screened to select the compounds. The hit compounds were then docked into the active site of ADAMTS-4, and interactions were visualized to determine the potential lead molecules. After subjecting all of the hits to various screening and filtering processes, 13 compounds were finally evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory activities. This study resulted in the identification of two lead compounds with potent inhibitory effects on ADAMTS-4 activity, with IC50 values of 0.042 mu M and 0.028 mu M, respectively. These results provide insight into the pharmacophoric requirements for the development of more potent ADAMTS-4 inhibitors.

AB  - Background Timely assessment of the burden of HIV/AIDS is essential for policy setting and programme evaluation. In this report from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we provide national estimates of levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and mortality for 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015.
   Methods For countries without high-quality vital registration data, we estimated prevalence and incidence with data from antenatal care clinics and population-based seroprevalence surveys, and with assumptions by age and sex on initial CD4 distribution at infection, CD4 progression rates (probability of progression from higher to lower CD4 cell-count category), on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality, and mortality from all other causes. Our estimation strategy links the GBD 2015 assessment of all-cause mortality and estimation of incidence and prevalence so that for each draw from the uncertainty distribution all assumptions used in each step are internally consistent. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and death with GBD versions of the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum software originally developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). We used an open-source version of EPP and recoded Spectrum for speed, and used updated assumptions from systematic reviews of the literature and GBD demographic data. For countries with high-quality vital registration data, we developed the cohort incidence bias adjustment model to estimate HIV incidence and prevalence largely from the number of deaths caused by HIV recorded in cause-of-death statistics. We corrected these statistics for garbage coding and HIV misclassification.
   Findings Global HIV incidence reached its peak in 1997, at 3.3 million new infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3.1-3.4 million). Annual incidence has stayed relatively constant at about 2.6 million per year (range 2.5-2.8 million) since 2005, after a period of fast decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has been steadily increasing and reached 38.8 million (95% UI 37.6-40.4 million) in 2015. At the same time, HIV/AIDS mortality has been declining at a steady pace, from a peak of 1.8 million deaths (95% UI 1.7-1.9 million) in 2005, to 1.2 million deaths (1.1-1.3 million) in 2015. We recorded substantial heterogeneity in the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS across countries. Although many countries have experienced decreases in HIV/AIDS mortality and in annual new infections, other countries have had slowdowns or increases in rates of change in annual new infections.
   Interpretation Scale-up of ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been one of the great successes of global health in the past two decades. However, in the past decade, progress in reducing new infections has been slow, development assistance for health devoted to HIV has stagnated, and resources for health in low-income countries have grown slowly. Achievement of the new ambitious goals for HIV enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets will be challenging, and will need continued efforts from governments and international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 2030.

AB  - Background & objectives: Diarrhoea is the main clinical manifestation caused by intestinal parasitic infections in patients, with special reference to transplant recipients who require careful consideration to reduce morbidity and mortality. Further, molecular characterization of some important parasites is necessary to delineate the different modes of transmission to consider appropriate management strategies. We undertook this study to investigate the intestinal parasitic infections in transplant recipients with or without diarrhoea, and the genotypes of the isolated parasites were also determined.
   Methods: Stool samples from 38 transplant recipients comprising 29 post-renal, two liver and seven bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients presenting with diarrhoea and 50 transplant recipients (42 post-renal transplant, eight BMT) without diarrhoea were examined for the presence of intestinal parasites by light microscopy using wet mount, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining for intestinal coccidia and modified trichrome staining for microsporidia. Genotypes of Cryptosporidium species were determined by multilocus genotyping using small subunit ribosomal (SSUrRNA), Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as the target genes. Assemblage study for Giardia lamblia was performed using triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) as the target gene. Samples were also screened for bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens.
   Results: The parasites that were detected included Cryptosporidium species (21%, 8/38), Cystoisospora (Isospora) belli (8%, 3), Cyclospora cayetanensis (5%, 2), G. lamblia (11%, 4), Hymenolepis nana (11%, 4), Strongyloides stercoralis (3%, 1) and Blastocystis hominis (3%, 1). Multilocus genotyping of Cryptosporidium species at SSUrRNA, COWP and DHFR loci could detect four isolates of C. hominis; two of C. parvum, one of mixed genotype and one could not be genotyped. All the C. hominis isolates were detected in adult post-renal transplant (PRT) recipients, whereas the C. parvum isolates included a child with BMT and an adult with PRT. Clostridium difficle, cytomegalovirus and Candida albicans were found in 2, 3 and 2 patients, respectively.
   Interpretation conclusions: In the present study, C. hominis was observed as an important parasite causing intestinal infections in transplant recipients. Multilocus genotyping of Cryptosporidium species could detect four isolates of C. hominis; two of C. parvum, one of mixed genotype and one could not be genotyped. Genotyping of G. lamblia revealed that assemblage B was most common.

AB  - Liver injury is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in polytrauma patients. This study was conducted to know the burden of hepatobiliary injury and its outcome in our setup. It is a retrospective study of all patients with traumatic hepatobiliary injuries from January 2008 through April 2012 at JPNATC, New Delhi. All patients were resuscitated as per ATLS guidelines. Management of patients was based on hemodynamic status and associated injuries. Liver injury occurred in 7.52 % of all trauma admissions and 20.34 % of total abdominal trauma patients. Most common mechanism of injury was blunt trauma due to road traffic injury among all age groups (n = 234, 67.83 %). Seventy-five percent of the patients with liver injury were hemodynamically stable at presentation (n = 262, 75 %). Isolated liver injury was seen in 27 % of the patients. Grade II (n = 138, 40 %) liver injury was the most common. Of the patients, 68.70 % were managed nonoperatively. Among operatively managed patients (n = 100, 29 %), 38 % patient underwent immediate laparotomy due to hemodynamic instability. The failure of nonoperative management was in eight (2.32 %) patients with success rate of 96.73 %, i.e., 237 patients out of 245 were successfully managed nonoperatively. Packing was done in 27 % of the patients of high-grade liver injury and was associated with high morbidity and mortality (51 %). The morbidity and mortality of liver trauma were 28.99 % and 12.17 %, respectively. Liver injury is common in abdominal trauma patients. Most of the patients with liver injury are hemodynamically stable and should be managed nonoperatively with careful monitoring.

AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide both in men and women. Our recent studies have indicated an association of heat shock protein 70-2 (HSP70-2) with bladder urothelial carcinoma. In the present study, we investigated the association of HSP70-2 with various malignant properties of colorectal cancer cells and clinic-pathological features of CRC in clinical specimens.
   Methods: HSP70-2 mRNA and protein was investigated expression by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and Western blotting in CRC clinical specimens and COLO205 and HCT116 cell lines. Plasmid-based gene silencing approach was employed to study the association of HSP70-2 with various malignant properties of COLO205 and HCT116 cells in in vitro and with tumor progression in in vivo COLO205 human xenograft mice model.
   Results: HSP70-2 expression was detected in 78 % of CRC patients irrespective of various stages and grades by RT-PCR and IHC. Our analysis further revealed that HSP70-2 expression was detected in both COLO205 and HCT116 cell lines. Ablation of HSP70-2 expression resulted in reduced cellular growth, colony forming ability, migratory and invasive ability of CRC cells. In addition, ablation of HSP70-2 expression showed significant reduction in tumor growth in COLO205 human xenograft in in vivo mouse model.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our results indicate that HSP70-2 is associated with CRC clinical specimens. In addition, down regulation of HSP70-2 expression reduces cellular proliferation and tumor growth indicating that HSP70-2 may be a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment.

AB  - Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, and higher education and earnings. We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height on more than 18.6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.522.7) and 16.5 cm (13.319.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.

AB  - Objective:To determine the association of ultraearly hematoma growth (uHG) with the CT angiography (CTA) spot sign, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).Methods:We analyzed data from 231 patients enrolled in the multicenter Predicting Haematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Haemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT study. uHG was defined as baseline ICH volume/onset-to-CT time (mL/h). The spot sign was used as marker of active hemorrhage. Outcome parameters included significant hematoma expansion (>33% or >6 mL, primary outcome), rate of hematoma expansion, early neurologic deterioration, 90-day mortality, and poor outcome.Results:uHG was higher in spot sign patients (p < 0.001) and in patients scanned earlier (p < 0.001). Both uHG >4.7 mL/h (p = 0.002) and the CTA spot sign (p = 0.030) showed effects on rate of hematoma expansion but not its interaction (2-way analysis of variance, p = 0.477). uHG >4.7 mL/h improved the sensitivity of the spot sign in the prediction of significant hematoma expansion (73.9% vs 46.4%), early neurologic deterioration (67.6% vs 35.3%), 90-day mortality (81.6% vs 44.9%), and poor outcome (72.8% vs 29.8%), respectively. uHG was independently related to significant hematoma expansion (odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.10) and clinical outcomes.Conclusions:uHG is a useful predictor of hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcomes in patients with acute ICH. The combination of high uHG and the spot sign is associated with a higher rate of hematoma expansion, highlighting the need for very fast treatment in ICH patients.

AB  - The elevated level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau and phosphorylated Tau(181) (p-Tau(181)) proteins are well established hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated level of p-Tau(181) can differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative disease. However, the expression level of these proteins in serum of AD patient is not well set up. This study sought to evaluate the level of Tau and p-Tau(181) in serum of AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients for an alternative approach to establish protein-based markers by convenient way. Blood samples were collected from 39 AD patients, 37 MCI patients and 37 elderly individuals as controls. The levels of Tau and p-Tau(181) in the serum of the different groups were measured by label free real time Surface Plasmon Resonance technology by using specific antibodies, and were further confirmed by the conventional western blot method. An appropriate statistical analysis, including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), was performed. The concentrations of serum Tau and p-Tau(181) were significantly higher (p<0.00001) in AD (Tau; 47.49 +/- 9.00 ng/mu L, p-Tau(181); 0.161 +/- 0.04 ng/mu L) compared to MCI (Tau; 39.26 +/- 7.78 ng/mu L, p-Tau(181); 0.135 +/- 0.02 ng/mu L) and were further higher compared to elderly controls (Tau; 34.92 +/- 6.58 ng/mu L, p-Tau(181); 0.122 +/- 0.01 ng/mu L). A significant (p<0.0001) downhill correlation was found between Tau as well as p-Tau(181) levels with HMSE and MoCA score. This study for the first time reports the concentration of Tau and p-Tau(181) in serum of AD and MCI patients. The cutoff values of Tau and p-Tau(181) of AD and MCI patients with sensitivity and specificity reveal that serum level of these proteins can be used as a predictive marker for AD and MCI.

AB  - Background: In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) studies on brain in HIV infected patients have shown significant alteration in neuro-biochemicals.
   Methods: In this study, we measured the neuro-biochemical metabolites from the left frontal white matter (FWM) and left basal ganglia (BG) caudate head nucleus in 71 subjects that include 30 healthy controls, 20 asymptomatic HIV and 21 HIV patients with CNS lesion. Proton MR spectra were acquired at 3 T MRI system and the concentration (institutional units) of tNAA (N-acetylaspartate, NAA + N-acetylaspartylglutamate, NAAG), tCr (Creatine, Cr + phosphocreatine, PCr), choline containing compounds (tCho), glutamate + glutamine (Glx) and lipid and macromolecules at 0.9 ppm were determined using LC Model.
   Results: In BG, the concentration of tNAA (6.71 +/- 0.64) was decreased and in FWM, the concentration of Glx (20.4 +/- 7.8), tCr (9.14 +/- 3.04) and lipid and macromolecules at 0.9 ppm (8.69 +/- 2.96) were increased in HIV patients with CNS lesion. In healthy controls, the concentration of tNAA in BG was 7.31 +/- 0.47 and concentration of Glx, tCr and lipid and macromolecules in FWM were 15.0 +/- 6.06, 6.95 +/- 2.56, 5.59 +/- 1.56, respectively.
   Conclusion: Reduced tNAA in BG suggests neuronal loss in HIV patients with CNS lesion while increased Glx in FWM may suggest excito-toxicity. In addition, increased levels of tCr in FWM of HIV patients were observed. The study indicates region specific metabolic changes in tNAA, tCr and Glx in brain of HIV infected patients.

AB  - Background
   A high proportion of active trachoma infection in children of Car-Nicobar Island was reported through the Trachoma Rapid Assessment survey conducted in year 2010 by the same researchers. Annual mass drug treatment with azithromycin was administered from years 2010-12 to all individuals residing in this island for reducing the burden of active trachoma infection. A cross-sectional prevalence survey was conducted in the year 2013 to assess the post-treatment burden of trachoma in this population.
   Methods
   In the 15 randomly selected compact segments from each village of the island, children aged 1-9 years were examined for evidence of active trachoma infection and participants aged ten years and above were examined for trachomatous trichiasis and corneal opacity.
   Results
   A total of 809 children (1-9 years) and 2735 adults were examined. Coverage with azithromycin for all the three rounds was more than 80%. The prevalence of active trachoma infection in children aged 1-9 years old was 6.8% (95% CI 5.1, 8.5) and Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) was 3.9% (95% CI 3.2, 4.6). The risk factors associated with active trachoma infection were older age and unclean faces. The risk factors associated with TT were older age and lower literacy level.
   Conclusion
   Trachoma has not been eliminated from Car-Nicobar Island in accordance to 'Global Elimination of Trachoma, 2020' guidelines. Sustained efforts and continuous surveillance admixed with adequate programmatic response is imperative for elimination of trachoma in the island.

AB  - ObjectiveThiodigalactoside (TDG), a synthetic inhibitor of -galactoside-binding protein (-GBP) suppresses tumour growth by inhibiting multiple cancer enhancing activities of -GBP. Hence, we attempted to understand whether disruption of -GBP functions and indirect inhibition of T-reg cells by TDG affect the growth and establishment of oral cancer cells.
   MethodThe growth, morphology, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis induction and angiogenesis of oral cancer cell lines (SCC-4, SCC-9, SCC-25) via MACS-purified T-reg cells were performed by MTT, propidium iodide (PI) staining, annexin-V-binding assay and ELISA respectively.
   ResultsTreatment with -GBP showed growth-promoting effects on T-regs and oral cancer cells. However, the treatment with its inhibitor TDG resulted in inhibition of T-reg subsets and also decreased the frequency of IL10(+) and IL35(+) T-regs indicating its immunomodulatory effects. Additionally, TDG treatment significantly (P<0.001) inhibited the growth of OSCC cells with a concomitant induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and anti-angiogenesis.
   ConclusionIt appears that TDG concurrently prevents many tumour-promoting effects of -GBP in oral cancer cells possibly by T-reg inhibition. This offers a preclinical proof of the concept that therapeutic targeting of -GBP can overcome T-reg-mediated tumour promotion and immunosuppression in oral cancer patients.

AB  - This study is aimed at the development of a composite material for wound dressing containing nanosilver nanohydrogels (nSnH) along with Aloe vera and curcumin that promote antimicrobial nature, wound healing and infection control. Nanosliver nanohydrogels were synthesized by nanoemulsion polymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA) followed by subsequent crosslinking and silver reduction under irradiation. Both the polymerization and irradiation time had significant influence on the nanoparticle shape, size and its formation. Polyvinyl alcohol/polyethylene oxide/carboxymethyl cellulose matrix was used as gel system to blend with nSnH, A. vera, curcumin and coat it on the hydrolysed PET fabric to develop antimicrobial dressings. The cumulative release of silver from the dressing was found to be similar to 42% of the total loading after 48 h. The antimicrobial activity of the dressings was studied against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In vivo wound healing studies were carried out over a period of 16 d on full-thickness skin wounds created on Swiss albino mice. Fast healing was observed in Gel/nSnH/Aloe treated wounds with minimum scarring, as compared to other groups. The histological studies showed A. vera based dressings to be the most optimum one. These results suggest that nSnH along with A. vera based dressing material could be promising candidates for wound dressings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - REMOVAL
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and in vivo cyst lysis for intraocular cysticercosis.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the records of 15 patients undergoing PPV for intraocular cysticercosis at a tertiary eye care center was done. All patients had undergone in vivo cyst lysis. Of these 15 patients, one had intravitreal cysticercosis (IVC) with vitritis, two cases had IVC with vitritis with tractional retinal detachment (TRD), four cases had subretinal cysticercosis (SRC), four cases had SRC with extensive fibrosis without TRD, and five cases had SRC with fibrosis with TRD. Postoperative visual acuity at 3 months of follow-up was analyzed as the primary outcome measure.
   RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 26 years +/- 12.27 years. Four out of 15 patients were female. Mean preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.55 logMAR units +/- 0.62 logMAR units, whereas mean postoperative BCVA at last followup (3 months) was 1.26 logMAR units +/- 0.65 logMAR units. Mean visual gain (0.29 logMAR units) post-surgery was statistically significant (P = .018). The final visual acuity correlated with preoperative BCVA with Pearson's coefficient being 0.78 (95% CI, 0.44-0.92; P = .001). Anatomical success was achieved in 13 of 15 (87%) cases. In one case the cyst was dead and calcified and could not be removed. TRD was associated with poor visual gain.
   CONCLUSION: Intravitreal cyst lysis is a safe and successful approach for managing intraocular cysticercosis. Visual results depend on preoperative condition. TRD implicates poor visual prognoses.

AB  - Introduction: "Common epilepsies", merely explored for genetics are the most frequent, nonfamilial, sporadic cases in hospitals. Because of their much debated molecular pathology, there is a need to focus on other neuronal pathways including the existing ion channels. Methods: For this study, a total of 214 epilepsy cases of North Indian ethnicity comprising 59.81% generalized, 40.19% focal seizures, and based on epilepsy types, 17.29% idiopathic, 37.38% cryptogenic, and 45.33% symptomatic were enrolled. Additionally, 170 unrelated healthy individuals were also enrolled. Here, we hypothesize the involvement of epilepsy pathophysiology genes, that is, synaptic vesicle cycle, SVC genes (presynapse), ion channels and their functionally related genes (postsynapse). An interactive analysis was initially performed in SVC genes using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Further, in order to understand the influence of ion channels and their functionally related genes, their interaction analysis with SVC genes was also performed. Results: A significant interactive two-locus model of STX1A_rs4363087|VAMP2_rs2278637 (presynaptic genes) was observed among SVC variants in all epilepsy cases (P-1000-value = 0.054; CVC = 9/10; OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.88-4.35). Further, subgroup analysis revealed stronger interaction for the same model in cryptogenic epilepsy patients only (P-1000-value = 0.012; CVC = 10/10; OR = 4.59, 95% CI = 2.57-8.22). However, interactive analysis of presynaptic and postsynaptic genes did not show any significant association. Conclusions: Significant synergistic interaction of SVC genes revealed the possible functional relatedness of presynapse with pathophysiology of cryptogenic epilepsy. Further, to establish the clinical utility of the results, replication in a large and similar phenotypic group of patients is warranted.

AB  - Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in retinoblastoma survivors was assessed using parent proxy report of PedsQLTM 4.0 generic core scale. One hundred twenty-two parents of retinoblastoma survivors filled the questionnaire satisfactorily. This was compared with parent-reported HRQOL of 50 siblings. The median age of survivors was 98 (range, 60-247) months and male: female ratio was 2:1. The overall parent-reported HRQOL was significantly worse in survivors as compared to controls (74.4 +/- 8.5 vs. 85.1 +/- 4.6, P < 0.001). All health domains were significantly affected when compared with controls. None of the baseline and treatment-related factors predicted HRQOL. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Pain is one of the most common, distressing and feared symptom among cancer and other patients in need of palliative care. An estimated 25% of cancer patients and 25 million people die in pain each year. Effective pain and symptom management are the core elements of palliative care which aims at reducing suffering and improving quality of life (QOL) throughout the course of illness starting from diagnosis, in sync with curative treatments and at end of life. There is a prevailing shortage of manpower apt to deal with pain and providing cost-effective palliative care and with the rise of cancer, other chronic diseases and explosion of new life-prolonging therapeutic modalities, this 'Patient-pain and palliative physician' discrepancy is only going to increase, more so in developing countries. The need of the hour is to train all healthcare physicians and nurses especially those working in the field of chronic pain in principles of effective pain and symptom palliation, to integrate cancer pain and symptom management into existing pain management fellowships and to introduce a holistic pain and palliative care model at all levels of healthcare system. Simultaneously, of equal importance is to conduct research, evidence building and formulate policies and guidelines for meticulous symptom management among the diverse category of patients and diseases so as to have a personalized and individualistic approach to patient management. In this comprehensive review, we have pondered upon the need, advantages, barriers and recommendations to achieve ideal 'Integrated pain and palliative medicine' services, their equitable implementation and delivery to 'whomsoever in need of them'.

AB  - Purpose of reviewMicrobial keratitis is one of the leading causes of ocular morbidity. The standard treatment consists of antibiotics, which is intensive and is fraught with risks of antibiotic resistance. Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) has recently been advocated as an adjunctive therapy for management of microbial keratitis. The addition of CXL to ongoing antimicrobial treatment can have a potential effect on overall duration of the disease, need for corneal transplantation, final visual outcome, and long-term impact on drug resistance pattern.Recent findingsCXL has been used in cases with bacterial, fungal as well as amoebic keratitis. However, so far the reported results have been variable and the evidence is largely anecdotal. The debate over the safety and efficacy of this modality continues especially with regards to its utilization in early phases of the disease when the corneal involvement is limited to the anterior stroma.SummaryCXL appears to be a promising adjunctive treatment in selective cases of mild to moderate bacterial keratitis. Its efficacy in fungal and amoebic keratitis is questionable. Treatment protocols in microbial keratitis need to be individualized. Long-term, prospective, randomized trials are needed to determine its usefulness in microbial keratitis.

AB  - Purpose: To prospectively study the clinical outcome and regression patterns of early retinoblastoma (Groups A and B) after systemic chemotherapy and focal consolidation in Indian children. Materials and Methods: Group A eyes were treated with focal therapy (transpupillary thermotherapy/cryotherapy) and Group B with systemic chemoreduction and focal therapy. Outcome measures were efficacy and safety of treatment, risk factors for treatment failure, regression patterns, and factors predictive of regression patterns. Results: Of 119 eyes (216 tumors), 14 (11.8%) were Group A and 105 (88.2%) were Group B eyes. The mean follow-up was 22.6 months. Tumor control was achieved in 111/119 eyes (93.3% overall, 100% Group A, 92.4% Group B). Eight Group B eyes (6.7%) had treatment failure. No serious systemic side-effects were noted. Risk factors for failure included larger tumors (P = 0.001) and proximity to posterior pole (P = 0.014). Regression patterns were Type 4 (50.2%), Type 3 (31.7%), Type 1 (11.1%), and Type 2 (7%). Factors predictive of Type 4 regression were smaller tumors, anterior location, younger age; Type 3 regression was associated with larger tumors, macular location, and older age. Conclusions: Systemic chemoreduction and focal therapy provided effective tumor control in Indian children. Factors predictive of regression patterns included age, tumor size and its location, and the modality of treatment.

AB  - Objective To ascertain the growth and endocrinal disturbances associated with Pediatric Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH).
   Methods Retrospective analysis of hospital records of subjects with LCH, aged 1 mo to 18 y was performed. The diagnosis of LCH was made as per Histiocyte Society criteria. Subjects were classified as group A: multifocal bone disease; B: soft tissue involvement without organ dysfunction; and C: organ dysfunction and treated as per DAL-HX-83 protocol of the Histiocyte Society LCH treatment guidelines. Paired t-test was used to compare the baseline and follow-up data.
   Results Total 62 records (group A-18, B-32 and C-12) were identifiedwith median follow-up of 5.3 +/- 3.3 y. Growth failure [measured as weight/height Standard deviation score (SDS) <=-2] was the commonest disorder seen in 27 (44 %) subjects. Central Diabetes Insipidus (DI) was seen in 12 (19 %) subjects. Subjects with group C of LCH had poorer weight and height at baseline and follow-up than subjects with group A or B. Height SDS were lower in subjects with concomitant DI than those without DI at baseline (-2.35 +/- 1.9 and -1.69 +/- 1.4; P 0.18). Subjects with DI did not show significant catch-up in their height (P 0.12) unlike those without DI who showed a catch-up in height (P 0.03) on follow-up.
   Conclusions Growth monitoring and screening for DI should be essential part of follow-up in all subjects with LCH.

AB  - Introduction: Neurologists in their clinical practice are faced with inquiries about the suitability of stem cell approaches by patients with a variety of acute and chronic (namely neurodegenerative) disorders. The challenge is to provide these patients with accurate information about the scope of stem cell use as well as at the same time, empowering patients with the capacity to make an autonomous decision regarding the use of stem cells. Methods: The Indian Academy of Neurology commissioned an Expert Group Meeting to formulate an advisory to practicing neurologists to counsel patients seeking information and advice about stem cell approaches. Results and Conclusions: In the course of such counselling, it should be emphasized that the information provided by many lay websites might be unsubstantiated. Besides, standard recommendations for the stem cell research, in particular, the application of several layers of oversight should be strictly adhered in order to ensure safety and ethical use of stem cells in neurological disorders.

AB  - A 30-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of erosive stomatitis and bullous lesions, along with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain. She was found to have a retroperitoneal lump in left lumbar region. Skin biopsy revealed bullous disorder. CT guided biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass was suggestive of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). She was started on oral steroids and supportive care, and surgery was being planned when she developed respiratory failure. CT chest revealed vertebral metastases. PET/CT for whole body work up revealed a left para-aortic mass along with multiple skeletal metastases. The patient was kept on conservative management. After 3 months, the patient has shown clinical improvement, and an exploratory laparotomy is now being planned for the excision of the tumor, followed by chemotherapy. This case of retroperitoneal IMT is rare in terms of skeletal metastases with paraneoplastic pemphigus. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder that demonstrates ethnic and regional differences. To assess the phenotypic variability among Indian PCOS women, we evaluated clinical, biochemical and hormonal parameters of these women being followed in two tertiary care institutions located in Delhi and Srinagar. A total of 299 (210 PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam 2003 criteria and 89 healthy) women underwent estimation of T4, TSH, LH, FSH, total testosterone, prolactin, cortisol, 17OHP, and lipid profile, in addition to post OGTT, C-peptide, insulin, and glucose measurements. Among women with PCOS, mean age, age of menarche, height, systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and serum LH were comparable. PCOS women from Delhi had significantly higher BMI (26.995.38 versus 24.77 +/- 4.32kg/m(2); P=0.01), glucose intolerance (36 versus 10%), insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR (4.20 +/- 3.39 versus 3.01 +/- 2.6; P=0.006) and QUICKI (0.140 +/- 0.013 versus 0.147 +/- 0.015; P=0.03) while PCOS from Srinagar had higher FG score (12.12 +/- 3.91 versus 10.32 +/- 2.22; P=0.01) and serum total testosterone levels (0.65 +/- 0.69 versus 0.86 +/- 0.41ng/ml; P=0.01. Two clear phenotypes, i.e. obese hyperinsulinaemic dysglycemic women from Delhi and lean hyperandrogenic women from Srinagar are emerging. This is the first report on North Indian women with PCOS showing phenotypic differences in clinical, biochemical and hormonal parameters despite being in the same region.

TI  - Mortality among homeless women who remain unclaimed after death: An insight
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Some homeless people remain unclaimed after death. Although women constitute a minor proportion among the homeless, they represent a more vulnerable section. We reviewed the major autopsy characteristics and causes of death among women whose bodies remained unclaimed after death.
   Methods. We analysed the autopsy records and inquest papers of unclaimed bodies of women for the period 200612 at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.
   Results. Most women whose bodies were unclaimed were 21 to 60 years old with a mean age of 45 years. Natural events (53.5%), largely attributable to acute/chronic lung diseases, were identified as the most common cause of death. Accidental deaths were predominant among the unnatural causes. Most bodies of women were found on the footpath besides the road (56.1%).
   Conclusion. The problems of physical/sexual abuse, acute chest infections and road traffic accidents are all aggravated in the situation of homelessness. More affordable shelters are needed to preferentially accommodate women. Also, awareness about the existing medical facilities needs to be increased.

AB  - We report the case of a 13-year-old girl presenting with left-sided hemiparesis, altered sensorium and episodic headache with bouts of projectile vomiting. Imaging revealed a large heterodense intraventricular mass lesion displaying focal calcification and hyperintensity on T1- and T2- weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance images suggesting the presence of intratumoral fat. Histologically, the tumour showed sheets of glial cells, focal perithelial rosettes and individual cells showing fat vacuoles. The morphological impression was of an ependymoma with lipomatous differentiation. Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry revealed positivity in the cytoplasmic processes of the tumour cells as well as in the cytoplasmic rim of the cells having an adipocytic appearance. S100 and vimentin were also immunoreactive. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the ependymal differentiation of the tumour and the presence of an osmiophilic fat component confirming the diagnosis. After 1 year of follow-up, the patient presented with similar complaints and MRI evidence of recurrence of the tumour. A comprehensive literature review revealed that half of the reported cases of this pattern recurred suggesting a possibly tenacious clinical course.

AB  - Motor vehicle crashes (MVC's) commonly results in life threating thoracic and abdominal injuries. Finite element models are becoming an important tool in analyzing automotive related injuries to soft tissues. Establishment of accurate material models including tissue tolerance limits is critical for accurate injury evaluation. The diaphragm is the most important skeletal muscle for respiration having a bi-domed structure, separating the thoracic cavity from abdominal cavity. Traumatic rupture of the diaphragm is a potentially serious injury which presents in different forms depending upon the mechanisms of the causative trauma. A major step to gain insight into the mechanism of traumatic rupture of diaphragm is to understand the high rate failure properties of diaphragm tissue. Thus, the main objective of this study was to estimate the mechanical and failure properties of human diaphragm at strain rates associated with blunt thoracic and abdominal trauma. A total of 23 uniaxial tensile tests were performed at various strain rates ranging from 0.001-200 s(-1) in order to characterize the mechanical and failure properties on human diaphragm tissue. Each specimen was tested to failure at one of the four strain rates (0.001 s(-1), 65 s(-1), and 130 s(-1), 190 s(-1)) to investigate the effects of strain rate dependency. High speed video and markers placed on the grippers were used to measure the gripper to gripper displacement. Engineering stresses reported in the study is calculated from the ratio of force measured and initial cross sectional area whereas engineering strain is calculated from the ratio of the elongation to the undeformed length (gauge length) of the specimen. The results of this study showed that the diaphragm tissues is rate dependent with higher strain rate tests giving higher failure stress and higher failure strains. The failure stress for all tests ranged from 1.17 MPa to 4.1 MPa and failure strain ranged from 12.15% to 24.62%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to retrospectively collect and then describe the clinico-radiographical profile of confirmed cases of leukodystrophy who presented over a 5-year period to a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India. Materials and Methods: The case records of 80 confirmed cases of leukodystrophy were reviewed and the cases have been described in terms of their clinical presentation and neuroimaging findings. Results: The cases have been grouped into five categories: Hypomyelinating, demyelinating, disorders with vacuolization, cystic, and miscellaneous. The commonest leukodystrophies are megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). A notable proportion of hypomyelinating disorders were uncharacterized. Conclusions: Leukodystrophies at this point of time have no definite cure. They have a progressively downhill clinical course. Early diagnosis is imperative for appropriate genetic counseling. A simplified approach to diagnose common leukodystrophies has also been provided. It is important to develop a registry, which can provide valuable epidemiological data to prioritize research in this field, which has many unanswered questions.

AB  - To evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional cephalometric measurements obtained through an automatic landmark detection algorithm compared to those obtained through manual identification.
   The study demonstrates a comparison of 51 cephalometric measurements (28 linear, 16 angles and 7 ratios) on 30 CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) images. The analysis was performed to compare measurements based on 21 cephalometric landmarks detected automatically and those identified manually by three observers.
   Inter-observer ICC for each landmark was found to be excellent () among three observers. The unpaired t-test revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in the measurements based on automatically detected and manually identified landmarks. The difference between the manual and automatic observation for each measurement was reported as an error. The highest mean error in the linear and angular measurements was found to be 2.63 mm ( distance) and (-Me angle), respectively. The highest mean error in the group of distance ratios was 0.03 (for N-Me/N-ANS and ).
   Cephalometric measurements computed from automatic detection of landmarks on 3D CBCT image were as accurate as those computed from manual identification.

AB  - Aims: The goal of this study was to identify mutations in the propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha subunit (PCCA) and propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta subunit (PCCB) genes, and to assess their effects on propionic academia (PA) patients. Methodology: Twenty-five Indian children with PA were enrolled in this study. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing was performed on both the coding and flanking regions of the PCCA and PCCB genes and the chromatograms were analyzed. Bioinformatic tools were used to classify novel variations into pathogenic or benign. Results: The majority of the cases (19/25, 76%) were of the early-onset (<90 days of age) type and 5 were of the late-onset type. The majority of patients had mutations in the PCCA gene (18/25). A total of 26 mutations were noted: 20 in the PCCA gene and 6 in PCCB gene. Seventeen mutations were novel (14 in PCCA and 3 in PCCB). The SNP c.937C> T (p.Arg313Ter), was noted in 9/36 (25%) alleles in the PCCA gene. All of the children were symptomatic and only three survived who are doing well with no major disabilities. Conclusion: The spectrum of mutations in the PCCA and PCCB genes among Indians is distinct from other populations. The absence of a common mutation signifies the heterogeneity and admixture of various subpopulations. These findings also suggest that individuals of Indian origin may not benefit from the mutation-based "carrier screening panels" offered by many genetic laboratories.
