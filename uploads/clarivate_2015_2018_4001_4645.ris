AB  - BackgroundMultiple ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are difficult to close. In this report, we describe a simple and safe technique of closing multiple muscular and apical VSDs.
   MethodsBetween January 2010 and December 2013, 52 patients with a muscular VSD either in isolation or in association with other congenital heart disease underwent surgery using this technique in which a black silk thread was passed through the suspected VSD opening into the left ventricle and brought out through the mitral valve and the interatrial septum. Sutures were placed around the silk thread to close the VSD.
   ResultsOut of 52 patients, 34 were male; age ranged from 45 days to 5.5 years. In addition to the large subaortic/lage muscular VSD, three additional VSDs were present in 34 patients, two additional VSDs were present in 13 patients, and five patients had Swiss Cheese septum. The VSDs were mid-muscular in 35 patients and were apical in 17 patients. Eleven patients had associated complex lesions. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms did not reveal any significant residual shunt in any of these patients. There was no step-up on oximetry. There was one hospital death due to sepsis. Follow-up was available in 48 patients; three patients were lost to follow-up. At follow-up, no patient had a residual VSD.
   ConclusionThe biventricular approach through trans-right atrial, trans-interatrial septum using a thread through the hole method for closing multiple muscular VSD is effective with no persistent residual defects. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12590 (J Card Surg 2015;30:731-734)

AB  - Background In rural areas in China and India, the cardiovascular disease burden is high but economic and healthcare resources are limited. This study (the Simplified Cardiovascular Management Study [SimCard]) aims to develop and evaluate a simplified cardiovascular management program delivered by community health workers with the aid of a smartphone-based electronic decision support system.
   Methods and Results The SimCard study was a yearlong cluster-randomized, controlled trial conducted in 47 villages (27 in China and 20 in India). Recruited for the study were 2086 individuals with high cardiovascular risk (aged 40 years with self-reported history of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and/or measured systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg). Participants in the intervention villages were managed by community health workers through an Android-powered app on a monthly basis focusing on 2 medication use and 2 lifestyle modifications. In comparison with the control group, the intervention group had a 25.5% (P<0.001) higher net increase in the primary outcome of the proportion of patient-reported antihypertensive medication use pre- and post-intervention. There were also significant differences in certain secondary outcomes: aspirin use (net difference: 17.1%; P<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (-2.7 mmHg; P=0.04). However, no significant changes were observed in the lifestyle factors. The intervention was culturally tailored, and country-specific results revealed important differences between the regions.
   Conclusions The results indicate that the simplified cardiovascular management program improved quality of primary care and clinical outcomes in resource-poor settings in China and India. Larger trials in more places are needed to ascertain the potential impacts on mortality and morbidity outcomes.

AB  - Short-term intensive insulin therapy is unique amongst therapies for type 2 diabetes because it offers the potential to preserve and improve beta-cell function without additional pharmacological treatment. On the basis of clinical experience and the promising results of a series of studies in newly diagnosed patients, mostly in Asian populations, an expert workshop was convened to assess the available evidence and the potential application of short-term intensive insulin therapy should it be advocated for inclusion in clinical practice. Participants included primary care physicians and endocrinologists. We endorse the concept of short-term intensive insulin therapy as an option for some patients with type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis and have identified the following six areas where additional knowledge could help clarify optimal use in clinical practice: (1) generalizability to primary care, (2) target population and biomarkers, (3) follow-up treatment, (4) education of patients and providers, (5) relevance of ethnicity, and (6) health economics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of combined delayed cord clamping and umbilical cord milking to either of them had done alone, on hematological parameters at 6 weeks of age in term neonates.
   STUDY DESIGN: It was a randomized controlled trial, conducted during January to December 2014. Three hundred eligible neonates were randomly allocated to three parallel groups. Primary outcome was hemoglobin and serum ferritin at 6 weeks of age. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis test.
   RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and hemodynamic parameters were comparable in all the three groups. The median serum ferritin level at 6 weeks was significantly higher in the group receiving both delayed cord clamping and milking the cut cord group (295.49 (233.5 to 346.54) ng ml(-1)) as compared with the group that received only milking of the cut cord (184.55 (131.22 to 256.5) ng ml(-1)) or only delayed cord clamping (268.8 (189.4 to 315.44) ng ml(-1)).
   CONCLUSION: Delayed cord clamping with milking the cut cord improved iron stores at 6 weeks of age in term infants, then either of the two interventions alone.

AB  - Background: Post-transcriptional regulation by heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) is an important regulatory paradigm in cancer development. Our proteomic analysis revealed hnRNPD overexpression in oral dysplasia as compared with normal mucosa; its role in oral carcinogenesis remains unknown. Here in we determined the hnRNPD associated protein networks and its clinical significance in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
   Methods: Immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the binding partners of hnRNPD in oral cancer cell lines. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was carried out to unravel the protein interaction networks associated with hnRNPD and key interactions were confirmed by co-IP-western blotting. hnRNPD expression was analyzed in 183 OSCCs, 44 oral dysplasia and 106 normal tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlated with clinico-pathological parameters and follow up data over a period of 91 months. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox-multivariate-regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of hnRNPD in OSCC.
   Results: We identified 345 binding partners of hnRNPD in oral cancer cells. IPA unraveled novel protein-protein interaction networks associated with hnRNPD and suggested its involvement in multiple cellular processes: DNA repair, replication, chromatin remodeling, cellular proliferation, RNA splicing and stability, thereby directing the fate of oral cancer cells. Protein-protein interactions of hnRNPD with 14-3-3 xi, hnRNPK and S100A9 were confirmed using co-IP-western blotting. IHC analysis showed significant overexpression of nuclear hnRNPD in oral dysplasia [p = 0.001, Odds ratio (OR) = 5.1, 95 % CI = 2.1-11.1) and OSCCs (p = 0.001, OR = 8.1, 95 % CI = 4.5-14.4) in comparison with normal mucosa. OSCC patients showing nuclear hnRNPD overexpression had significantly reduced recurrence free survival [p = 0.026, Hazard ratio = 1.95, 95 % CI = 1.0-3.5] by Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox-multivariate-regression analyses and has potential to define a high-risk subgroup among OSCC patients with nodal negative disease.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest novel functions of hnRNPD in cellular proliferation and survival, besides RNA splicing and stability in oral cancer. Association of nuclear hnRNPD with poor prognosis in OSCC patients taken together with its associated protein networks in oral cancer warrant future studies designed to explore its potential as a plausible novel target for molecular therapeutics.

AB  - Background: Insulinomas, which are rare tumors causing hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia are usually sporadic but may also occur in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome an autosomal dominant disorder caused by MEN1 gene mutations. MEN1 encodes a nuclear protein Menin, a tumor suppressor which acts as an adapter and interacts with partner proteins involved in crucial activities like transcriptional regulation, cell division, proliferation and genome stability.
   This study reports on clinical findings and mutation screening in sporadic insulinoma patients.
   Methods: Seventeen patients diagnosed with insulinoma were recruited along with 30 healthy volunteers who acted as controls for the present study. The patients presented with symptoms of sweating, tremors, drowsiness, palpitations, loss of consciousness, abnormal behavior, seizures and weight gain. Detailed clinical and family history was collected from all the participants along with 5 ml of blood sample after taking informed consent.
   Genomic DNA isolated from blood was subjected to MEN1 gene amplification followed by direct sequencing. Nucleotide sequences obtained were compared with published MEN1 cDNA sequences. Prediction of functional effects of novel changes was done using various bioinformatics algorithms.
   Results: Molecular analysis revealed presence of three novel exonic mutations (M561K, Q192K and Q261Q), two novel intronic variations c.445-44G -> A and c.913-42G -> C in introns two and six respectively and three reported exon SNPs; H433H (rs540012), D418D (rs2071313), A541T (rs2959656) and one intronic SNP (rs669976).
   Conclusions: The study identified presence of novel pathogenic MEN1 mutations in sporadic cases of insulinoma. The new mutations identified were in regions involved in defective binding of menin to proteins implicated in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The outcome of the study extends the growing list of MEN1 pathogenic mutations even in sporadic cases providing consequential insight into phenotypic heterogeneity and in the expression of individual mutations.

AB  - Background: Studies from developed countries document the presence of injecting drug use among females and significantly higher vulnerabilities and risks as compared with male injecting drug users (IDUs). Studies comparing vulnerabilities and drug use patterns between female and male IDUs are not available for developing countries. Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the drug use pattern and related HIV vulnerabilities among female IDUs and compare these findings with those from male IDUs from four states of Northeast India. Method: The study used data collected as part of a nationwide study of drug use pattern and related HIV vulnerabilities among IDUs. Ninety-eight female and 202 male IDUs accessing services from harm reduction sites across the four states of Northeast region of India were chosen through random sampling methodology. Drug use pattern, injecting practices, and knowledge of HIV were assessed using a structured questionnaire. Results: Significantly higher proportion of female IDUs was uneducated, unemployed, reported their occupation as sex workers, and switched to injecting drug use faster as compared with male IDUs. Female IDUs practicing sex work differed significantly from those who did not with respect to frequency of daily injections, choice of drugs injected, and concomitant use of non-injecting drugs. More than half of female IDUs initiated sharing within the first month of injecting. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that female IDUs differ from male IDUs in their drug use pattern, initiation into injection as well as injecting behavior, which would be an important consideration during designing of female-specific interventions.

AB  - Background Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013.
   Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries.
   Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2.4 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537.6 million in 1990 to 764.8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114.87 per 1000 people to 110.31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21.1% in 1990 to 31.2% in 2013.
   Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries.

AB  - E3 ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of several key regulators of cell cycle. Owing to their pleotropic behavior, E3 ubiquitin ligases are tightly regulated both at transcriptional and post-translational levels. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRUSS (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated ubiquitous scaffolding and signaling protein) which negatively regulates c-Myc, are found down-regulated in most human cancer cell lines. However, the mechanism of regulation of intracellular levels of TRUSS remains elusive. Here we show that TRUSS is expressed majorly during the G1 phase of cell cycle and its level starts to decline with the expression of S-phase specific E3 ligase Skp2. Enforced expression of Skp2 led to a marked increase in the ubiquitination of TRUSS after its phosphorylation by GSK3 and followed by rapid proteolytic degradation. Our co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested a direct interaction between Skp2 and TRUSS through the LRR motif of Skp2. Interestingly, the human tumor samples that exhibited elevated expression of Skp2, showed relatively poor expression of TRUSS. Further, enforced expression of HBx, the oncoprotein of Hepatitis B virus which is known to stabilize c-Myc and enhance its oncogenic potential, led to the intracellular accumulation of TRUSS as well as c-Myc. Apparently, HBx also interacted with TRUSS which negatively impacted the TRUSS-c-Myc and TRUSS-Skp2 interactions leading to stabilization of TRUSS. Thus, the present study suggests that TRUSS is a novel substrate of E3 ligase Skp2 and that disruption of TRUSS-Skp2 interaction by viral oncoproteins could lead to pathophysiological sequelae.

AB  - AIM: To describe a new surgical technique for managing dislocated sclerotic cataractous lens.
   METHODS: Six patients with advanced posteriorly dislocated cataracts were operated at a tertiary care centre and analyzed retrospectively. After standard 3 port 23 G pars plana vitrectomy and perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) injection, the dislocated white cataract was held with occlusion using phaco fragmatome and then chopped into smaller pieces with a sharp tipped chopper using 25 G chandelier endoilluminator. Each piece was emulsified individually. Following aspiration of PFCL, Fluid Air Exchange was done in all the cases and surgery completed uneventfully.
   RESULTS: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in all the patients was better than 6/12 after one month of follow up. No serious complications were noted till minimum 6mo of follow up.
   CONCLUSION: Four port posterior segment nucleotomy with a chandelier endoilluminator, fragmatome and a chopper appears to be a safe, easy and effective procedure for managing dislocated sclerotic cataractous nuclei. Ultrasonic energy used and adverse thermal effects of the fragmatome on the sclera may be lesser.

AB  - Plasmodium tryptophan-rich proteins are involved in host-parasite interaction and thus potential drug/vaccine targets. Recently, we have described several P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens (PvTRAgs), including merozoite expressed PvTRAg38, from this noncultivable human malaria parasite. PvTRAg38 is highly immunogenic in humans and binds to host erythrocytes, and this binding is inhibited by the patient sera. This binding is also affected if host erythrocytes were pretreated with chymotrypsin. Here, Band 3 has been identified as the chymotrypsinsensitive erythrocyte receptor for this parasite protein. Interaction of PvTRAg38 with Band 3 has been mapped to its three different ectodomains (loops 1, 3, and 6) exposed at the surface of the erythrocyte. The binding region of PvTRAg38 to Band 3 has been mapped to its sequence, KWVQWKNDKIR-SWLSSEW, present at amino acid positions 197-214. The recombinant PvTRAg38 was able to inhibit the parasite growth in in vitro Plasmodium falciparum culture probably by competing with the ligand(s) of this heterologous parasite for the erythrocyte Band 3 receptor. In conclusion, the host-parasite interaction at the molecular level is much more complicated than known so far and should be considered during the development of anti-malarial therapeutics.

KW  - COUNT
AB  - Background: Mortality levels and patterns are significant indicators of population health, and are of importance to prioritize the goals of health systems and efficient resource allocation. We ascertained the decadal transition of mortality pattern in adult population aged 15 years and above during the years 2002-2011.
   Methods: All adult deaths aged 15 years and above during the years 2002 to 2011 were included in the study. Cause of death was ascertained by verbal autopsy tool for adults which is a validated questionnaire developed at Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). Cause and age specific mortality, and mean age at death was determined for individual years.
   Results: A total of 4,276 deaths (>= 15 years) occurred in the Ballabgarh HDSS during the years 2002 to 2011. Of these, 96.8 % deaths were investigated using verbal autopsy tool. Of total deaths investigated, 60.6 % were males. Cardiovascular diseases (19.6 %) were the leading cause of death, followed by respiratory diseases (16.5 %). In the age group of 15-59 years, the most common cause of mortality was external causes of mortality (28.9 %). Most common cause of death was senility (20.8 %) in females, whereas cardiovascular diseases were commonest cause (19.6 %) in males. Road traffic injuries contributed 6.7 % deaths in males compared to 1.5 % in females. Over the years, the proportions of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases had increased (12.6 % to 18.8 %). Mortality proportions had decreased for infectious diseases (12.1 % to 9.5 %) and respiratory diseases (24.7 % to 10.9 %). Mortality due to neoplasms remained nearly stagnant (6.6 % to 6.4 %). Mean age at death due to cardiovascular diseases and neoplasm had increased from 57 years (95 % CI: 52.2-62.9) to 62 years (95 % CI: 59.2-65.4) and 58 years (95 % CI: 53.1-63.2) to 62 years (95 % CI: 57.0-66.7), respectively, during the decade. Mean age at death had decreased for road traffic injuries and infectious diseases from 41 years (95 % CI: 31.7-50.8) to 39 years (95 % CI: 34-43.4) and 53 years (95 % CI: 48.3-58.6) to 50 years (95 % CI: 44.1-55.8), respectively over the years.
   Conclusion: Mortality surveillance using verbal autopsy tool revealed a transition in cause specific deaths from respiratory diseases to cardiovascular diseases over the decade. The apparent epidemiological transition in the community demands reorientation of healthcare priorities.

AB  - Background: Several studies reported prognostic value of biomarker in intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) but they are either preliminary observation or inadequately powered to analyse independent contribution of biomarkers over and above clinical and neuroimaging data.
   Objective: To examine whether the biomarker can significantly add to the predictive accuracy of prognosis of ICH.
   Method/design: In a multi-centric prospective cohort study, 1020 patients with ICH within 72 hours of onset are being recruited. After obtaining written informed consent from patients/proxy, venous blood sample (10 ml) is being collected and analysed for C-reactive protein (CRP) level, S100B, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Troponin, change in leukocyte count and Copeptin levels. The patients are telephonically followed using stroke scales (Barthel Index and modified Rankin Scale) at 3, 6, 12 months and 2 years after the recruitment.
   Discussion: This protocol will aim at predicting the short term or long term prognosis with the use of clinical, neuroimaging and biomarkers in order to help clinician to stratify patients for early referral or intervention.

AB  - GM1 gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLB1 gene, leading to the deficiency of the enzyme beta-D-galactosidase. In this study, we report molecular findings in 50 Asian Indian families with GM1 gangliosidosis. We sequenced all the exons and flanking intronic sequences of GLB1 gene. We identified 33 different mutations (20 novel and 13 previously reported). The novel mutations include 12 missense (p.M1?, p.E129Q p.G134R, p.L236P, p.G262E, p.L297F, p.Y331C, p.G414V, p.K493N, p.L514P, p.P597L, p.T600I), four splicing (c.246-2A>G, c.397-2A>G, c.552+1G>T, c.956-2A>G), three indels (p.R22Qfs*8, p.L24Cfs*47, p.I489Qfs*4) and one nonsense mutation (p.Q452*). Most common mutations identified in this study were c.75+2InsT (14%) and p.L337P (10%). Known mutations accounted for 67% of allele frequency in our cohort of patients, suggesting that these mutations in GLB1 are recurrent across different populations. Twenty three mutations were localized in the TIM barrel domain, beta-domain 1 and beta-domain 2. In silico sequence and structure analysis of GLB1 reveal that all the novel mutations affect the function and structure of the protein. We hereby report on the largest series of patients with GM1 gangliosidosis and the first from India. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Placental like alkaline phosphate (PLAP), an oncofetal antigen, is highly expressed in germ cell, cervical, ovarian and several other tumour types but minimally in normal tissues. The expression of a PLAP promoter based transcriptional unit following antigen mediated cell specific delivery is a possible approach for tumour targeting.
   Methods: PLAP promoter alone or in combination with NF kappa B DNA response elements was used for expressing shRNA targeting the long control region (LCR) of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 oncogenes E6 and E7 via transcriptional gene silencing in PLAP expressing cervical cancer cell lines, SiHa and CaSki. This was packaged in a Sendai virus envelope incorporating a single chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) for antibody mediated targeting. Specificity and efficacy of the shRNA was assessed by studying the heterochromatization, down regulation of the HPV-16 E6/E7 genes and subsequent effects on their targets and cell growth properties.
   Results: Reduction of HPV-16 E6 and E7 expression by TGS led to the activation of the previously suppressed target genes of p53 (PUMA and NOXA) and Rb (cyclins A2 and E). Cell death was seen only in PLAP expressing HPV-16 infected SiHa and CaSki cells but not in the HPV-18 integrated HeLa and non-PLAP CHO cells. There was reduction in the enhancer associated transcripts of the long control region (LCR) of HPV-16 E6/E7 genes. Also, an increase in the enrichment of dimethylated histone three lysine nine (H3K9Me2) and trimethylated histone three lysine twenty-seven (H3K27Me3) was observed by ChIP assay, which decreased upon trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible mechanism for the heterochromatization of the target LCR region.
   Conclusion: A combination of novel PLAP promoter and antibody based specificities has the potential for being developed as a possible therapeutic strategy for PLAP positive neoplasia.

AB  - HMGB1 is a non-histone nuclear protein which plays important role in transcription, variable, diverse and joining (VDJ) recombination, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair, etc. and its over expression is directly correlated with various human malignancies and inflammatory diseases. Because of the clear association between HMGB1 and cancer, we studied the binding of adriamycin (ADM), a well-known anticancer drug with the promoter region (-165 to -183) of hmgb1 by using a variety of spectroscopic, calorimetric techniques, and in-silico molecular modeling. Changes in UV and CD spectral characteristics (intensity and wavelength) of ADM and DNA associated with an induced peak (300nm) in CD spectrum of DNA and a high binding constant of 2.0x10(5)M(-1) suggest a strong and stable complex formation between DNA and ADM. Scatchard analysis of spectroscopic data indicate that ADM binds to DNA in a non-cooperative nature. Further the quenching of fluorescence emission of ADM and isothermal titration calorimetry of ADM in presence of DNA points out to the intercalative mode of ADM binding to DNA which is enthalpically driven with additional small entropic contribution. Results from molecular modeling, Isothermal titration calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal that ADM has no marked preference between AT vs. GC base pair in binding to DNA. Therefore, hmgb1 can be considered as a novel potential chemotherapeutic target in treating cancers associated with HMGB1 upregulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Growth rods are used to limit the progression of scoliosis without restraining the opportunity for the spine to grow. However, major complications like rod breakage, screw loosening, and altered sagittal contour have been encountered.
   OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of the magnitude of distraction forces on the T1-S1 growth, maximum von Mises stresses on the rods, sagittal contours, and load at the pedicle screw-bone interface and quantify the maximum stresses on the rod for a period of 24 months using different frequencies of distraction in a representative scoliotic spine model.
   STUDY DESIGN: A representative finite element model of a juvenile scoliotic spine was used to study the effect of magnitude and frequency of distraction on growth rods.
   METHODS: A representative scoliotic model was developed and instrumented using proximal foundation, distal foundation, and rods. Part 1: simulation steps comprised 6 months of growth under various distraction forces to analyze effects of distraction force on the biomechanics of the spine and instrument. Part 2: simulation steps comprised 24 months of growth under various intervals of distraction to analyze effects of distraction interval on the propensity of rod fracture.
   RESULTS: Part 1: an optimal distraction force exists for which the growth is sustained with minimum stress on the rod, lower loads at screw-bone interface, and unaltered sagittal contours. Part 2: the stresses on the rods were highest for 12-month distraction (2 distractions in 2 years) and lowest for 2-month distraction (12 distractions in 2 years).
   CONCLUSIONS: The data and trend suggest that as the distraction forces vary so do the effects on spinal growth. The results of this study also signify the importance of shorter distraction period in reducing the stresses on the rods. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To conduct a study on ptotic eyelids with Marcus Gunn jaw-winking ptosis operated via a technique of modified levator plication, prospective interventional case series. Ten ptotic eyelids with Marcus Gunn jaw-winking phenomenon (MGJWP) underwent modified levator plication surgery. Postoperatively, all cases were followed up for at least 6 months. Outcome parameters included amount of ptosis correction, amount of MGJWP correction, palpebral aperture height, lid lag, and lagophthalmos. The mean amount of ptosis was 4.25 +/- A 0.79 mm (range of 3-6 mm), mean amount of MGJWP was 5.10 +/- A 2.27 mm (range 2-9 mm), and the mean levator function was 8.3 +/- A 2.27 mm (range of 4-12 mm). At 6 months follow-up, good correction of ptosis was seen in nine out of ten patients. Resolution of MGJWP (a parts per thousand currency sign1 mm of excursion of upper eyelid with synkinetic mouth movement) was seen in three patients. Improvement in MGJWP (> 1 mm of excursion of upper eyelid with synkinetic mouth movement) was seen in seven patients. The mean post-operative lagophthalmos was 0.80 +/- A 0.88 mm. The modified levator plication technique was effective in the treatment of MGJWP. This modified technique of levator plication is anatomically less destructive and hence more acceptable, with the added advantages of less post-operative lagophthalmos and no lid contour defects.

AB  - The type of anti-reflux procedure to be used as an adjunct to laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy (LHCM) in Achalasia cardia is controversial. We compared Angle of His accentuation and Dor fundoplication in a randomized controlled trial.
   From May 2010 to October 2013, 62 patients undergoing LHCM were randomized to receive either Dor fundoplication (Dor group) or Angle of His accentuation (AOH group) as an anti-reflux procedure. Symptomatic outcome was evaluated using modified Mellow and Pinkas scale for dysphagia and modified DeMeester's score for regurgitation and heartburn. Achalasia-specific quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. The primary outcome was symptomatic relief and the secondary outcome was postoperative heartburn. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software.
   All the procedures were completed laparoscopically with no mortality. Morbidity was similar in the two groups (6.4 %). Median operative time was higher in Dor group (170 vs 130 min). At a median follow-up of 21 months relief of dysphagia, regurgitation, and heartburn was seen in 87, 90.3, and 90.3 % patients in Dor group versus 93.5, 96.7, and 77.4 % in AOH group patients with significant improvement in symptom scores. Improvement was similar in both groups with no statistically significant difference in the symptom scores (p = 0.48 for dysphagia, p = 0.37 for regurgitation, and p = 0.19 for heartburn). The QOL improved in both groups [62.3 to 12.3 (p = 0.02) in Dor group and 63.9-13 (p = 0.02) in AOH group] with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.96). There was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative heartburn between the two groups (p = 0.19).
   Laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy with either Angle of His accentuation or Dor fundoplication leads to similar improvement in symptoms and quality of life.

AB  - Introduction: Head and neck carcinoma is a very rare entity in pediatric age group. We here present the demography, treatment and outcome of 12 pediatric patients.
   Methodology: We retrieved the treatment charts of pediatric patients with a diagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (PHNSCC). We also retrieved the published literature of pediatric HNSCC to present the treatment modalities being delivered across institutes.
   Results: We found 12 patients registered with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Median age of the entire cohort was 17 years (Range: 8-20). Gender predilection was skewed in favor of male (male:female ratio-11:1). Oral tongue 3(25%) was the commonest sub site followed by soft palate 2(17%) gingiva 2 (17%), supra glottis larynx 2(17%) and one each of hard palate, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth (8.25% each). The most commonly employed modality of treatment was surgery in 6(50%). Radiation was used in seven cases: 7(Adjuvant-4, Radical-3). Two patients received radical chemo-radiation. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was used in two cases. Median follow up duration was 2 years (Range: 6 months to 8 years). One patient recurred 6 months post completion of radical chemo-radiation. The patient with recurrent disease had soft palate primary and had isolated local recurrence. The patient was salvaged with surgery and was disease free at the last follow up. At the last follow up all patients were surviving without disease.
   Conclusion: The treatment and survival are not much different in pediatric patients compared to adult counterpart. However, in the absence of molecular profiling it is difficult to assess the cause of development of SCC in pediatric patients. A detailed study of underlying molecular pathway will further guide the future treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pinealoblastoma is a highly malignant embryonal tumour of the pineal region affecting children and young adults. We herein intend to report the clinical features and treatment outcome of patients of pinealoblastoma treated at our institute.
   Clinical data was collected by retrospective chart review from 2003-2012. Histopathology slides were reviewed, and relevant immunohistochemistry stains were done. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analysed by Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors were done by log rank test and Cox proportional hazard regression model, respectively.
   Seventeen patients met the study criterion (male:female = 11:6). Median age at presentation was 14 years (range 4-47 years). Surgical resection was gross total in 6 (35.29 %), near-total in 2 (11.76 %), sub-total in 2 (11.76 %), and limited to biopsy in 7 (41.18 %) patients. At presentation, 4 patients had leptomeningeal dissemination. Radiation therapy was delivered in all patients-craniospinal irradiation in 15 (88.24 %), whole brain irradiation in 1 (5.88 %), and whole ventricular irradiation followed by boost in 1 (5.88 %) patient. Systemic chemotherapy (median 6 cycles) was given in 14 (82.35 %) patients. The most common regimen was a combination of carboplatin and etoposide, used in 10 (58.82 %) patients. After a median follow-up of 30.3 months (mean 32.01 months), death and disease recurrences were noted in 3 (17.65 %) and 7 (41.18 %) patients. Amongst the patients with recurrent disease, 4 had spinal drop metastases and 3 had local recurrence along with spinal drop metastases. Median OS was not reached, and estimated median RFS was noted to be 5.49 years. The actuarial rates of OS and RFS at 2 years were 85.6 and 73.1 %, respectively. On univariate analysis, age more than 8 years (P = 0.0071) and M0 stage (P = 0.0483) were significant predictors of improved RFS. Age retained significance on multivariate analysis of RFS (P = 0.02932).
   Maximal safe resection followed by craniospinal irradiation and systemic chemotherapy with 6 cycles of carboplatin-etoposide regimen is a reasonable treatment strategy in patients of pinealoblastoma more than 8 years of age in a developing nation. However, the same strategy is less effective in younger children and innovative study designs of intensification of post-operative treatment must be explored in this age group.

AB  - Although anatomic imaging to assess the precise localization of pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) is unavoidable before any surgical intervention on these tumors, functional imaging is becoming an inseparable portion of the imaging algorithm for these tumors. This review article presents applications of the most up-to-date functional imaging modalities and image-based treatment to PHEOs/PGLs patients. Functional imaging techniques provide whole-body localization (number of tumors present along with metastatic deposits) together with genetic-specific imaging approaches to PHEOs/PGLs, thus enabling highly specific and sensitive PHEO/PGL detection and delineation that now greatly impact the management of patients. Radionuclide imaging techniques also play a crucial role in the prediction of possible radioactive treatment options for PHEO/PGL. In contrast to previous imaging algorithms used for either assessement of these patients or their follow-up, endocrinologists, surgeons, oncologists, pediatricians, and other specialists require functional imaging before any therapeutic plan is outlined to the patient, and follow-up, especially in patients with metastatic disease, is based on the periodic use of functional imaging, often reducing or substituting for anatomical imaging. In similar specific indications, this will be further powered by using PET/MR in the assessment of these tumors. In the near future, it is expected that PHEO/PGL patients will benefit even more from an assessement of the functional characteristics of these tumors and new imaging-based treatment options. Finally, due to the use of new targeting moieties, gene-targeted radiotherapeutics and nanobodies-based theranostic approaches are expected to become a reality in the near future.

AB  - The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and their candidate genes are principally involved in regulation of blood pressure through salt-water homeostasis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) are the important RAAS mediators, play a major role in hypertension through regulation of cardiorenal homeostasis and water-electrolytes balance, respectively.
   Present study reports the expression of ANP and CYP11B2 gene at mRNA and proteins levels in patients with essential hypertension in North Indian subjects.
   Gene expression at mRNA and protein levels was carried out by Real time PCR and Western blot, respectively. We found a significant down regulation in the ANP gene expression at mRNA (85%) and protein (72.6%) levels and significant increase in the CYP11B2 protein expression in patients as compared to controls. A significant increase in Serum creatinine (14.6%), Sodium (1.15%) and decrease in the Blood urea (8.18%) and Potassium (2.32%) levels were also observed among the patients group having higher expression (based on median delta-CT value) in comparison to the lower expression of CYP11B2 gene.
   Our results suggest that the down-regulation of ANP gene expression at mRNA and protein levels and up-regulated CYP11B2 protein expression levels may be correlated with the essential hypertension and could serve as circulating prognostic biomarkers for essential hypertension.

AB  - BackgroundThe air-Q is a new supraglottic airway device (SAD) and has been increasingly used as a primary airway device and as a conduit for tracheal intubation in children as well as in adults. This device has either performed equally or better than other SADs in children. The Ambu Aura-i is a commonly used SAD in children undergoing various short surgical procedures. However, limited literature is available evaluating the safety and efficacy of the air-Q and the Ambu Aura-i in small children. We, therefore, conducted this study to compare the clinical performance of these two airway devices in infants weighing up to 10kg. Our hypothesis is that air-Q, due to its improved and larger cuff design will yield better airway seal pressures as compared with the Ambu Aura-i.
   MethodsSixty-four ASA I-II infants weighing <10kg undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery were randomly assigned to receive either an air-Q or the Ambu Aura-i. After induction of general anesthesia (GA) and muscle relaxation, we measured oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) as the primary outcome. The secondary end points measured were time to insert, first insertion success rate, fiberoptic grade (FO) of laryngeal view and any other airway complications like trauma, laryngospasm, and desaturation.
   ResultsThe air-Q ILA provided significantly higher OLP as compared with the Ambu Aura-i [20.24.6cm H2O, CI 18.55-21.88; vs 16.2 +/- 5.6 cmH(2)O, CI 14.27-18.25, P=0.003; mean difference 4 +/- 1.29cm H2O, CI 1.41-6.58]. However, the Ambu Aura-i required significantly less time for its insertion (14.6 +/- 2.8s, CI 13.66-15.70; vs 16.3 +/- 1.5s, CI 15.75-16.86, P=0.005; mean difference 1.625 +/- 0.56s, CI 0.48-2.76). There were no differences in first insertion success rate, FO view, and postoperative complications.
   ConclusionWe conclude that air-Q may be considered superior to Ambu Aura-i in infants for controlled ventilation as it provides higher airway sealing pressures.

AB  - The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an organization of eight countries Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. The major objectives of this review are to examine trends and progress in newborn and neonatal health care in the region. A landscape analysis of the current state of neonatal mortality, stillbirths and trends over the years for each country and the effective interventions to reduce neonatal mortality and stillbirths was undertaken. A modelling exercise using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) was also undertaken to determine the impact of scaling up a set of essential interventions on neonatal mortality and stillbirths. The findings demonstrate that there is an unacceptably high and uneven burden of neonatal mortality and stillbirths in the region which together account for 39% of global neonatal deaths and 41% of global stillbirths. Progress is uneven across countries in the region, with five of the eight SAARC countries having reduced their neonatal mortality rate by more than 50% since 1990, while India (43%), Afghanistan (29%) and Pakistan (25%) have made slower progress and will not reach their MDG4 targets. The major causes of neonatal mortality are intrapartum-related deaths, preterm birth complications and sepsis which account for nearly 80% of all deaths. The LiST analysis shows that a gradual increase in coverage of proven available interventions until 2020 followed by a uniform scale-up to 90% of all interventions until 2030 could avert 52% of neonatal deaths (0.71 million), 29% of stillbirths (0.31 million) and achieve a 31% reduction in maternal deaths (0.25 million). The analysis demonstrates that the Maldives and Sri Lanka have done remarkably well while other countries need greater attention and specific focus on strategies to improve neonatal health.

AB  - Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms are rare cardiac anomalies that may be acquired or congenital. We describe the case of a patient who had an unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm causing right ventricular outflow obstruction, with an associated subaortic ventricular septal defect. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms rarely present until rupture occurs. However, the unruptured aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva caused significant right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, resulting in exertional dyspnea. Intraoperative multiplane transesophageal echocardiography and color Doppler helped in precise identification of structural anomalies, shunt location, and definitive surgical repair.

AB  - B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is a common lymphoproliferative disorder with an increased risk of developing subsequent neoplasms of epithelial and mesenchymal origin. The decreased immunity and B-cell dysfunction in CLL probably accounts for this emergence of second malignancies. We report a case of synchronous bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and prostatic carcinoma with CLL. A 74-year-old male who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostatic hyperplasia 2 years before, presented with recurrent urinary tract infection. Peripheral blood smear revealed leukocytosis with absolute lymphocytosis (absolute lymphocyte count: 37870 cells/mm(3)). Flow cytometric immunophenotyping revealed 75% abnormal lymphoid cells which were positive for CD 19, CD5, CD23, CD22, CD200, CD20 (moderate) with lambda light chain restriction and negative for CD3, CD10, FMC7, CD38, CD138, IgM, CD103, CD123. (18) F Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed increased metabolic activity of the left lateral wall of the urinary bladder extending to the left UV junction, adjacent part of trigone and bladder neck region along with multiple heterogeneous enhancing areas with increased FDG avidity within the prostate. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumour by cystoscopy was performed. Histopathology showed high grade, muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Due to presence of uptake in the prostate, transurethral resection of the prostate was done and histopathology revealed adenocarcinoma of prostate (prostate specific antigen-positive), Gleason grade III+III and Gleason score 6. A high index of suspicion is required to detect synchronous and metachronous malignancies. Ancillary studies such as immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and PET/CT are often essential for detection and an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose: To review the changing pattern of donor, corneal utilization in an eye bank at a Tertiary Care Center in Northern India by analyzing the trend in the years 2003, 2008, and 2011. Methods: A retrospective review of eye bank records for 3 years (2003, 2008, and 2011) was performed at the National Eye Bank. Details including a clinical grade of donor cornea, indication of corneal transplantation (therapeutic or optical), type of procedure (penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty [LK]), and clinical diagnosis of the graft recipients were recorded. Primary outcome measure was to observe any preference toward LK, judicious usage of donor corneal tissue, and impact of lamellar corneal transplant in the usage of donor corneas. Secondary outcomes included overall utilization rate and change in trend of indication for keratoplasty. Results: A total of 673, 745, and 864 corneas were retrieved in the years 2003, 2008, and 2011, respectively. The percentage of donor corneal utilization increased significantly over time with the rate being 65.08%, 70.06%, and 68.29%, respectively, in the years 2003, 2008, and 2011 (P = 0.014); however, this change was reflected only in the usage of nonoptical grade corneas and not for the optical grade corneas. There was an overall increase in lamellar corneal procedures for any clinical grade of cornea (P = 0.0019); number of Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) procedures increased significantly (P < 0.001), particularly for pseudophakic corneal edema (PCE) (P = 0.0085) and failed graft (P = 0.002). Significant increase in the utilization of nonoptical grade corneas was observed over the years (P = 0.005), though the utilization did not increase significantly for optical purposes viz., LK (P = 0.08). Conclusions: Utilization rate of donor corneas increased over the years, primarily due to increase in usage of nonoptical grade corneas for therapeutic purposes. There was a procedural shift toward DSAEK for PCE and failed graft. However, an increase in usage of nonoptical grade corneas for LK, a single donor corneal tissue for two recipients, and retrieval or utilization of optical grade cornea was not observed.

AB  - The bronchoscopic procedures have seen a remarkable increase in both numbers and complexity. Although many anesthesia providers have kept pace with the challenge, the practice is varied and frequently suboptimal. Shared airway during bronchoscopy poses unique challenges. The available reviews have tried to address this lacuna; however, these have frequently dealt with the technical aspects of bronchoscopy than anesthetic challenges. The present review provides evidence-based management insights into anesthesia for bronchoscopy-both flexible and rigid. A systematic approach toward pre-procedural evaluation and risk stratification is presented. The possible anatomical and physiological factors that can influence the outcomes are discussed. Pharmacological principles guiding sedation levels and appropriate selection of sedatives form the crux of safe anesthetic management. The newer and safer drugs that can have potential role in anesthesia for bronchoscopy in the near future are discussed. Ventilatory strategies during bronchoscopy for prevention of hypoxia and hypercarbia are emphasized.

AB  - Objectives To report experience of implementing universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) in a tertiary care neonatal unit, identify risk factors associated with failed two-step automated acoustic brainstem response (AABR) screen and evaluate cost of AABR.
   Methods This was a prospective study of UNHS outcomes of all live births with two step AABR using BERAphone MB11 (R). Outcome measures were screening coverage, refer, pass and lost to follow up rates and cost of AABR using micro-costing method. To identify risk factors for failed screening, authors performed multivariate logistic regression with failed two-step AABR screen as dependent variable and baseline risk factors significant on univariate analysis as predictors.
   Results Screening coverage was moderate (84 %), with 2265 of total 2700 eligible infants screened with initial AABR (mean gestation 37.2 +/- 2.3 wk; birth weight 2694 +/- 588 g; 305 received nursery care). A total of 273 of 2265 infants were "refer" on first screen. Second screen was done on 233, of which 58 were "refer". Of these, 35 underwent conventional ABR, of which 5 were diagnosed to have hearing impairment. Only 2 could get hearing aid. Overall, a total of 2197 (81.4%) infants passed, 496 (18.4%; excluding 2 deaths) were lost to follow up at various stages, and 5 (0.2 %) were diagnosed with hearing impairment, all of whom were high risk. Average cost of AABR was INR 276 per test. No factor emerged as significant on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions UNHS is feasible to implement, but significant lost to follow up and non-linkage with appropriate rehabilitation services limit its utility. Cost effectiveness of UNHS compared to high risk based screening needs to be determined.

AB  - This article defines and explains the concept of good clinical sense. It defines good clinical sense as "the presence of sensory faculties, their usage and interpretation, by which one is able to practice good clinical medicine". Good clinical sense differs from good clinical practice (GCP) and good clinical acumen. It encompasses all steps of the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic process, and encourages diligent practice of clinical medicine. Good clinical sense is integral to the practice of diabetology.

AB  - Serous ovarian cancer is the most common malignant ovarian tumour. Traditional management consists of surgical resection with postoperative chemotherapy. Currently neoadjuvant chemotherapy is offered to patients with advanced stage disease. The present study aims to analyse the histomorphological alterations in serous ovarian cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Correlation of these morphological alterations with survival is also presented here. Serous ovarian cancers from 100 advanced stage cases were included; 50 were treated with pre-surgery chemotherapy. Semi-quantitative scoring was used to grade the alterations in tumour morphology. Survival data was correlated with the final morphological score. Tumour morphology was significantly different in cases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT group) as compared to cases with upfront surgery. The CT group cases showed more fibrosis, calcification, and infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, foamy and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. The residual tumour cells had degenerative cytoplasmic changes with nuclear atypia. Patients with significant morphological response had a longer median survival, although it did not attain statistical significance in the current study. With the increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in management, the pathologist needs to be aware of the altered morphological appearance of tumour. Further studies are required to establish a grading system to assess the tissue response which can be helpful in predicting the overall therapeutic outcome and the prognosis of patients.

AB  - Information on provision of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill children from developing countries is limited. The authors describe their experience in 17 children with hypotension and acute kidney injury (AKI) with fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance managed by 20 sessions of CRRT. The median (range) age and weight were 6 y (0.75-18) and 20 kg (6.2-42), respectively. All patients were receiving inotropic agents; nine had fluid overload (19 %, range 11-34.1 %) and ten had severe AKI. Median clearance and filter-life were 2171.4 ml/1.73 m(2)/h (1730.6-4405.8) and 69.7 h (2.8-98.3), respectively. Complications were catheter flow related (n= 1), filter clotting (n= 3), hemorrhage (n= 3), hypokalemia (n= 16) and hypophosphatemia (n= 11). Eight patients (47.1 %) survived; the median PRISM III score of survivors was significantly lower than non survivors (10.5 vs. 17.0; P 0.02). Renal function recovered in the survivors emphasizing the role of this modality in managing critically ill patients.

AB  - The management of advanced gynaecological cancers remains a therapeutic challenge. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used to reduce tumour size, thus facilitating subsequent local treatment in the form of surgery or radiation. For advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, data from several non-randomized and one randomized studies indicate that neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is a reasonable approach in patients deemed inoperable. Such an approach results in optimum debulking (no visible tumour) in approximately 40% of the patients with reduced operative morbidity. Overall and progression free-survival is comparable to the group treated with primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery is associated with improved survival for women with stage IB2-IIA cervix cancer. There is a resurgence of interest for using short-course neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemo-radiation. Currently, this is being tested in randomized trials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Allium sativum is well known for its medicinal properties. The A. sativum lectin 50 (ASL50, 50 kDa) was isolated from aged A. sativum bulbs and purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 column. Agar well diffusion assay were used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of ASL50 against Candida species and bacteria then minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined. The lipid A binding to ASL50 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology with varying concentrations. Electron microscopic studies were done to see the mode of action of ASL50 on microbes. It exerted antimicrobial activity against clinical Candida isolates with aMIC of 10-40 mu g/ml and clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with a MIC of 10-80 mu g/ml. The electron microscopic study illustrates that it disrupts the cell membrane of the bacteria and cell wall of fungi. It exhibited antiproliferative activity on oral carcinoma KB cells with an IC50 of 36 mu g/ml after treatment for 48 h and induces the apoptosis of cancer cells by inducing 2.5-fold higher caspase enzyme activity than untreated cells. However, it has no cytotoxic effects towards HEK 293 cells as well as human erythrocytes even at higher concentration of ASL50. Biological properties of ASL50 may have its therapeutic significance in aiding infection and cancer treatments.

AB  - Plant seeds contain a number of proteins which play important roles in the protection and the process of germination of seeds. We have isolated and purified a 25 kDa protein from Kabuli Chana (Cicer arietinum L., Chickpea-white, CW-25). The CW-25 protein was crystallized using 0.5 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate and 20 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 6.5. The crystals of CW-25 belonged to space group P3 with unit cell dimensions, a = b = 80.5 , and c = 69.2 . The structure of CW-25 was determined using molecular replacement method and refined to an R factor of 0.152. The buried surface area between two molecules was found to be approximately 653 (2) indicating the formation of a weak homodimer. The polypeptide chain of CW-25 adopted a hemopexin-fold with four-bladed beta-propellers. The structure formed a central tunnel-like architecture. A magnesium ion was observed in the centre of the tunnel. It was located at distances varying between 2.3 and 2.7 from five oxygen atoms of which four were backbone oxygen atoms belonging to residues, Asn7, Asp65, Asp121 and Asp174 while the fifth oxygen atom, O-delta 1 was from the side chain of Asn7. The approximate length of the tunnel was 30 . Furthermore, a series of carbonyl oxygen atoms were present along the internal face of the tunnel. The diameter of the tunnel varied from 4.6 to 6.2 . The diameter and chemical environment of the tunnel clearly indicated that it might be used for the transport of various metal ions across the molecule.

TI  - Caudal bupivacaine and morphine provides effective postoperative analgesia but does not prevent hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum for major laparoscopic surgeries in children

AB  - The use of a caudal block in laparoscopic surgery in children is limited to minor procedures like inguinal hernia repair, and intravenous opioids remain the analgesic modality of choice in major laparoscopic surgery. However, a caudal block is frequently performed at our institute even for laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, we planned to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of caudal bupivacaine and morphine in major laparoscopic surgery as compared to intravenous opioids. Our hypothesis was that a single-shot caudal block would increase the duration of analgesia and minimize the hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum. After institutional ethics committee clearance, data were collected for 65 ASA I-II children aged 6 months to 12 years who underwent laparoscopic surgery in the last 14 months. Demographic, surgical, and perioperative anesthetic and analgesic data were noted and analyzed. Twenty-four children received a caudal block with 0.25 % bupivacaine (1-1.25 ml/kg) with morphine (30-50 mcg/kg). In the caudal group, the time to first analgesic request was increased (165 vs. 45 min; p = 0.00) and tachycardia response to port site incision was less observed (33 vs. 63 % children; p = 0.019). Hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum was equal in both of the groups. Single-shot caudal injection of local anesthetic with morphine reduces port site skin incision response and increases the duration of postoperative analgesia but fails to prevent hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum.

AB  - The HIV vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (Abs) display low rates of mutation in their variable regions. To determine the range of neutralization mediated by similar human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) but derived from unselected chronically HIV-1 infected subjects, we tested a panel of 66 mAbs specific to V3, CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and V2 regions. The mAbs were tested against 41 pseudoviruses, including 15 tier 1 and 26 tier 2,3 viruses, showing that the neutralization potency and breadth of anti-V3 mAbs were significantly higher than those of the anti-CD4bs and anti-V2 mAbs, and only anti-V3 mAbs were able to neutralize some tier 2, 3 viruses. The percentage of mutations in the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains varied broadly in a range from 2% to 18% and correlated moderately with the neutralization breadth of tier 2, 3 viruses. There was no correlation with neutralization of tier 1 viruses as some mAbs with low and high percentages of mutations neutralized the same number of viruses. The electrostatic interactions between anti-V3 mAbs and the charged V3 region may contribute to their neutralization because the isoelectric points of the VH CDR3 of 48 anti-V3 mAbs were inversely correlated with the neutralization breadth of tier 2, 3 viruses. The results demonstrate that infection-induced antibodies to CD4bs, V3 and V2 regions can mediate cross-clade neutralization despite low levels of mutations which can be achieved by HIV-1 vaccine-induced antibodies.

AB  - Purpose:
   To compare the efficacy of levosimendan with nitroglycerin in patients with isolated diastolic dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
   Procedure:
   Thirty patients with isolated diastolic dysfunction undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized into 2 groups receiving levosimendan or nitroglycerin infusion. The infusion was started before sternotomy and continued in the postoperative period. Perioperatively, diastolic function was serially evaluated at 3 different time points using echocardiography. N-terminal fragment of pro-B-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were measured in both the groups.
   Results:
   There was a significant improvement in diastolic function as measured by isovolumic relaxation time (P = 0.0001, P = 0.001) and deceleration time (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001) in the levosimendan group from the baseline in patients with impaired relaxation. Similarly, tissue Doppler imaging also revealed an improvement from the baseline in patients with a pseudonormal pattern (P = 0.018, P = 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in the above parameters when compared with the nitroglycerin group. The NT-proBNP levels also demonstrated a similar pattern between the 2 groups (P = 0.03, P = 0.02) when levosimendan was compared with nitroglycerin in patients with a pseudonormal pattern on echocardiography.
   Conclusions:
   Levosimendan is superior to nitroglycerin in improving diastolic function irrespective of coronary revascularization.

AB  - Children with upper airway obstruction are both unique and variable in their presentation and management, often posing a challenge to the pediatrician. Several anatomical and physiologic peculiarities make a child vulnerable to develop an obstruction of upper airways. The characteristic finding in upper airway obstruction is stridor-inspiratory, biphasic or expiratory. The etiologies vary widely throughout the age groups and according to the mode of presentation. The approach starts with suspicion, mandates careful clinical evaluation of the degree of obstruction and many a times emergency measures precede any investigation or even precise diagnosis. Maintaining an open and stable airway is of the utmost importance, often requiring a team approach of emergency physician, pediatrician, otorhinolaryngologist and pediatric pulmonologist. The commonest condition presenting with upper airway obstruction in pediatric population is viral croup. Croup is a clinical diagnosis in a febrile child, with barking cough and stridor preceded by upper respiratory infection. It is treated with systemic or inhaled steroids and nebulized epinephrine. Epiglottitis and bacterial tracheitis are acute bacterial infections of upper airways, presenting as true airway emergencies. Though the mainstay of therapy is IV antibiotics, the prime concern is maintenance of airway, which frequently requires endotracheal intubation. Rigid bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice for airway foreign bodies, a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children below 3 y of age. Airway malacias are the commonest cause of chronic stridor and are mostly managed conservatively.

AB  - AimMinimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) impairs daily functioning and health-related quality of life in chronic liver disease (CLD). Lactulose is the standard treatment but has side-effects. Probiotics have an encouraging role in MHE. The aim of the present study was to test whether probiotics are non-inferior to lactulose in improving MHE.
   MethodsPatients with CLD (n=227) were screened for MHE using neuropsychometric tests (number connection tests A and B [or figure connection tests A and B]) and/or neurophysiological test (P-300 auditory event-related potential), and 120 (53%) were diagnosed with MHE by abnormal tests. MHE patients were randomized to lactulose (30-60mL/day) or probiotic (four capsules of VSL#3; total of 450billion CFU/day) for 2 months. Response was defined as normalization of tests. Serum ammonia was measured by commercial kit.
   ResultsOf 120 patients randomized, 40 in the lactulose arm and 33 in the probiotic arm completed 2 months of intervention. MHE improved in 25 (62.5%) patients taking lactulose and 23 (69.7%) taking probiotics. The effect size of difference of improvement in MHE between lactulose and probiotic was 0.072 per per-protocol analysis and 0.040 as per intention to treat analysis (within -20% of non-inferiority margin). Serum ammonia was comparable between groups at baseline and 2 months; it decreased in patients in whom MHE improved, while increased in patients with no improvement in MHE.
   ConclusionThe probiotic VSL#3 was non-inferior to the standard therapy, lactulose in the treatment of MHE. Improvement in MHE correlated with reduction of ammonia levels.

AB  - Background & objectives: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by irreparable and irreversible loss of cardiac myocytes. Despite major advances in the management of AMI, a large number of patients are left with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which is a major determinant of short and long term morbidity and mortality. A review of 33 randomized control trials has shown varying improvement in left ventricular (LV) function in patients receiving stem cells compared to standard medical therapy. Most trials had small sample size and were underpowered. This phase III prospective, open labelled, randomized multicenteric trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy in improving the LVEF over a period of six months, after injecting a predefined dose of 5-10 x 10(8) autologous mononuclearcells (MNC) by intra-coronary route, in patients, one to three weeks post ST elevation AMI, in addition to the standard medical therapy.
   Methods: In this phase III prospective, multicentric trial 250 patients with AMI were included and randomized into stem cell therapy (SCT) and non SCT groups. All patients were followed up for six months. Patients with AMI having left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-50 per cent were included and were randomized to receive intracoronary stem cell infusion after successfully completing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
   Results: On intention-to-treat analysis the infusion of MNCs had no positive impact on LVEF improvement of >= 5 per cent. The improvement in LVEF after six months was 5.17 +/- 8.90 per cent in non SCT group and 4.82 +/- 10.32 per cent in SCT group. The adverse effects were comparable in both the groups. On post hoc analysis it was noted that the cell dose had a positive impact when infused in the dose of >= 5 X 10(8) (n=71). This benefit was noted upto three weeks post AMI. There were 38 trial deviates in the SCT group which was a limitation of the study.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Infusion of stem cells was found to have no benefit in ST elevation AMI. However, the procedure was safe. A possible benefit was seen when the predefined cell dose was administered which was noted upto three weeks post AMI, but this was not significant and needs confirmation by larger trials.

AB  - Purpose: Untreated epilepsy is a major global public health problem with more than 20 million people not being treated for an easily treatable disease. In part this is due to a lack of trained doctors. There are many more non-medical health workers than doctors and they could have an important role in diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy if they had some tools. We have previously described such a tool to distinguish epileptic episodes from other causes of altered consciousness and here present its validation in three new populations.
   Methods: The tool was presented as a phone app where the answers to 11 questions provided a probability score which indicated whether episodes might be due to epilepsy or not. It was applied either by non-medical volunteers, health workers, or inexperienced doctors to 132 patients in three separate populations in India and Nepal and compared with the "gold standard" diagnosis of a neurologist with expertise in epilepsy.
   Results: There was good agreement between the app score and the neurologists' diagnoses (weighted kappa = 75.3%). An app score of 90 or greater had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100% for diagnosing epilepsy. The app was easy to use with little training and took about 5 min to administer.
   Conclusion: A tool presented as a phone app can be used by non-medical health workers to identify episodes as epileptic or not with good accuracy. It needs to be evaluated more widely but has the potential to play a part in reducing the epilepsy treatment gap. (C) 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - CYSTIC DEGENERATION
AB  - The aim of the study was to study the clinical, radiological and histopathological characteristics of orbital schwannomas. It is a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary eye care hospital. A review of histopathological records of the orbital tumors operated between 1993 and 2011 was done. The clinical, imaging and histopathological details of cases of orbital schwannoma were analyzed. Forty-nine cases of orbital schwannomas identified. The age ranged from 8 to 65 years with a female preponderance. The median duration of symptoms was 3 years. Computed tomography findings varied from a hypodense to hyperdense lesion with nil to marked contrast enhancement. USG demonstrated a defined lesion with variable internal reflectivity. Varied proportions of Antoni A and Antoni B areas were found on histopathology of the masses. Hypodense or cystic areas on imaging significantly correlated with Antoni B areas on histopathology. Orbital schwannoma is a rare tumor. The incidence of schwannoma in our institution is 6.5 %. Variable imaging features were found. The definite diagnosis can be established on the basis of histopathological and immunohistochemical studies.

AB  - We report our initial experience to optimize neurosurgical procedures using high field strength intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (IOMRI) in 300 consecutive patients as high field strength IOMRI rapidly becomes the standard of care for neurosurgical procedures. Three sequential groups (groups A, B, C; n = 100 each) were compared with respect to time management, complications and technical difficulties to assess improvement in these parameters with experience. We observed a reduction in the number of technical difficulties (p < 0.001), time to induction (p < 0.001) and total anesthesia time (p = 0.007) in sequential groups. IOMRI was performed for neuronavigation guidance (n = 252) and intraoperative validation of extent of resection (EOR; n = 67). Performing IOMRI increased the EOR over and beyond the primary surgical attempt in 20.5% (29/141) and 18% (11/61) of patients undergoing glioma and pituitary surgery, respectively. Overall, EOR improved in 59.7% of patients undergoing IOMRI (40/67). Intraoperative tractography and real time navigation using re-uploaded IOMRI images (accounting for brain shift) helps in intraoperative planning to reduce complications. IOMRI is an asset to neurosurgeons, helping to augment the EOR, especially in glioma and pituitary surgery, with no significant increase in morbidity to the patient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ObjectiveThe correct identification of fungal organisms is important for the appropriate clinical management of patients. It becomes difficult in necrotic smears when the tissue response is not clearly discernible. It is difficult to distinguish between histoplasma and cryptococcus in severely necrotic cases, where both appear as variably sized clear refractile haloes.
   MethodsFour cases of adrenal necrotic histoplasma infection were studied and the morphology was compared with that of non-necrotic histoplasmosis and cases of cryptococcal infection. Eleven cases were analysed in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain was performed to exclude tuberculosis in necrotic smears. A clinical and serology correlation was performed where available.
   ResultsNecrotic cases of histoplasma infection revealed negative refractile clear haloes similar to those of cryptococcus. Histoplasma showed methylene blue-stained organisms in ZN stains, whereas the cryptococcus cases were negative. Similar methylene blue-stained organisms were seen in non-necrotic histoplasma infection.
   ConclusionAs a result of morphological overlap between cryptococcus and histoplasma, the distinction between the two fungi can be difficult in many cases. ZN staining appears to have a role in the differentiation of these fungi in severely necrotic cases. This observation needs to be validated on a larger number of cases with complete correlation with clinical, serology and treatment records.

AB  - Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is common in Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy of parkinsonian type (MSA-P), but the pathophysiology of OH is different in the two. We hypothesised that the baroreflex-independent sympathetic reactivity may also be different in them. To evaluate this we assessed the sympathetic vascular reactivity and the heart rate response to the standard cold pressor test (CPT) in these patients.
   The study was conducted in ten patients with PD with OH, 5 PD without OH, 13 MSA-P with OH, and 7 MSA-P without OH. Lead II ECG and finger PPG (photoplethysmography) were simultaneously acquired during a baseline period of 1 min followed by a 10 A degrees C cold exposure (1 min) of the contralateral hand (CPT). The vascular response was then evaluated by computing the pulse transit time (PTT).
   The percentage decrease in PTT during the CPT was significantly higher in patients with PD as compared to MSA-P, irrespective of the presence or absence of OH (-2.74 +/- A 0.96 vs -0.05 +/- A 0.75 %, p = 0.03; PD vs MSA-P with OH and -3.04 +/- A 0.85 vs 0.48 +/- A 1.13 %, p = 0.04; PD vs MSA-P without OH). The rise in heart rate during CPT was similar in patients with PD and MSA-P with or without OH (4.95 +/- A 1.6 vs 5.99 +/- A 1.04, p = 0.28; PD vs MSA-P with OH and 5.62 +/- A 1.31 vs 13.15 +/- A 2.89, p = 0.06; PD vs MSA-P without OH).
   Vasoconstrictor response to CPT is compromised in MSA-P as compared to PD, but the baroreflex-independent heart rate response is similar in the two.

AB  - ObjectiveThe clinical spectrum of celiac disease (CeD) is wide and its symptoms overlap with those of functional bowel diseases. This study aimed to investigate the relationship among gluten-related disorders, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and uninvestigated dyspepsia in Indian patients.
   MethodsPatients with IBS and uninvestigated dyspepsia (using Rome III criteria) were tested for immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody and anti-gliadin antibody (AGA). Those with positive anti-tTG antibody were evaluated for the presence of villous abnormalities. Patients who were only IgA AGA-positive were considered to have gluten sensitivity and those with positive anti-tTG antibody and villous atrophy were considered to have CeD.
   ResultsOf 362 patients with IBS, 22 (6.1%) had positive anti-tTG antibody, among whom 3 (0.8%) had CeD and 19 had potential CeD. Of 358 patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia, 18 (5.0%) were anti-tTG antibody-positive and among them 4 (1.1%) had CeD and 14 had potential CeD. AGA was positive in 104 (28.7%) patients with IBS and 68 (19.0%) with uninvestigated dyspepsia, suggesting the presence of gluten sensitivity.
   ConclusionThis study highlights the relationship between IBS or dyspepsia and CeD or gluten sensitivity.

AB  - Purpose:To describe the role of multiplanar reconstruction and three-dimensional volume-rendered imaging in the assessment of silicon-based scleral buckle (SB)-related complications.Methods:Five eyes of five patients with SB-related complications where the history, surgical notes, and clinical examination proved inconclusive were included. Unenhanced axial orbital computed tomography images of all patients were acquired parallel to orbitomeatal line, and images were reviewed in orthogonal planes. The volume rendition of the imaged volume was evaluated in various tilts, with special reference to the spatial relationship of the band-buckle to the globe and bony orbit. All patients underwent imaging-assisted SB removal.Results:Imaging assisted in in vivo localization of the obscure band or buckle in all five eyes. Band was seen as hyperdense structure encircling whole of the globe, whereas buckle was seen as segmental, broad, hyperdense structure with scleral indentation. Presence of SB was identified in three patients, and globe integrity was shown in the other two. Abnormal anterior displacement of band and buckle was demonstrated in three cases on volume-rendered imaging in relation to lateral orbital rim. Focal exuberant soft-tissue proliferation around the buckle was present in all patients, suggesting chronic inflammation and infection. Successful removal of band and buckle could be achieved, and all patients were relieved of their preoperative complaints. No complication occurred during intraoperative and postoperative period.Conclusion:Use of multiplanar reconstruction and three-dimensional volume-rendered computed tomography imaging played a pivotal role in surgical success.

AB  - Experience with male cloaca (MC), a single opening in perineum for passage of urine and meconeum is described.
   Cases of MC were ambispectively studied, prospectively from July 2007 to April 2015 and retrospectively for last three decades.
   Seven cases of MC were identified, between the ages of newborn-4 years (median 10 days). Two missed cases underwent a colostomy, posterior sagittal anorectoplasty, and urethroplasty. Two cases underwent perineal urethrostomy and anoplasty followed by urethroplasty. In one case, part of the rectal wall was used to form urethral tube and urethrostomy. For three recent cases, posterior sagittal anorectourethroplasty was done with mobilization of rectal pouch and common channel, separation of common wall between the urethra and rectum, urethroplasty varying from 1.5 to 3 cm, perineal body reconstruction, perineal urethrostomy and anoplasty. Follow-up of 6 patients varied from 3 months to 23 years. One case is lost to follow-up. Three patients have completed repair. Complications included a discharging sinus and a urethral fistula in one case each. One patient died while awaiting urethroplasty. Two patients are awaiting formal urethroplasty.
   With familiarity of varying anatomy of MC, early recognition can avoid a neonatal colostomy in selected patients.

AB  - Congenital pouch colon (CPC) was analysed for anatomical variations and surgical options.
   Records of CPC patients managed between 1999 and 2014 were studied. CPC was classified as complete (CCPC) and incomplete (ICPC) pouch.
   Of 400 cases of high anorectal malformations, 68 cases were CPC (17 %). Male:female ratio was 2:1. Fistulous communication was colovesical, colocloacal, colovaginal and absent in 42, 15, 8 and 3 cases. ICPC and CCPC was 48 (70 %) and 20 (30 %). In neonatal period, proximal/end colostomy (31), ileostomy (6), pouch excision with abdominoperineal pull-through (18 cases) and coloplasty with end colostomy (7) were done. 6 presented as infants including 3 referred cases of CCPC with a window colostomy. Definitive surgery was completed in 56. Severe colonic dilatation after coloplasty was noted in 5, requiring excision of coloplasty segment in 2. Histopathology of excised pouch (45) showed muscle layer disorganization, widened sub mucosa, prominent vasculature and mature and immature ganglion cells, with no hypertrophy of nerve fibres. Diarrhoea and faecal incontinence (soiling) were more frequent in patients with CCPC versus ICPC. Six neonates with CCPC died. Six are awaiting definitive surgery.
   CPC had 8.8 % neonatal mortality. Pouch excision and definitive procedure are feasible in neonates with CPC. Coloplasty in CCPC may result in postoperative colonic dilatation.

AB  - Objectives: Molecular genotyping profiles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) provide a valuable insight into the evolution and transmission of the bacilli. Due to the lack of comprehensive national level data from India on this subject, we performed this study to determine the recent trends and distribution of various MTB lineages circulating in India.
   Methods: A total of 628 MTB isolates were obtained from North, West, South, Central and Eastern India. Spoligotyping and drug susceptibility testing was performed by using manufacturer's instructions.
   Results: Spoligotyping detected 102 distinct spoligo-patterns. A total of 536 (85.3%) isolates were distributed into 85 SITs which matched the pre-existing database, whereas 17 SITs were newly created for 34 (5.4%) isolates. Overall, CAS family genotype was predominant, comprising 222 (35.4%) isolates, followed by EAI in 152 (24.2%), Beijing in 108 (17.2%), Manu in 41 (6.5%), T in 30 (4.8%), H in 6 (0.9%), X in 3 (0.5%) and one (0.2%) each in Ural and AFRI. Drug susceptibility testing identified 134 (21.3%) isolates as multi drug resistant (MDR).
   Conclusions: The CAS lineage had a pan India presence but EAI lineage was confined to southern parts of India. Beijing genotype of MTB was significantly associated (p-value <0.0001) with MDR. (C) 2015 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundRetinoblastoma is evolving, but it is still a therapeutic challenge for pediatric oncologists. Polo-like kinases (PLKs) plays an important role in cell cycle events. They play a crucial role in cell proliferation which may lead to tumour formation. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of PLK1 and PLK3 proteins in human retinoblastoma tissues.
   DesignNon-randomized, prospective study was performed in the Dr R. P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   ParticipantsThis study included 74 primary enucleated retinoblastoma tissues.
   MethodsExpression of PLK1 and PLK3 protein were assessed in primary enucleated retinoblastoma tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.
   Main Outcome MeasuresExpression of PLK1 and PLK3 protein were correlated with clinical and histopathological parameters, tumour staging and overall survival of patients.
   ResultsImmunohistochemical results revealed expression of PLK1 in 47/74 (63.51%) cases and PLK3 in 31/74 (41.89%) cases. Western blotting confirmed the immunoreactivity results. Expression of PLK1 showed correlation with poor differentiation and tumour invasion. In addition, PLK1 was statistically significant with massive choroidal invasion, whereas PLK3 did not correlate with any of the clinical or histopathological parameters. There was no statistical correlation in the overall survival of patients with PLK1 and PLK3 expression.
   ConclusionsPLK1 expression was associated with poor tumour differentiation and histopathological high-risk factors. These proteins may be involved in tumorigenesis and progression of disease. These results suggest that PLK1 may act as a potential therapeutic target and a promising marker for developing potent small molecule inhibitors of PLK isoforms in retinoblastoma.

AB  - Background Present-day diagnostic modalities for detecting periampullary carcinoma are suboptimal, and currently used proven markers lack specificity and sensitivity.
   Methods In order to assess the diagnostic potential of sperm protein 17, a cancer testis antigen, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of sperm protein 17 in tissue and sera specimens collected from periampullary carcinoma patients and normal subjects. Additionally, circulating levels of anti-sperm protein 17 antibodies were determined in sera of periampullary carcinoma patients and normal subjects using ELISA.
   Results Aberrant expression of sperm protein 17 was found in 14/15 (93 %) periampullary cancer tissues when compared with distant matched nonmalignant tissues (P = 0.006, Mann-Whitney U test). None of the distant matched nonmalignant tissues showed increased expression of sperm protein 17 mRNA. Area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.791, 87, and 73 %, respectively. Increased levels of sperm protein 17 mRNA were demonstrated in sera of periampullary carcinoma patients (P = 0.020, Student's t test). Circulating levels of anti-sperm protein 17 antibody were found to be significantly elevated in 27/30 (90 %) periampullary carcinoma patients (P < 0.001, Student's t test). Area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.954, 86.7, and 96.3 %, respectively. Only two of the normal subjects (7 %) showed elevated levels of anti-sperm protein 17 antibody.
   Conclusion For the first time, our findings suggest that high levels of sperm protein 17 mRNA as well as increased circulating anti-sperm protein 17 antibodies can be used to distinguish periampullary cancer patients from healthy individuals, highlighting the diagnostic potential of sperm protein 17.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common clinical problem prevalent in intensive care settings. It can complicate many critical illnesses. The general treatment is mainly supportive. Mechanical ventilation, low tidal volume strategy, and control of plateau pressure form the basis of current management. No specific treatment exists for ARDS. Various interventions have been tested for the lethal condition including steroids, fluid restriction, statins, high-frequency ventilation, nitric oxide, and prone ventilation strategy. However, none has shown improvement apart from prone positioning and low tidal volume ventilation. We report our observation in a patient with ARDS, which may potentially show a new mechanism to protect normal alveoli in ARDS lung and thereby may improve survival.

AB  - IntroductionThe aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the newly developed handheld hemoglobinmeter (TrueHb) by comparing its performance against and an automated five-part hematology analyzer, Sysmex counter XT 1800i (Sysmex).
   MethodsTwo hundred venous blood samples were subjected through their total hemoglobin evaluation on each device three times. The average of the three readings on each device was considered as their respective device values, that is, TrueHb values and Sysmex values. The two set of values were comparatively analyzed. The repeatability of the performance of TrueHb was also evaluated against Sysmex values.
   ResultsThe scatter plot of TrueHb values and Sysmex values showed linear distribution with positive correlations (r = 0.99). The intraclass correlation (ICC) values between the two set of values was found to be 0.995. Regression coefficients through origin, , was found to be 0.995, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) ranging between 0.9900 and 1.0000. The mean difference in Bland-Altman plots of TrueHb values against the Sysmex values was found to be -0.02, with limits of agreement between -0.777 and 0.732g/dL. Statistical analysis suggested good repeatability in results of TrueHb, having a low mean CV of 2.22, against 4.44, that of Sysmex values, and 95% confidence interval of 1.99-2.44, against 3.85-5.03, that of Sysmex values.
   ConclusionThese results suggested a strong positive correlation between the two measurements devices. It is thus concluded that TrueHb is a good point-of-care testing tool for estimating hemoglobin.

AB  - Aims. This study evaluated the measurement invariance of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) self-report among adolescents from seven different nations.
   Methods. Data for 2367 adolescents, aged 13-18 years, from India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Serbia, Turkey, Bulgaria and Croatia were available for a series of factor analyses.
   Results. The five-factor model including original SDQ scales emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention problems, peer problems and prosocial behaviour generated inadequate fit degree in all countries. A bifactor model with three factors (i.e., externalising, internalising and prosocial) and one general problem factor yielded adequate degree of fit in India, Nigeria, Turkey and Croatia. The prosocial behaviour, emotional symptoms and conduct problems factor were found to be common for all nations. However, originally proposed items loaded saliently on other factors besides the proposed ones or only some of them corresponded to proposed factors in all seven countries.
   Conclusions. Due to the lack of a common acceptable model across all countries, namely the same numbers of factors (i.e., dimensional invariance), it was not possible to perform the metric and scalar invariance test, what indicates that the SDQ self-report models tested lack appropriate measurement invariance across adolescents from these seven nations and it needs to be revised for cross-country comparisons.

AB  - Background: Extrahepatic portal-vein obstruction (EHPVO) is a common cause of portal hypertension in developing countries. The main risk in pregnant women with this condition is variceal bleeding, which may be life-threatening. The objective of our study was to assess the outcome of pregnancy in women with EHPVO.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 21 pregnancies in 12 women with EHPVO was carried out at a tertiary hospital in India.
   Results: The mean age of pregnant women with EHPVO was 25.3 years, and the mean duration of disease since diagnosis was 6.1 +/- 1.2 years. All the patients had chronic EHPVO, and two patients were diagnosed in the index pregnancy. The incidence of abortion, preterm deliveries, and small for gestational age fetus was 23.8%, 18.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia was found to complicate 61.9% of the pregnancies, while anemia was detected in 40% of the pregnancies. Variceal bleeding occurred in one woman, who was diagnosed during pregnancy and was managed successfully with endoscopic sclerotherapy. None of the patients who were diagnosed prenatally had variceal bleeding during pregnancy. The outcome in nine pregnancies, in which prenatal endoscopic variceal ligation was done, was compared with eight pregnancies, in which endoscopic sclerotherapy was done. No significant difference between the two groups in terms of pregnancy outcome and complications was found. There were no stillbirths or maternal mortality.
   Conclusion: Women with EHPVO who have been diagnosed and treated prenatally have a good pregnancy outcome. They should be managed in a tertiary care center with a multidisciplinary approach.

AB  - Problem
   Recurrent pregnancy loss is characterized by predominant Th1-type immunity and increased reactive oxygen species. Low levels of Coenzyme Q(10) are found in the plasma of RPL as compared to healthy pregnant females. Our aim was to investigate whether in vitro supplementation of PBMCs from such females with CoQ(10) could change the observed Th1 bias.
   Method of study
   PBMCs were isolated from 20 RPL pregnant and non-pregnant females and 16 healthy pregnant females and incubated with CoQ(10) in in vitro conditions. Phenotyping of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells was performed by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels were determined by ELISA.
   Results
   PBMCs treated with CoQ(10) showed significantly decreased percentage of Th1 cells (P < 0.005) in pregnant females with history of RPL than in the untreated ones. Also, levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were significantly decreased in the culture supernatant of treated PBMCs from RPL. DCFDA staining showed significantly reduced production of ROS in the treated PBMCs in RPL females.
   Conclusion
   CoQ(10) was effective in maintaining the immune homeostasis by reducing the proportion of IFN-gamma-producing T cells and proinflammatory cytokine levels in the RPL pregnant females. This property could be attributed to the capability of CoQ(10) in reducing oxidative stress by decreasing ROS production.

AB  - ObjectivesIndia is the most malaria-endemic country in South-East Asia, resulting in a high socio-economic burden. Insecticide-treated or untreated nets are effective interventions to prevent malaria. As part of an Indian first-aid guideline project, we aimed to investigate the magnitude of this effect in India.
   MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase and Central to systematically review Indian studies on the effectiveness of treated or untreated vs. no nets. Parasite prevalence and annual parasite incidence served as malaria outcomes. The overall effect was investigated by performing meta-analyses and calculating the pooled risk ratios (RR) and incidence rate ratios.
   ResultsOf 479 articles, we finally retained 16 Indian studies. Untreated nets decreased the risk of parasite prevalence compared to no nets [RR 0.69 (95% CI; 0.55, 0.87) in high-endemic areas, RR 0.49 (95% CI; 0.28, 0.84) in low-endemic areas], as was the case but more pronounced for treated nets [RR 0.35 (95% CI; 0.26, 0.47) in high-endemic areas, risk ratio 0.16 (95% CI; 0.06, 0.44) in low-endemic areas]. Incidence rate ratios showed a similar observation: a significantly reduced rate of parasites in the blood for untreated nets vs. no nets, which was more pronounced in low-endemic areas and for those who used treated nets. The average effect of treated nets (vs. no nets) on parasite prevalence was higher in Indian studies (RR 0.16-0.35) than in non-Indian studies (data derived from a Cochrane systematic review; RR 0.58-0.87).
   ConclusionsBoth treated and untreated nets have a clear protective effect against malaria in the Indian context. This effect is more pronounced there than in other countries.
   Objectifsl'Inde est le pays le plus endemique pour le paludisme en Asie du sud-est, ce qui entraine une charge socioeconomique elevee. Les moustiquaires impregnees ou non d'insecticide sont des interventions efficaces pour prevenir le paludisme. Dans le cadre d'un projet de directive de secourisme Indien, nous avons cherche a investiguer sur l'ampleur de cet effet en Inde.
   MethodesNous avons recherche dans MEDLINE, Embase et Centrale afin d'analyser systematiquement les etudes indiennes sur l'efficacite des moustiquaires traitees ou non traitees par rapport a l'absence de moustiquaires. La prevalence du parasite et l'incidence annuelle du parasite ont servi de resultats pour l'analyse. L'effet global a ete etudie en effectuant des meta-analyses et en calculant les rapports de risque (RR) pooles et les rapports des taux d'incidence.
   ResultatsSur 479 articles, nous avons finalement retenu 16 etudes indiennes. Les moustiquaires non traitees ont diminue le risque de prevalence du parasite compare a l'absence de moustiquaires (RR: 0,69 [IC 95%]; 0,55-0,87 dans les zones de forte endemie, RR: 0,49 [IC95%; 0,28-0,84] dans les zones de faible endemie), comme c'etait le cas aussi mais de facon plus prononcee pour les moustiquaires traitees (RR: 0,35 [IC95%]; 0,26-0,47 dans les zones de forte endemie et RR:0,16 [IC95%]; 0,06-0,44 dans les zones de faible endemie). Les rapports des taux d'incidence ont donne une observation similaire; un taux significativement reduit de parasites dans le sang pour les moustiquaires non traitees par rapport a l'absence de moustiquaires, qui etait plus prononce dans les zones de faible endemie et pour ceux qui ont utilise des moustiquaires traitees. L'effet moyen des moustiquaires impregnees (par rapport a l'absence de moustiquaires) sur la prevalence du parasite etait plus eleve dans les etudes indiennes (RR: 0,16-0,35) que dans les etudes non indiennes (donnees derivees d'une revue systematique de Cochrane; RR: 0,58-0,87).
   ConclusionsLes moustiquaires traites et non traitees ont un effet protecteur clair contre le paludisme dans le contexte indien. Cet effet est plus prononce que dans d'autres pays.
   ObjetivosIndia es el pais con mayor endemicidad para malaria en el sudeste asiatico, lo cual resulta en una gran carga socioeconomica. Las redes mosquiteras sin tratar y tratadas con insecticida son intervenciones efectivas para prevenir la malaria. Como una parte del proyecto para las primeras guias de primeros auxilios hindues, buscabamos averiguar la magnitud de este efecto en la India.
   MetodosRealizamos busquedas en MEDLINE, Embase y Central para revisar, de forma sistematica, estudios realizados en la India sobre la efectividad de las redes mosquiteras tratadas versus las no tratadas. La prevalencia de parasitos y la incidencia anual de parasitos servian como resultados de malaria. El efecto general fue evaluado mediante un meta-analisis y se calcularon el cociente de riesgos agrupado (RR) y la razon de densidades de incidencia (RDI)
   ResultadosDe 479 articulos, se escogieron 16 estudios hindues. Las mosquiteras no impregnadas disminuian el riesgo de prevalencia parasitaria al compararlas con no utilizar ninguna mosquitera (RR 0.69 [IC95%; 0.55,0.87] en areas altamente endemicas, RR 0.49 [IC95%; 0.28,0.84] en areas con baja endemicidad), como era tambien el caso para las mosquiteras impregnadas, pero con un efecto aun mas pronunciado (RR 0.35 [95%CI; 0.26,0.47] en areas altamente endemicas, RR 0.16 [IC 95%; 0.06,0.44] en areas de baja endemicidad. Con las RDI se observaba una tendencia similar: una tasa significativamente reducida de parasitos en sangre para el uso de mosquiteras sin tratar vs. no utilizar mosquiteras, lo cual era mas pronunciado en areas de baja endemicidad asi como para aquellos que utilizaban mosquiteras impregnadas. El efecto promedio de utilizar mosquiteras impregnadas (versus no utilizar mosquitera) sobre la prevalencia de parasitos era mayor en estudios de la India (RR 0.16-0.35) que en estudios fuera de la India (datos derivados de una revision sistematica de Cochrane; RR 0.58-0.87).
   ConclusionesTanto las mosquiteras impregnadas como las no impregnadas tienen un efecto protector claro frente a la malaria en el contexto de la India. Este efecto es mas pronunciado que en otros paises.

AB  - The clinical use of doxorubicin is associated with dose limiting cardiotoxicity. This is a manifestation of free radical production triggered by doxorubicin. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and antioxidant, in blocking cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin in rats. Male albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control (normal saline 2.5 mL/kg/day i.p. on alternate days, a total of 6 doses); Doxorubicin (2.5 mg/kg/day i.p. on alternate days, a total of 6 doses), Doxorubicin + Febuxostat (10 mg/kg/day oral) and Doxorubicin + Carvedilol (30 mg/kg/day oral) for 14 days. Febuxostat significantly ameliorated the doxorubicin-induced deranged cardiac functions as there was significant improvement in arterial pressures, left ventricular end diastolic pressure and inotropic and lusitropic states of the myocardium. These changes were well substantiated with biochemical findings, wherein febuxostat prevented the depletion of non-protein sulfhydryls level, with increased manganese superoxide dismutase level and reduced cardiac injury markers (creatine kinase-MB and B-type natriuretic peptide levels) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level. Febuxostat also exhibited significant anti-inflammatory (decreased expression of NF-kappa Bp65, IKK-beta and TNF-alpha) and anti-apoptotic effect (increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax and caspase-3 expression and TUNEL positivity). Hematoxylin and Eosin, Masson Trichome, Picro Sirius Red and ultrastructural studies further corroborated with hemodynamic and biochemical findings showing that febuxostat mitigated doxorubicin-induced increases in inflammatory cells, edema, collagen deposition, interstitial fibrosis, perivascular fibrosis and mitochondrial damage and better preservation of myocardial architecture. In addition, all these changes were comparable to those produced by carvedilol. Thus, our results suggest that the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effect of febuxostat contributes to its protective effects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often devastating, Mendelian disorders(1), and Darwin was one of the first to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness(2). However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide sufficient power(3,4). Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P < 1 x 10(-300), 2.1 x 10(-6), 2.5 x 10(-10) and 1.8 x 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in substantially smaller samples(5,6), no evidence was seen of an influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection(7), this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends virtually eliminating trans fat from the global food supply. Although several high-income countries have successfully reduced trans fat levels in foods, low-and middle-income countries such as India face additional challenges to its removal from the food supply. This study provides a systems analysis of the Indian food chain to assess intervention options for reducing trans fat intake in low-income consumers.
   Methods: Data were collected at the manufacturer, retailer and consumer levels. Qualitative interviews were conducted with vanaspati manufacturers (n = 13) and local food vendors (n = 44). Laboratory analyses (n = 39) of street foods/snacks sold by the vendors were also conducted. Trans fat and snack intakes were also examined in low-income consumers in two rural villages (n = 260) and an urban slum (n = 261).
   Results: Manufacturers of vanaspati described reducing trans fat levels as feasible but identified challenges in using healthier oils. The fat content of sampled oils from street vendors contained high levels of saturated fat (24.7-69.3 % of total fat) and trans fat (0.1-29.9 % of total fat). Households were consuming snacks high in trans fat as part of daily diets (31 % village and 84.3 % of slum households) and 4 % of rural and 13 % of urban households exceeded WHO recommendations for trans fat intakes.
   Conclusions: A multisectoral food chain approach to reducing trans fat is needed in India and likely in other low- and middle-income countries worldwide. This will require investment in development of competitively priced bakery shortenings and economic incentives for manufacturing foods using healthier oils. Increased production of healthier oils will also be required alongside these investments, which will become increasingly important as more and more countries begin investing in palm oil production.

AB  - In this report, retrospectively, we analyzed fifteen histo-pathologically characterized FFPE based Wilms' Tumor (WT) samples following an integrative approach of copy number (CN) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) imbalances. The isolated-DNA was tested on CN and somatic-mutation related Molecular-Inversion-Probe based-Oncoscan Array (TM) and was analyzed through Nexus-Express OncoScan-3.0 and 7.0 software. We identified gain of 3p13.0-q29, 4p16.3-14.0, 7, 12p13.33-q24.33, and losses of 1p36.11-q44, 11p15.5-q25, 21q 22.2-22.3 and 22q11.21-13.2 in six samples (W1-6) and validated them in nine more samples (W7-9, W12-15, W17-18). Some observed that discrete deletions (1p, 1q, 10p, 10q, 13q, 20p) were specific to our samples. Maximum-LOH was observed in Ch11 as reported in previous studies. However, LOH was also observed in different regions of Ch7 including some cancer genes. The identified LOH-regions (1q21.2-q21.3, 2p24.1-23.3, 2p24.3-24.3, 3p21.3-21.1, 4p16.3, 7p11.2-p11.1, 7q31.2-31.32, 7q34-q35 and Ch 8) in W1-W6 were also validated in W7-9, W12-15 and W18. In addition, previously reported LOH of 1p and 16q region was also observed in our cases. The proven and novel onco (OG)- and tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) involved in the CNV regions affected the major pathways like Chromatin Modification, RAS, PI3K; RAS in 14/15 cases, NOTCH/TGF-beta and Cell Cycle Apoptosis in 10/15 cases, APC in 9/15 cases and Transcriptional Regulation in 7/15 cases, PI3K and genome maintenance in 6/15 cases. This exhaustive profiling of OG and TG may help in prognosis and diagnosis of the disease after validation of all the relevant results, especially the novel ones, obtained in this research in a larger number of samples.

AB  - Aims To characterize patient radiation doses from nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and the use of radiation-optimizing 'best practices' worldwide, and to evaluate the relationship between laboratory use of best practices and patient radiation dose.
   Methods and results We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of protocols used for all 7911 MPI studies performed in 308 nuclear cardiology laboratories in 65 countries for a single week in March-April 2013. Eight 'best practices' relating to radiation exposure were identified a priori by an expert committee, and a radiation-related quality index (QI) devised indicating the number of best practices used by a laboratory. Patient radiation effective dose (ED) ranged between 0.8 and 35.6 mSv (median 10.0 mSv). Average laboratory ED ranged from 2.2 to 24.4 mSv (median 10.4 mSv); only 91 (30%) laboratories achieved the median ED <= 9 mSv recommended by guidelines. Laboratory QIs ranged from 2 to 8 (median 5). Both ED and QI differed significantly between laboratories, countries, and world regions. The lowest median ED (8.0 mSv), in Europe, coincided with high best-practice adherence (mean laboratory QI 6.2). The highest doses (median 12.1 mSv) and low QI (4.9) occurred in Latin America. In hierarchical regression modelling, patients undergoing MPI at laboratories following more 'best practices' had lower EDs.
   Conclusion Marked worldwide variation exists in radiation safety practices pertaining to MPI, with targeted EDs currently achieved in a minority of laboratories. The significant relationship between best-practice implementation and lower doses indicates numerous opportunities to reduce radiation exposure from MPI globally.

AB  - Semi-interpenetrating polymeric network hydrogel patches are fabricated using poly(acrylamide) (PAm) and gelatin (G) in which poly(caprolactone) diacrylate is used as a crosslinker for PAm while gelatin is kept uncrosslinked. The healing efficiency of selected hydrogel dressing [PAm(1)G(1)(0.5)] is evaluated in comparison with control group (cotton gauze covered with 3M Tegaderm). The sustained release of gelatin is found to extend from 4 to 15 days while maximum tensile strength stretched to 559 +/- 12.5 kPa in PAm(1)G(0.5) matrix, which reduced to 158 +/- 6.1 kPa at higher gelatin content (PAm(1)G(1.0)). The higher wound contraction (34%), less inflammatory response, significant improvement (P<0.05) in the collagen biosynthesis, and the granulation tissue formation are observed in PAm/G treated animals in comparison to control, as evidenced by quantitative enhancement of DNA (21%), hydroxyproline (28%), and hexosamine (41%). The histological examination of PAm/G hydrogel treated wound tissues shows enhanced re-epithelialization on day 8 and 12 post-wounding, in comparison to control group.

AB  - Background: The role of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in characterization of urinary calculi is evolving and literature regarding differentiation of calcium calculi is sparse and confounding.
   Purpose: To evaluate the capability of DECT in assessing the urinary calculi composition in vivo, especially in differentiating various types of calcium calculi.
   Material and Methods: One hundred and twenty patients underwent DECT for characterization of urinary calculi. Seventy patients with 114 calculi, including 93 calcium stones, were retrospectively analyzed. DE ratios and attenuation differences were compared using ANOVA and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was done to predict cut-off values, in particular for detecting calcium-oxalate-monohydrate (COM) stones.
   Results: DE ratio <= 1.14 accurately detected uric acid calculi, >= 1.29 was definitive for calcium and intermediate values were characteristic of cystine stones. DE ratios were significantly different between group 1 (COM [n = 32]; mean 1.376 +/- 0.041), group 2 ([calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) + COM] [n = 51]; 1.416 +/- 0.048), and group 3 ([carbonate apatite (CaP) + COD+COM] [n = 10]; 1.468 +/- 0.038) (group 1 vs. 2, P = 0.001; 1 vs. 3, P = 0.000; 2 vs. 3, P = 0.004). More importantly, pure COM calculi (group 1) had significantly lower DE ratio compared with mixed calcium calculi (groups 2 and 3) (P = 0.000). Attenuation differences (between low and high kV images) could not distinguish between COM and mixed calculi. ROC analysis for detection of COM calculi yielded AUC of 0.770 with cut-off DE ratio <1.385 (sensitivity 65.6%, specificity 82%) and value <1.335 was seen only with COM calculi (100% specificity).
   Conclusion: DECT can be employed for in vivo differentiation of various types of calculi and for detection of relatively lithotripsy-resistant COM calculi.

AB  - Hydatidiform mole (HM) is an aberrant human pregnancy with abnormal embryonic development and excessive proliferation of the trophoblast. Recessive mutations in NLRP7 are responsible for recurrent HM (RHM). Women with recessive NLRP7 mutations fail to have normal pregnancies from spontaneous conceptions with the exception of three out of 131 reported patients. Because there is no treatment for RHM and maternal-effect genes are needed in the oocytes to sustain normal embryonic development until the activation of the embryonic genome, one patient with recessive NLRP7 mutations tried ovum donation and achieved a successful pregnancy. This study reports three additional live births from donated ova to two patients with recessive NLRP7 mutations. The occurrence of two live births from spontaneous conceptions to two other patients is also reported. The reproductive outcomes and mutations of all reported patients were reviewed and it was found that live births are associated with some missense mutations expected to have mild functional consequences on the protein. The data support a previous observation that ovum donation appears the best management option for these patients to achieve normal pregnancies and provide an explanation for the rare occurrence of live births from natural spontaneous conceptions in patients with two NLRP7 mutations.

AB  - India is experiencing an alarming rise in the burden of noncommunicable diseases, but data on the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are sparse. Using the Center for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia surveillance study (a population-based survey of Delhi and Chennai, India) we estimated overall, and age-, sex-, city-, and diabetes-specific prevalence of CKD, and defined the distribution of the study population by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification scheme. The likelihood of cardiovascular events in participants with and without CKD was estimated by the Framingham and Interheart Modifiable Risk Scores. Of the 12,271 participants, 80% had complete data on serum creatinine and albuminuria. The prevalence of CKD and albuminuria, age standardized to the World Bank 2010 world population, was 8.7% (95% confidence interval: 7.9-9.4%) and 7.1% (6.4-7.7%), respectively. Nearly 80% of patients with CKD had an abnormally high hemoglobin A1c (5.7 and above). Based on KDIGO guidelines, 6.0, 1.0, and 0.5% of study participants are at moderate, high, or very high risk for experiencing CKD-associated adverse outcomes. The cardiovascular risk scores placed a greater proportion of patients with CKD in the high-risk categories for experiencing cardiovascular events when compared with participants without CKD. Thus, 1 in 12 individuals living in two of India's largest cities have evidence of CKD, with features that put them at high risk for adverse outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND. Molecular stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) based on genetic aberrations including ETS or RAF gene-rearrangements, PTEN deletion, and SPINK1 over-expression show clear prognostic and diagnostic utility. Gene rearrangements involving ETS transcription factors are frequent pathogenetic somatic events observed in PCa. Incidence of ETS rearrangements in Caucasian PCa patients has been reported, however, occurrence in Indian population is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ETS and RAF kinase gene rearrangements, SPINK1 over-expression, and PTEN deletion in this cohort.
   METHODS. In this multi-center study, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) PCa specimens (n = 121) were procured from four major medical institutions in India. The tissues were sectioned and molecular profiling was done using immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
   RESULTS. ERG over-expression was detected in 48.9% (46/94) PCa specimens by IHC, which was confirmed in a subset of cases by FISH. Among other ETS family members, while ETV1 transcript was detected in one case by RNA-ISH, no alteration in ETV4 was observed. SPINK1 over-expression was observed in 12.5% (12/96) and PTEN deletion in 21.52% (17/79) of the total PCa cases. Interestingly, PTEN deletion was found in 30% of the ERG-positive cases (P = 0.017) but in only one case with SPINK1 over-expression (P = 0.67). BRAF and RAF1 gene rearrangements were detected in similar to 1% and similar to 4.5% of the PCa cases, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS. This is the first report on comprehensive molecular profiling of the major spectrum of the causal aberrations in Indian men with PCa. Our findings suggest that ETS gene rearrangement and SPINK1 over-expression patterns in North Indian population largely resembled those observed in Caucasian population but differed from Japanese and Chinese PCa patients. The molecular profiling data presented in this study could help in clinical decision-making for the pursuit of surgery, diagnosis, and in selection of therapeutic intervention. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Objective To assess the impact of nutritional status on outcomes like mortality rate, length of mechanical ventilation and length of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay, in critically ill children.
   Methods In this retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care center, records of 332 critically ill children between 1 mo to 15 y of age for whom anthropometric parameters were available were included. Anthropometric parameters for the study subjects were used to assess the nutritional status using the WHO growth charts as the reference. The study subjects were categorized as non-malnourished, moderately, and severely malnourished, defined by Body mass index (BMI) for age 0 to -2 SD, -2 to -3 SD and less than -3 SD of WHO growth charts, respectively. Various outcomes like mortality, duration of PICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were assessed in the 3 groups based on the nutritional status.
   Results The prevalence of malnutrition in the index study was 51.2% with an overall mortality of 38.8%. No difference was found between mortality rates and proportion of ventilated children in the three study groups. However, more children who were severely malnourished had significantly prolonged ICU stay (>7 d) as well as duration of mechanical ventilation (>7 d). When the outcome variables were compared after adjusting for PIM2 scores, there were increasing odds of mortality, ventilation, prolonged PICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation with increasing severity of malnutrition.
   Conclusions After stabilization of the initial critical phase, PICU outcome is influenced by the nutritional status of the children.

AB  - Aim: This study was aimed at identifying the prognostic factors predicting remission in pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients presenting with pulmonary metastases. Little is known about the prognostic factors in reference to pediatric DTC patients presenting with pulmonary metastases.
   Methods: Fifty-three DTC patients aged <= 21 years were diagnosed with pulmonary metastases at initial presentation. The demographic and disease characteristics were compared between the patients who achieved remission and those who did not.
   Results: During the median follow-up of 72 months, 38 patients became disease free, 14 patients had biochemically and/or structurally persistent disease, and one patient died due to disease progression. Patient age >15 years, presence of macronodular pulmonary metastases, and surgical methods lesser than total/near-total thyroidectomy were identified as factors associated with reduced odds of remission.
   Conclusion: This study describes the disease course and depicts the disease related prognostic factors in pediatric DTC patients with pulmonary metastases.

AB  - Low-risk (LR) differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients should be ablated or not, albeit, with small dose of radioiodine is highly controversial. We hypothesized that those LR DTC patients who were surgically ablated need no radioiodine remnant ablation (RRA). This study aims to evaluate the long-term outcome in these two groups of patients. Retrospective cohort study conducted from January 1991 to December 2012. Based on extent of surgical resection and histopathology, LR DTC patients were classified as Gr-1: 169 patients, who were surgically ablated; Gr-2: 153 patients, who had significant remnant in thyroid bed. Basal parameters were comparable between two groups except pretherapy 24h radioiodine uptake (0.16 +/- 0.01% vs. 5.64 +/- 0.46%; P<0.001). No patient received RRA in Gr-1; Gr-2 patients were administered 30mCi I-131. Total number of events (recurrence, persistent, and progression of disease), with median follow up of 10.3years, was observed in 10/322 (3.1%) of LR DTC patients. Only one patient had disease recurrence from Gr-1, who became disease-free after radioiodine therapy. Similarly, one patient from 126, who was ablated with single dose of RRA, had recurrence from Gr-2. However, 8/27 (29.7%) patients from Gr-2 had persistent disease; even two of them subsequently developed disease progression, who failed first-dose of RRA. The event-free survival rates were 99.4% and 94.1% (P=0.006) in Gr-1 and Gr-2, respectively. RRA is an overtreatment in surgically ablated LR DTC patients. Successfully ablated RRA patients also had similar long-term outcome, however, those who failed, should be re-stratified as intermediate-risk category, and managed aggressively.

AB  - Background & objectives: Genetic factors have potential of predicting response to antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, an attempt was made to find an association between response to escitalopram in patients with MDD, and serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and receptor (5HTR1A, 5HTR2A) polymorphisms.
   Methods: Fifty five patients diagnosed as suffering from MDD, were selected for the study. The patients were treated with escitalopram over a period of 6-8 wk. Severity of depression, response to treatment and side effects were assessed using standardised instruments. Genetic variations from HTR1A (rs6295), HTR2A (rs6311 and rs6313) and SLC6A4 (44 base-pair insertion/deletion at 5-HTTLPR) were genotyped. The genetic data of the responders and non-responders were compared to assess the role of genetic variants in therapeutic outcome.
   Results: Thirty six (65.5%) patients responded to treatment, and 19 (34.5%) had complete remission. No association was observed for genotype and allelic frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among remitter/non-remitter and responder/ non-responder groups, and six most common side-effects, except memory loss which was significantly associated with rs6311 (p=0.03).
   Interpretation & conclusions: No significant association was found between the SNPs analysed and response to escitalopram in patients with MDD though a significant association was seen between the side effect of memory loss and rs6311. Studies with larger sample are required to find out genetic basis of antidepressant response in Indian patients.

AB  - Supra-tentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (SPNET) are high-grade, hemispheric tumors, which account for around 2-3 % of pediatric brain tumors. We herein intend to report the clinical features and treatment outcome of patients with nonpineal SPNET treated at our institute.
   Clinical data were collected by retrospective chart review from 2006 to 2012. Histopathology slides were reviewed, and relevant immunohistochemistry stains were done. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.
   Fifteen patients met the study criterion (male: female = 2:1). Median age at presentation was 11 years (range 3-49 years). Surgical resection was gross total in 6 (40 %) and subtotal in 8 (53.33 %) patients. At presentation, two patients had leptomeningeal dissemination. Radiation therapy was delivered in 11 (73.33 %) patients: craniospinal irradiation in 8 (36 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks to the craniospinal axis followed by a local boost of 20 Gy/10 fractions/2 weeks) and focal RT in 3 patients. Systemic chemotherapy (median 6 cycles; range 1-16 cycles), given in 13 (86.67 %) patients, included the VAC regimen (vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) alternating with IE (ifosfamide,etoposide). After a median follow-up of 22.6 months (mean, 24.47 months), complete response and progressive disease were noted in 8 (53.33 %) and 7 (46.67 %) patients, respectively. Median OS was not reached, and estimated median EFS was noted to be 4.12 years (actuarial rate of EFS at 2 years, 55.2 %).
   Maximal safe resection followed by craniospinal irradiation and systemic chemotherapy with 6-12 cycles of an alternating regimen of VAC and IE is a reasonable treatment strategy in patients with nonpineal SPNET.

AB  - BACKGROUND:Recent strategies for treatment of basilar invagination (BI) and atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) are based on simultaneous posterior reduction and fixation.OBJECTIVE:To describe new modifications of the procedure distraction, compression, extension, and reduction (DCER), ie, joint remodeling (JRM) and extra-articular distraction (EAD) in patients with vertical joints, and to quantify the improvement in joint indices, ie, sagittal inclination (SI), craniocervical tilt (CCT), and coronal inclination.METHODS:Prospective study (May 2010 to September 2014). Joint indices measured included (normal values): SI (87.15 5.65 degrees), CCT (60.2 9.2 degrees), and coronal inclination (110.3 4.23 degrees). Surgical procedures included DCER alone (performed in SI <100 degrees, group I) or JRM with DCER (in SI: 100-160 degrees, group II), or EAD with DCER in severe BI with almost vertical joints (SI >160 degrees, group III).RESULTS:Seventy-nine patients were selected (mean, 22.5 years of age). All conventional indices improved significantly (P < .001). CCT improved in all groups (P < .01); group I (n = 32): 54 8.7 degrees (preoperative 80.71 12.72 degrees); group II (n = 40): 58 7.0 degrees (preoperative 86.5 14 degrees); group III (n = 7): 62 10.0 degrees (preoperative 104 11.2 degrees). SI improved in both group I and II, P < .01 (cannot be measured in group III). At long-term follow-up (n = 64, 29 8 months, range 12-39 months), the Nurick grade improved to 1.5 +/- 0.52 (preoperative: 3.4 +/- 0.65; P < .001).CONCLUSION:DCER seems to be an effective technique in reducing both BI and AAD.

AB  - Background: The use of minimally invasive endoscopic surgery is fast emerging in many subspecialties of neurosurgery as an effective alternative to the open procedures. Objective: The author describe a novel technique of using an endoscope for performing a corpus callosotomy and hemispherotomy. A description of endoscopic disconnection for a hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) and a review of the literature is also presented.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty four patients underwent endoscopic procedures between January 2010 and March 2015. These included endoscopic-assisted inter-hemispheric trans-callosal hemispherotomy (EH; n = 11), endoscopic-assisted corpus callosotomy with anterior/posterior commissurotomy (CCWC; n = 16), and endoscopic disconnection for HH (n = 7). EH and CCWC were performed with the use of a small craniotomy (4 cm x 3 cm). The surgeries were performed using a rigid high-definition endoscope, bayonetted self-irrigating bipolar forceps, and other standard endoscopic instruments along with the guidance of intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging and neuronavigation. HH disconnection was performed using endoscopic neuronavigation through a burr hole.
   Results: Hemispherotomy: Sequelae of middle cerebral artery infarct (5), Rasmussen's syndrome (3), and hemimegalencephaly (3). Outcome: Class I Engel (9) and class II (2), mean follow-up of 8.4 months, range: 3-18 months. Mean blood loss: 85 cc, mean operating time: 210 min. CCWC: All had a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), with etiologies of hypoxic insult (10), lissencephaly (2), bilateral band heterotropia (2), microgyria and pachygyria (2). Mean follow-up: 18 +/- 4.7 (16-27 months). Drop attacks stopped in all the patients. Seizure frequency and duration decreased >90% (11) and >50% (5). HH: Type II (2), Type III (2), Type IV (3). 5 had IA outcome.
   Conclusion: The article emphasizes the role of endoscopic procedures for epilepsy surgery and provides a review of literature. This experience may subserve to coin the term "endoscopic epilepsy surgery" for a fast emerging subspeciality in the field of epilepsy surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of clear lens extraction (CLE) on intraocular pressure (IOP) and the anterior chamber angle in primary angle closure after laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI).
   SETTING: Tertiary eyecare center at a university hospital, New Delhi, India.
   DESIGN: Prospective case series.
   METHODS: The study included eyes with primary angle closure and an MP over 25.0 mm Hg more than 8 weeks after LPI. All eyes had CLE by phacoemulsification. Absolute success was defined as an IOP less than 18.0 mm Hg without medications at 12 months.
   RESULTS: In 44 eyes (24 women, 20 men; mean age 57.2 years +/- 4.2 [SD]), the mean preoperative 10P of 27.1 +/- 1.55 mm Hg decreased to 13.2 +/- 1.12 mm Hg at 12 months (P<.0001). The angle opening distance at 500 mu m increased from baseline values at 0 degrees (from 0.104 +/- 0.015 mm to 0.31 +/- 0.013 mm) and 180 degrees (from 0.202 +/- 0.008 mm to 0.412 +/- 0.012 mm). The trabecular iris angle also increased at 0 degrees (from 9.3 +/- 3.2 degrees to 32.7 +/- 5.6 degrees) and 180 degrees (from 9.12 +/- 3.2 degrees to 31.7 +/- 5.6 degrees) (all P<.0001). In multivariate analysis, the preoperative 10P was the strongest determinant of 10P change (R-2 = 0.69, P<.0001). Absolute success was achieved in 38 eyes (86.3%).
   CONCLUSION: Clear lens extraction led to a significant reduction in 10P, a widening of the anterior chamber angle, and a reduced need for ocular hypotensive medications in eyes with primary angle closure and persistently raised 10P after LPI. (C) 2015 ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Objective We evaluated the role of diosmectite as an add-on treatment to the 'recommended treatment' of acute diarrhoea in children.
   Methods We searched all published literature through the major databases: Medline via Ovid, PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase and Google Scholar till May 2014. Randomised clinical trials comparing diosmectite versus placebo were included (PROSPERO registration: CRD42014013783).
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome measures were duration of acute diarrhoea (h), and day-to-day cure rates (%). The secondary outcome measures were stool output (volume), stool output (frequency) and adverse events.
   Results Of 384 citations retrieved, a total of 13 randomised clinical trials (2164 children, 1-60 months old) were included in the meta-analysis. A dose of 3-6 grams per day of diosmectite was given for a duration from 3 days until recovery. Compared with placebo, diosmectite significantly decreased the duration of acute diarrhoea (mean difference, -23.39; 95% CI -28.77 to -18.01), and increased the cure rate (%) at day 5 (OR, 4.44; 95% CI 1.66 to 11.84), without any increases in the risk of adverse events. Diosmectite was effective in all types of acute childhood diarrhoea except dysentery. Because, most of the trials were open-label, and there was a high possibility of publication bias, the GRADE evidence generated was of 'low quality'.
   Conclusions Diosmectite may be a useful additive in the treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea. As the evidence generated was of 'low quality', future research is needed with higher quality designs before any firm recommendations can be made.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is the only acute leukemia amenable to targeted therapy. However, there is limited Indian data on APL. We aimed to analyze data of APL patients treated with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline based chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 34 cases of APL were treated at our center over 4 years. Induction chemotherapy consisted of a combination of ATRA and daunorubicin. RESULTS: Most of our patients were intermediate risk (50%) followed by high risk (41.17%). Induction mortality was 14.7%. We observed a high incidence of febrile neutropenia (91%) and 50% of our patients developed ATRA syndrome. Four patients (11.76%) relapsed during follow-up (median - 15 months, range: 13-33 months). There was no correlation between risk status and death or relapse or ATRA syndrome. Median event free survival (EFS) duration was not reached however mean duration was 38.45 +/- 3.84 months. Median overall survival (OS) duration was also not reached at 53 months of follow-up. The 4 year OS and EFS were 75.45% and 64.5% respectively. On multivariate analysis, only disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) significantly correlated with a poor OS and EFS. DISCUSSION: Our data reflects that APL remains a highly curable malignancy with good response to ATRA plus anthracycline based chemotherapy even with a greater number of high and intermediate risk patients. Only DIC during induction chemotherapy bore an impact on survival in our patients.

AB  - Background Both young and advanced maternal age is associated with adverse birth and child outcomes. Few studies have examined these associations in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and none have studied adult outcomes in the off spring. We aimed to examine both child and adult outcomes in five LMICs.
   Methods In this prospective study, we pooled data from COHORTS (Consortium for Health Orientated Research in Transitioning Societies)-a collaboration of five birth cohorts from LMICs (Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa), in which mothers were recruited before or during pregnancy, and the children followed up to adulthood. We examined associations between maternal age and off spring birthweight, gestational age at birth, height-for-age and weight-for-height Z scores in childhood, attained schooling, and adult height, body composition (body-mass index, waist circumference, fat, and lean mass), and cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose concentration), along with binary variables derived from these. Analyses were unadjusted and adjusted for maternal socioeconomic status, height and parity, and breastfeeding duration.
   Findings We obtained data for 22 188 mothers from the five cohorts, enrolment into which took place at various times between 1969 and 1989. Data for maternal age and at least one outcome were available for 19 403 off spring (87%). In unadjusted analyses, younger (<= 19 years) and older (>= 35 years) maternal age were associated with lower birthweight, gestational age, child nutritional status, and schooling. After adjustment, associations with younger maternal age remained for low birthweight (odds ratio [OR] 1.18 (95% CI 1.02-1.36)], preterm birth (1.26 [1.03-1.53]), 2-year stunting (1.46 [1.25-1.70]), and failure to complete secondary schooling (1.38 [1.18-1.62]) compared with mothers aged 20-24 years. After adjustment, older maternal age remained associated with increased risk of preterm birth (OR 1.33 [95% CI 1.05-1.67]), but children of older mothers had less 2-year stunting (0.64 [0.54-0.77]) and failure to complete secondary schooling (0.59 [0.48-0.71]) than did those with mothers aged 20-24 years. Off spring of both younger and older mothers had higher adult fasting glucose concentrations (roughly 0.05 mmol/L).
   Interpretation Children of young mothers in LMICs are disadvantaged at birth and in childhood nutrition and schooling. Efforts to prevent early childbearing should be strengthened. After adjustment for confounders, children of older mothers have advantages in nutritional status and schooling. Extremes of maternal age could be associated with disturbed off spring glucose metabolism.

AB  - More than one decade ago, introduction of integrated PET/CT scanners changed oncologic imaging and oncologic patient management profoundly. With these systems, the metabolic information acquired by PET can be anatomically localized even to small structures such as small primary tumors, lymph nodes, and soft tissue masses owing to the high-resolution multidetector CT scanners. This has made PET/CT a most reliable method for tumor detection, characterization, staging, and response monitoring. The importance of an integrated functional and morphologic approach to better understand the biology of oncologic disease and to improve therapy planning is underlined by the increasing number of PET/CT systems worldwide, leading to an increasing number of scientific publications in the field. The paradigmatic indication of integrated PET/CT is staging of patients with lung cancer, as PET/CT allows for precise pretherapeutic staging and also posttreatment restaging according to the TNM criteria. The growing numbers of targeted therapy strategies in the fields of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, which are adapted to dedicated tumor stages, require the exact classifications of each patient's tumor stage. In this context, whole-body examinations using integrated F-18-FDG-PET/CT have been shown to reduce the side effects of futile invasive procedures and reduce additional costly staging procedures. In this review article, the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of PET/CT examinations are highlighted and compared with some competitive techniques such as scintigraphy, MRI, and, where possible, integrated PET/MRI.

AB  - Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) accounts for >80% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in childhood. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of SSNS remain obscure. Hypothesizing that coding variation may underlie SSNS risk, we conducted an exome array association study of SSNS. We enrolled a discovery set of 363 persons (214 South Asian children with SSNS and 149 controls) and genotyped them using the Illumina HumanExome Beadchip. Four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 (rs1129740, rs9273349, rs1071630, and rs1140343) were significantly associated with SSNS at or near the Bonferroni-adjusted P value for the number of single variants that were tested (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.56 to 2.86; P=1.68x10(-6) (Fisher exact test). Two of these SNPsthe missense variants C34Y (rs1129740) and F41S (rs1071630) in HLA-DQA1were replicated in an independent cohort of children of white European ancestry with SSNS (100 cases and 589 controls; P=1.42x10(-17)). In the rare variant gene set-based analysis, the best signal was found in PLCG2 (P=7.825x10(-5)). In conclusion, this exome array study identified HLA-DQA1 and PLCG2 missense coding variants as candidate loci for SSNS. The finding of a MHC class II locus underlying SSNS risk suggests a major role for immune response in the pathogenesis of SSNS.

AB  - Inflammation and oxidative stress have been reported in obesity. Safoof Mohazzil, is a traditional formulation prescribed by Unani physicians for weight loss. In the present study, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Safoof Mohazzil were evaluated using pyrogallol induced hepatotoxicity and carrageenan induced paw edema, respectively, in male Wistar rats. For the antioxidant study, rats were treated with Safoof Mohazzil for 14 days at the doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, p.o. On 14th day, 2 hrs after the last dose of Unani formulation, pyrogallol (100 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and on next day the animals were sacrificed for estimation of hepatic oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione). Safoof Mohazzil demonstrated dose-dependent anti-oxidant activity. To assess its anti-inflammatory property, Safoof Mohazzil was administered at the doses of 500 & 1000 mg/kg, p.o. for 7 days and on 7th day carrageenan was administered 1 hr after the last dose of Unani formulation. The change in paw volume was calculated at 1, 3 and 6 hrs. Significant anti-inflammatory activity was found at 1000 mg/kg dose which is the human equivalent of its anti-obesity dose. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of Safoof Mohazzil support its use in obesity and possibly metabolic syndrome.

AB  - AimThe aim of our study was to examine the association of low pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) with adverse pregnancy outcome.
   Material and MethodsA total of 1640 consecutive pregnant women between 9(+5) and 13(+6) weeks of pregnancy were recruited. One hundred and thirty women with PAPP-A levels<0.4 multiple of median were followed till delivery and the outcome information was obtained for fetal loss, birthweight, growth restriction, preterm birth, reduced liquor and development of pre-eclampsia.
   ResultsDuring the study period, 130 (7.92%) women had low PAPP-A and were considered as cases and 200 women with normal PAPP-A were controls. Intrauterine growth restriction was observed in 28 (21.54%) cases as compared to 10 (5%) controls. Pre-eclampsia presented in 24 (18.46%) cases and in 18 (9%) controls. Twenty (15.38%) cases had preterm delivery compared to 12 (6%) controls. Fifty-six (43.08%) cases delivered low-birthweight babies compared to 22 (11%) controls. Thus, the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and low birthweight was significantly more in the cases as compared to the control group.
   ConclusionsPAPP-A is a valuable analyte for predicting risk of adverse pregnancy outcome and women with low serum PAPP-A levels would benefit from closer surveillance.

AB  - Type 1 Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal enzyme deficiency with variable age of symptom onset. Common presenting signs include thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone abnormalities, and, additionally in children, growth failure. Fifty-seven patients aged 3-62 years at the baseline of two phase III trials for velaglucerase alfa treatment were enrolled in the single extension study. In the extension, they received every-other-week velaglucerase alfa intravenous infusions for 1.2-4.8 years at 60 U/kg, although 10 patients experienced dose reduction. No patient experienced a drug-related serious adverse event or withdrew due to an adverse event. One patient died following a convulsion that was reported as unrelated to the study drug. Only one patient tested positive for anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies. Combining the experience of the initial phase III trials and the extension study, significant improvements were observed in the first 24 months from baseline in hematology variables, organ volumes, plasma biomarkers, and, in adults, the lumbar spine bone mineral density Z-score. Improvements were maintained over longer-term treatment. Velaglucerase alfa had a good long-term safety and tolerability profile, and patients continued to respond clinically, which is consistent with the results of the extension study to the phase I/II trial of velaglucerase alfa.

AB  - Purpose To compare the visual outcome of microincision (2.2 mm) with standard (2.75 mm) corneal incision phacoemulsification.
   Methods In this prospective, randomized comparative study, patients with senile cataract and less than 1 diopter (D) of astigmatism were divided into two groups. Group 1 included patients undergoing phacoemulsification with 2.2 mm clear corneal incision and group 2 included those undergoing phacoemulsification with 2.75 mm incision. The steep axis measured on keratometry was marked preoperatively. Phacoemulsification was performed through clear corneal incision on this steep axis. Assessment of visual acuity (distance and near), keratometry, keratometric cylinder, contrast sensitivity by Functional Acuity Contrast Test, and surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) was performed at 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months.
   Results Fifty eyes of 50 patients were included in the study (29 were male). There were 25 patients in each group. The mean (SD) SIA calculated by vector analysis method (Holladay-Cravy-Koch) using keratometry value, at the end of 6 months, was 0.54 (+/- 0.18) D and 0.58 (+/- 0.14) D in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.27). No significant differences were found in the distance and near uncorrected visual acuity, mean keratometry, keratometric cylinder, contrast sensitivity, and SIA at any follow-up visit between two groups.
   Conclusions In patients with less than 1 D astigmatism undergoing phacoemulsification, both 2.2-mm and 2.75-mm clear corneal incisions result in similar postoperative visual outcome in terms of SIA, keratometry, and contrast sensitivity.

AB  - MDM2 protein is an important regulator of the p53 pathway and has a large effect on the anti-tumorigenic activity of the p53. Presently, we aimed to analyze the possible association of p53 and mdm2 in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, impact of an important gene promoter polymorphism of MDM2 (T309G, rs 2279744) on its gene expression and ultimately of the TP53 was investigated in non-small cell lung cancer patients. A case-control study using peripheral blood samples of 100 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 100 cancer free healthy controls was conducted. Expression profile of MDM2 and TP53 gene were evaluated by using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay, and MDM2 promoter polymorphism were analyzed by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. Non-small cell lung cancer patients expressed more than 6-fold increased mdm2 and about 7-folds decreased in p53 expression levels compared to healthy controls. Higher fold change increase of mdm2 and/or decrease of p53 were associated with advanced status and poor clinical outcome of the patients. A significant increase in mdm2 of about 14-folds and decrease in p53 of about 16.5-fold were observed among patients with MDM2 (309GG) genotype vs just 2.2-fold increase in mdm2 and 1.9fold decrease in p53 among patients with MDM2 (309TT) genotype. In conclusion, present study demonstrated that MDM2 (309 T>G) polymorphism may be one of the important factors for the increased expression mdm2, which was associated with down-regulation of p53 at messenger RNA (mRNA) level and ultimately may contribute in the poor clinical outcome of the non-small cell lung cancer patients, thus may prove as a promising target for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer at molecular level.

AB  - Survivin is highly expressed in fetal tissue and is completely absent in terminally differentiated cells, but its re-expression has been observed in most human tumors. Presently, we aimed to analyze the possible impact of the survivin gene (-31G>C, rs 9904341) promoter polymorphism on the expression profile of survivin gene and ultimately the role of survivin re-expression in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer. A case-control study of 100 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 100 cancer-free healthy controls was conducted. Survivin gene promoter polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) technique, and the survivin expression profile was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR assay. Compared to the survivin GG genotype, odd ratio of 3.2 (95% CI 4.8-25.9, p=0.004) was found to be associated to homozygous CC genotype with 15-fold increase of survivin gene expression in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Significant trend of increase in survivin expression was observed with the increase in severity of the disease. Patients with survivin (-31CC) genotype had significantly shorter overall survival compared to survivin (-31GG) genotype carriers. In addition, advanced disease status and significant poor overall survival were also reflected by patients with higher-fold increase in survivin gene expression. In conclusion, present study demonstrated that survivin (-31G>C) polymorphism may contribute to the risk of developing non-small cell lung cancer in Indian population. Survivin (-31CC) genotype was associated with significantly increased survivin gene expression and ultimately may contribute in the poor clinical outcome of non-small cell lung cancer patients, suggesting its possible significance in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer.

KW  - SALIVARY-GLAND
AB  - Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) of the salivary gland is a malignant tumor which bears morphologic, immunohistochemical and molecular features similar to those of mammary secretory carcinoma. The tumor is considered as a low-grade malignancy perhaps slightly more aggressive than acinic cell carcinoma. High-grade transformation with recurrences, regional nodal involvement, metastases, and cancer-related death has been reported in a few cases. We report an unusual case of large MASC of the parotid gland in a young patient without regional lymph node involvement. To the best of our knowledge till date such a large MASC of the salivary gland has not been reported in the English literature.

AB  - Panchagavya Ghrita (PG), according to Ayurvedic formulary of India (AFI), is used to treat epilepsy (apasmara), fever (jvara), mania (unmade) and jaundice (kamala). In the present study, we examined its effect on convulsions, oxidative stress and cognitive impairment in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced seizures in rats. PG @ 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg/kg was administered orally for 7 days to male Wistar rats. On day 7, PTZ (60 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 2 h after the last dose of PG. Sodium valproate (300 mg/kg) was used as positive control. Latency to myoclonic jerks, clonus and generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) were recorded for seizure severity. Cognitive impairment was assessed using elevated plus maze and passive avoidance tests Malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were measured in rat brain. The results have shown that pretreatment with PG @ 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg/kg exhibited 16.6, 33.3, 50 and 100% protection against occurrence of GTCS. The pretreatment with PG has significantly improved cognitive functions and the oxidative stress induced by seizures demonstrating its protective effect against PTZ induced seizures, and further, use of PG as an anticonvulsant in Ayurvedic system of medicine.

TI  - Composite renal cell carcinoma and angiomyolipoma in a patient with Tuberous sclerosis: A diagnostic dilemma
T2  - CUAJ-CANADIAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with various renal pathologies, including angiomyolipoma (AML). Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with concomitant AML is rare. We report a case of composite RCC and AML in a young male with TS. This 25-year-old male presented with an abdominal mass. The abdominal computed tomography scan revealed RCC in the left kidney and AML in right kidney. A left radical nephrectomy was performed. Microscopy showed a tumour composed of closely intermingled RCC and AML components. Immunohistochemistry was performed for confirmation. A diagnosis of composite tumour with clear cell RCC and AML was made. Though the coexistence of RCC with AML is rare, and the composite variant is even rarer, one must be aware of this entity to prevent misdiagnosis as well as upstaging of RCC, and also to avoid missing areas of RCC within a large AML, especially in TS patients.

KW  - CHILDREN
AB  - Purpose To present the clinical features and management of infants presenting with periorbital necrotising fasciitis (NF).
   Methods Retrospective case series.
   Results Six children were studied. The age at presentation was in the range of 5-11 months (median, 8 months). All children presented with acute onset eyelid inflammation and necrosis with fever, lethargy and poor oral intake. The management included intravenous antibiotics and repeated surgical debridement. The infection healed by 2-3 weeks in all cases, resulting in cicatricial ectropion and lagophthalmos. Full thickness skin grafting (with a Hughes tarso-conjunctival graft in one child) was performed in all patients at 3-5 weeks subsequently. Repeat surgery was required in three children. Adequate globe coverage and cosmesis was achieved in five children.
   Conclusion NF of eyelids is a potentially fatal infection that requires urgent and vigorous management and heals with sequelae that may need more than one surgical intervention over a period of time. Adequate cosmetic and functional outcomes can be achieved.

AB  - Objective: Studies on association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) C677T gene polymorphism and ischemic stroke have shown conflicting results. We have conducted a meta-analysis to determine the precise association of the C677T polymorphism of MTHFR gene with risk of ischemic stroke.
   Materials and methods: We searched electronic databases Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar (last search dated till August 2014). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random or fixed-effects models were calculated. The methodological quality of included studies was determined by the quality assessment scale.
   Results: Thirty eight case-control studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria comprising 6310 patients and 8297 controls. The significant associations between MTHFR C677T genetic polymorphism and risk of ischemic stroke were observed in dominant (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.12, P-value < 0.001) and recessive (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.19-1.44, P-value < 0.001) inheritance models. In an Asian population, significant association between the MTHFR polymorphism and ischemic stroke was observed (dominant model: OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.23-1.49 and under recessive model OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.45). In the Caucasian population borderline, non-significant association was observed under dominant model of inheritance (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99-1.10) but significant association was observed under the recessive model of inheritance (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.58).
   Conclusion: The present study results suggest that MTHFR C677T genetic polymorphism is a probable risk of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Alcohol and substance use, until recently, were believed to be a predominantly male phenomenon. Only in the last few decades, attention has shifted to female drug use and its repercussions in women. As the numbers of female drug users continue to rise, studies attempt to understand gender-specific etiological factors, phenomenology, course and outcome, and issues related to treatment with the aim to develop more effective treatment programs. Research has primarily focused on alcohol and tobacco in women, and most of the literature is from the Western countries with data from developing countries like India being sparse. This review highlights the issues pertinent to alcohol and substance use in women with a special focus to the situation in India.

AB  - Background: Aspiration pneumonia is an important cause of death in head and neck cancer patients. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with aspiration pneumonia in head and neck cancer patients.
   Methods: Hospital death records from 12 years (2000-2012) were reviewed to obtain the number of deaths. Treatment details and cause of death were analysed. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for aspiration pneumonia.
   Results: The records revealed that aspiration pneumonia was the cause of death in 51 out of 85 patients. Primary tumour site (oropharynx and hypopharynx, odds ratio 3.3; 95 per cent confidence interval 1.17-9.4, p = 0.02) and advanced tumour stage (odds ratio 4.2, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.16-15.61, p = 0.02) had significant negative impacts on aspiration pneumonia related mortality.
   Conclusion: Advanced pharyngeal cancer patients are at an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia related death. Investigations for the early detection of this condition are recommended in these high-risk patients.

AB  - Cisplatin is an effective anti-cancer drug which causes remarkable toxicity to kidney by generating reactive oxygen species and by stimulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathway. Citrus flavonoid, like nobiletin has been reported to possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate these properties of nobiletin, a polymethoxy flavone in cisplatin-induced acute renal injury. Adult male albino Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups. Nobiletin was administered at the dose of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg for a period of 10 days. On 7th day, a single injection of cisplatin (8 mg/kg) was injected to rats. Cisplatin administration resulted in renal dysfunction as evident by increase in serum creatinine and BUN levels. Oxidative stress in cisplatin group was reflected by increase in MDA level, and depletion of anti-oxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase in renal tissue. Furthermore, cisplatin increased the expressions of Bax, caspase-3 and DNA damage along with decreased expression of Bcl-2 in the renal tissue. Histological analysis also revealed acute tubular necrosis. However, pretreatment with nobiletin preserved renal function and restored anti-oxidant status. Nobiletin supplementation inhibited activation of apoptotic pathways and DNA damage. It also attenuated tubular injury histologically. Collectively, the result of this study suggests the nephroprotective potential of nobiletin which may be related to its anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  - This paper evaluates a prototype flat-panel volume CT (fpVCT) for dynamic in vivo imaging in a variety of neurovascular and lower limb applications.
   Dynamic CTA was performed on 12 patients (neuro = 8, lower limb = 4) using an fpVCT with 120 kVp, 50 mA, rotation time varying from 8 to 19 s, and field of view of 25 x 25 x 18 cm(3). Four-dimensional data sets (i.e. 3D images over time) were reconstructed and reviewed.
   Dynamic CTA demonstrated sufficient spatio-temporal resolution to elucidate first-pass and recirculation dynamics of contrast bolus through neurovasclaur pathologies and phasic blood flow though lower-limb vasculature and grafts. The high spatial resolution of fpVCT resulted in reduced partial volume and metal beam-hardening artefacts. This facilitated assessment of vascular lumen in the presence of calcified plaque and evaluation of fractures, especially in the presence of fixation hardware. Evaluation of arteriovenous malformation using dynamic fpVCT angiography was of limited utility.
   Dynamic CTA using fpVCT can visualize time-varying phenomena in neuro and lower limb vascular applications and has suffcient diagnostic imaging quality to evaluate a number of pathologies affecting these regions.
   aEuro cent CTA using fpVCT has sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to study phasic blood flow.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome, an abnormally shortened chromosome 22. It is the result of a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, creating BCR-ABL fusion transcripts, b3a2, b2a2, and e1a2. The aim of our study was to determine the type of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts for molecular diagnosis and investigate the frequency of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts in CML patients by multiplex RT-PCR in CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single reaction with multiple primers multiplex PCR was used to detect and investigate the type and frequency in 200 CML patients among which 116, 33, and 51 were in CP, AP, and BC phase, respectively. RESULTS: The study included 200 CML patients, among whom breakpoints in b3a2, b2a2 transcripts were detected in 68% and 24%, respectively, while 8% of the patients showed both b3a2/b2a2. A statistically significant difference was seen between frequency of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts and gender (P = 0.03), molecular response (P = 0.04), and hematological response (P = 0.05). However, there was no correlation found between frequencies of BCR-/ABL fusion transcripts and other clinicopathological parameters like age, type of therapy, thrombocytopenia, and white blood cell count. CONCLUSION: Multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is useful and saves time in the detection of BCR-ABL variants; the occurrence of these transcripts associated with CML can assist in prognosis and treatment of disease.

KW  - CANCER
AB  - Radiation esophagitis is one of the commonest complications of the radiotherapy involving esophagus. It is characterized by diffuse radiotracer uptake in the esophagus on F-18-FDG PET/CT. Thus, it can be often confused with the esophageal malignancy. We present the sequential F-18-FDG PET/CT images of a 45-year-old woman with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who developed radiation esophagitis after chemoradiotherapy. It was confused with the progression of the disease, and the dilemma was resolved by the follow-up PET/CT.

AB  - Primary pulmonary leiomyosarcomas are rare and diagnostically challenging group of neoplasms approximately constituting 0.2-0.5% of all primary lung malignancies. They originate from the smooth muscle cells of the bronchial wall, blood vessels or from the pulmonary interstitium. Here we present a case of 45 year old male with history of chronic cough, breathlessness and chest pain for few months. Clinical and radiological workup showed a left upper lobe lung mass. Endobronchial ultrasound guided (EUS) needle biopsy of the mass on histopathology confirmed leiomyosarcoma. Further through evaluation ruled out the possibility of metastasis. A final diagnosis of primary leiomyosarcoma of lung was made and patient was planned for surgical management.

AB  - Superscan is a well-known finding described in skeletal scintigraphy characterized by intense radiotracer uptake in axial skeleton and decreased uptake in soft tissues and kidneys. Metabolic skeletal superscan has also been described in F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in various conditions. We describe here a case of 12-year-old boy who presented with a scalp swelling, progressive pallor, easy fatigability, poor appetite, and fever for 6 months. The initial diagnosis was inconclusive. F-18-FDG PET/CT revealed metabolic skeletal superscan and the final histopathological diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

AB  - Cancers of the breast, uterine cervix, and lip or oral cavity are three of the most common malignancies in India. Together, they account for about 34% of more than 1 million individuals diagnosed with cancer in India each year. At each of these cancer sites, tumours are detectable at early stages when they are most likely to be cured with standard treatment protocols. Recognising the key role that effective early detection and screening programmes could have in reducing the cancer burden, the Indian Institute for Cytology and Preventive Oncology, in collaboration with the US National Cancer Institute Center for Global Health, held a workshop to summarise feasible options and relevant evidence for screening and early detection of common cancers in India. The evidence-based recommendations provided in this Review are intended to act as a guide for policy makers, clinicians, and public health practitioners who are developing and implementing strategies in cancer control for the three most common cancers in India.

AB  - This report describes 6 HIV-negative patients including 5 children with scrofuloderma and an adult with lupus vulgaris, out of a total of 303 cases of cutaneous tuberculosis seen during a 41/2-year period, who showed a positive tuberculin test and granulomatous histopathology, but failed to respond to first-line antitubercular therapy. They were suspected to have multidrug-resistant infection as no other cause could be ascertained. Tissue aspirate or biopsy was sent for histopathology and culture. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from the aspirate in three patients and sputum in one with associated pulmonary tuberculosis. Drug susceptibility tests showed that all isolates were resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid, and one each additionally to streptomycin and ethambutol, respectively. In two, culture was unsuccessful. All were administered second-line antitubercular drugs. Clinical improvement was appreciable within 2 months as weight gain, and regression of ulcers, swellings and plaques. Two completed the recommended 24 months of therapy. Multidrug-resistant cutaneous tuberculosis should be suspected in patients with no response to first-line drugs, with clinical deterioration, and where other causes of treatment failure are not forthcoming. Owing to poor isolation rates on culture and low sensitivity of molecular tests, in such cases, a trial of second-line anti-tubercular drugs may be justified for a reasonable period of 2 months. Where facilities permit, culture and drug sensitivity tests should be done before starting treatment. Culture positivity is better from aspirated material.

AB  - A regulated protein turnover machinery in the cell is essential for effective cellular homeostasis; any interference with this system induces cellular stress and alters the normal functioning of proteins important for cell survival. In this study, we show that persistent cellular stress and organelle dysfunction because of disruption of cellular homeostasis in human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, leads to apoptosis-like cell death. Quantitative global proteomic analysis of the stressed parasites before onset of cell death, showed upregulation of a number of proteins involved in cellular homeostasis; protein network analyses identified upregulated metabolic pathways that may be associated with stress tolerance and pro-survival mechanism. However, persistent stress on parasites cause structural abnormalities in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, subsequently a cascade of reactions are initiated in parasites including rise in cytosolic calcium levels, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of VAD-FMK-binding proteases. We further show that activation of VAD-FMK-binding proteases in the parasites leads to degradation of phylogenetically conserved protein, TSN (Tudor staphylococcal nuclease), a known target of metacaspases, as well as degradation of other components of spliceosomal complex. Loss of spliceosomal machinery impairs the mRNA splicing, leading to accumulation of unprocessed RNAs in the parasite and thus dysregulate vital cellular functions, which in turn leads to execution of apoptosis-like cell death. Our results establish one of the possible mechanisms of instigation of cell death by organelle stress in Plasmodium.

AB  - Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that usually arise in the pleura or less commonly in relation to other serosal surfaces. Infrequent case reports of extra-pleural SFTs have been described at various sub sites within the head and neck area. We report a case of recurrent sino-nasal SFTs treated with surgery followed by re-excision and adjuvant radiation on recurrence and then salvage chemotherapy on progression. Further discussed are the challenges associated with accurate histological and immunohistochemical diagnosis, the difficulty in assessing the aggressiveness and malignant potential of these lesions and the appropriate treatment and follow-up duration that these neoplasms require. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of recurrent malignant sino-nasal SFT in available scientific literature in English language.

AB  - Eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have been classically described in young females in Western population. Recent research shows that they are also seen in developing countries including India. The classification of eating disorders has been expanded to include recently described conditions like binge eating disorder. Eating disorders have a multifactorial etiology. Genetic factor appear to play a major role. Recent advances in neurobiology have improved our understanding of these conditions and may possibly help us develop more effective treatments in future. Premorbid personality appears to play an important role, with differential predisposition for individual disorders. The role of cultural factors in the etiology of these conditions is debated. Culture may have a pathoplastic effect leading to non-conforming presentations like the non fat-phobic form of anorexia nervosa, which are commonly reported in developing countries. With rapid cultural transformation, the classical forms of these conditions are being described throughout the world. Diagnostic criteria have been modified to accommodate for these myriad presentations. Treatment of eating disorders can be quite challenging, given the dearth of established treatments and poor motivation/ insight in these conditions. Nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment, while pharmacotherapy may be helpful in specific situations.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of perioperative high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (PHDRB3T) in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS).
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: From year 2004 to 2010, 52 patients with localized STS were treated with wide local excision plus PHDRIBT followed by EBRT. Median size of the tumor was 8 cm (range, 4-19 cm). A single-plane interstitial brachytherapy implant with an average of nine catheters was performed during the surgical resection. The PHDRHIT was started on third postoperative day to deliver a high-dose-rate dose of 16 Gy in four fractions over 2 days using twice-a-day fractionation schedule. After 4 weeks, EBRT was started for a prescription dose of 50 Gy by conventional fractionation. Subsequently, chemotherapy was administered, if indicated as per our institutional policy. Patients were followed up regularly to study local control, survival, and toxicity.
   RESULTS: At a median followup of 46 months, no patient developed local recurrence, but 12 patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 67% and 63%, respectively. Main acute toxicity was delayed wound healing observed in 3 patients (5.7%). Commonest late toxicity was chronic skin/subcutaneous fibrosis noticed in 5 patients (9.6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The PHDRIBT combined with EBRT provides excellent local control and survival rates with acceptable acute and late toxicity in patients with localized STS. (C) 2015 American Brachytherapy Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tuberculosis can mimic malignancy, both clinically as well as on F-18-FDG PET/CT, leading to false-positive lesions. We present such a case of a 14-year-old female patient with ovarian Burkitt lymphoma treated with chemotherapy. On post-therapy PET/CT, F-18-FDG avid meningeal enhancement was seen which was suspicious for distant relapse versus tubercular meningitis. On cerebrospinal fluid examination, diagnosis of tubercular meningitis was confirmed.

   The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Ga-68 DOTANOC PET/CT imaging in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.
   Patients and Methods
   Data of 33 patients (age, 33.5 [13.8] years; male 14/female 19) with MEN syndromes (MEN 1, 9; MEN 2A, 19; MEN 2B, 5) who underwent 41 Ga-68 DOTANOC PET/CT studies were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty PET/CTs were done for staging and 21 for restating. PET/CT images were evaluated in consensus by 2 nuclear medicine physicians, qualitatively and semiquantitatively (SUVmax). A combination of histopathology, clinical, and biomarker follow-up was taken as reference standard.
   Results
   Of the total 41 Ga-68 DOTANOC PET/CTs, 34 were interpreted as positive for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and 7 as negative. The patientwise sensitivity of PET/CT was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80-99), specificity was 71% (95% CI, 29-96), positive predictive value was 94% (95% CI, 80-99), negative predictive value was 71% (95% CI, 29-96), and accuracy was 90%. A total of 74 disease sites were demonstrated on PET/CT, including 41 primary NETs (pancreas, 10; stomach, 2; pheochromocytoma, 10; medullary thyroid carcinoma, 19), 31 metastatic sites (lymph node, 15; liver, 10; bone, 4; lung, 1; breast, 1), and 2 parathyroid adenomas. Lesionwise sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of PET/CT were 93%, 96%, and 90% overall, 89%, 95%, and 85% for primary tumors, and 100%, 97%, and 97% for metastasis, respectively. Among primary tumors, the SUVmax of medullary thyroid carcinoma was significantly lower than gastro pancreatic NETs (P = 0.003) and pheochromocytomas (P = 0.003). No site-specific difference was seen in SUVmax of metastatic lesions.
   Conclusions
   Ga-68 DOTANOC PET/CT shows high diagnostic accuracy in MEN syndrome and can demonstrate both primary and metastatic NETs in these patients.

AB  - Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare condition characterized by clinical disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria. All genes mutated in MSMD patients are involved in IFN-gamma immunity. Autosomal partial dominant (PD) interferon-gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gamma R1) deficiency is the most frequent abnormality affecting the group of MSMD patients leading to impaired response of IFN-gamma. We describe here a patient from India with disseminated infection due to Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAC) including multifocal osteomyelitis and BCG disease. A heterozygous mutation in exon 6 of IFNGR1 gene was identified, conferring an autosomal PD IFN-gamma R1 deficiency. Patient had recurrence of mycobacterial disease during antibiotic therapy for which subcutaneous IFN-gamma was added as a modality of treatment for resistant MAC infection.

AB  - To evaluate safety and efficacy of 0.1 mg/ml versus 0.2 mg/ml mitomycin-C (MMC), applied for 1 min subconjunctivally, during trabeculectomy for primary adult glaucoma in previously un-operated eyes.
   This is a randomised controlled, non-inferior, clinical trial consisting of 50 consecutive POAG or CPACG patients uncontrolled on maximal hypotensive therapy, meeting all inclusion criteria. Patients were randomized into two groups and underwent a standard limbus-based trabeculectomy with MMC: Group I, 0.1 mg/ml and Group II, 0.2 mg/ml. The pre-operative and post-operative intraocular pressure (IOP), bleb morphology, and visual acuity were recorded every 6 months for 2 years. Complete success (primary outcome) was defined as IOP a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 15 mmHg without any additional medications at the end of 2 years.
   The average age of patients was 62.6 +/- 9.8 years and 61.2 +/- 8.1 years in Group 1 and 2, respectively; p = 0.57. The mean preoperative IOP was 22.5 +/- 1.4 mmHg and 23.3 +/- 1.8 mmHg; p = 0.10. The mean IOP at 2 years was 11.1 +/- 1.6 mmHg and 10.8 +/- 2.8 mmHg, a mean reduction in IOP of 50.6 +/- 1.23 %, and 53.7 +/- 2.25 % in Group I and II, respectively. The complete success was 92.0 % and 91.7 % in the two groups, respectively (p = 0.99), and there was one failure (Group II, post trauma). A wider bleb extent and larger areas of thin, transparent conjunctiva over the bleb were seen with the 0.2 mg/ml MMC group (p < 0.001) and in PACG eyes; p < 0.04.
   A 1-min subconjunctival application of low dose 0.1 mg/ml MMC is non-inferior to 0.2 mg/ml and is probably a safer alternative, as thinning of the bleb is significantly less frequent in the long term.

AB  - Purpose: Altered energy metabolism plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes and their prognostic significance in retinoblastoma (Rb).
   Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 109 primary enucleated retinoblastoma tissues for mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes and their expression was confirmed by western blotting.
   Results: Histopathological high risk factors (HRFs) were identified in 42.2% cases. Mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes III, IV and V were expressed in more than 50% of primary retinoblastoma cases each whereas mitochondria! complex I was expressed in only 29/109 (26.60%) cases by immunohistochemistry. Loss of mitochondrial complex I correlated well with poor tumor differentiation and tumor invasion (p < 0.05) whereas expression of mitochondrial complexes III, IV and V was associated with better survival (Kaplan-Meier method).
   Conclusions: This was the first study predicting a relevant role of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes and highlights the prognostic significance with patient outcome in retinoblastoma. Loss of mitochondrial complex I immunoexpression could prove to be a useful independent prognostic biomarker to identify high risk retinoblastoma patients. Differential expression of these mitochondrial complexes is a novel finding and may be used as an attractive future anticancer target in primary retinoblastoma tumors.

AB  - The department of neurosurgery at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) started its humble beginning in 1965. With the untiring and selfless hard work of Prof. P N Tandon and Prof. A K Banerji, the department progressed over time to become a center of excellence in the subcontinent. To establish a neurosciences center at AIIMS was an uphill task, which was accomplished with great efforts. The department has established itself as one of the highest centers of learning in the country with its vast infrastructure and diversity in all fields of neurosurgery. AIIMS, New Delhi was established by an act of the parliament in 1956. It was started with a grant from the Government of New Zealand under the "Colombo Plan." It was the vision of Rajkumari Amrita Kaur, the first Health Minister of India, that led to the establishment of a medical institute of international repute in India. AIIMS, New Delhi is an autonomous institute and is governed by the AIIMS Act, 1956. The department of neurosurgery at AIIMS was started in March 1965 with Prof. P. N. Tandon as the Head of the Department. Prof. A. K. Banerji joined him a few months later. The Department celebrated its golden jubilee in the year 2015,

AB  - Background. We aimed to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease among children with short stature at a tertiary care centre and to define the predictors for coeliac disease, if any, in them.
   Methods. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the case records of children and adolescents with growth retardation attending the Paediatric Endocrinology Clinic from January 2008 to June 2011. All patients underwent the multi-tier stratified diagnostic protocol for complete evaluation of short stature. Coeliac disease was screened using IgA-anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria.
   Results. Of 432 patients (238 boys) who presented with short stature, 72 (16.7%) had physiological, while 360 (83.3%) had pathological causes. Endocrine causes were growth hormone deficiency (86 patients, 19.9%), hypopituitarism (31, 7.2%), hypothyroidism (22, 5.1%) and others (7, 1.6%). The systemic causes were: coeliac disease (47, 10.9%), haematological diseases (14, 3.2%), renal diseases (11, 2.5%) and others (24, 5.6%). Chronic diarrhoea (OR 15.7, 95% CI 7.8-31.5) and anaemia (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-12.71) were significant predictors for coeliac disease in patients with short stature. There was a definite response to gluten-free diet in them and the mean (SD) growth velocity measured over at least 6 months of gluten-free diet was 8.1 (3.0) cm/year.
   Conclusion. Nearly 11 % of patients presenting with short stature have coeliac disease. In these patients chronic diarrhoea and anaemia were significant predictors of coeliac disease.

AB  - Single small enhancing CT lesions (SSECTL) have been very commonly encountered in clinical practice. These lesions typically are small (often < 20 mm), enhancing as a ring lesion or a disc and with varying amounts of surrounding edema. Most SSECTL present as focal seizures. Once the diagnosis of SSECTL and likely to be a solitary cysticercus lesion is made, the patient is given appropriate AED therapy. Depending on the resolution pattern on repeat imaging performed at intervals not less than six months if patient remains asymptomatic, cysticidal therapy is instituted along with AEDs. Any deviation from the classical clinical or radiological patterns needs further evaluation and other etiologies described for the SSECTL will need to be ruled out, including that of tuberculosis. Largely these lesions resolve and the clinical condition remains benign and in most patients AEDs can be withdrawn in two to three years period.

AB  - Background: The goals of treating ulcerative colitis (UC) have shifted from clinical remission to mucosal healing. Non-invasive biomarkers are required to assess mucosal healing as endoscopic assessment is inconvenient for patients. Enhanced expression of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3, a mucin-associated peptide) is observed after injury of the gastrointestinal tract. The present study was designed to evaluate TFF3 as a biomarker of mucosal healing in patients with UC.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included consecutive patients with UC (18-65 years old, disease duration >3 months, either left-sided colitis or pancolitis) who had a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) <6. Colonoscopy was done to assess the presence or absence of mucosal healing (defined using the Baron score) in all patients. Serum level of TFF3 was assessed in all patients and 20 healthy controls.
   Results: Seventy-four patients were included [mean age 37.2 +/- 10.9 years, 47 males, median disease duration 4.8 years (IQR 3-8.3), median SCCAI = 0] in the study. Forty-three patients had mucosal healing (Baron score 0 or 1) and 31 did not (Baron score 2 or 3). Median TFF3 level in patients without mucosal healing was significantly higher than that in patients with mucosal healing [1.5 (IQR 1.2-1.9) vs 1.1 (IQR 0.8-1.3) ng/ml, p = 0.01] and healthy controls [0.85 (IQR 0.7-1.2) ng/ml, p < 0.001]. A serum TFF3 level of <1.27 ng/ml (as determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve; area under the curve 0.73) had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 70, 68, 75 and 62%, respectively, for identifying patients with mucosal healing.
   Conclusion: Serum TFF3 can potentially be used as a biomarker to assess mucosal healing in UC patients.

AB  - OBJECT The surgical corridor to the upper third of the clivus and ventral brainstem is hindered by critical neurovascular structures, such as the cavernous sinus, petrous apex, and tentorium. The traditional Kawase approach provides a 10 x 5-mm fenestration at the petrous apex of the temporal bone between the 5th cranial nerve and internal auditory canal. Due to interindividual variability, sometimes this area proves to be insufficient as a corridor to the posterior cranial fossa. The authors describe a modification to the technique of the extradural anterior petrosectomy consisting of additional transcavernous exploration and medial mobilization of the cisternal component of the trigeminal nerve. This approach is termed the modified Dolenc-Kawase (MDK) approach.
   METHODS The authors describe a volumetric analysis of temporal bones with 3D laser scanning of dry and drilled bones for respective triangles and rhomboid areas, and they compare the difference of exposure with traditional versus modified approaches on cadaver dissection. Twelve dry temporal bones were laser scanned, and. mesh-based volumetric analysis was done followed by drilling of the Kawase triangle and MDK rhomboid. Five cadaveric heads were drilled on alternate sides with both approaches for evaluation of the area exposed, surgical freedom, and angle of approach.
   RESULTS The MDK approach provides an approximately 1.5 times larger area and 2.0 times greater volume of bone at the anterior petrous apex compared with the Kawase's approach. Cadaver dissection objectified the technical feasibility of the MDK approach, providing nearly 1.5-2 times larger fenestration with improved view and angulation to the posterior cranial fossa. Practical application in 6 patients with different lesions proves clinical applicability of the MDK approach.
   CONCLUSIONS The larger fenestration at the petrous apex achieved with the MDK approach provides greater surgical freedom at the Dorello canal, gasserian ganglion, and prepontine area and better anteroposterior angulation than the traditional Kawase approach. Additional anterior clinoidectomy and transcavernous exposure helps in dealing with basilar artery aneurysms.

AB  - A 49-year-old female with biopsy proven primary vitreoretinal lymphoma and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) presented with asymmetric involvement of both eyes. Right eye had primarily retinal and optic nerve involvement with no light perception while the left eye had purely vitreal form of the disease with visual acuity of 6/18. She was treated with recommended DeAngelis protocol for PCNSL and achieved complete remission of CNS disease and in the right eye and responded only partially to the systemic chemotherapy in the left eye. She received multiple intravitreal methotrexate injections (400 mu g/0.1 ml) for persisting disease in the left eye. However, she developed resistance to the same after repeated injections for which therapeutic vitrectomy was performed. She achieved final visual acuity of 6/12 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye and did not relapse until last follow-up of 2 years.

AB  - Background. Desensitization with intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab (I+R) significantly improves transplant rates in highly sensitized patients, but antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) remains a concern. Patients and Methods. Between July 2006 and December 2012, 226 highly sensitized patients received transplants after desensitization. Most received alemtuzumab induction and standard immunosuppression. Two groups were examined: ABMR(-) (n = 181) and ABMR(+) (n = 45, 20%). Risk factors for ABMR, pathology, and outcomes were assessed. Results. Significant risks for ABMR included previous transplants and pregnancies as sensitizing events, donor-specific antibody (DSA) relative intensity scores greater than 17, presence of both class I and II DSAs at transplant and time on waitlist. The ABMR- showed a significant benefit for graft survival and glomerular filtration rate at 5 years (P < 0.0001). Banff pathology characteristics for ABMR(+) patients with or without graft loss did not differ. C4d+ versus C4d-ABMR did not predict graft loss (P = 0.086). Thromboticmicroangiopathy (TMA(+)) significantly predicted graft failure (P = 0.045). The ABMR episodes were treated with I+R (n = 25), or, in more severe ABMR(+), plasma exchange (PLEX)+I+R (n = 20). Graft survival for patients treated with I+R was superior (P = 0.028). Increased mortality was seen in ABMR(+) patients experiencing graft loss after ABMR treatment (P = 0.004). The PLEX + Eculizumab improved graft survival for TMA(+) patients (P=0.036). Conclusion. Patients desensitized with I+R who remain ABMR(-) have long-term graft and patient survival. The ABMR(+) patients have significantly reduced graft survival and glomerular filtration rate at 5 years, especially TMA(+). Severe ABMR(+) episodes benefit from treatment with PLEX + Eculizumab. The DSA-relative intensity scores at transplant was a strong predictor of ABMR. Donor-specific antibody avoidance and reduction strategies before transplantation are critical to avoiding ABMR and improving long-term outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: Cyclospora cayetanensis is an intestinal coccidian protozoan that has emerged as an important cause of both epidemic and endemic protracted diarrhea worldwide. Though humans appear to be the only natural hosts; the role of animals as natural reservoir is uncertain but of increasing concern. The present study aimed to study the prevalence of coccidian in different groups such as immunocompromised, clinically apparent immunocompetent and healthy individuals. Also, the study isolates were assessed for heterogeneity among the sequences. Materials and Methods: Stool samples from different groups of patients were collected. The parasite was detected in stool by different diagnostic tools such as light microscopy and nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism using 18S ribosomal RNA as the target gene. Results: The prevalence of C. cayetanensis was 2.4% (19/800) in the present study. The PCR assay amplified Cyclospora cayetanensis DNA in only 89% (17/19) isolates. Further, sequencing revealed no significant difference among the study isolates and the non-primates. Phylogenetic analysis of the study isolates however, formed two clusters. While one cluster showed close evolutionary association with the C. cayetanensis strains, the other cluster showed evolutionary association with the two non-primate species. Conclusion: The methods described here for detection of C. cayetanensis oocysts are simple, efficient, specific, and sensitive and therefore can be effectively applied for laboratory diagnosis and environmental assessment of fresh produce and water sources. Clinicians should include Cyclospora infection in the differential diagnosis of prolonged or relapsing diarrheal illness even in clinically apparent immunocompetent individuals.

KW  - RNA-VLP complex
KW  - Chimeric RNA
KW  - HBsAg
AB  - Background: Assembled virus-like particles (VLPs) without genetic material, with structure similar to infectious virions, have been successfully used as vaccines. We earlier described in vitro assembly, characterisation and tissue specific receptor dependent Clathrin mediated entry of empty HEV VLPs, produced from Escherichia coli expressed HEV capsid protein (pORF2). Similar VLP's have been described as a potential candidate vaccine (Hecolin) against HEV.
   Findings: We have attempted to use such recombinant assembled Hepatitis E virus (HEV) VLPs as a carrier for heterologous RNA with protein coding sequence fused in-frame with HEV 5' region (containing cap and encapsidation signal) and investigated, if the relevant protein could be expressed and elicit an immune response in vivo. In vitro transcribed red fluorescent protein (RFP)/Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) RNA, fused to 5'-HEV sequence with cap and encapsidation signal (1-249 nt), was packaged into the recombinant HEV-VLPs and incubated with five different cell lines (Huh7, A549, Vero, HeLa and SiHa). The pORF2-VLPs could specifically transfer exogenous coding RNA into Huh7 and A549 cells. In vivo, Balb/c mice were immunized (intramuscular injections) with 100 mu g pORF2-VLP encapsidated with 5'-methyl-G-HEV (1-249 nt)-HBsAg RNA, blood samples were collected and screened by ELISA for anti-pORF2 and anti-HBsAg antibodies. Humoral immune response could be elicited in Balb/c mice against both HEV capsid protein and cargo RNA encoded HBsAg protein.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that other than being a possible vaccine, HEV pORF2-VLPs can be used as a promising non-replicative tissue specific gene delivery system.

AB  - Background: Essential Care for Every Baby (ECEB) is an evidence-based educational program designed to increase cognitive knowledge and develop skills of health care professionals in essential newborn care in low-resource areas. The course focuses on the immediate care of the newborn after birth and during the first day or until discharge from the health facility. This study assessed the overall design of the course; the ability of facilitators to teach the course; and the knowledge and skills acquired by the learners.
   Methods: Testing occurred at 2 global sites. Data from a facilitator evaluation survey, a learner satisfaction survey, a multiple choice question (MCQ) examination, performance on two objective structured clinical evaluations (OSCE), and pre- and post-course confidence assessments were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Pre-post course differences were examined. Comments on the evaluation form and post-course group discussions were analyzed to identify potential program improvements.
   Results: Using ECEB course material, master trainers taught 12 facilitators in India and 11 in Kenya who subsequently taught 62 providers of newborn care in India and 64 in Kenya. Facilitators and learners were satisfied with their ability to teach and learn from the program. Confidence (3.5 to 5) and MCQ scores (India: pre 19.4, post 24.8; Kenya: pre 20.8, post 25.0) improved (p < 0.001). Most participants demonstrated satisfactory skills on the OSCEs. Qualitative data suggested the course was effective, but also identified areas for course improvement. These included additional time for hands-on practice, including practice in a clinical setting, the addition of video learning aids and the adaptation of content to conform to locally recommended practices.
   Conclusion: ECEB program was highly acceptable, demonstrated improved confidence, improved knowledge and developed skills. ECEB may improve newborn care in low resource settings if it is part of an overall implementation plan that addresses local needs and serves to further strengthen health systems.

AB  - The aim of our study was to look for alternative predictive biomarkers for breast cancer management in limited resource setup. A comprehensive analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (CCFD) in serum at baseline was performed to assess its prognostic potential. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of ALU sequences using ALU115 and ALU247 primers was carried out in patients (N: baseline 148, postoperative 47) and 51 healthy controls. Mean serum DNA integrity, levels of ALU 247 and levels of ALU 115 were significantly higher in patients than in healthy females. No significant differences were observed in the levels ALU 247 and ALU 115 between stage IV and earlier stages of the disease. The DNA integrity was significantly higher in stage IV than earlier stages. A significant decrease in DNA integrity was observed after surgery (pre: 0.55 +/- 0.23 vs post: 0.43 +/- 0.30; P = 0.002) while no such change could be observed for ALU 247 and ALU 115. Baseline DNA integrity was significantly higher in relapsed patients than in patients who were free of disease (P = 0.005). Higher baseline DNA integrity was also indicated, though statistically not significant, in patients who died (P = 0.14). In contrast, ALU 247 and ALU 115 levels were decreased in died patients as compared to survivors (24.8 +/- 34.80 vs 73.5 +/- 170.83, P = 0.02 for ALU 247 and 41.0 +/- 47.99 vs 159.5 +/- 299.54, P = 0.005 for ALU 115). Baseline levels of ALU 115 and ALU 247 were lower in relapsed patients, though statistically not significant. In univariate analysis, the only clinic-pathological parameter associated with disease prognosis was tumor size. The hazards of 5-year overall mortality was 3.60 (95 % CI: 1.03 12.53, P = 0.03) among patients with lower baseline serum levels of CCFD (ALU 247 < 21 and ALU 115 < 41). Similarly the 4 year hazards for recurrence was 2.30 (95 % CI: 0.96 5.52, P = 0.05) among patients with higher DNA integrity. Baseline serum levels of CCFD and its integrity were found to be potential prognostic biomarkers in patients of primary breast cancer at our centre.

AB  - Rapamycin has been shown to protect against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) induced ischemic injury. In this study, the neuroprotective effect of rapamycin on the metabolic changes induced by MCAo was evaluated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of brain tissues. MCAo in rats was induced by insertion of nylon filament. One hour after ischemia, rapamycin (250 mu g/kg, i.p.) in dimethyl sulfoxide was administered. Reperfusion was done 2 h after ischemia. Twenty-four hours after ischemia phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) levels and metabolic changes were assessed. Perchloric acid extraction was performed on the brain of all animals (n=7; sham, vehicle; DIMS and rapamycin 250 mu g/kg) and the various brain metabolites were assessed by NMR spectroscopy. In all 44 metabolites were assigned in the proton NMR spectrum of rat brain tissues. In the vehicle group, we observed increased lactate levels and decreased levels of glutamate/glutamine, choline containing compounds, creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr/PCr), taurine, myo-inositol, gamma-amino butryic acid (GABA), N-aspartyl aspartate (NAA), purine and pyrimidine metabolites. In rapamycin treated rats, there was increase in the levels of choline containing compounds, NAA, myo-inositol, glutamate/glutamine, GABA, Cr/PCr and taurine as compared to those of vehicle control (P < 0.05). Rapamycin treatment reduced PLA(2) levels as compared to vehicle group (P < 0.05). Our findings indicated that rapamycin reduced the increased PLA(2) levels and altered brain metabolites after MCAo. These protective effects might be attributed to its effect on cell membrane metabolism; glutamate induced toxicity and calcium homeostasis in stroke. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB  - Background
   Recently various studies have demonstrated the role of promoter associated non-coding RNAs (pRNA) in dsRNA induced transcriptional gene silencing and activation. However the exact mechanistic details of these processes with respect to the orientation of pRNAs are poorly defined.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We have identified novel sense and antisense long control region (LCR) associated RNAs (pRNAs) in HPV18 positive cervical cancer cell lines HeLa, C-4 I and C-4 II. Using dsRNAs against these pRNAs, we were able to achieve upregulation or downregulation of the sense and antisense pRNAs and the downstream E6 and E7 oncogenes. We present evidence that knockdown of the sense pRNA is associated with reduction in E6 and E7 oncogenes and an upregulation of antisense pRNA. Conversely upregulation of sense pRNA is accompanied by an induction of the oncogenes and a concomitant reduction in antisense pRNA. Moreover, the exact role of sense and antisense pRNAs in dsRNA mediated gene modulation was confirmed by their selective degradation using antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Degradation of sense pRNA with antisense ODN led to loss of dsRNA induced silencing and activation, suggesting that dsRNA mediated gene modulation requires sense pRNA. Both processes were accompanied with congruent changes in the methylation pattern of activating and repressive histones.
   Conclusion/Significance
   Thus this data identifies and demonstrates the role of previously unknown important regulatory transcripts in HPV18 gene expression which can prove valuable targets in cervical cancer therapeutics. This mode of gene regulation by bidirectional transcription could be operational in other promoters as well and serve as a mechanism of regulating gene expression.

AB  - Background: Conventional total knee arthroplasty is performed with use of an intramedullary alignment guide, which produces elevated intramedullary pressure that can create fat emboli. Total knee arthroplasty performed via computer-assisted surgery does not require an intramedullary femoral rod, raising the question of whether computer-assisted surgery generates less embolic material than conventional total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to compare the emboli produced in the two techniques.
   Methods: Fifty-seven patients were randomized into two groups: the computer-assisted surgery group (n = 29) and the conventional total knee arthroplasty group (n = 28). An intramedullary femoral alignment jig was used in the conventional total knee arthroplasty group but not in the computer-assisted surgery group. Intraoperative invasive monitoring was performed with use of transesophageal echocardiography and a pulmonary artery catheter.
   Results: The mean embolic score was 6.21 points for the conventional technique group and 5.48 points for the computer-assisted surgery group (p = 0.0161). After tourniquet deflation, fat emboli were observed in the blood of five patients in the conventional surgery group and one patient in the computer-assisted surgery group.
   Conclusions: The patients in the computer-assisted surgery group had lower embolic loads compared with the patients in the conventional total knee arthroplasty group. In patients with an uncompromised cardiopulmonary system, the embolic load difference between the techniques was not clinically relevant.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the results of microkeratome-assisted sutureless anterior lamellar keratoplasty (SALK) with and without phacoemulsification.
   Methods: In this retrospective comparative interventional case series, patients with superficial anterior corneal opacity were divided into 2 groups. Eyes in group 1 (n = 6) had associated cataract and underwent SALK with phacoemulsification surgery (SALK triple). Eyes in group 2 (n = 6) did not have cataract and underwent only anterior lamellar keratoplasty. A 200-mm microkeratome head was used for host and donor cut. Fibrin glue was applied at the graft-host junction. Visual acuity, refractive error, topographic changes, and pachymetry were noted.
   Results: Mean follow-up was 9 +/- 2.7 months. The best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) improved significantly over the preoperative value in both the groups at 1 month, 6 months, and the last follow-up (P = 0.028). The mean gain in BSCVA was 8.8 +/- 3.4 lines and 6.8 +/- 5.2 lines, respectively, for groups 1 and 2 at the last follow-up, with no statistically significant difference in the BSCVA of both groups at the last follow-up (P = 0.80). There was no statistical difference at the last follow-up between the 2 groups with respect to spherical equivalent (P = 0.6), cylinder (P = 0.81), topographic astigmatism (P = 0.75), and graft thickness (P = 0.81). One patient in group 1 underwent graft rejection, which completely reversed with treatment. No cases of graft dislocation, infection, epithelial ingrowth, vascularization, or recurrence of primary pathology were noted in either group.
   Conclusions: SALK triple is an effective surgery for early visual rehabilitation of patients with superficial anterior corneal opacity and concomitant cataract.

AB  - TNF-alpha potently induces LOX-1 expression in THP-1 macrophages at concentrations between 1.25-50 ng/mL. The interplay between the two TNF receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) was apparent in the expression pattern of LOX-1 in response to TNF-alpha. Interestingly, R1 signal abrogation depleted both TNFR2 as well as LOX-1 transcript expression, suggesting that TNFR1 holds priority in the relative signaling mechanism between TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNF-alpha was also found to abrogate the oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) mediated increase in intracellular pool of NO, a known downstream intermediate of LOX-1 pro-inflammatory signaling cascade. At the level of ox-LDL clearance, TNF-alpha inhibited the uptake (scavenging) of ox-LDL via LOX-1. Our study demonstrates the ability of TNF-alpha to enhance the signaling propensity of LOX-1 by increasing its expression and inhibiting its scavenging property.

AB  - Bilateral ovarian metastasis from neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is uncommon. Ovarian NET could be primary or metastatic, and if it is bilateral, then the chances of metastatic disease are from 88% to 94%. Proper identification and appropriate management become necessary in such patients. Somatostatin receptor imaging by Ga-68-labeled DOTANOC ([1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid]-1-NaI3-Octreotide) PET/CT can be used for localization, staging, and restaging of NET, and it also has an impact on appropriate clinical management of patients with NET. We present here a case of somatostatin receptor expressing bilateral ovarian metastases from NET demonstrated by Ga-68 DOTANOC PET/CT imaging.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of initial topical medical therapy on newly diagnosed glaucoma patients using the Indian Vision Function Questionnaire (IND-VFQ33). Patients and Methods: The IND-VFQ33 was used to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) in 62 newly diagnosed patients with moderate to severe primary glaucoma and 60 healthy controls. IND-VFQ33 is a 33 item QoL assessment tool with three domains: General functioning, psychosocial impact and visual symptoms. The glaucoma patients were started on medical therapy and the QoL assessment was repeated after 3 months. Results: Glaucoma patients (mean age: 55.6 +/- 9.6 years, range 40-77 years) and controls (mean age: 54.9 +/- 6.7 years, 42-73 years) were matched with respect to age (P = 0.72), gender (P = 0.91) and literacy (P = 0.18). Glaucoma patients had significantly worse QoL as compared to controls at baseline across all the three domains (P < 0.001). 3 months after initiation of treatment, the overall QoL life significantly worsened from baseline with a decrease in general functioning (P < 0.001) and psychosocial impact (P = 0.041). Visual acuity in better eye significantly co-related to poor QoL at baseline (P < 0.001) and at 3 months (P = 0.04). In addition, the use of >2 topical medications significantly co-related to poor QoL at 3 months (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Evaluation using the IND-VFQ33 revealed that newly diagnosed glaucoma patients have a significant worsening of QoL after initiation of topical ocular hypotensive therapy. This should be an important consideration when educating patients about the disease and its therapy.

AB  - Objective of the studyTherapeutic options for pediatric Graves' disease (PGD) include antithyroid drug therapy (ATD) as the first line and radioiodine (I-131) therapy as the second line of treatment. To date, controversies persist regarding the true effect of prior ATD in the outcome of I-131 therapy in PGD. This study evaluated the effect of prior carbimazole treatment on the outcome of I-131 therapy in PGD.MethodsThis is a retrospective study covering the years 1995-2012, with a median follow-up of 75 months. Records of 114 children (84 girls and 30 boys, age range: 5-20 years, mean 24-h radioiodine uptake, 58%) who had clinically and biochemically proven Graves' disease irrespective of prior ATD therapy were included. All patients were treated with fixed doses of 5mCi (185MBq) I-131 for Graves' disease; 74 had undergone prior carbimazole treatment (group 1) and 40 were drug naive (group 2). The endpoint of follow-up was stable euthyroid or hypothyroid in patients. The effect of prior carbimazole treatment on the outcome of I-131 therapy in PGD patients was evaluated. The success of radioiodine therapy was defined as the cure of hyperthyroidism. Variables were analyzed to identify the potential predictive factors for euthyroidism/hypothyroidism after treatment.ResultsThe cure rate was 70% in group 1 and 83% in group 2 with a single dose of radioiodine (P=0.299). The success rate achieved at the end of 1-year follow-up in group 1 and group 2 was 81 and 87%, respectively (P=0.401). No independent predictor was associated with success or failure of treatment. At the median follow-up of 75 months (range: 12-216 months), 76% of patients were hypothyroid on replacement doses of levothyroxine and 24% still continued to be euthyroid.ConclusionPrior carbimazole treatment does not alter the outcome of radioiodine therapy in PGD.

AB  - Despite many advances in both diagnosis and treatment, tuberculosis still remains one of commonest causes of morbidity and mortality from any infectious cause in the world. Although the overall incidence and mortality rate for tuberculosis has decreased over the years, timely and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis is essential for the health of the patient as well as the public. For the diagnosis of tuberculosis, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required, and this becomes much more important in high-risk populations. Tuberculosis may masquerade as any disease; therefore, tissue and microbiological assessment is sometimes important for establishing the diagnosis. However, in daily practice, the clinician and radiologist should be familiar with the imaging features of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, as well as manifestations of tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients. Imaging provides a very important role in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis. Although chest X rays remain the basic imaging modality for pulmonary tuberculosis, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine techniques, including positron emission tomography/computed tomography, are extremely helpful in the assessment of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

AB  - Aim To study the short tandem repeat (STR) pattern of DNA from the blood, buccal swabs, and hair follicles of the recipients of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to examine whether these tissues contain donor derived cells.
   Methods The study enrolled 25 patients who sustained engraftment. Peripheral blood, buccal swabs, and hair follicles were collected on days 21-30, 90, and 180 after transplantation and the chimeric status of the recipients was evaluated.
   Results Donor derived cells existed in the blood and buccal swabs, but not in hair follicles, which can be used to obtain the pre-transplant sample of the recipient after transplant.
   Conclusion Peripheral blood and buccal swab do not serve as a reliable source of recipient's origin for DNA analysis of individuals who underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at least within 6 months after transplant.

AB  - Although regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been extensively studied in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, there is no uniform guideline or consensus regarding their use as a prognostic marker. This study describes the methodology used to develop an optimal threshold level for Tregs in these patients. Treg levels were assessed in the peripheral blood of 130 patients and 150 controls. Treg frequencies were linked to established prognostic markers as well as overall survival and time to first treatment. The cut-offs for Treg positivity were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A cut-off of 5.7% for Treg cell percentage and of 35 cells/mu L for absolute Treg cell count were determined as optimal in patients with CLL along with a median Treg percentage of 15.5% used to separate patients with low- and high-risk disease. The experiments presented here will possibly aid in the use of Treg frequencies as a potential prognostic marker in CLL.

AB  - Till today, there is no effective treatment protocol for the complete clearance of Wuchereria bancrofti (W.b) infection that causes secondary lymphoedema. In a double blind randomized control trial (RCT), 146 asymptomatic W. b infected individuals were randomly assigned to one of the four regimens for 12 days, DEC 300 mg + Doxycycline 100 mg co-administration or DEC 300 mg + Albendazole 400 mg co-administration or DEC 300 mg + Albendazole 400 mg sequential administration or control regimen DEC 300 mg and were followed up at 13, 26 and 52 weeks post-treatment for the clearance of infection. At intake, there was no significant variation in mf counts (F(3,137)=0.044; P=0.988) and antigen levels (F(3,137)=1.433; P=0.236) between the regimens. Primary outcome analysis showed that DEC + Albendazole sequential administration has an enhanced efficacy over DEC + Albendazole co-administration (80.6 Vs 64.7%), and this regimen is significantly different when compared to DEC + doxycycline co-administration and control (P<0.05), in clearing microfilaria in 13 weeks. Secondary outcome analysis showed that, all the trial regimens were comparable to control regimen in clearing antigen (F(3, 109)=0.405; P=0.750). Therefore, DEC + Albendazole sequential administration appears to be a better option for rapid clearance of W. b microfilariae in 13 weeks time.

AB  - To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on parameters of insulin sensitivity/resistance (IS/IR) and insulin secretion in subjects with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). A prospective double-blind randomized control trial was conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D on insulin kinetics in women with PCOS. The trial was conducted in a tertiary care research hospital. A total of 36 subjects with PCOS, aged 18-35 years, were included in this study. Vitamin D3 4000 IU/day versus placebo was given once a month for 6 months and both groups received metformin. IS (by whole-body IS index or Matsuda index), IR (by homeostasis model assessment IR (HOMA-IR)), and insulin secretion (by insulinogenic index; II30) were the main outcome measures. Secondary outcome included blood pressure (BP), lipid profile, disposition index (DI), and vascular stiffness. Out of 36 subjects who consented, 32 completed the study. Subjects were randomized into two groups: group A (n=15; metformin and vitamin D 4000 IU/day) or group B (n=17; metformin and placebo). Oral glucose tolerance tests with 75 g glucose were carried out at baseline and 6 months after supplementation. Hypovitaminosis D was observed in 93.8% of all subjects with mean serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D level of 7.30 +/- 4.45 ng/ml. After 6 months of vitamin D supplementation, there was no significant difference in any of the parameters of IS/IR (area under curve (AUC)-glucose, AUC-insulin, insulin: glucose ratio, HOMA-IR, Matsuda index, insulinogenic index, and DI), II30, and cardiovascular risk factors between the two groups. Supplementation of vitamin D, at a dose of 4000 IU/day for 6 months, did not have any significant effect on parameters of IS/IR and insulin secretion in subjects with PCOS.

AB  - Malakoplakia is a rare chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease, related to immune deficiency and impaired bactericidal macrophage activity. Common sites of involvement include urinary bladder and kidney followed by gastrointestinal tract. We present an unusual case of abdominal malakoplakia diagnosed preoperatively on ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). It presented as a large locally aggressive mass with extensive involvement of multiple bowel loops in an 18-year-old boy following blunt trauma to the abdomen. The demonstration of calcified laminated intracytoplasmic Michaelis-Gutman bodies in histiocytes is a reliable diagnostic feature of malakoplakia on FNAC smears, which can guide an appropriate medical management.

AB  - Drugs exhibiting anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties have been clinically used in the management of pain and impairment of joint functions in arthritis. In view of available studies on the beneficial effect of artesunate in various inflammatory conditions, the present study was carried out to evaluate its efficacy in ameliorating functional limitations of arthritis and to understand the underlying mechanisms. The study was carried out in rat model of Freund's complete adjuvant-induced monoarthritis where artesunate was found to produce a dose-dependent reduction in joint inflammation, improvement in functional parameters like stair climbing ability, motility, and suppression of mechanical allodynia at the doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg. Our study shows that protection afforded by artesunate was brought about by decreasing the levels of nitric oxide, influx of neutrophils, maintenance of oxidative homeostasis, inhibition of COX-2 expression, and apoptosis. Further, histological analysis of the arthritic joints also substantiated the anti-inflammatory property of artesunate. Thus, our study shows that artesunate has a potential for use in the treatment of arthritis.

AB  - Objective: To examine Juvenile Angiofibroma (JA) tissue for expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and to explore its relationship with puberty status, stage, recurrence and the intraoperative blood loss.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 36 histologically proven cases of JA. Minimum follow up period was 3 years. VEGF expression on tumor cells assessed by immunohistochemistry and graded on two criteria - percentage of cells expressing positivity and the intensity of positivity. These two parameters assessed for impact on puberty status, stage, recurrence, and blood loss.
   Results: VEGF expression noted on the tumor endothelial cells in 36/36, and on the tumor stromal cells in 34/36. The percentage of cells expressing VEGF and the intensity of expression were not significantly related to puberty status, tumor stage, recurrence, or intra-operative blood loss (p values 0.3-1.0).
   Conclusion: VEGF expression is near universal in JA. Such expression is independent of puberty status and stage, and does not impact on intra operative blood loss and recurrence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundSebaceous carcinomas (SBCs) are aggressive tumors with the potential to cause great morbidity and mortality. Poorly-differentiated tumors may at times pose challenges for the correct diagnosis. p40, a new antibody that targets a short isoform of p63 has been shown as a promising squamous cell marker. In this study, we sought to evaluate cytomorphological features of SBC and p40 expression analysis.
   MethodsA total of 29 previously diagnosed cases of SBCs including fine-needle aspirates and histopathology specimens from various sites were reviewed and studied for p40 expression. p40 nuclear expression was semi-quantitatively assessed. Adequate positive and negative controls of non-small cell lung carcinoma were taken for comparison. Expression pattern of normal sebaceous glands was also analyzed.
   ResultsOf the 29 cases, 13 (44.8%) were from the periocular region. The most common extraocular site was parotid gland. Morphologically tumors were categorized into well- and poorly-differentiated varieties based on extent of sebaceous differentiation. p40 positivity was seen in all cases of cytology aspirates and histology sections with similar intensity. No difference in percentage positivity of cells was recorded in well- and poorly-differentiated tumors.
   Conclusionp40 can be a valuable marker when evaluating tumors with possible sebaceous differentiation. Although p40 expression in SBCs is not as useful for the differential diagnosis that includes poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, this study, for the first time in the literature, highlights an important observation that p40 can be utilized as a marker for sebaceous lineage.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer has a devastating prognosis, and markers enabling a precise prediction of therapy response have long remained scarce. Better treatment monitoring would allow an individual's more effective patient adjusted therapy with lesser side effects and good clinical outcomes. In the present study, we monitored the serum cytochrome c levels pre- and post-chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Using highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we evaluated cytochrome c levels in serum of 100 non-small cell lung cancer and 100 healthy controls. We observed about threefold lower serum cytochrome c level in newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer patients than healthy individuals. Patients in advanced stages and grade 3 histological differentiation showed significantly low level of serum cytochrome c, and the lower levels were associated with worse survival outcome of non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, serum cytochrome c level was observed to be more than 13-fold higher after first cycle of conventional chemotherapy, wherein patients with higher level of serum cytochrome c before any therapy showed better response to chemotherapy in terms of significantly higher level of serum cytochrome c after first cycle of chemotherapy than patients with low level of serum cytochrome c at the time of diagnosis. Detection of serum cytochrome c levels at the time of diagnosis may be useful in suggesting disease severity and prognosis of the non-small cell lung cancer patients. Monitoring of serum cytochrome c might also serve as a sensitive apoptotic marker in vivo reflecting chemotherapy-induced cell death burden in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Telomerase Activity and Cellular Aging Might Be Positively Modified by a Yoga-Based Lifestyle Intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
KW  - STRESS
AB  - Objectives: Recent studies showed that a brief yoga-based lifestyle intervention was efficacious in reducing levels of oxidative stress and cellular aging in obese men. The objective of this case report was to assess the efficacy of this intervention in reducing the levels of biochemical markers of cellular ageing, oxidative stress, and inflammation at baseline (day 0), at the end of active intervention (day 10), and follow-up at day 90. Design: Single case report from a prospective ongoing study with pre-post design assessing the level of various markers of cellular aging. Setting: Integral Health Clinic, an outpatient facility conducting meditation and yoga-based lifestyle intervention programs for management of chronic diseases. Patient: A 31-year-old man with class I obesity (body-mass index, 29.5kg/m(2)) who presented to the medicine outpatient department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, with a history of fatigue, difficulty losing weight, and lack of motivation. He noted a marked decrease in his energy level, particularly in the afternoon. Intervention: A pretested intervention program included asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), stress management, group discussions, lectures, and individualized advice. Results: From baseline (day 0) to day 90, the activity of telomerase and levels of -endorphins, plasma cortisol, and interleukin-6 increased, and a sustained reduction in oxidative stress markers, such as reactive oxygen species and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy-guanosine levels. Conclusions: Adopting yoga/meditation-based lifestyle modification causes reversal of markers of aging, mainly oxidative stress, telomerase activity, and oxidative DNA damage. This may not only delay aging and prolong a youthful healthy life but also delay or prevent onset of several lifestyle-related diseases, of which oxidative stress and inflammation are the chief cause. This report suggests this simple lifestyle intervention may be therapeutic for oxidative DNA damage and oxidative stress.

AB  - Purpose. To determine the impact of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) in epilepsy surgeries on the extent of surgical resection and seizure outcome along with its feasibility and limitations. Methods. Patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (PRE), who underwent surgeries in operating theater equipped with high-field 1.5-Tesla MRI, were evaluated for extent of resection, operative time, scanning time, pathologies, resultant extra resection, and seizure outcomes. Results. Thirty-nine patients with mean age of 18 (range: 3-65) years with PRE underwent surgical intervention. Mean duration of epilepsy was 10.2 years. Surgical interventions included tumor resection (31%), resection of focal cortical dysplasia (28%), mesial temporal lobe surgeries (18%), and disconnection surgeries (23%). iMRI alone, apart from navigation and electrophysiology, improved resection rates in 13% (5 out of 39) of these patients. In lesional group, iMRI modified operative strategy resulting in increased resections in 21%(5/23) patients. Complete resection was observed in 87% of patients. iMRI scanning time constituted 25% (mean: 72 +/- 21 min) of time spent under anesthesia by the patient. Major and minor complications were observed in 2.5% and 7.5% of patients, respectively. The mean follow-up was 14 months. Favorable postoperative seizure control (Engel Classes I and II) was achieved in 85% and complete seizure freedom was achieved in 77% of patients (Engel Class IA) at 1-year follow-up. Conclusions. iMRI increases the extent of resection mainly in lesional epilepsy surgeries translating into good seizure outcomes but not found to be much beneficial in prototype mesial temporal sclerosis surgeries and disconnection surgeries.

AB  - Redox responsive biodegradable polymersomes comprising of poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactic acid-poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG-s-s-PLA-s-s-PLA-s-s-PEG] triblock copolymer with multiple disulfide linkages were developed to improve intracellular delivery and to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin in breast cancer with minimal cardiotoxicity. Folic acid and trastuzumab functionalized monodispersed polymersomes of size similar to 150 nm were prepared by nanoprecipitation method while achieving enhanced doxorubicin loading of similar to 32% in the polymersomes. Multiple redox responsive disulfide linkages were incorporated in the polymer in order to achieve complete disintegration of polymersomes in redox rich environment of cancer cells resulting in enhanced doxorubicin release as observed in in vitro release studies, where similar to 90% doxorubicin release was achieved in pH 5.0 in the presence of 10 mM glutathione (GSH) as compared to similar to 20% drug release in pH 7.4. Folic acid and trastuzumab mediated active targeting resulted in improved cellular uptake and enhanced apoptosis in in vitro studies in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo studies in Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing Swiss albino mice showed enhanced antitumor efficacy and minimal cardiotoxicity of polymersomes with similar to 90% tumor regression as compared to similar to 38% tumor regression observed with free doxorubicin. The results highlight therapeutic potential of the polymersomes as doxorubicin delivery nanocarrier in breast cancer therapy with its superior antitumor efficacy and minimal cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is seen in various malignant and non-malignant disorders. The relative frequency ranges between 0.37 and 6.5 % in western countries. The aim of this study is to analyze various etiology and prevalence at our tertiary care center and to compare our clinico-pathologic profile of this uncommon entity to western data. This is a retrospective observational study done in the Department of Hematology, tertiary care centre in northern India over a period of 21 months. Various clinical features and laboratory parameters of the cases showing BMN were noted from hospital records. Bone marrow trephine biopsies with BMN were graded semi-quantitatively according to the criteria laid down by Maisel et al. grading system into three grades I, II, and III as area of the biopsy showing necrosis like <20, 20-50, and >50 %, respectively. Bone marrow necrosis was observed in 1.8 % of bone marrow biopsies studied for various clinical indications over the study period. Median age was 35 years with male to female ratio of 3.4:1. Underlying non-malignant disease was seen in 64.4 % cases with tuberculosis as the most common etiology (59.32 %). Among malignancies, hematolymphoid malignancies were observed in 23.72 % cases. On semi-quantitative grading, bone marrow biopsies revealed grade I, II, and III necrosis in 62.71, 18.64, and 18.64 % of cases, respectively. BMN is rare clinico-pathological entity with a poor prognosis. Although the etiology of BMN is varied, this differential possibility should be kept in mind in any patient presenting with bicytopenia or pancytopenia especially in the setting of infection and malignancy. Tuberculosis should always be an important differential diagnosis in developing countries like India, before considering malignancy.

AB  - The aromatic compounds such as aromatic amino acids, vitamin K and ubiquinone are important prerequisites for the metabolism of an organism. All organisms can synthesize these aromatic metabolites through shikimate pathway, except for mammals which are dependent on their diet for these compounds. The pathway converts phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate to chorismate through seven enzymatically catalyzed steps and chorismate serves as a precursor for the synthesis of variety of aromatic compounds. These enzymes have shown to play a vital role for the viability of microorganisms and thus are suggested to present attractive molecular targets for the design of novel antimicrobial drugs. This review focuses on the seven enzymes of the shikimate pathway, highlighting their primary sequences, functions and three-dimensional structures. The understanding of their active site amino acid maps, functions and three-dimensional structures will provide a framework on which the rational design of antimicrobial drugs would be based. Comparing the full length amino acid sequences and the X-ray crystal structures of these enzymes from bacteria, fungi and plant sources would contribute in designing a specific drug and/or in developing broad-spectrum compounds with efficacy against a variety of pathogens.

AB  - OBJECT Spondyloptosis represents the most severe form of spondylolisthesis, which usually follows high-energy trauma. Few reports exist on this specific condition, and the largest series published to date consists of only 5 patients. In the present study the authors report the clinical observations and outcomes in a cohort of 20 patients admitted to a regional trauma center for severe injuries including spondyloptosis.
   METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted with spondyloptosis at their department over a 5-year period (March 2008-March 2013). Clinical, radiological, and operative details were reviewed for all patients.
   RESULTS In total, 20 patients with spondyloptosis were treated during the period reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 27 years (range 12-45 years), and 17 patients were male (2 boys and 15 men) and 3 were women. Fall from height (45%) and road traffic accidents (35%) were the most common causes of the spinal injuries. The grading of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) was used to assess the severity of spinal cord injury, which for all patients was ASIA Grade A at the time of admission. In 11 patients (55%), the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2) was involved in the injury, followed by the dorsal region (T1-9) in 7 patients (35%); 1 patient (5%) had lumbar and 1 patient (5%) sacral spondyloptosis. In 19 patients (95%), spondyloptosis was treated surgically, involving the posterior route in all cases. In 7 patients (37%), corpectomy was performed. None of the patients showed improvement in neurological deficits. The mean follow-up length was 37.5 months (range 3-60 months), and 5 patients died in the follow-up period from complications due to formation of bedsores (decubitus ulcers).
   CONCLUSIONS To the authors' best knowledge, this study was the largest of its kind on traumatic spondyloptosis. Its results illustrate the challenges of treating patients with this condition. Despite deformity correction of the spine and early mobilization of patients, traumatic spondyloptosis led to high morbidity and mortality rates because the patients lacked access to rehabilitation facilities postoperatively.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the presentation, treatment and outcome of testicular tumors in undescended testes (UDT) in boys below 5 y of age.
   Methods Case records of boys below 5 y of age, diagnosed to have germ cell tumors (GCT) in the UDT were reviewed.
   Results Seven children in the age range of 05-54 mo (mean 26 mo) were included. While five of these 7 (71 %) presented with abdominal mass [one antenatally detected], 2 (29 %) were detected to have a GCT during orchiopexy. In three of these five with abdominal mass, the alpha-fetoprotein (alpha FP) was markedly elevated. Two of these three with elevated alpha FP were endodermal sinus tumors while the third was embryonal carcinoma. The 4th patient with an abdominal mass was diagnosed to have an immature teratoma (IMT) while the patient with antenatally diagnosed mass had a mature cystic teratoma (MT). Both the patients with incidentally detected mass during the orchiopexy had mature teratoma (MT). All the seven children are alive and disease free at last follow-up.
   Conclusions Though rare, boys with impalpable undescended testes may develop germ cell tumors early in childhood. These can be managed with chemotherapy and resection and have a good disease free outcome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fungal granulomas of the central nervous system are rare and have a high rate of mortality and morbidity, irrespective of treatment. The authors report their experience of managing 66 patients during 15 years and discuss the clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathologic findings. This series is among the largest reported.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with intracranial fungal granulomas (ICFGs), treated in the authors' institution, between January 1997 and May 2011. Only mass-forming histopathologically proven ICFGs were included in this study.
   RESULTS: The age of the patients ranged from 7 years to 67 years (mean = 32.3 years), and most patients were in the third and fourth decades of life. The study population comprised 47 male and 19 female patients. The most common symptom was headache (41 patients), followed by vomiting (16 patients) and blurring of vision (16 patients). Only 3 patients presented with fever. The duration of symptoms was less than 6 months in all cases and less than 3 months in 39 cases. Anterior cranial fossa and frontal lobe was involved in 35 cases (54.5%), followed by middle cranial fossa in 20 cases (30.3%). Three cases had granulomas in the cerebellopontine angle. Three cases had multicompartmental involvement, and 4 had multilobar involvement. Nine patients had predisposing factors for fungal infection Based on clinical and imaging data, preoperative diagnosis of a possible fungal lesion was made in 44 (some had only computed tomography imaging) patients. All the patients were treated surgically, followed by antifungal treatment with amphotericin-B and/fluconazole/itraconazole for a period of 6 weeks. Eight patients had symptomatic recurrence of lesions 3-12 weeks after treatment and underwent reoperation. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Nine patients died in the postoperative period (within 30 days postoperatively). Fifteen patients died during follow-up because of recurrent lesions, repeat surgery, renal failure, and unrelated causes. Overall mortality was 24 (36.3%). Poor neurologic status before surgery, emergency craniotomy, severe brain edema with mass effect, and opening of ventricles during surgery were associated with poor outcome. Aspergillus species were the causative organism in an overwhelming majority of patients (n = 52) followed by Mucor in 7 cases, Cladosporium in 3 cases, eumycetoma in 2 cases, and maduramycosis and blastomycosis in 1 case each.
   CONCLUSION: ICFGs have high rates of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis, radical surgery, and antifungal treatment for 6 weeks may improve outcome. Poor neurologic status of patients at the time of presentation, immunocompromised state, contamination of ventricular cerebrospinal during surgery, and renal failure (attributable to amphotericin-B) are associated with poor outcome.

AB  - Background & objectives: Several diabetes prevention programmes have demonstrated a reduction in incidence of diabetes in individuals with prediabetes through weight loss. Short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention programmes have also been shown to be efficacious in weight loss. This study was undertaken to investigate if interleukin (IL)-6, vitamin D, neopterin, vaspin, and diabetes risk factors can be modified by a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention in overweight/obese subjects.
   Methods: In this pilot study, 34 overweight/obese [body mass index (BMI) >= 23 to <35 kg/m(2) per Asian cut-off values] individuals were enrolled, and received directly supervised intervention for 10 days. Thereafter, they were advised to follow this yoga-based lifestyle at home for one month, and were reassessed for study variables at day 30.
   Results: There was a reduction from baseline to day 10 in weight (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.001), waist/hip-ratio (p<0.05), blood glucose (p<0.01), and a significant improvement in lipid profile. There was a decrease in median fasting insulin (p<0.05), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (p<0.01), and IL-6 (p<0.05). A non-significant increase in 25-OH-vitamin D, and a decrease in neopterin and vaspin were observed. Twenty subjects returned for follow up assessments. At day 30, weight loss was sustained while systolic blood pressure also showed reduction (p<0.05). Changes in vitamin D levels were significantly and negatively correlated with changes in weight, BMI and fasting blood glucose, and positively with change in high density lipoprotein. Changes in body weight and BMI significantly and positively correlated with insulin. Changes in IL-6 levels positively and significantly correlated with change in neopterin levels.
   Interpretation & conclusions: the findings showed that IL-6, vitamin D, and diabetes risk factors were favourably modified by a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention in obesity. This study also highlighted the challenges in compliance associated with the follow up of subjects following an aggressive supervised intervention of 10 days.

AB  - Background: SLC30A10 mutations cause an autosornal recessive disorder, characterized by hyperrnanganesaennia, polycythennia, early-onset dystonia, paraparesis, or late-onset parkinsonism, and chronic liver disease. This is the first identified inborn error of Mn metabolism in humans, reported in 10 families thus far.
   Methods: Methods for this study consisted of clinical examination, neuroimaging studies (MRI), serum dosages, and SLC30A10 genetic analysis.
   Results: We describe early disease manifestations (including videos) in 5 previously unreported Indian children, carrying novel homozygous SLC30A10 mutations. Gait and speech disturbances, falls, dystonias, and central hypotonia were the presenting neurological features, starting within the first 5 years of life. All children also had severe hypermanganesemia, polycythennia, variable degree of liver disease, and marked brain MRI Ti hyperintensities.
   Conclusions: Our findings expand the mutational and clinical spectra of this recently recognized disorder. An early diagnosis is warranted, because treatment with manganese-chelating agents, iron supplementation, or their combination might improve symptoms and prevent progression of this otherwise potentially fatal disease.

AB  - Background: Abundant Larval Transcript (ALT) is one of the major groups of immune-dominant proteins produced by filarial worms during their larval stage. The major B-cell and T-cell epitopic domains of the ALT-2 antigen were mapped to develop a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) prophylactic antigen against lymphatic filariasis. Methods and Results: ALT MAP was constructed by solid phase peptide synthesis. The reactivity of whole ALT protein and ALT MAP against clinical sera described a high reactivity of endemic normal sera against ALT MAP compared to WbALT-2 protein. The antibody isotype pattern revealed elevated levels of IgG1 and IgG2 against ALT MAP, followed by IgG3 and IgG4. In this study we also analyzed the immune response pattern elicited by ALT MAP, ALT in mice models, which revealed similar pattern of humoral response, while low T cell proliferation in ALT MAP groups. The low proliferation could be attributed to T/B epitope arrangement on the construct, MHC restriction, and incomplete signal delivery by T cell receptor. Conclusion: The immunodominant epitopes in ALT MAP were found to play a crucial role in inducing high antigen specific proliferation. This revealed the significance of ALT MAP in stimulating innate immunity in offering protective immune response probably through the activation of complement cascade along with stimulation of cellular response. An improved understanding, including the construction of ALT MAP and parasite challenge study in jirds to determine the worm clearance would give a better insight in the characterization ALT MAP construct as a prophylactic vaccine candidate.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. For its early management and accurate prognosis, there is a need to develop automated and noninvasive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique(s). The present study proposes a novel region-of-interest (ROI) based CAD technique using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (Mm) to discriminate PD patients from healthy subjects. A volumetric 3D T1-weighted (1 mm isovoxel) MRI of 30 PD patients and age & gender matched 30 healthy subjects is acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Five well-documented regions affected in PD, namely substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, hippocampus, frontal lobe (FL) and mid-brain are analyzed individually and in combinations of pairs and triplets. Features are constructed from gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) values of voxel from these regions. A small set of discriminating and non-redundant features is selected using mutual information based approach in conjunction with unpaired two-tailed two-sample t-test based ranking. A decision model is built with the help of support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier. The performance of the decision model is evaluated in terms. of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to differentiate PD from healthy subjects with a maximum accuracy of 86.67% with SN for GM and combination of SN & FL for WM; and outperforms the voxel-based morphometry method. Furthermore, loss in GM and WM volume and gain in CSF volume is observed in PD patients in comparison to healthy subjects. The excellent performance of the proposed method is beneficial for clinicians as it can be used as a decision support system which requires less time and efforts in diagnosing PD. In addition, it also encourages the application of CAD in medical domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - AimTo compare the operation and reproductive outcome of hysteroscopic septal resection using unipolar resectoscope verses bipolar resectoscope.
   MethodsIn this prospective randomized study, 70 women underwent hysteroscopic septal resection using either unipolar resectoscope or bipolar resectoscope. Intraoperative parameters (operation time, fluid deficit and complications) and pre- and postoperative serum sodium levels were compared between the two groups. A second-look hysteroscopy was performed after 6weeks. All pregnancies occurring during the follow-up period were recorded.
   ResultsThere was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of operation parameters and second-look hysteroscopy findings. Six patients in the unipolar group were found to have hyponatremia in the postoperative period compared to none in the bipolar group (P=0.025). Regarding reproductive outcome, the difference between the two groups was not significant.
   ConclusionThe use of bipolar resectoscope is associated with lesser risk of hyponatremia compared to unipolar resectoscope. Bipolar resectoscopy is a safe alternative to unipolar resectoscopy with similar reproductive outcome.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate changes in ocular surface and central corneal sub-basal nerve fiber layer (SBNFL) after topical cyclosporin therapy in chronic glaucoma patients on long-term topical antiglaucoma therapy.
   Methods A prospective comparative study of ocular surface evaluation of chronic glaucoma patients on long-term topical therapy treated concurrently with a topical cyclosporine 0.05% twice daily for 6 months and controls was done. The study parameters evaluated at recruitment and at the 6-month follow-up included details of topical antiglaucoma medications, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, ocular surface evaluation parameters (TBUT, Schirmers I, ocular surface staining scores and ocular surface disease (OSD) index score (OSDI)), central corneal sensation (Cochet Bonnett aesthesiometer), and central confocal microscopy to study the SBNFL density (SBNFLD).
   Results Thirty-two eyes of 16 patients with chronic glaucoma and 30 eyes of 15 normal subjects as controls were studied. Mean TBUT, pre/post CsA treatment was 8.67 +/- 3.01/12.24 +/- 1.83 s (P = 0.007). Mean conjunctival/corneal staining scores pre/post CsA treatment were 3.38 +/- 1.93/1.50 +/- 0.718 (P = 0.00) /5.19 +/- 1.82/1.81 +/- 0.78 (P = 0.098), respectively. Mean OSDI pre/post CsA treatment scores were 30.63 +/- 14.61/14.76 +/- 6.06 (P = 0.007). Mean corneal sensations scores pre/post CsA treatment were 4.64 +/- 0.46/4.94 +/- 0.39 (P = 0.002). Central corneal SBNFLD pre and post CsA treatment was 8811.35 +/- 2985.29/10335.13 +/- 4092.064 mu m/mm(2) (P = 0.0001).
   Conclusions Schirmer's test, ocular surface staining scores, OSDI, corneal sensations, and corneal SBNFLD showed a statistically significant improvement following a 6-month concurrent topical CsA therapy.

AB  - Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with unknown primary (CUP-NET) are associated with a poor prognosis (10-year survival 22 %), grade 1 and 2 NETs having a more favorable outcome than grade 3 (also called carcinoma). There is evidence that an effort should be made to localize the primary tumor even in the presence of metastasis because resection of the primary tumor(s) may improve disease-free and overall survival, and because the choice of chemotherapeutic agent depends on the location of the primary tumor. Localization of the tumors remains challenging and often relies on a combination of radiological, endoscopic and functional imaging. The functional imaging protocol for evaluation of these patients has historically relied on somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS). However, the sensitivity and specificity of SRS may be unsatisfactory, especially for NETs of midgut origin. Newer PET radiotracers such as Ga-68-labeled somatostatin analogs (Ga-68-DOTA-SSTa) and F-18-DOPA have shown promise. In direct comparisons between Ga-68-DOTA-SSTa PET/CT and Tc-99m-HYNIC-octreotide/In-111-pentetreotide SPECT(/CT), Ga-68-DOTA-SSTa performed better than other techniques, giving a compelling reason for switching from SPECT/CT to PET/CT imaging. F-18-DOPA performs better than SRS and CT in well-differentiated NETs of the small intestine. For detecting pancreatic NETs, the high background uptake of F-18-DOPA by the normal exocrine pancreas can be somewhat overcome by pretreatment with carbidopa. We have suggested a protocol in which SRS is replaced by one of the two agents (preferably with Ga-68-DOTA-SSTa, alternatively F-18-DOPA) as first-line nuclear tracer for detection of CUP-NET in patients with well-differentiated NETs and F-18-FDG PET/CT may be an additional diagnostic test for poorly differentiated tumors and for prognostication. In the near future, it is expected that patients with CUP-NET will benefit from newly developed PET approaches (radiopharmaceuticals) and intraoperative PET imaging.

AB  - Objective: To determine tumor marker concentrations during normal and high-risk pregnancies. Methods: The present cross-sectional study included women attending the gynecology outpatient department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, between November 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013. Their serum was assayed for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3). Results: A total of 251 pregnant women and 31 nonpregnant women were included. Median CEA value was lower among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women (12 mu g/L vs 1.4 mu g/L; P = 0.006), whereas that of CA15-3 was higher (16.7 U/mL vs 123 U/mL; P = 0.03). CA19-9 concentration was higher among pregnant women aged 25-29 years (7.0 U/mL) or 30-34 years (7.2 U/mL) than among those aged 20-24 years (4.2 U/mL; P = 0.01 for both). The CA15-3 level was increased during the second (13.0 U/mL) and third (60.5 U/mL) trimesters compared with the first trimester (9.5 U/mL) (P 0.01 for both comparisons). It was also raised in high-risk pregnancies (33.7 U/mL), specifically pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (39.7 U/mL), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (64.3 U/mL), or heart disease (54.0 U/mL) (P < 0.05 for all). Conclusion: CA15-3 concentrations rise during pregnancy, but whether this increase can be attributed to physiological changes in breast tissue needs to be investigated further.

AB  - Introduction: The human peripheral auditory pathway in infants is a relatively less explored domain in auditory research. In the present study, the cochlea, auditory nerve (AN) and the cochlear nucleus (CN) were examined using immunohistochemistry and light and electron-microscopy.
   Methods: The study was performed on specimens retrieved from a 40-day-old infant who could not survive after corrective surgery for congenital cyanotic heart disease. The donation was done in accordance with the protocol approved by the Human Ethics Committee, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.
   Results: The AN revealed degeneration of nerve fascicles originating from the spiral ganglion neurons of the middle and basal turns of the cochlea. The proximal and middle segments of the nerve showed varying degrees of degenerating fibers with macrophages whereas the most distal part of the nerve showed dilated endoneurial capillaries without any degeneration. On electron-microscopy, the nerve revealed features of acute myelin-opathy. The differential perisomatic synaptophysin immunoreactivity was observed in the CN. The unaffected neurons showed strong microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) immunoreactivity, while those denervated revealed decreased staining. The VCN showed varying degree of parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) immunostaining with AN fibers and terminals showing strong immunoreactivity for PV. The AN revealed strong immunoreactivity for CB on the affected side. The spiral ganglion neurons did not reveal any pathological changes.
   Discussion: The results provide a cochleotopic map of the human CN that maybe relevant in better understanding of the tonotopic organization and will be helpful during auditory implants in children.

AB  - Background: Animate foreign bodies in the ear are frequent occurrences in otology practice. Such foreign bodies may lead to hazardous complications.
   Method: This paper describes a retrospective study of six patients with a recent history of an insect in the ear who presented with various complications following intervention received elsewhere.
   Results: An insect was retrieved from the external auditory canal in four cases and from the antrum in two cases. The patients presented with progressive otological complications: two patients who presented with orbital apex syndrome and cavernous sinus thrombosis succumbed to the disease; three patients suffered sensorineural hearing loss; and two patients had persistent facial palsy. One patient with sigmoid sinus thrombosis, who presented early, experienced complete recovery.
   Conclusion: Insects in the ear can lead to hazardous complications. Animate foreign bodies should preferably be managed by a trained otologist, even in an emergency setting. Patients with delayed presentation and complications have a guarded prognosis.

AB  - BackgroundInducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has a significant role in ischemia reperfusion (I-R) injury. I-R injury impairs the healing at the intestinal anastomotic site. This study was designed to assess the role of aminoguanidine (AG, a selective inhibitor of iNOS), in healing at the colonic anastomotic site after intestinal I-R injury in rats.
   MethodsFemale Wistar rats (n=60) were divided into three groups. Group I (n=15): sham operation, Group II (n=15): I-R injury and anastomosis, and Group III (n=30): I-R injury+anastomosis+AG-50 mg/kg. On the 7th postoperative day, relaparotomy was done and 4 cm of the colon with an intact area of the anastomosis was resected. Bursting pressure and histology at the anastomotic site were assessed.
   ResultsThe bursting pressure was significantly higher in Group III. In addition, bridging parameters (i.e., mucosal continuity, muscular continuity, re-epithelization, and granulation tissue), collagen pattern, and collagen density were significantly better in Group III. While the polymorphonuclear density was higher in Group II, suggestive of delayed healing.
   ConclusionAG, by decreasing inflammation and increasing collagen content in an organized pattern, helped in preventing I-R injury at the site of colonic anastomosis in rats.

   Methods: Twenty patients with stage IIb LSCD were randomized so that cases underwent either Lr-CLAL or KLAL. Fibrovascular pannus was removed and superficial keratectomy done on the recipient bed. Limbal lenticule of 2-3 clock hours' length was harvested from the donor, which was placed over the host bed and sutured followed by bandage contact lens application. Parameters assessed were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), conjunctivalization, corneal neovascularization, epithelial defects, corneal clarity, Schirmer's test, tear film breakup time (tBUT), and ultrasonic pachymetry.
   Results: At 6 months follow-up, the Lr-CLAL group had a higher gain in vision (p = 0.029), decrease in conjunctivalization (p = 0.009), and increase in Schirmer's values (p = 0.009).
   Conclusion: Lr-CLAL seems to have better result in terms of vision gain and ocular surface restoration.

AB  - Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 has high affinity and specificity for dopamine transporters and is useful for the evaluation of presynaptic dopaminergic function, especially in parkinsonism. There have been a few reports of extrastriatal pathological accumulation of Tc-99m-TRODAT-1. We report a patient with intracranial tuberculomas that were incidentally detected when he underwent Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 scintigraphy for an unrelated indication.

AB  - Cephalometric analysis has long helped researchers and orthodontic practitioners for evaluation of facial growth, understanding facial morphology and its ethnic variations, orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning for patients presenting with malocclusion and dentofacial deformities. Mostly, inaccuracy in cephalometric measurements is a reflection of errors in identification and accurate localization of anatomical landmarks. The accuracy of landmark identification is greatly influenced by knowledge of the operator and experience. Moreover, the process of manual detection is tedious and time consuming. Therefore, a need for development of robust and accurate algorithms for automatic detection of landmarks on cephalometric images has been comprehended. In this work, we hereby propose an optimized template matching (OTM) algorithm which could automatically localize hard and soft tissue anatomical landmarks on lateral cephalometric images. This algorithm was tested for sixteen hard and eight soft tissue landmarks chosen in 12 regions on 37 lateral cephalograms obtained from subjects of either sex covering wide spectrum of malocclusion cases. The results of proposed automatic algorithm were compared to that of manual marking conducted by three experienced orthodontic specialists. All the 24 landmarks (100%) were detected within 3.0 mm error range of manual marking, 23 (96%) were detected within 2.5 mm error range and 16 (66.6%) landmarks were detected within 2.0 mm error range. The optimized template matching (OTM) algorithm may prove to be a promising approach in automatic detection of anatomical landmarks on cephalometric images.

AB  - Purpose:To evaluate the test-retest variability of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) in measurement of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness.Methods:A total of 65 eyes of healthy subjects were enrolled in this observational cross-sectional study. RNFL thickness and GCIPL thickness were measured using the repeat scan optic cube and macular cube protocol using Cirrus HD-OCT (software version 6.0). A single operator obtained 3 measurements during 1 session to determine test-retest variability. Intrasession repeatability was defined by intraclass correlation, limits of agreement, and coefficient of variation.Results:The mean age of patients was 37.8915.11 years (range, 10 to 70 y). The mean RNFL thickness readings as measured during 3 sessions were 93.89 +/- 9.73, 93.63 +/- 10.00, and 93.55 +/- 9.64 m and average GCIPL thickness measurements were 82.90 +/- 4.61, 82.98 +/- 4.24, and 83.06 +/- 4.36 m, respectively. Coefficient of variation was 1.2 for average RNFL thickness and 0.82 for average GCIPL thickness. The intraclass correlation coefficient showed a good correlation between repeat measurements for both average RNFL and GCC thicknesses (0.994 and 0.990, respectively). The limits of agreement (95% confidence interval) for the 3 sessions ranged from -3.61 to 4.13 m for the average RNFL thickness and -2.55 to 2.40 m for GCIPL thickness measurements.Conclusions:In healthy eyes, Cirrus HD-OCT shows excellent intrasession repeatability for RNFL and GCIPL thickness measurements.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are prerequisite for the development of cervical cancer, with HPV16 and HPV18 being the most prevalent. Despite the fact that two prophylactic vaccines against HPVs are in the market, wide-scale application of the vaccine in developing countries is a major problem as far as cost of the vaccine and lack of therapeutic efficacy are concerned. Hence, the aim of our study was to develop HPV18 L1E7 chimeric virus-like particles (CVLPs) vaccine candidate possessing both, prophylactic and therapeutic potential against HPV18-associated cervical cancer. In this study, we have developed a potential candidate vaccine against HPV18 involving HPV18 L1E7 CVLPs, which was expressed in E. coli and assembled in vitro. These CVLPs were able to induce a neutralizing antibody response as well as a cell-mediated immune response in mice.

T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
KW  - Ballabgarh
KW  - Induced abortion
KW  - Abortion
KW  - Determinants
AB  - Background: Induced abortion has been legal in India on a broad range of medical and social grounds since 1980s. Often, induced abortion is resorted to as a means for contraception, and has a potential to be misused for sex selective feticide. We assessed the rates, trends, causes and determinants of induced abortions from 2008-12 in a rural community of northern India.
   Methods: Present study is a secondary data analysis of pregnancy outcomes at Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System from 2008-12. The data was retrieved from the Health and Management Information System maintained at Ballabgarh. Cause of abortion was self-reported by the women who underwent abortion.
   Results: Of the 11,102 pregnancies, 1,226 (11 %) culminated as abortions of which 425 (3.8 %) were induced abortions. Spontaneous abortion rate (7.2 %) was twice that of induced abortion rate (3.8 %). Both abortion rates had an increasing trend during the course of the study period. Self-reported reasons for opting for induced abortions were bleeding per vaginum (23 %), unwanted pregnancy (16 %), and unviable fetus diagnosed by ultrasonography (11 %). Eight percent of the induced abortions were due to the female sex of the fetus. About 11 % of the abortions were performed beyond 20 weeks of gestation which was the upper legal permissible gestational age for performing induced abortions in India. About 10 % of the abortions were performed by unqualified practitioners. Caste, wealth index, birth order and size of the village population were the factors that were significantly associated with induced abortion.
   Conclusions: Though the abortion rate was low, the proportionate contribution of induced abortion was more than what could be expected. Unsafe and sex selective abortion, though illegal, was prevalent. Upper caste and higher socio-economic status families were more likely to opt for induced abortion.

AB  - This article reviews the imaging anatomy of temporomandibular joint (TMJ), describes the technique of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) of the TMJ, and describes in detail various osseous pathologic afflictions affecting the joint. Traumatic injuries affecting the mandibular condyle are most common, followed by joint ankylosis as a sequel to arthritis. The congenital anomalies are less frequent, hemifacial microsomia being the most commonly encountered anomaly involving the TMJ. Neoplastic afflictions of TMJ are distinctly uncommon, osteochondroma being one of the most common lesions. MDCT enables comprehensive evaluation of osseous afflictions of TMJ, and is a valuable tool for surgical planning. Sagittal, coronal and 3D reformatted images well depict osseous TMJ lesions, and their relationship to adjacent structures.

AB  - Background: Tobacco burdens in India and Pakistan require continued efforts to quantify tobacco use and its impacts. We examined the prevalence and sociodemographic and health-related correlates of tobacco use in Delhi, Chennai (India), and Karachi (Pakistan).
   Methods: Analysis of representative surveys of 11,260 participants (selected through multistage cluster random sampling; stratified by gender and age) in 2011 measured socio-demographics, tobacco use history, comorbid health conditions, and salivary cotinine. We used bivariate and multivariate regression analyses to examine factors associated with tobacco use.
   Results: Overall, 51.8 % were females, and 61.6 % were below the age of 45 years. Lifetime (ever) tobacco use prevalence (standardized for world population) was 45.0 %, 41.3 %, and 42.5 % among males, and 7.6 %, 8.5 %, and 19.7 % among females in Chennai, Delhi, and Karachi, respectively. Past 6 month tobacco use prevalence (standardized for world population) was 38.6 %, 36.1 %, and 39.1 % among males, and 7.3 %, 7.1 %, and 18.6 % among females in Chennai, Delhi, and Karachi, respectively. In multivariable regression analyses, residing in Delhi or Karachi versus Chennai; older age; lower education; earning less income; lower BMI; were each associated with tobacco use in both sexes. In addition, semi-skilled occupation versus not working and alcohol use were associated with tobacco use in males, and having newly diagnosed dyslipidemia was associated with lower odds of tobacco use among females. Mean salivary cotinine levels were higher among tobacco users versus nonusers (235.4; CI: 187.0-283.8 vs. 29.7; CI: 4.2, 55.2, respectively).
   Conclusion: High prevalence of tobacco use in the South Asian region, particularly among men, highlights the urgency to address this serious public health problem. Our analyses suggest targeted prevention and cessation interventions focused on lower socioeconomic groups may be particularly important.

AB  - Dissecting antibody specificities in the plasma of HIV-1 infected individuals that develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) is likely to provide useful information for refining target epitopes for vaccine design. Several studies have reported CD4-binding site (CD4bs) antibodies as neutralization determinants in the plasma of subtype B-infected individuals; however there is little information on the prevalence of CD4bs specificities in HIV-infected individuals in India. Here, we report on the presence of CD4bs antibodies and their contribution to virus neutralization in the plasma from a cohort of HIV-1 infected Indian individuals. Plasma from 11 of the 140 HIV-1 infected individuals (7.9%) studied here exhibited crossneutralization activity against a panel of subtype B and C viruses. Analyses of these 11 plasma samples for the presence of CD4bs antibodies using two CD4bs-selective probes (antigenically resurfaced HXB2gp120 core protein RSC3 and hyperglycosylated JRFLgp120 mutant Delta N2mCHO) revealed that five (AIIMS 617, 619, 627, 642, 660) contained RSC3-reactive plasma antibodies and only one (AIIMS 660) contained Delta N2mCHO-reactive antibodies. Plasma antibody depletion and competition experiments confirmed that the neutralizing activity in the AIIMS 660 plasma was dependent on CD4bs antibodies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report specifically on the presence of CD4bs antibodies in the plasma of a cohort of HIV-1 infected Indian donors. The identification of CD4bs dependent neutralizing antibodies in an HIV-1 infected Indian donor is a salient finding of this study and is supportive of ongoing efforts to induce similar antibodies by immunization.

AB  - Enteric fever is a major cause of morbidity in several parts of the Indian subcontinent. The treatment for typhoid fever majorly includes the fluoroquinolone group of antibiotics. Excessive and indiscriminate use of these antibiotics has led to development of acquired resistance in the causative organism Salmonella Typhi. The resistance towards fluoroquinolones is associated with mutations in the target gene of DNA Gyrase. We have estimated the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of commonly used fluoroquinolone representatives from three generations, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, for 100 clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhi from patients in the Indian subcontinent. The MICs have been found to be in the range of 0.032 to 8 mu g/ml. The gene encoding DNA Gyrase was subsequently sequenced and point mutations were observed in DNA Gyrase in the quinolone resistance determining region comprising Ser83Phe/Tyr and Asp87Tyr/Gly. The binding ability of these four fluoroquinolones in the quinolone binding pocket of wild type as well as mutant DNA Gyrase was computationally analyzed by molecular docking to assess their differential binding behaviour. This study has revealed that mutations in DNA Gyrase alter the characteristics of the binding pocket resulting in the loss of crucial molecular interactions and consequently decrease the binding affinity of fluoroquinolones with the target protein. The present study assists in understanding the underlying molecular and structural mechanism for decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility in clinical isolates as a consequence of mutations in DNA Gyrase.

AB  - Aims Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) accounts for over a million premature deaths annually; however, there is little contemporary information on presentation, complications, and treatment.
   Methods and results This prospective registry enrolled 3343 patients (median age 28 years, 66.2% female) presenting with RHD at 25 hospitals in 12 African countries, India, and Yemen between January 2010 and November 2012. The majority (63.9%) had moderate-to-severe multivalvular disease complicated by congestive heart failure (33.4%), pulmonary hypertension (28.8%), atrial fibrillation (AF) (21.8%), stroke (7.1%), infective endocarditis (4%), and major bleeding (2.7%). One-quarter of adults and 5.3% of children had decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic function; 23% of adults and 14.1% of children had dilated LVs. Fifty-five percent (n = 1761) of patients were on secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. Oral anti-coagulants were prescribed in 69.5% (n = 946) of patients with mechanical valves (n = 501), AF (n = 397), and high-risk mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm (n = 48). However, only 28.3% (n = 269) had a therapeutic international normalized ratio. Among 1825 women of childbearing age (12-51 years), only 3.6% (n = 65) were on contraception. The utilization of valvuloplasty and valve surgery was higher in upper-middle compared with lower-income countries.
   Conclusion Rheumatic heart disease patients were young, predominantly female, and had high prevalence of major cardiovascular complications. There is suboptimal utilization of secondary antibiotic prophylaxis, oral anti-coagulation, and contraception, and variations in the use of percutaneous and surgical interventions by country income level.

AB  - To minimize cardiotoxicity and to increase the bioavailability of doxorubicin, polymersomes based on redox sensitive amphiphilic triblock copolymer poly(polyethylene glycol methacrylate)-poly(caprolactone)-s-s-poly(caprolactone)-poly(polyethylene glycol methacrylate) (pPEGMA-PCL-ss-PCL-pPEGMA) with disulfide linkage were designed and developed. The polymers were synthesized by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of e-caprolactone followed by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of PEGMA. The triblock copolymers demonstrated various types of nanoparticle morphologies by varying hydrophobic/hydrophilic content of polymer blocks, with PEGMA content of similar to 18% in the triblock copolymer leading to the formation of polymersomes in the size range similar to 150 nm. High doxorubicin loading content of similar to 21% was achieved in the polymersomes. Disulfide linkages were incorporated in the polymeric backbone to facilitate degradation of the nanoparticles by the intracellular tripeptide glutathione (GSH), leading to intracellular drug release. Release studies showed similar to 59% drug release in pH 5.5 in the presence of 10 mM GSH, whereas only similar to 19% was released in pH 7.4. In cellular uptake studies, dual targeted polymersomes showed similar to 22-fold increase in cellular uptake efficiency in breast cancer cell lines (BT474 and MCF-7) as compared to nontargeted polymersomes with higher apoptosis rates. In vivo studies on Ehrlichs ascites tumor (EAT) bearing Swiss albino mouse model showed similar to 85% tumor regression as compared to free doxorubicin (similar to 42%) without any significant cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin. The results indicate enhanced antitumor efficacy of the redox sensitive biocompatible nanosystem and shows promise as a potential drug nanocarrier in cancer therapeutics.

TI  - Dynamics of Influenza Seasonality at Sub-Regional Levels in India and Implications for Vaccination Timing
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - PATTERNS
KW  - TRANSMISSION
AB  - Background
   Influenza surveillance is an important tool to identify emerging/reemerging strains, and defining seasonality. We describe the distinct patterns of circulating strains of the virus in different areas in India from 2009 to 2013.
   Methods
   Patients in ten cities presenting with influenza like illness in out-patient departments of dispensaries/hospitals and hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infections were enrolled. Nasopharangeal swabs were tested for influenza viruses by real-time RT-PCR, and subtyping; antigenic and genetic analysis were carried out using standard assays.
   Results
   Of the 44,127 ILI/SARI cases, 6,193 (14.0%) were positive for influenza virus. Peaks of influenza were observed during July-September coinciding with monsoon in cities Delhi and Lucknow (north), Pune (west), Allaphuza (southwest), Nagpur (central), Kolkata (east) and Dibrugarh (northeast), whereas Chennai and Vellore (southeast) revealed peaks in October- November, coinciding with the monsoon months in these cities. In Srinagar (Northern most city at 34 degrees N latitude) influenza circulation peaked in January-March in winter months. The patterns of circulating strains varied over the years: whereas A/H1N1pdm09 and type B co-circulated in 2009 and 2010, H3N2 was the predominant circulating strain in 2011, followed by circulation of A/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B in 2012 and return of A/H3N2 in 2013. Antigenic analysis revealed that most circulating viruses were close to vaccine selected viral strains.
   Conclusions
   Our data shows that India, though physically located in northern hemisphere, has distinct seasonality that might be related to latitude and environmental factors. While cities with temperate seasonality will benefit from vaccination in September-October, cities with peaks in the monsoon season in July-September will benefit from vaccination in April-May. Continued surveillance is critical to understand regional differences in influenza seasonality at regional and sub-regional level, especially in countries with large latitude span.

AB  - Purpose: We describe a technique of air-assisted anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) implantation.
   Methods: Lens aspiration and ACIOL implantation was performed in patients with progressive subluxation of lenses associated with systemic disorders.
   Results: Surgery was performed in nine eyes of six patients. No intraoperative adverse events were noted. There was air leak from the main port in three patients while inserting the intraocular lens; however the ACIOL was successfully implanted after re-injecting air from the side port. The mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.67 to 0.25 log of minimal angle of resolution at 6-month follow-up. Mean intraocular pressure preoperatively was 14.54+1.38 mm Hg and 15.16+1.15 mm Hg at 6-month follow-up. Mean corneal endothelial count was 3,151+240.49 cells per square millimeter in the preoperative period and 2,947+194.9 cells per square millimeter at 6-month follow-up.
   Conclusions: Air-assisted ACIOL implantation seems to be a safe and effective technique for implantation of ACIOL in cases with progressive lens subluxation.

AB  - ExPress glaucoma filtration device (GFD) has recently become available in India as a surgical option for glaucoma patients. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of ExPress GFD in 12 eyes with advanced glaucoma with intraocular pressures (IOPs) not controlled on maximal tolerable medical therapy. The mean preoperative IOP of 29.58 +/- 7.13 mmHg decreased to 17.0 +/- 2.67 and 17.40 +/- 0.89 mmHg at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Absolute success (IOP <= 18 mmHg, with no additional glaucoma medications) was achieved in eight cases (66.7%) and qualified success (IOP <= 18 mmHg, with additional glaucoma medications) in two cases (16.7%) at 1-year after surgery. Early intervention was needed in 4 patients; two underwent anterior chamber reformation while the other two required needling. Two patients required resurgery. There was no significant change in the best corrected visual acuity postoperatively (P = 0.37). ExPress GFD does not seem to offer a benefit over standard trabeculectomy in patients with advanced glaucomatous disease in terms of IOP control or complication rate. However, due to the small sample size with a heterogeneous mixture of primary and secondary glaucoma's, we await further studies with a larger sample size and long-term follow-up, to see how the device performs.

AB  - Tc-99m-Methylene diphosphonate (MDP) triple phase bone scintigraphy (BS) has a role in early diagnosis of Kienbock's disease, especially when the X-ray is negative. Early diagnosis can result in prompt management of the patient since wrist pain in older individuals due to aging may go unnoticed or be due to other diagnoses with the production of greater damage and eventually a worse prognosis. Herein, we present a case report of a 29-year-old female with Kienbock's disease in whom the X-ray was negative and MRI incorrect. The Tc-99m-MDP SPECT/CT BS helped the diagnosis of the disease in an early stage (stage 1) and had a clinical impact on the patient's management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and SEMNIM.

AB  - Background: Ultrasound (US)-guided short-axis approach for internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation does not fully protect patients from inadvertent carotid artery (CA) puncture. Carotid puncture is not rare (occurring in up to 4% of all IJV cannulations) despite the use of US. Objectives: Compare the sonoanatomy of the "medial-oblique approach" probe position with the classic US-guided "short-axis" probe position, specifically: relation of internal CA and IJV; vertical and horizontal diameter of IJV; and degree of overlapping of IJV with CA. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients between the ages of 18 and 50 years, both male and female, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification system (ASA PS) I-II undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were recruited in this prospective, randomized, crossover, parallel-group study. Results: The transverse diameter of the IJV was found to be significantly higher in the medial-oblique probe position (p = 0.000, mean difference 0.43 cm; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.52). The percentage of overlap was also significantly lower in the medial-oblique probe position (48.7 +/- 10.7% in short-axis vs. 36.3 +/- 13.2% in medialoblique probe position; p = 0.000; mean difference 12.4%, 95% CI 9.1-15.8). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the anteroposterior diameter of the IJV between the two probe positions (1.11 +/- 0.26 cm in short axis vs 1.07 +/- 0.25 cm in medial oblique; p = 0.631). Conclusion: The medial-oblique probe position for IJV cannulation provides sonoanatomic superiority over the classic short-axis probe position. Further randomized, controlled trials may confirm the medial-oblique view's clinical benefit in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aluminum phosphide is one of the commonest poisons encountered in agricultural areas, and manner of death in the victims is often suicidal and rarely homicidal or accidental. This paper presents an unusual case, where two humans (owner and housemaid) and eight dogs were found dead in the morning hours inside a room of a house, used as shelter for stray dogs. There was allegation by the son of the owner that his father had been killed. Crime scene visit by forensic pathologists helped to collect vital evidence. Autopsies of both the human victims and the dogs were conducted. Toxicological analysis of viscera, vomitus, leftover food, and chemical container at the crime scene tested positive for aluminum phosphide. The cause of death in both humans and dogs was aluminum phosphide poisoning. Investigation by police and the forensic approach to the case helped in ascertaining the manner of death, which was accidental.

AB  - BackgroundData on patients with localized Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) who have received a uniform chemotherapy protocol are minimal.
   MethodsThis is a single institutional review of patients with ESFT treated between June 2003 and November 2011.
   Results224/374 (60%) patients with ESFT presented with localized disease; median age was 15 years (range: 0.1-55). Ninety-nine patients underwent surgery of which 50 received adjuvant radiotherapy; 80 patients received radical radiotherapy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At median follow-up of 40.2 months (range: 1.3-129), 5-year EFS, OS, and local-control-rate, were 36.83.6%, 52.4 +/- 4.3%, and 63 +/- 4.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, tumor diameter >8cm (P=0.03), symptom duration >4 months (P=0.04), and WBC >11x10(9)/L (P=0.003) predicted inferior EFS; spine/abdomino-pelvic primary (P=0.009) and WBC >11x10(9)/L (P=0.003) predicted inferior OS. Tumor size >8cm (P=0.03) and radical radiotherapy as local treatment (P=0.01) predicted inferior local-control-rate.
   ConclusionPrognostic hazard models for EFS and OS based on significant prognostic factors suggested that patients with combination of ESFT of spine/abdomino-pelvic region and baseline WBC >11x10(9)/L had inferior OS (hazard ratio 4.44, P<0.001) while patients with combination of ESFT with symptom duration >4 months, tumor diameter >8m and baseline WBC >11x10(9)/L had inferior EFS (hazard ratio 3.89, P=0.002).

AB  - BACKGROUND:Following gamma knife (GK) therapy for intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), obliteration of the nidus occurs over several years. During this period, complications like rebleeding have been attributed to early draining vein occlusion.OBJECTIVE:To evaluate if shielding the draining vein(s) during GK therapy prevents early draining vein obliteration and complications following GK therapy.METHODS:This was a nonrandomized case-control study over 5 years (January 2009-February 2014) and included patients with intracranial AVM who underwent GK therapy at our center. All patients who underwent draining vein shielding by the senior author (D.A.) were included in the test group, and patients who did not undergo draining vein shielding were put in the control group. Patients were followed up for at least 6 months (and every 6 months thereafter) clinically as well as radiologically with computed tomography head scans/magnetic resonance imaging brain scans to check for postradiosurgery imaging (PRI) changes.RESULTS:One hundred eighty-five patients were included in this study, of which 96 were in the control group and 89 were in the test group. Both groups were well matched in demographics, comorbidities, adjuvant treatment, angioarchitecture, and radiation dosing. Because of shielding, the test group patients received significantly less radiation to the draining vein than the control group (P = .001). On follow-up, a significantly lower number of patients in the test group had new neurological deficits (P = .001), intracranial hemorrhage (P = .03), and PRI changes (P = .002).CONCLUSION:Shielding of the draining vein is a potent new strategy in minimizing PRI and hemorrhage as well as clinical deterioration following GK therapy for intracranial AVMs.ABBREVIATIONS:AVM, arteriovenous malformationDSA, digital subtraction angiographyDV, draining veinDVS, draining vein shieldingGK, gamma knifePRI, postradiosurgery imagingSD, standard deviationSM, Spetzler-Martin

AB  - Purpose Hemangiopericytoma is a rare tumor of CNS with potential for recurrence and widespread metastasis, even outside CNS with even rare involvement of spinal cord. This case series presents five patients to evaluate the clinical presentation, radiological features, management, pathology and outcome of spinal hemangiopericytomas.
   Methods Between 2004 and 2013, five patients underwent surgery for spinal hemangiopericytoma. Histopathological data were reviewed in all cases and clinical and follow-up details were collected from the data available in our department.
   Results There were three males and two females, including one pediatric patient. Three patients had dorsal spine involvement and two patients had involvement of cervical spine. There were two patients with intradural extramedullary tumors, one patient each with pure intramedullary tumor, pure extradural tumor and both intra and extradural tumor. All of them presented with motor weakness. Gross total resection of the tumor was done in three patients. Four patients received post-operative radiotherapy. Histopathology showed anaplastic tumor in four cases with high MIB-1 LI. Most of them were positive for CD34, mic-2 and bcl-2. Three patients who underwent gross total resection improved significantly in the follow-up period. Two patients who underwent subtotal resection expired due to spread of their disease.
   Conclusion Spinal hemangiopericytoma is a rare tumor. Strong clinical suspicion is required to diagnose it preoperatively. Gross total resection is the goal and radiotherapy should be given in case of residual tumor or high-grade tumors.

AB  - Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon cause of stroke with extremely varied clinical presentations, predisposing factors, imaging findings, and outcomes, and thus can be extremely challenging to diagnose. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of CVT is crucial because timely and appropriate therapy can reverse the disease process and significantly reduce the risk of acute complications and long-term squel. In this article, we have reviewed the epidemiology, causative factors, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of CVT from an Indian perspective. Over the last decade, a change in trends in the causative factors has been noted from India.

TI  - The extraction of maxillary lateral incisors for the treatment of a Class II crowded malocclusion: a case report
T2  - AUSTRALIAN ORTHODONTIC JOURNAL
KW  - THERAPY
KW  - CANINE
AB  - Background: The extraction of an upper lateral incisor for orthodontic purposes is rare and must be adequately justified. Aim: The present case report describes the management of a skeletal Class II crowded malocclusion that was facilitated by the extraction of upper lateral incisors and lower first premolars.
   Methods: A 14-year-old male patient presented with a skeletal Class II crowded malocclusion with associated speech and chewing difficulties. Phase I of treatment involved the extraction of the upper lateral incisors and functional appliance therapy. Phase II included the extraction of lower first premolars and mechanotherapy using full fixed appliances.
   Results: An improvement in aesthetics and sagittal relations was achieved during phase I therapy as the mandible was advanced over a period of eight months. Mandibular skeletal change was 6.5 mm observed at pogonion. During phase II therapy, the maxillary canines were substituted for lateral incisors and a functional occlusion was achieved. The skeletal correction and occlusion were stable one year after debonding.
   Conclusion: The present case indicated that the timely extraction of palatally-placed maxillary lateral incisors facilitated functional appliance therapy in the management of a skeletal Class II problem. The crowding of the lower anterior teeth was relieved and alignment of the upper arch was achieved with full fixed appliance therapy, resulting in improved aesthetics and a stable occlusion at one year review.

AB  - Background
   Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) infect over a billion individuals worldwide. In India, 241 million children are estimated to need deworming to avert the negative consequences STH infections can have on child health and development. In February-April 2011, 17 million children in Bihar State were dewormed during a government-led school-based deworming campaign. Prior to programme implementation, a study was conducted to assess STH prevalence in the school-age population to direct the programme. The study also investigated risk factors for STH infections, including caste, literacy, and defecation and hygiene practices, in order to inform the development of complementary interventions.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted among children in 20 schools in Bihar. In addition to providing stool samples for identification of STH infections, children completed a short questionnaire detailing their usual defecation and hand-hygiene practices. Risk factors for STH infections were explored.
   Results
   In January-February 2011, 1279 school children aged four to seventeen provided stool samples and 1157 children also completed the questionnaire. Overall, 68% of children (10-86% across schools) were infected with one or more soil-transmitted helminth species. The prevalence of ascariasis, hookworm and trichuriasis was 52%, 42% and 5% respectively. The majority of children (95%) practiced open defecation and reported most frequently cleansing hands with soil (61%). Increasing age, lack of maternal literacy and certain castes were independently associated with hookworm infection. Absence of a hand-washing station at the schools was also independently associated with A. lumbricoides infection.
   Conclusions
   STH prevalence in Bihar is high, and justifies mass deworming in school-aged children. Open defecation is common-place and hands are often cleansed using soil. The findings reported here can be used to help direct messaging appropriate to mothers with low levels of literacy and emphasise the importance of water and sanitation in the control of helminths and other diseases.

AB  - Various micronutrients are essential for optimal functioning of the peripheral nervous system. Serum vitamin E, vitamin B-12, and folic acid were estimated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors aged between 5 and 18 years in first continuous remission within 3 years of completion of vincristine-based chemotherapy with and without electrophysiologically defined neuropathy. A total of 80 children were studied. Neuropathy was seen in 27 (33.75%) children electrophysiologically. None of the children had vitamin E deficiency. However, the alpha tocopherol/(cholesterol + triglyceride) ratio was significantly lower in children with neuropathy (P = .05). The prevalence of folate (P = .48) and vitamin B-12 (P = .21) deficiency in children with and without neuropathy was not significantly different. Thus, the prevalence of deficiencies of these micronutrients was not significantly different in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors with or without electrophysiologically defined neuropathy.

AB  - This study was devised to translate Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised to Hindi and administer it to Indian children and adolescents diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.
   Cross-sectional study.
   This study was carried out in cystic fibrosis patients attending Pediatric Chest Clinic of a tertiary-care hospital in Northern India from July 2012 to December 2012.
   45 children (6-13 years) and their parents, and 14 adolescents. Patients with unstable health in the past two weeks were excluded.
   Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- Revised translated in Hindi was administered. Clinical evaluation and scoring, throat swab cultures and spirometry were also done during the same visit.
   Health Related Quality of Life scores were the primary measures, and clinical scores, swab cultures and spirometry were secondary measures.
   Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.020-0.863.The Factor analysis indicated that most test-items correlated more with competing scales than the intended scales. Convergence between self and proxy-rating was found to be dependent on the domain. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised scores correlated well with clinical scores (r=0.65,P=0.011), Pseudomonas spp culture data and pulmonary function tests. There was an inverse relation between Health Related Quality of Life scores and age at diagnosis (r=-0.339, P=0.02).
   Hindi versions of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- Revised: Child, Adolescent and Parents' instruments will act as an important step towards data on Health Related Quality of Life of Indian patients with cystic fibrosis.

AB  - Background. The prevalence of diabetes in India is rising. It is also occurring at a younger age. Ulcers on the foot in patients with diabetes are a common cause of amputations and are largely preventable. We assessed the awareness of foot care among patients with diabetes attending a tertiary care hospital in northern India and whether this varied with the level of healthcare availed, i.e. primary, secondary or tertiary.
   Methods. A scored questionnaire was designed based on foot care practices advised by the American Diabetes Association as part of the national diabetes education programme. It was administered to 400 patients and a total foot care score was calculated and correlated with various variables.
   Results. Only 50 of 400 patients (12.5%) had received previous foot care advice from healthcare professionals, and 193 (48.2%), 28 (7%) and 179 (44.8 %) patients were being taken care of by primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare systems, respectively. Almost one-quarter of patients were uneducated. The mean foot care score in all three groups was 5 of a maximum of 14, which was poor.
   Conclusion. The awareness of foot care among people with diabetes is low among those attending all levels of healthcare: primary, secondary and tertiary. It is necessary to educate people about foot care, lack of which will lead to a huge financial and health burden due to preventable complications of diabetes.

AB  - Background and Purpose The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the precise association between beta-2 adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) polymorphism and Ischemic stroke.
   Methods Published case control studies on association between beta 2AR and ischemic stroke were searched from electronic databases. Pooled Odds ratio and 95% Confidence interval were calculated by using software Rev Man version 5.2.
   Results A total of three studies involving 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls, which were published from 2007 to 2014, were subjected to meta-analysis for allelic association and 518 cases and 510 controls for genotypic association. Pooled analysis of two studies for genotypic association suggested that subjects carrying Gln27Glu polymorphism of beta 2AR had an increased risk for Ischemic stroke under recessive model (OR 2.09; 95% Cl; 1.20 to 3.64) and under dominant model (OR 1.47; 95% Cl 1.14 to 1.90). Pooled analysis of three studies for allelic association showed a significantly higher Glu27 allele of beta 2AR in the patients with ischemic stroke (OR 1.58; 95% Cl; 1.38 to 1.81).
   Conclusions The present meta-analysis suggests that Gln27Glu polymorphism of beta 2AR gene is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke.

AB  - Extramedullary relapse in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is rare, but occurs most commonly in central nervous system (CNS), generally in high-risk cases (total leucocyte count 10,000/mu L, atypical morphology or disseminated intravascular coagulation at presentation), and concomitant with bone marrow (BM) relapse. Here, we describe a case of APL who except for CD56 positivity was low risk but had a CNS relapse without concomitant BM involvement. Diagnosis of isolated CNS relapse was based on characteristic tear-drop pattern for CD45/side scatter plot on flow cytometry, a full compatible immunophenotype and cytomorphology in the cerebrospinal fluid. The case illustrates the value of the latter and the importance of including CD56 in risk assessment of APL. (c) 2014 International Clinical Cytometry Society

AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to evaluate gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (GMPS) in the prediction of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in nonischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy patients.Patients and methodsThirty-two patients (23 men, mean age 57.512.1 years) with severe heart failure, who were selected for CRT implantation, were prospectively included in this study. Patients with coronary heart disease and structural heart diseases were excluded. Tc-99m-MIBI GMPS and clinical evaluation were performed at baseline and 3 months after CRT implantation. In GMPS, first-harmonic fast Fourier transform was used to extract a phase array using commercially available software. Phase standard deviation (PSD) and phase histogram bandwidth (PHB) were used to quantify cardiac mechanical dyssynchrony (CMD). Left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated.ResultsAt baseline evaluation the mean NYHA class was 3.3 +/- 0.5, left ventricular ejection fraction was 23.2 +/- 5.3% and mean QRS duration was 150.3 +/- 18.2ms. PSD was 55.8 +/- 19.2 degrees and PHB was 182.1 +/- 75.8 degrees. At 3-month follow-up, 22 patients responded to CRT with improvement in NYHA class by more than 1 grade and in ejection fraction by more than 5%. Responders had significantly larger PSD (63.6 +/- 16.6 vs. 38.7 +/- 12.7 degrees) and PHB (214.8 +/- 63.9 vs. 110.2 +/- 43.5 degrees) compared with nonresponders. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated 86% sensitivity and 80% specificity at a cutoff value of 43 degrees for PSD and 86% sensitivity and 80% specificity at a cutoff value of 128 degrees for PHB in the prediction of response to CRT.ConclusionBaseline PSD and PHB derived from GMPS are useful for prediction of response to CRT in nonischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy patients.

AB  - BackgroundFrequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction (HVOTO) is unclear and risk factors in HVOTO associated with HCC are unknown.
   AimTo assess the incidence of HCC and to identify risk factors for HCC in primary HVOTO.
   MethodsIn the consecutive primary HVOTO patients evaluated between 1989 to 2013, the incidence of HCC among HVOTO was assessed in a retrospective cohort study and identification of the risk factors for HCC in HVOTO patients done by a case-control study.
   ResultsOf the 421 HVOTO patients, 8 had HCC at presentation (prevalence 1.9%). Another 8 of the remaining 413 developed HCC during 2076.2 person-years follow-up (mean 5.03+4.65years, range 0.08-20years). The cumulative incidence of HCC was 3.5% (95% CI 1.28-9.2%) at 10years. The case-control study included 16 HCC as cases and remaining 405 as controls. Controls were predominantly males (M:F - 230:175), mean age 2910.3years. Cases were predominantly females with an older age of 36.2 +/- 11.4years (P<0.01, OR=1.06, CI 1.0-1.10%). Presence of cirrhosis (P<0.001), combined inferior vena cava (IVC) and hepatic vein (HV) block (P<0.03, OR=5.58, CI 1.43-25.30%) and long-segment IVC block (P<0.02, OR=6.50, CI 1.32-32.0%) were significantly higher among cases than controls.
   ConclusionsHepatic venous outflow tract obstruction is a risk factor for HCC. The cumulative incidence of HCC in HVOTO is low and progressively increases over time. Those with liver cirrhosis, combined IVC and HV block and long-segment IVC block are at risk to develop HCC and need active surveillance.

AB  - ProblemTo determine the role of inactivated GSK3 with respect to Wnt/-catenin pathway activation in HPV-16/18-associated cervical cancer.
   Method of studyThe expression of active (pGSK3-Try(216)), inactive (pGSK3-Ser(9)), and c-Myc as well as HPV-16/18 infection was analyzed in cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs) and normal by immunohistochemistry and multiplex PCR. The proteins level was also compared with -catenin and APC expression.
   ResultsThe dramatic decrease of pGSK3-Try(216) expression but ectopic overexpression of pGSK3-Ser(9) and c-Myc was observed both in CIN and SCCs samples compared to normal tissues. 57/67 CIN and 132/153 SCCs showed HPV-16 infection, while 3/67 CIN and 4/153 SCCs were harbored with HPV-18 infection. Both the proteins were significantly upregulated in HPV-16 infected cases (P=0.0001; P=0.001) and also positively correlated with nuclear -catenin (P=0.0001; P=0.0001).
   ConclusionThe process of generation of HPV-16-associated cervical tumorigenesis is synergized with GSK3 inactivation and overactivation of Wnt/-catenin pathway.

AB  - Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) can be caused due to diverse factors with thrombophilia being one of them. The association of various thrombophilic risk factors with RPL is inconsistent in different studies and the frequency of these risk factors in Indian population is obscure. Five hundred and eighty patients with either recurrent early miscarriage or a history of at least one late miscarriage were screened for deficiency of protein C (PC), protein S (PS), antithrombin III (AT), APC resistance and prothrombin 20210G > A mutation. APC resistance positive patients were typed for the factor V Leiden, factor V Hong Kong/Cambridge mutations, and HR2 haplotype. PstI and rs2227589 AT mutations were detected by direct sequencing. APC resistance (13.4 %) was detected to be most common in Indian RPL patients followed by PS (10.6 %), PC (9.8 %) and AT deficiency (4.31 %.). FV Leiden was shown to be associated with APC resistance while HR2 haplotype was not associated with APC resistance (p values: 0.0001 and 0.327 respectively) and the increased risk of RPL. PstI and rs2227589 polymorphisms were similar in patients and controls and not associated with AT deficiency in RPL. Our study emphasizes the presence of other contributory factors towards APC resistance rather than FV Leiden alone. This is the first Indian study where HR2 haplotype and rs2227589 are observed to be present in RPL population. Although not significant, occurrence of rs2227589 and FV HR2 in homozygous condition necessitates the study of these polymorphisms in a larger sample size.

AB  - Purpose To compare the efficacy of umbilical cord serum (UCS) with amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in cases of acute ocular chemical burns.
   Methods In a retrospective, interventional, comparative case series, 55 eyes with grades III, IV and V chemical burns (Dua's classification) who presented within 3 weeks of injury were evaluated. Patients were treated with conventional medical (CM group, 20 eyes) management alone or combined with either UCS (UCS group, 17 eyes) or AMT (AMT group, 18 eyes). The parameters evaluated were time to epithelialisation, epithelial defect diameter, epithelial defect area, corneal clarity, tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer test and best-corrected vision.
   Results UCS and AMT groups showed early epithelialisation as compared with the CM group (Kaplan-Meier analysis=0.01). Mean time for healing of epithelial defect was 57.7 +/- 29.3, 27.4 +/- 19.0, 41.1 +/- 28.9 days in the CM, UCS and AMT groups, respectively (p=0.02). Mean TBUT at the last follow-up was 8.6 +/- 0.7, 10.3 +/- 1.1, 9.4 +/- 1.2 s in the CM, UCS and AMT groups, respectively (p=0.02). The mean Schirmer value at the last follow-up was 13.7 +/- 1.0, 16.9 +/- 3.0 and 13.2 +/- 1.5 mm in the CM, UCS and AMT groups, respectively (p=0.01). The visual outcomes and the occurrence of corneal vascularisation, symblepheron, ectropion and entropion were comparable in between the groups.
   Conclusions Our study suggests that the UCS therapy may be a better alternative to AMT in acute moderate to severe (grades III, IV and V) ocular chemical burns, as it avoids surgical manoeuvre in already inflamed eyes.

AB  - Background: Few population based studies on multiple sclerosis have been published from India. There is an increasing demand to establish a nationwide MS registry in India especially in view of the percieved increased incidence and prevalence.
   Objectives: To create a registry data base for all MS patients presenting at our institute and understand the disease characteristics in our population and compare them with the published reports from the west.
   Methods: MS was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and imaging features (Revised McDonald's criteria 2010). Demographics, clinical data, treatment details and disease behavior were recorded over a follow up of one year. Descriptive analyses was performed.
   Results: 101 patients (61 females) were recruited in the study period from June 2011 to December 2012. Mean age of the patients at the time of presentation was 33.3 +/- 9.2 years and mean duration of illness was 5.98 +/- 4.95. 68.4% patients had RRMS, 16.8% had SPMS whereas 14.8% patients had PPMS. Site(s) involved in first relapse was spinal cord in 43.7% patients followed by brainstem 25.3% and optic nerve in 24.1% patients. Mean number of relapses were 3.26 +/- 2.026. Mean EDSS at the time of presentation was 3.20 +/- 2.11. Overall, 55.44% patients took DMT at some point during their course of disease. No significant differences were observed between our patient characteristics when compared to publications from west.
   Conclusion: Demographic data in the present study are comparable to those reported in population-based epidemiological studies from west. A nationwide registry network will help establish stronger data on incidence, prevalence and disease profile of MS in India. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the last four decades, as the rates of obesity have increased, so have the challenges associated with its anesthetic management. In the present review, we discuss perioperative anesthesia management issues that are modifiable by the early involvement of the surgical team. We sum up available evidence or expert opinion on issues like patient positioning, postoperative analgesia, and the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation on surgical anastomosis. We also address established predictors of higher perioperative risk and suggest possible management strategies and concerns of obese patients undergoing same day procedures. Finally, a generalized pharmacological model relevant to altered pharmacokinetics in these patients is presented.

AB  - Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by M. leprae. We analyzed 48 cytokine polymorphisms in 13 (pro as well as anti-inflammatory) cytokine genes using PCR-SSP assay in 102 leprosy patients and 120 healthy controls with intent to find out a link between cytokine polymorphisms and disease susceptibility. TNF-alpha (-308) GG, IL-10 (-819) TT, IL-10 (-1082) GG and IL1R (+1970) CC genotypes are found to be predominant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.001, respectively) in both tuberculoid as well as lepromatous leprosy patients. This observation suggests these genotypes as play the central role(s) in the progression of disease. CBA assay demonstrates the varied serum concentration of these cytokines with respect to their genotypes. The above genotypes appeared as high producer genotypes in our study. Even in presence of high produce genotypes, TNF-alpha level are found to be affected/masked by the presence of IL-10 in leprosy patients. Expressional masking of TNF-alpha is associated with the expression of IL-10 in these patients. This is one the negative impact of SNP-SNP interaction in leprosy patients. Therefore, we can conclude that cytokine gene polymorphisms determine the predisposition to the leprosy progression. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vitiligo is a depigmentary disease where melanocytes of the basal layer of epidermis are selectively destroyed by immune-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The T cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecules (TIMs) are involved in immune regulation, and their participation is not known in vitiligo. The present study revealed significant increase in the percentage of CD3+CD4+TIM3+ T cells (P < 0.05) in peripheral blood and was positively correlated with percentage body surface area involvement in aGV group. Further, increased expression of TIM-3 and its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9) mRNA was found in peripheral blood and lesional/perilesional skin of active generalized vitiligo (aGV) compared with controls. Characteristic migration pattern of TIM-3-positive immune cells in lesional (near/in the epidermis) and perilesional (towards epidermis) skin section suggested that TIM-3+ immune cells may be involved in melanocyte destruction. Further, investigation is required to understand the role of TIM-3/Gal-9 signalling pathways in aGV and it can be targeted in the management of vitiligo.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the stability of latanoprost in generic formulations by using controlled degradation and patient usage simulation studies
   Methods: Standard latanoprost was subjected to controlled degradation studies. Latanoprost content was assessed by using MRM, and generated Degradation Products (DP) were analysed by using the Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) protocol of positive ESI-LC-MS/MS. Latanoprost content and formation of DP were assessed in generic formulations and were compared with Xalatan (R) in a controlled patient usage simulation studies. The last few drops of latanoprost, present in containers used by patients were also evaluated.
   Results: Extreme pH conditions, oxidation, light and heat were found to be the significant factors for high degree of latanoprost degradation. Systematic analysis of 7 selected generics revealed that the latanoprost content varied from 90-330%. Concentration of the latanoprost in Xalatan was found to be 97% of the label claim. Degradation studies showed the formation of 3 novel and 3 already known impurities. Upon simulated patient usage, 2 of the generic formulations showed significant degradation of latanoprost. Generic formulations having thermally sealed gas tight packing showed good stability during patient usage. Overage of latanoprost was observed in generics with other than thermal sealing. Latanoprost bottles used by patients showed concentrations ranging from 20 to 250% of label claim (144% median).
   Conclusion: This study revealed the presence of overage of latanoprost in some generic formulations and formation of degradation products. Packaging with gas tight containers may be one of the important factors for latanoprost stability, along with its storage at low temperature during patient usage.

AB  - Background: Azathioprine in daily doses has been shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of Parthenium dermatitis. Weekly pulses of azathioprine (WAP) are also effective, but there are no reports comparing the effectiveness and safety of these two regimens in this condition. Aims: To study the efficacy and safety of WAP and daily azathioprine in Parthenium dermatitis. Methods: Sixty patients with Parthenium dermatitis were randomly assigned to treatment with azathioprine 300 mg weekly pulse or azathioprine 100 mg daily for 6 months. Patients were evaluated every month to assess the response to treatment and side effects. Results: The study included 32 patients in the weekly azathioprine group and 28 in the daily azathioprine group, of whom 25 and 22 patients respectively completed the study. Twenty-three (92%) patients on WAP and 21 (96%) on daily azathioprine had a good or excellent response. The mean pretreatment clinical severity score decreased from 26.4 +/- 14.5 to 4.7 +/- 5.1 in the WAP group, and from 36.1 +/- 18.1 to 5.7 +/- 6.0 in the daily azathioprine group, which was statistically significant and comparable (P = 0.366). Patients on WAP had a higher incidence of adverse effects (P = 0.02). Limitations: The study had a small sample size and the amount of clobetasol propionate used in each patient was not determined, though it may not have affected the study outcome due to its comparable use in both groups. Conclusions: Azathioprine 300 mg weekly pulse and 100 mg daily dose are equally effective and safe in the treatment of Parthenium dermatitis.

AB  - Background: Cushing syndrome (CS) due to central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of hematological malignancy is a rare finding.
   Case: A 6.5-year-old boy with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) came with excessive weight gain, headache, and irritability over last 2 months. CNS was not involved at diagnosis of ALL. On examination, the child had central obesity, moon facies, and buffalo hump. His height was at 3rd-25th percentile, weight was at >97th percentile, and blood pressure was >99th percentile. Serum cortisol was high in morning (25 mu g/dL), at 12 a.m. (19.3 mu g/dL) and remained elevated (7.5 mu g/dL) after overnight dexamethasone test. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed blast cells suggestive of CNS relapse. Our second case was a 2.5-year-old girl with precursor B cell ALL, came with complaints of excessive weight gain, and increased appetite over last 3 months. On examination, the child had Cushingoid facies with trunkal obesity. Blood pressure was normal. Serum cortisol at 8 a.m. (40.4 mu g/dL), midnight (13.8 mu g/dL), and after dexamethasone suppression test (22 mu g/dL) was high. CSF examination showed blast cells. We diagnosed both cases with adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent CS due to CNS relapse based on the above findings.
   Conclusion: We have reported two cases of CS due to CNS relapse of ALL. CS is a very rare manifestation of CNS relapse in patients with leukemia, and the exact pathogenesis is not clear.

AB  - Colloid cysts are usually located in third ventricle and are believed to be derived from either primitive neuroepithelium or endoderm. Patients may remain asymptomatic for long time while some can present with paroxysmal headache, gait disturbance, nausea, vomiting, behavioral changes, weaknesses of lower limbs, impaired memory, new learning disability and sudden death. Computed tomography usually reveals a well-defined round or oval nonenhancing lesion. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensity of colloid cysts is variable, the most common appearance is hyperintensity in T1-weighted sequences and iso to hypointensity in T2-weighted sequences. Observation, stereotactic aspiration, microscopic or endoscopic approaches and shunt surgery are various management options. Transcallosal and transcortical microscopic (with or without tubular retractor) approaches are mainly useful in normal-sized and dilated ventricles respectively. Endoscopic technique is an effective alternative to microsurgical technique but total resection and long-term recurrence remains a concern. Utilization of two instruments, the bi port technique and tubular retractor can be helpful in selected patients to overcome limitations. Although total excision should be aimed, subtotal excision and coagulation of residual cyst wall usually results in good long-term results without any growth of remnant wall. Conversion to an open procedure may be required in some patients.

AB  - Tryptophan-rich proteins play important biological functions for the Plasmodium parasite. Plasmodium vivax contains remarkably large numbers of such proteins belonging to the "Pv-fam-a" family that need to be characterized. Earlier, we reported the presence of memory T cells and naturally acquired antibodies against 15 of these proteins in P. vivax malaria-exposed individuals (M. Zeeshan, H. Bora, and Y.D. Sharma, J Infect Dis 207:175-185, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jis650). Here, we sought to characterize and ascertain the cross talk between effector responses of T and B cells in malarial patients against all Pv-fam-a family proteins. Therefore, we expressed the remaining 21 of these proteins in Escherichia coli and studied the humoral and cellular immune responses based on the same parameters used in our previous study. Naturally acquired IgG antibodies were detected against all 21 antigens in P. vivax patient sera (37.7 to 94.4% seropositivity). These antigens were able to activate the lymphocytes of P. vivax-exposed individuals, and the activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes produced higher levels of Th1 (interleukin-2 [IL-2] and gamma interferon [IFN-gamma]) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines than the healthy controls, but the response was Th2 biased. The combined results of present and previous studies seem to suggest a striking link between induction of the CD4(+) T cell response and naturally acquired antibodies against all 36 proteins of the Pv-fam-a family, the majority of them having conserved sequences in the parasite population. Further work is required to utilize this information to develop immunotherapeutic treatments for this disease.

T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - AVOIDABLE BLINDNESS
KW  - CATARACT-SURGERY
KW  - PREVALENCE
KW  - DISTRICT
AB  - Purpose
   To determine the prevalence, causes and associated demographic factors related to visual impairment amongst the urban population of New Delhi, India.
   Methods
   A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in East Delhi district using cluster random sampling methodology. This Rapid Assessment of Visual Impairment (RAVI) survey involved examination of all individuals aged 40 years and above in 24 randomly selected clusters of the district. Visual acuity (VA) assessment and comprehensive ocular examination were done during the door-to-door survey. A questionnaire was used to collect personal and demographic information of the study population. Blindness and Visual Impairment was defined as presenting VA <3/60 and <6/18 in the better eye, respectively. Descriptive statistics were computed along with multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine associated factors for visual impairment.
   Results
   Of 2421 subjects enumerated, 2331 (96.3%) were available for ophthalmic examination. Among those examined, 49.3% were males. The prevalence of visual impairment (VI) in the study population, was 11.4% (95% C.I. 10.1, 12.7) and that of blindness was 1.2% (95% C.I. 0.8, 1.6). Uncorrected refractive error was the leading cause of VI accounting for 53.4% of all VI followed by cataract (33.8%). With multivariable logistic regression, the odds of having VI increased with age (OR = 24.6[95% C.I.: 14.9, 40.7]; p<0.001). Illiterate participants were more likely to have VI [OR = 1.5 (95% C.I.: 1.1,2.1)] when compared to educated participants.
   Conclusions
   The first implementation of the RAVI methodology in a North Indian population revealed that the burden of visual impairment is considerable in this region despite availability of adequate eye care facilities. Awareness generation and simple interventions like cataract surgery and provision of spectacles will help to eliminate the major causes of blindness and visual impairment in this region.

AB  - Mammary gland is an exocrine and sebaceous gland made up of branching network of ducts that end in alveoli. Milk is synthesized in the alveoli and secreted into alveolar lumen. Mammary gland represents an ideal system for the study of organogenesis that undergoes successive cycles of pregnancy, lactation and involution. To gain insights on the molecular events that take place in Pubertal and lactating mammary gland, we have identified 43 differentially expressed proteins in mammary tissue of heifer (non-lactating representing a virgin mammary gland), and lactating buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) by 2D-difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry. Twenty one proteins were upregulated during lactation whereas 8 proteins were upregulated in heifer mammary gland significantly (p<0.05). Bioinforrnatics analyses of the identified proteins showed that a majority of the proteins are involved in metabolic processes. The differentially expressed proteins were validated by real-time PCR and Western blotting. We observed differential expressions of certain new proteins including EEF1D, HSPA5, HSPD1 and PRDX6 during lactation which have not been reported before. The differentially expressed proteins were mapped to available biological pathways and networks involved in lactation. This study signifies the importance of some proteins which are preferentially expressed during lactation and in heifer mammary gland.
   Biological significance
   This work is important because we have generated information in water buffalo (B. bubalis) for the first time which is the major milk producing animal in Indian Subcontinent. Out of a present production of 133 million tons of milk produced in India, contribution of buffalo milk is around 54%. Its physiology is somewhat different from the lactating cows. Buffalo milk composition varies from cow milk in terms of higher fat and total solid content, which confers an advantage in preparation of specialized cheese, curd and other dairy products. Being a major milk producing animal in India it is highly essential to understand the lactation associated proteins in the mammary gland of buffalo. In the present investigation our attempt has been to identify new protein evidences which are expressed in lactatingbuffalo mammary gland and have not been reported before. The findings reported in the present study will help in understanding the lactation biology of buffalo mammary gland in particular and the mammary gland biology in general. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction
   Serious bacterial infections continue to be an important cause of death and illness among infants in developing countries. Time to recovery could be considered a surrogate marker of severity of the infection. We therefore aimed to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of time to recovery in infants with probable serious bacterial infection (PSBI).
   Methods
   We used the dataset of 700 infants (7-120 days) enrolled in a randomised controlled trial in India in which 10mg of oral zinc or placebo was given to infants with PSBI. PSBI was defined as signs/symptoms of possible serious bacterial infection along with baseline C-reactive protein(CRP) level >12mg/L. Time to recovery was defined as time from enrolment to the end of a 2-day period with no symptoms/signs of PSBI and daily weight gain of at least 10g over 2 succesive days on exclusive oral feeding. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to measure the associations between relevant variables and time to recovery.
   Results
   Infants who were formula fed prior to illness episode had 33% longer time to recovery (HR-0.67, 95% CI-0.52, 0.87) than those who were not. Being underweight (HR-0.84, 95% CI-0.70, 0.99), lethargic (HR-0.77, 95% CI-0.62, 0.96) and irritable (HR-0.81, 95% CI-0.66, 0.99) were independent predictors of time to recovery. Baseline CRP was significantly associated with time to recovery (P<0.001), higher CRP was associated with longer time to recovery and this association was nearly linear.
   Conclusion
   Simple clinical and laboratory parameters such as formula feeding prior to the illness, being underweight, lethargic, irritable and having elevated CRP levels could be used for early identification of infants with PSBI at risk for protracted illness and could guide prompt referral to higher centers in resource limited settings. This also provides prognostic information to clinicians and family as longer recovery time has economic and social implications on the family in our setting.

AB  - Background
   While infections are a major cause of neonatal mortality in India even in full-term neonates, this is an especial problem in the large proportion (similar to 20%) of neonates born underweight (or small-for-gestational-age; SGA). One potential contributory factor for this susceptibility is the possibility that immune system maturation may be affected along with intrauterine growth retardation.
   Methods
   In order to examine the possibility that differences in immune status may underlie the susceptibility of SGA neonates to infections, we enumerated the frequencies and concentrations of 22 leukocyte subset populations as well as IgM and IgA levels in umbilical cord blood from full-term SGA neonates and compared them with values from normal-weight (or appropriate-for-gestational-age; AGA) full-term neonates. We eliminated most SGA-associated risk factors in the exclusion criteria so as to ensure that AGA-SGA differences, if any, would be more likely to be associated with the underweight status itself.
   Results
   An analysis of 502 such samples, including 50 from SGA neonates, showed that SGA neonates have significantly fewer plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a higher myeloid DC (mDC) to pDC ratio, more natural killer (NK) cells, and higher IgM levels in cord blood in comparison with AGA neonates. Other differences were also observed such as tendencies to lower CD4:CD8 ratios and greater prominence of inflammatory monocytes, mDCs and neutrophils, but while some of them had substantial differences, they did not quite reach the standard level of statistical significance.
   Conclusions
   These differences in cellular lineages of the immune system possibly reflect stress responses in utero associated with growth restriction. Increased susceptibility to infections may thus be linked to complex immune system dysregulation rather than simply retarded immune system maturation.

AB  - Background: Despite the high mortality and morbidity resulting from acute respiratory infections (ARI) globally, there are few data from low-income countries on costs of ARI to inform public health policy decisions We conducted a prospective survey to assess costs of ARI episodes in selected primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities in north India where no respiratory pathogen vaccine is routinely recommended.
   Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted among a purposive sample of patients with ARI from healthcare facilities. Data were collected on out-of-pocket costs of hospitalization, medical consultations, medications, diagnostics, transportation, lodging, and missed work days. Telephone surveys were conducted two weeks after medical encounters to ask about subsequent missed work and costs incurred. Costs of prescriptions and diagnostics in public facilities were supplemented with WHO-CHOICE estimates of hospital bed costs. Missed work days were assigned cost based on the national annual per capita income (US$1,104). Non-medically attended ARI cases were identified from an ongoing community-based ARI surveillance project in Faridabad.
   Results: During September 2012-March 2013, 1766 patients with ARI were enrolled, including 451 hospitalized patients, 1056 outpatients, and 259 non-medically attended patients. The total direct cost of an ARI episode requiring outpatient care was US$4-$6 for public and $3-$10 for private institutions based on age groups. The total direct cost of an ARI episode requiring hospitalized care was $54-$120 in public and $135-$355 in private institutions. The cost of ARI among those hospitalized was highest among persons aged > = 65 years and lowest among children aged < 5 years. Indirect costs due to missed work days were 16-25% of total costs. The direct out-of-pocket cost of hospitalized ARI was 34% of annual per capita income.
   Conclusions: The cost of hospitalized ARI episodes in India is high relative to median per capita income. Data from this study can inform evaluations of the cost effectiveness of proven ARI prevention strategies such as vaccination.

AB  - Management of delayed presenting esophageal perforations has long been a topic of debate. Most authors consider definitive surgery being the management of choice. Management, however, differs in pediatric patients in consideration with better healing of younger tissues. We extensively review the role of aggressive non-operative management in pediatric esophageal perforations, especially with delayed presentation and exemplify with case of a young boy with esophageal perforation and esophago-cutaneous fistula. We also lay down the protocol to manage such patients based on our institutional recommendations.

AB  - Background & objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) is a common infection in patients on haemodialysis. There is a definite role of treatment of latent TB (LTB) in these patients. However, diagnosis of LTB in these patients by tuberculin skin test (TST) is unreliable. There is suggestion that interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) will be more reliable test for diagnosis of LTB in this setting. Thus, we evaluated value of IGRA and TST for the diagnosis of LTB in patients on dialysis in an Indian setting.
   Methods: Patients with end stage kidney disease on dialysis were included. Patients with active TB were excluded. Each patient was subjected to TST (induration of >= 10 mm was taken as positive) and QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) for diagnosis of LTB.
   Results: A total of 185 patients were included; 129 (69.7%) were males and mean age was 36.7 +/- 12.3 yr. Past history of TB was present in 18 (9.7%) patients. One hundred and thirty four (72.4%) patients had scar of BCG vaccination. QFT-GIT test was positive in 66 (36%), TST in 32 (17%) and both in 13 (7%) patients. Of the 66 patients positive with QFT-GIT, only 13 (19.6%) were positive for TST. Of the 32 patients positive with TST, only 13 (40.6%) were positive with QFT-GIT; 100 (54%) patients were negative for both the tests. Overall, 85 (45.9%) patients were positive for either of the two tests. Poor agreement was shown between the two methods. On logistic regression analysis, odds of QFT-GIT to be positive in patients with BCG vaccination was 1.23 and with history of TB 0.99, both being insignificant. odds of tuberculin skin test to be positive in patients with BCG vaccination was 1.04 and with history of TB 0.99, both again being insignificant.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed that more number of patients (36%) on haemodialysis were positive for QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube test as compared to TST (17%). There was poor agreement between the two tests. no significant effect of BCG vaccination and history of TB in past was observed on both tests.

AB  - The da Vinci(TM) robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) has been used frequently for urological procedures including radical prostatectomy and pyeloplasty. Its use in bariatric surgery is limited to few high volume centres in the western world. The advantages of robotic assistance are three-dimensional vision, ergonomic advantage and improved precision. We report our experience of using this advanced technology to perform a robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in a 55-year-old obese diabetic patient. We were able to reproduce our standard laparoscopic technique and all the steps of the surgical procedure were done using robotic assistance.

AB  - Phyllodes tumour is a rare benign neoplasm of the breast. It is a mixed tumour of epithelial and mesenchymal origin. The epithelial element is characterized by proliferation of ductolobular units. The fibrous tissue and collagen bundles represent the mesenchymal element. It is also known as "cystosarcoma" phyllodes to characterize some important features, viz. cyst-like or cleft-like spaces within the mass along with a leaf- or frond-like pattern of the stromal element. The tumour is well known for its high potential for local recurrence. Most patients in developing countries present with very large breast tumours with close proximity to the skin and pectoralis major. In these cases, there is a need to perform a three-dimensional en bloc removal of the mass with overlying skin and underlying muscle(s). If a skin flap is raised in the vicinity of the tumour, there is a risk of cutting close to the tumour, increasing risk of local recurrence. Here, we describe a surgical technique that permits a three-dimensional en bloc removal of phyllodes tumour.

AB  - Recent studies have proposed the potential role of 5-HT2B receptor (5-HT2BR) blockade in alleviating myocardial dysfunction; hitherto, the regulatory pathway for its protective effect has remained enigmatic. In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of SB-204741, a 5-HT2BR blocker in isoproterenol-induced myocardial remodeling in rats and its cross-talk with apoptosis and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPKs)/heat shock proteins (HSPs) pathway. To assess this hypothesis, we measured the effect of SB-204741 (0.25-1.0 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in isoproterenol (85 mg/kg/day, s.c.)-induced myocardial remodeling in rats. SB-204741 dose dependently improved hemodynamic and ventricular functions following isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury. This amelioration was well substantiated with reduced expression of 5-HT2B, inflammatory proteins (NF-kappa Bp65, IKK-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and Cox-2), MAPKs (p-p38/p38 and p-JNK/JNK ratio) accompanied with increased protein expression of HSPs (alpha B-crystallin, Hsp27 and Hsp70), autophagy (LC3 and Beclin-1) and p-ERK/ERK ratio. Additionally, SB-204741 inhibited apoptotic signaling pathway as there was decreased DAPI/TUNEL positivity and protein expression of cytochrome c, Bax, and caspase-3 along with increased Bcl-2 expression. Preservation of histopathological and ultrastructural components, normalization of nitric oxide level, endogenous antioxidants and myocyte injury marker enzymes were also observed. In conclusion, inhibition of apoptosis via modulation of MAPKs/HSPs is essential for 5-HT2BR blockade mediated cardioprotective effect.

AB  - Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) occurs in about 30 % of individuals with epilepsy. For seizure control, a wide range of surgical procedures are performed, depending on the underlying pathology. To address the anesthetic and perioperative concerns in these patients, we analyzed the data of persons with DRE who underwent epilepsy surgery at our institute.
   A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery from 2005-2010 was performed. For data collection and analysis, patients were divided into three groups: Group I (temporal lobe epilepsy), Group II (extratemporal lobe epilepsy), and Group III (multilobar epilepsy and others).
   A total of 241 surgical procedures were performed on 235 persons with DRE. The procedures included temporal (149) and extratemporal (47) lobe resection, hemispherotomy (31), corpus callosotomy (5), vagus nerve stimulation (3), and implantation of invasive cerebral electrodes (6). General anesthesia was the more common anesthetic technique; awake craniotomy was performed in only five cases. Intraoperative neuromonitoring was used most frequently in Group II. Patients in Group III had the longest intraoperative course and the greatest blood loss. The overall incidence of postoperative mechanical ventilation was 17.84 %, with 53.84 % of patients in Group III alone. At one-year follow-up, a good outcome was seen in 78 % of temporal lobe resection, 55 % of extratemporal cortical resection, 82 % of hemispherotomy, and 80 % of corpus callosotomy procedures.
   Careful preoperative selection and meticulous perioperative management are the most significant factors for success of epilepsy surgery. Although temporal and extratemporal lobe surgeries have a fairly stable perioperative course, multilobar epilepsy requiring disconnective surgery poses a greater challenge.

AB  - We intended to assess the clinicopathological features and treatment outcome in patients of intracranial atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), a rare malignant tumor of the brain.
   Medical records were reviewed and clinical data collected on AT/RT in a 6-year period (2006-2012). Overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of factors predictive of overall survival was done by log-rank test.
   Fifteen patients met the study criterion (male:female = 4:1). Median age at presentation was 5 years (range, 0.8-8 years). Presenting complaints included vomiting (73.33 %), headache (46.67 %), orbital symptoms (33.33 %), motor impairment (26.67 %), gait abnormality (20 %), and seizure (20 %). Median duration of symptoms was noted to be 2 months (range, 0.5-6 months). On contrast-enhanced MRI of brain, tumor location was supratentorial in 60 % patients and infratentorial in 40 % of patients. Cystic component and hydrocephalus were noted in 73.33 % patients each, whereas contrast enhancement and calcification were discerned in 53.33 and 40 % of the patients, respectively. All patients underwent tumor resection-gross total (26.67 %), near-total (13.33 %) and subtotal (60 %). Histopathology was confirmative of AT/RT with MIB-1 labeling index varying from 11 to 85 % (median 45 %). There was a lack of immunostaining for INI-1 protein, suggesting INI-1gene mutation or deletion. Adjuvant radiation (36 Gray/20 fractions/4 weeks to entire neuraxis followed by local boost 20 Gray/10 fractions/2 weeks) was started in six patients (40 %) and completed in five patients. Young age at presentation and poor performance status precluded the use of radiation in the remainder. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in ten (66.67 %) patients. Median number of cycles given was three (range, 1-12) with ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide) being the common regimens (26.67 and 20 %, respectively). After a median follow-up of 8.33 months (mean, 12.27 months), median overall survival was noted to be 10 months. At last follow-up, two patients are in complete response, one patient is on treatment, three patients are alive with evidence of disease, and nine patients expired due to disease progression. The 1- and 2-year actuarial rate of overall survival was noted to be 48.1 and 24.1 %, respectively. On univariate analysis, extent of surgery (p = 0.0149), use of craniospinal radiation (p = 0.0087), and MIB1 labeling index (p = 0.0034) were significant predictors of overall survival while age (a parts per thousand yen5 years versus < 5 years) was of borderline significance (p = 0.08).
   Median survival of 10 months reflects the aggressive biology of this rare neoplasm. Maximal safe resection followed by craniospinal irradiation and systemic chemotherapy with ICE or VAC regimen is a reasonable treatment strategy in this uncommon malignancy.

AB  - Background: Cysteine protease Cathepsin L is involved in bone remodeling and expressed in activated macrophages. It is highly expressed in metastatic tumor tissue, especially with bone metastases. Aims: We evaluated immunohistochemical expression of Cathepsin L in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in chemo-naive Ewing sarcoma. Settings and Design: Retrospective evaluation of archived specimens of Ewing sarcoma. Materials and Methods: Immunohistochemical staining was performed on archived blocks of chemo-naive patients with Ewing sarcoma treated with uniform chemotherapy at our institute between January 2009 and November 2011. Statistical Analysis: Immunohistochemical expression was co-related with baseline demographics and survival. Results: During the study period, we had evaluable baseline samples from 62 patients with median age 15 years (range: 2-40); 26 (42%) had metastases. Cathepsin L expression in tumor cells was observed in 8/62 (13%) specimens. None of the baseline clinical characteristics correlated with Cathepsin L expression. Cathepsin L positivity was associated with poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (P = 0.05), but did not influence either event-free-survival (EFS) or overall survival. Cathepsin L was expressed in TAMs in all specimens. Grade 3 TAMs (>10 TAMs/high power field) was associated with better response to NACT (P = 0.05). On univariate analysis Grade 3 TAMs predicted superior EFS (median EFS 28.5 months in those with Grade 3 TAMs versus 14.8 months in those with grade 1/2 TAMs [P = 0.04]). Conclusions: Cathepsin L expression by immunohistochemistry was low in our patient cohort, and it did not affect the outcome. In addition, Grade 3 TAMs with Cathepsin L expression was associated with improved EFS.

A 45-year-old male patient undergoing initial evaluation for newly diagnosed prostatic adenocarcinoma was referred to our department for Tc-99m-MDP bone scintigraphy. As part of the study protocol, he also underwent Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-[Ga-68(HBED-CC)] (Ga-68-PSMA) PET/CT, which revealed tracer accumulation in brain lesions, apart from localization in the primary, lymph node, and bone metastases. A subsequent MR evaluation confirmed brain metastases.

AB  - BACKGROUND:Various hemispherotomy techniques have been developed to reduce complication rates and achieve the best possible seizure control.OBJECTIVE:To present a novel and minimally invasive endoscopy-assisted approach to perform this procedure.METHODS:Endoscopy-assisted interhemispheric transcallosal hemispherotomy was performed in 5 children (April 2013-June 2014). The procedure consisted of performing a small craniotomy (4 x 3 cm) just lateral to midline using a transverse skin incision. After dural opening, the surgery was performed with the assistance of a rigid high-definition endoscope, and bayoneted self-irrigating bipolar forceps and other standard endoscopic instruments. Steps included a complete corpus callosotomy followed by the disconnection of the hemisphere at the level of the basal nuclei and thalamus. The surgeries were performed in a dedicated operating room with intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging and neuronavigation. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a total disconnection.RESULTS:The pathologies for which surgeries were performed included sequelae of middle a cerebral artery infarct (n = 2), Rasmussen syndrome (n = 1), and hemimegalencephaly (2). Four patients had an Engel class I and 1 patient had a class II outcome at a mean follow-up of 10.2 months (range, 3-14 months). The mean blood loss was 80 mL, and mean operating time was 220 minutes. There were no complications in this study.CONCLUSION:This study describes a pilot novel technique and the feasibility of performing a minimally invasive, endoscopy-assisted hemispherotomy.ABBREVIATIONS:BKT, Binet Kamat Test of IntelligenceCBCL, Child Behavior ChecklistPedsQL, Pediatric Quality of Life InventorySD, standard deviation

AB  - IntroductionThe inactivation of suppressor of cytokine signaling SOCS-1, a negative regulator of cytokine pathways, by hypermethylation was shown in hematological malignancies including Myelsplastic Syndromes. So far, its prognostic relevance in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients has not been understood.
   MethodsMethylation status of SOCS-1 gene was analyzed in series of 100 patients using methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and correlated with disease severity, progression, and survival by comparing prognostic factors such as hematological, clinical, and cytogenetics.
   ResultsOf the total of 100 MDS patients analyzed, methylation of SOCS1 gene was found in 53% patients. Also, the frequency of patients with poor and intermediate cytogenetics was observed significantly high in methylated group (P<0.001). Moreover, the patients with methylated SOCS-1 gene had significantly more frequent disease progression as compared to the patients with unmethylated SOCS-1 gene (P<0.006). Both progression-free survival and median overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with methylated SOCS-1 gene when compared to the patients with unmethylated SOCS-1 gene (P=0.006 & P=0.001, respectively).
   ConclusionThis study for the first time showed that the mathylation of SOCS-1 gene plays an important role in the disease progression and is associated with poor survival especially among the high-risk patients. This may be due to high association between SOCS1 methylation and higher risk subtypes of MDS (such as RAEB) in this study.

AB  - Loco-regional recurrence in 50% of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients poses major challenge for oncologists. Lack of biomarkers that can predict disease aggressiveness and recurrence risk makes the scenario more dismal. On the basis of our earlier global proteomic analyses we identified five differentially expressed proteins in OSCC. This study aimed to develop protein biomarkers-based prognostic risk prediction model for OSCC. Sub-cellular expression of five proteins, S100A7, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinK (hnRNPK), prothymosin a (PTMA), 14-3-3. and 14-3-3s was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in test set (282 Indian OSCCs and 209 normal tissues), correlated with clinic-pathological parameters and clinical outcome over 12 years to develop a risk model for prediction of recurrence-free survival. This risk classifier was externally validated in 135 Canadian OSCC and 96 normal tissues. Biomarker signature score based on PTMA, S100A7 and hnRNPK was associated with recurrence free survival of OSCC patients (hazard ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.08, 1.13, P<0.001, optimism-corrected c-statistic = 0.69) independent of clinical parameters. Biomarker signature score stratified OSCC patients into high- and low-risk groups with significant difference for disease recurrence. The high- risk group had median survival 14 months, and 3-year survival rate of 30%, whereas low-risk group survival probability did not reach 50%, and had 3-year survival rate of 71%. As a powerful predictor of 3-year recurrence-free survival in OSCC patients, the newly developed biomarkers panel risk classifier will facilitate patient counseling for personalized treatment.

AB  - The ileum is one of the most common sites of intestine to undergo endoscopic biopsy. However, even with the experienced histopathologists, a definite diagnosis can be achieved only in 18% cases. Lack of knowledge about proper tissue handling, tissue orientation, overlapping histological findings, and lack of a standard algorithm based approach results in this low diagnostic yield. In this review article, we have tried to discuss these aspects and give a clear picture how to approach the ileal lesions. It would help the surgical pathologists in effectively interpreting the lesions and to identify the common pitfalls.

AB  - Purpose: The present study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effects of reducing the number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) administered to patients with drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) during their admission and document any change in seizure frequency in subsequent follow up.
   Methods: A total of 962 patients with DRE who were admitted to the neurology wards waiting for connection to video EEG were recruited for this prospective study. After their admission to the neurology ward, modifications in the number and dosage of AEDs were done with a target of a maximum of three AEDs in every patient. Drug tapering was done using a standardized protocol. The primary outcome was the change in seizure frequency in the follow-up period of 6 months. Secondary outcome measures were the adverse event profile (AEP) and the quality of life (QOL).
   Results: Of the 1134 patients screened, 962 patients gave consent to participate in the study. The mean number of AEDs received by each patient was 4.24. After the tapering following a standardized protocol each patient received a mean of 2.65 AEDs per patient. In 82.70% patients with DRE, there was either a reduction or no change in seizure frequency in the subsequent 6 months follow up. There was a significant reduction in the AEP score after the reduction in the number of AEDs (P = 0. 001).
   Conclusion: Our study proves that optimization of reduction of the number of AED's in patients with DRE leads to reduction or no change in seizure frequency with a significant decrease in adverse effects. (C) 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among percutaneous biopsy techniques, the vacuum assisted breast biopsy (VAB) obtains large tissue samples to alleviate some of the limitations associated with conventional percutaneous biopsy techniques. We aimed to determine the efficacy of VAB in previous equivocal biopsies using the mammotome device. Materials and Methods: A prospective non-randomized efficacy study was planned and executed on 43 patients (42 women, 1 man) whose previous FNAC and/or CNB of breast masses yielded inconclusive results or were suspicious for cancer. Results: VAB revealed malignancy in 31 (72%) of the 43 patients. Among them, 23 were diagnosed as infiltrative ductal carcinoma (IDC) on VAB, 20 underwent surgery and the final histopathological diagnosis was the same in 19 of them. One patient showed ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) only in the surgical specimen. Other malignancies included infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) in 5 patients and one each of DCIS, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and metastasis from lung cancer. Benign lesions were detected in 12 (28%) patients. These included 8 fibroadenomas, 2 fibrocystic disease and 1 each of mastitis and breast abscess. Four patients with fibroadenoma underwent surgical excision.

KW  - S-100
AB  - Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are uncommon sarcomas that originate from a peripheral nerve or neurofibroma either spontaneously or in association with neurofibromatosis type 1. MPNSTs account for approximately 5% of all soft tissue malignancies. The tumor is commonly seen in the extremities and trunk. Most of these tumors are high-grade with the potential to recur and metastasize. Common metastatic sites include the lungs, bone, and pleura. Primary intraosseous MPNST is rare, and the diagnosis of intraosseous MPNST, especially in an unusual location is difficult because of its cellular origin, histomorphological similarities with other sarcomas, and bone is the most common site for metastasis. We report an unusual case of MPNST of the calcaneus in a young male.

AB  - Purpose: To report the occurrence of juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) in patients with keratoconus.
   Patients and Methods: In this observational case series we report 6 eyes of 3 patients with keratoconus who had concomitant JOAG. Corneal topography, intraocular pressure, gonioscopic, and fundus findings were recorded for all the eyes.
   Results: All 3 patients presented with corneal ectasia, high intraocular pressure, and advanced glaucomatous damage and had no family history of glaucoma or keratoconus. Two of the 3 patients needed collagen cross-linking with riboflavin for progression of keratoconus and trabeculectomy for control of intraocular pressure. One of the patients also underwent a lamellar keratoplasty for keratoconus.
   Conclusions: This is the first case series pointing toward a possible association of JOAG with keratoconus and highlights the importance of a thorough workup of glaucoma in patients with keratoconus.

AB  - Background Insufficient fasting prior to endoscopic procedures performed under sedation may result in potential aspiration of gastric contents. Fasting as per ASA guidelines is recommended prior to these procedures. However, the effect of chewing gum on fasting status has been a subject of debate and often leads to procedural delays.
   Objective Evaluation of the effect of chewing gum on the gastric volume and pH.
   Methods In this randomized controlled prospective observer blinded trail, ASA I-III patients aged more than 18 years scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or a combined EGD and colonoscopy under conscious sedation were studied. Patients randomized to the chewing gum group (Group-C) were allowed to chew gum until just before the start of their procedure; the remaining patients were included into Group-NC. After sedation and endoscope insertion, stomach contents were aspirated under vision of a gastroenterologist (blinded to groups).
   Results Volume and pH of gastric contents aspirated from 67 patients (34 in Group-C and 33 in Group-NC) were analyzed. The demographic parameters of the groups were comparable. Gastric volume (median-interquartile range) was statistically higher in Group-C (13 ml (7.75-40.75) vs Group-NC 6 ml (1.00-14.00) (P < 0.001)]. The mean pH in both groups was comparable: 2.84 +/- 2.11 in Group-C and 3.79 +/- 2.53 in Group-NC (P = 0.141).
   Conclusion Although our results show gastric volume in patients chewing gum was statistically higher, clinical relevance of such a small difference is questionable. Thus patients who chewed gum inadvertently prior to procedure should not be denied or delayed administration of sedative and anesthetic medications.

AB  - Context: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a cost-effective and minimal invasive respiratory support for the newborn.
   Objective: To review the evidence related to various aspects of CPAP usage and its applicability for developing countries.
   Evidence Acquisition: We conducted a literature search on PubMed, CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the terms 'CPAP' OR 'continuous positive airway pressure' OR, non-invasive ventilation' AND 'newborn' OR 'neonate' OR 'infant'. We also searched the reference lists from the above articles and of review articles. Extracted manuscripts and reviews were analyzed and results related to various aspects of CPAP usage were summarized in narrative form.
   Results: Early use of CPAP with early rescue surfactant (InSurE) is the ideal approach for management of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm and extremely preterm infants. Delivery room CPAP is feasible and reduces the need for surfactant and mechanical ventilation by nearly 50%. Prophylactic surfactant for extreme preterms should be discouraged. Heated humidified high flow nasal cannula is best utilized for post-extubation respiratory support. The search for ideal interface still continues and binasal prongs or nasal masks are the good contenders. Evidence on the ideal CPAP delivery is still inconclusive.
   Conclusions: CPAP, if used early and judiciously, is an effective intervention and need immediate scaling-up in resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on the ideal interface and the CPAP delivery methods.

To the best of our knowledge, six pairs of bilaterally symmetrical arteries developing within the pharyngeal arches are yet to be found in any mammalian or avian species. Collateral channels between the distal ends of the fourth and sixth arch arteries, in contrast, have been found in up to half of all developing mouse embryos. In only one human embryo, again to the best of our knowledge, has a channel been found that extends from the aortic sac to the dorsal aorta, and hence qualifies as an arch artery. Despite these confounding factors in terms of the developmental heritage of the fifth arch arteries, the purported channels are invoked with increasing frequency to describe various lesions discovered in the setting of the congenitally malformed heart. Persistence of the artery of the fifth arch was initially proposed to explain double-barrelled aorta. It was subsequently proposed to account for various systemic-to-pulmonary channels feeding the pulmonary circulation in the setting of pulmonary atresia. It has also been claimed to persist so as to explain abnormal branching of the brachiocephalic arteries from the aortic arch. In the light of the ongoing doubts concerning the existence of the arteries of the fifth arch themselves, we have reviewed the various descriptions of purported fifth arch arteries within the world literature. We have then sought to validate the descriptions on the basis of our own understanding of development, for this purpose providing images of the remoulding arch arteries in the mouse so as to substantiate our conclusions. While accepting that our own interpretations are speculative, we suggest that more convincing alternative explanations can be advanced to account for the majority of lesions currently interpreted on the basis of persistence of the arteries of the fifth arches. Although the interpretations do not necessarily change the therapeutic approaches to the channels, appropriate description is important in terms of their classification.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationship of liraglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, in Asian subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: Data were derived from a published 16-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group trial of liraglutide in China, India and South Korea. The analysis utilized 2061 pharmacokinetic (PK) samples from 605 subjects exposed to liraglutide 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 mg once daily. Demographic factors (body weight, age, gender, country) of importance for liraglutide clearance were evaluated. An exploratory exposure-response analysis was conducted to investigate effects on glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and body weight.
   Results: Estimated liraglutide exposure (area under the curve; AUC) appeared to increase proportionally with increasing liraglutide dose (0.6-1.8 mg). The covariate analysis confirmed previous findings in a global clinical trial. Body weight was a predictor of liraglutide exposure; compared to a reference subject of 67 kg, exposure was 32% lower for maximum (115 kg) and 54% higher for minimum (37 kg) observed body weights. Gender, age and country had no relevant effect on exposure. Exposure-response analysis supported the use of 1.2 mg as maintenance dose with the option of individual dose escalation to 1.8 mg to optimize treatment outcomes.
   Conclusions: Exposure appeared to increase proportionally with increasing liraglutide dose in Asian subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The only PK relevant predictor of exposure was body weight. The exposure-response relationships for HbA(1c) and body weight in Asian subjects were similar to observations in global populations.

AB  - B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) gene is a well-known regulator of apoptosis and a key element in cancer development and progression. A regulatory (-938C > A, rs2279115) single-nucleotide polymorphism in the inhibitory P2 BCL-2 gene promoter generates significantly different BCL-2 promoter activities and has been associated with different clinical outcomes in various malignancies. The aim of the present study was to analyze the possible influence of the (-938C > A) SNP on the risk and survival of Indian patients suffering from NSCLC.
   A hospital-based case-control study of 155 age- and sex-matched patients diagnosed with NSCLC and 155 cancer-free controls was conducted and genotyped by performing PIRA-PCR to elucidate the putative association between clinical outcome and genotypes of BCL-2 (-938C > A, rs2279115). The association of the polymorphism with the survival of NSCLC patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves.
   In Indian NSCLC, patients increased risk of developing NSCLC was found to be associated with BCL-2 (-938) CC genotype, [OR 3.68 (1.92-6.79), RR 1.87 (1.35-2.57) and RD 31.03 (16.79-45.27) p 0.00006 for CC and OR 2.08 (1.18-3.66), RR 1.36 (1.08-1.71) and RD 17.74 (4.68-30.81) p 0.01 for AC genotype]. Patients homozygous for C allele exhibited a significant poor overall survival compared with patients displaying AC + CC or AC or AA genotype [median survival (months) 8 vs. 11 vs. 14 vs. 35.5 (p < 0.0001)]. In addition, significant associations were observed between TNM stage, histological type, distant metastases status, family history of any cancer, gender and age group of NSCLC patients with BCL-2 (-938C > A) polymorphism.
   Genetic polymorphism in the inhibitory P2 promoter region of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 genes contributes to the risk of developing non-small-cell lung cancer in Indian population. BCL-2 (-938CC) genotype was an independent adverse prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC.

AB  - There is limited data on proportion of Bitot's spots (BS), which could reappear after receiving mega dose of Vitamin A (MDVA), and their complete resolution. A prospective, community-based, cohort study with 12 months follow-up was conducted among children (1-5 years) with BS at a district from North India. On diagnosis, 200 000IU of vitamin A was administered on the same day, then after 4 weeks and subsequently after 6 months. Out of 262 children with BS, 157 (59.9%, 95% CI: 54.1-65.9) children had shown resolution of BS after the MDVA supplementation. Out of 157 children, 97 (61.8%, 95% CI: 54.2-69.4) had reappearance of BS after complete resolution. Kaplan-Meir analysis found that median duration of reappearance of BS was 5 months (95% CI: 3.8-6.2) after their complete resolution. The reappearance of BS after administration of two MDVA within 12 months suggests that children with possibly adequate serum retinol level status may have reappearance of BS.

AB  - Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) is a rare variety of soft tissue sarcoma that originates from Schwann cells or pluripotent cells of neural crest origin. They have historically been difficult tumours to diagnose and treat. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment with a goal to achieve negative margins. Despite aggressive surgery and adjuvant therapy, the prognosis of patients with MPNST remains poor. MPNST arising from penis is a very rare entity; thus, it presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We present a case of penile MPNST in a 38-year-old man in the absence of neurofibromatosis treated with surgery followed by post-operative radiotherapy to a dose of 60 Gray in 30 fractions and adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the change in anterior chamber angle parameters after scleral buckling surgery using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT).
   Methods: Fifty-five phakic eyes of 55 subjects undergoing scleral buckling with the placement of an encircling band for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were included in this study. Anterior chamber angle assessment was performed using ASOCT. The trabecular iris angle (TIA), the angle-opening distance, and the trabecular iris space area were the parameters obtained preoperatively and 48 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after the surgery using ASOCT. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 43.2 +/- 11.3 years; there were 38 male and 17 female patients. There was a significant decrease in all the angle parameters (TIA, angle opening distance, and trabecular iris space area) at 48 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery (P < 0.0001). TIA 180 degree decreased from 41.93 +/- 14.27 degrees preoperatively to 31.09 +/- 10.52 degrees (P < 0.0001) and TIA 0 degree from 42.7 +/- 14.04 degrees to 32.92 +/- 12.17 degrees (P < 0.0001) at 48 hours postoperatively. The mean IOP at 48 hours (17.04 +/- 3.26 mm Hg) was significantly higher than the preoperative level (12.68 +/- 1.96 mm Hg; P < 0.001). No significant difference was noted between the mean preoperative IOP and the IOP readings at 1 week (P = 0.402) and 1 month (P = 0.23) postoperatively.
   Conclusions: ASOCT imaging reveals that scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment induces significant narrowing of the anterior chamber angle.

AB  - Ureaplasma species are the most prevalent genital Mycoplasma isolated from the urogenital tract of both men and women. Ureaplasma has 14 known serotypes and is divided into two biovars-Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The organism has several genes coding for surface proteins, the most important being the gene encoding the Multiple Banded Antigen (MBA). The C-terminal domain of MBA is antigenic and elicits a host antibody response. Other virulence factors include phospholipases A and C, IgA protease and urease. Besides genital tract infections and infertility, Ureaplasma is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and diseases in the newborn (chronic lung disease and retinopathy of prematurity). Infection produces cytokines in the amniotic fluid which initiates preterm labour. They have also been reported from renal stone and suppurative arthritis. Genital infections have also been reported with an increasing frequency in HIV-infected patients. Ureaplasma may be a candidate 'co factor' in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the mainstay of diagnosis. Commercial assays are available with improved turnaround time. Micro broth dilution is routinely used to test antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates. The organisms are tested against azithromycin, josamycin, ofloxacin and doxycycline. Resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones have been reported. The susceptibility pattern also varies among the biovars with biovar 2 maintaining higher sensitivity rates. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent long term complications of Ureaplasma infections. After surveying PubMed literature using the terms 'Ureaplasma', 'Ureaplasma urealyticum' and 'Ureaplasma parvum', relevant literature were selected to provide a concise review on the recent developments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective tuberculosis (TB) control has been hindered by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).
   OBJECTIVE: To analyse the frequency of drug resistance among presumed cases of drug-resistant TB in the state of Punjab, India, and to determine the frequency of various genetic mutations detected using the line-probe assay (LPA).
   METHODS: Eight hundred patients with presumptive drug-resistant TB were enrolled under the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB under India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme. Sputum samples from these patients were subjected to smear microscopy and LPA. Clinicodemographic details along with drug resistance patterns and genetic mutations were studied.
   RESULTS: After excluding non-eligible samples, 545 samples were analysed, of which 290 (53.2%) showed resistance. Isoniazid and rifampicin (RMP) monoresistance were detected in respectively 9.3% (51/545) and 18% (98/545) of samples, while MDR was present in 25.8% (141/545) of samples. Of the MDR-TB cases, 2.1% (3/141) were treatment-nave, while 90.8% (128/141) were on retreatment. The most common mutation conferring RMP resistance was S531L.
   CONCLUSION: All patients undergoing retreatment for TB should be tested for drug susceptibility at the initial evaluation. Factors responsible for high MDR-TB and heteroresistance in Punjab need further studies.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) in children is a common cause of morbidity. Diagnosis is difficult because of paucibacillary nature of illness and difficulty in obtaining appropriate samples. Children presenting with poor weight gain, fever with or without cough for more than two weeks or contact with an adult in family with pulmonary tuberculosis should be investigated for TB. In all suspected cases of tuberculosis initial investigations include radiograph of chest (CXR) and Mantoux test. If CXR is suggestive of TB, an ambulatory gastric aspirate and induced sputum for acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear may be carried out in two days. Children with AFB positive or abnormal CXR with positive Mantoux test should be started on Antitubercular therapy (ATT). Rest of the patients require more investigations and should be referred to a specialist. All children with newly diagnosed tuberculosis should be treated with 6 mo of ATT (two months with 4 drugs, followed by four months with 2 drugs). Children on ATT should be monitored for improvement in symptoms and weight gain along with side effects of medications. CXR should be done after completion of treatment.

AB  - Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd) class belongs to Magnoliopsida family curcurbitaceae that is a traditionally used medicinal plant. Fruit of this plant are widely used as a therapeutic vegetable in various diseases, all over the Asia and Africa. Various parts of this plant like fruit, seed, leaf and root are used as alternative medicine. In the present study, primarily, we have focused on proteomic analysis of L. siceraria seed using phenol extraction method for protein isolation. Twenty-four colloidal coomassie blue stained protein spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) after resolving on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Out of 24 identified protein spots, four were grouped as unidentified proteins which clearly suggest that less work has been done in the direction of plant seed proteomics. These proteins have been found to implicate in various functions such as biosynthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins, serine/threonine kinase activity, plant disease resistance and transferase activity against insects by means of insecticidal and larval growth inhibitory, anti-HIV, antihelmintic and antimicrobial properties. By Blast2GO annotation analysis, amongst the identified proteins of L. siceraria, molecular function for majority of proteins has indispensable role in catalytic activity, few in binding activity and antioxidant activity; it is mostly distributed in cell, organelle, membrane and macromolecular complex. Most of them involved in biological process such as metabolic process, cellular process, response to stimulus, single organism process, signalling, biological recognition, cellular component organization or biogenesis and localization.

AB  - Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is accepted as a safe and minimally invasive modality for evaluation of mediastinal pathologies in adults. There is scanty literature on the utilization and performance characteristics of Convex probe EBUS-TBNA in children. The authors herein describe two pediatric patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy wherein the underlying diagnosis was unclear based on the clinico-radiological profile. A possibility of lymphoma was considered in one of the patients. EBUS-TBNA was performed for obtaining tissue samples from the enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and diagnosis of tuberculosis was established in both the patients. The authors review the available literature on Pediatric EBUS TBNA. EBUS-TBNA is an exciting and promising approach towards safe and accurate evaluation of mediastinal pathologies in children. Pediatric EBUS-TBNA needs further evaluation in prospective studies.

AB  - Background: Despite implementation of lung-protective ventilation strategy, acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with significant mortality, which necessitates the evaluation of ventilatory modes other than conventional lung-protective strategy. This meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials has been undertaken to know whether high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) provides any mortality benefit over conventional ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
   Methods: Published randomized controlled trials comparing HFOV with conventional lung-protective ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were included in this meta-analysis.
   Results: A total 1,759 patient data from seven randomized controlled trials have been analyzed here. Primary outcome of the review is in-hospital/30-day mortality and secondary outcomes are duration of intensive care unit stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, requirement of additional treatment, and complications associated with the interventions. HFOV does not offer any in-hospital/30-day mortality benefit (386 of 886 in HFOV vs. 368 of 873 in conventional ventilation; risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.19; P = 0.70) over conventional ventilation. It may also prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 1.18 days; 95% CI, 0.00 to 2.35 days; P = 0.05). Duration of intensive care unit stay (mean difference, 1.24 days; 95% CI, -0.08 to 2.56 days; P = 0.06) and requirement of neuromuscular blocker is similar between two treatment arm. Incidence of refractory hypoxemia is significantly less (risk ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.93; P = 0.02) with the use of HFOV. HFOV is not associated with increased incidence of barotrauma and refractory hypotension.
   Conclusion: HFOV should not be used routinely in all adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome as primary ventilation strategy in place of conventional lung-protective ventilation.

AB  - The process of child's mental development depends heavily on the social interrelationship between the mother and her child. Schizophrenia in mothers potentially disrupts mother infant relationship and adaptation to motherhood. Literature is limited on evaluating the emotional and behavioral problems of children of mother having schizophrenia with nearly none from the Indian subcontinent. The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of psychosocial environment in children of females with schizophrenia. Thirty children of mothers suffering with schizophrenia were evaluated with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents. The psychosocial environment was assessed using Parent Interview Schedule. Control group of 30 children were evaluated in the same way as the cases. The children of female patients with schizophrenia were found to score significantly higher on internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems on CBCL as compared to control group, along with significant differences in the psychosocial environment between the groups. We conclude that there is a need for screening and evaluation of children of mothers diagnosed with schizophrenia, for identifying and managing possible mental and behavioral problems in them, and to assess the psychosocial environment and provide interventions for issues related to it.

AB  - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a disease of adolescent males characterised by high vascularity with local aggressiveness. This analysis was intended to see the effectiveness of radiation in locally advanced JNA. We included patients treated from 1990-2012. A total of 31 patients met study criteria. Median age was 16 years (range: 12-33 years). Radiation was used for refractory, residual or unresectable locally advanced disease. The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range: 30-45 Gy). Median follow-up was 36 months (Range: 1-271 months). The median progression-free survival [PFS] was not reached. PFS at 3, 5 and 10 years was 91.7, 70.7 and 70.7% respectively. Three patients progressed at 38, 43 and 58 months after completion of treatment and opted for alternative therapy. One patient developed squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal ale 15 years after radiation.

AB  - Urethral injury is a common form of urogenital trauma in males. Urethral injuries can be diagnosed with ease in emergency due to the presence of blood clot at external urethral meatus or inability to catheterize the urethra. Stricture formation is usual sequelae of such injuries. Uncontrolled urethral hemorrhage is a relatively rare complication which can present either as immediate or delayed. Such injuries can be managed conservatively in majority; however, if uncontrolled may require interventional management. Such patients usually have underlying pseudoaneurysm formation or arteriovenous fistula. Here, we are reporting a case of bulbar urethral injury which presented with delayed uncontrolled urethral hemorrhage. On angiography, pseudoaneurysm arising from left bulbourethral artery with active urethral extravasation was noted and was managed with coil embolization.

AB  - Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is an extramedullary solid neoplasm of immature myeloid cells. These tumours usually develop in concurrence with or following acute leukemia. The breast is an uncommon site for presentation of this tumour, where it is often misdiagnosed as lymphoma or carcinoma. A 33-year- old female presented with a right breast lump in a private hospital, which was diagnosed as ductal carcinoma on lumpectomy. Subsequently she developed a lump in the left breast and a similar diagnosis of carcinoma was made on biopsy. A left mastectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a tumour composed of mononuclear cells arranged in sheets and cords with round to oval vesicular nuclei and occasional prominent nucleoli. IHC for CK was very weak and focal. The tumour cells were immunonegative for ER, PR, Her2neu, epithelial membrane antigen, e-cadherin, CD3 and CD20. Diffuse immunopositivity for myeloperoxidase, CD34 and CD117 established a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. A histopathological review of the right breast lesion, with immunohistochemistry, also confirmed the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Investigatory workup for acute myeloid leukemia, including bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and karyotypic studies, proved negative. The patient was treated with high dose cytarabine (HDAC) regimen and was disease free during the 12-month follow-up. Although extremely rare, awareness of such a presentation is crucial. This case also illustrates that careful histopathological review along with an expanded panel of immunohistochemistry is extremely important for recognizing such cases as a misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgery and inappropriate therapy.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF), methyl parathion (MPT), and malathion (MLT) are among the most extensively used organophosphate (OP) pesticides in India. DNA protein cross-links (DPC) and DNA strand breaks are toxic lesions associated with the mechanism(s) of toxicity of carcinogenic compounds. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that individual and interactive genotoxic effects of CPF, MPT, and MLT are involved in the formation of DPC and DNA strand break. The DNA strand break was measured by comet assay and expressed as DNA damage index, while DPC estimation was carried out by fluorescence emission assay. The results showed that exposure of rat lymphocytes with CPF, MPT, and MLT caused significantly marked increase in DNA damage and DPC formation in time-dependent manner. MPT caused the highest damage, and these pesticides do not potentiate the toxicity of each other.

AB  - Background: Blunt pancreatic trauma is an uncommon injury with high morbidity and mortality. Retrospective analyses of computed tomography (CT) performance report CT to have variable sensitivity in diagnosing pancreatic injury. Both a prospective analysis of multidetector CT (MDCT) performance and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in acute blunt pancreatic injury remain unexplored.
   Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the utility of MDCT with MRI correlation in patients with blunt pancreatic trauma using intraoperative findings as the gold standard for analysis.
   Material and Methods: The contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans of patients admitted with blunt abdominal trauma were prospectively evaluated for CT signs of pancreatic injury. Patients detected to have pancreatic injury on CT were assigned a CT grade of injury according to American Association for Surgery of Trauma classification. MRI was performed in patients not undergoing immediate laparotomy and MRI grade independent of CT grade was assigned. Surgical grade was taken as gold standard and accuracy of CT and MRI for grading pancreatic injury and pancreatic ductal injury (PDI) was calculated. A quantitative and qualitative comparison of MRI was also done with CT to determine the performance of MRI in acute pancreatic injury.
   Results: Thirty out of 1198 patients with blunt trauma abdomen were detected to have pancreatic injury on CT, which was surgically confirmed in 24 patients. Seventeen underwent MRI and surgical correlation was available in 14 patients. CT and MRI correctly identified the grade of pancreatic injury in 91.7% (22/24) and 92.86% (13/14) patients, respectively. Both CT and MRI correctly identified PDI in 18/19 and 11/12 patients, respectively, with good inter-modality agreement of 88.9% (kappa value of 0.78). MRI also qualitatively added to the information provided by CT and increased diagnostic confidence in 58.8% of patients.
   Conclusion: MDCT performs well in grading pancreatic injury and evaluating pancreatic ductal injury. MRI is useful in evaluation of acute pancreatic trauma as it can increase diagnostic confidence and provide more qualitative information regarding the extent of injury.

AB  - To assess utility of PCR in the diagnosis of bacterial corneal ulcer and to compare sensitivity and specificity of this technique with conventional laboratory methods. A prospective nonrandomized investigative study conducted on 122 eyes of presumed bacterial keratitis. Samples were collected for bacterial and fungal culture and Gram stain smear. A separate sample was taken for PCR with 26 gauge needle and was dipped directly into eppendorff tube with lysis buffer in it. Diagnosis of culture proven bacterial keratitis was established in 53 (43.4 %) and most common bacterial isolate was staphylococcal sp. (83 %). Direct microscopic examination of Gram stained smear revealed presence of bacteria in 24 (23.9 %) specimens and PCR positivity was evident in 56 (45.5 %). In preantibiotic treated eyes culture was positive in 15 (30 %), Gram stain in 9 (18 %), and PCR in 18 (36 %). The same for untreated (fresh) eyes, positivity of culture as well as PCR was noted in 38 (52.7 %) and that of Gram stain was noted in 20 (27.7 %). Sensitivity of Gram stain and PCR was 45.28 and 88.68 % respectively; whereas specificity was 92.75 % for Gram stain and 86.96 % for PCR. The average time taken for PCR reaction was 4-8 h while culture reporting took at least 24-48 h. Our findings suggest that PCR is a good adjunct modality to the "Gold Standard" technique in the diagnosis of bacterial corneal ulcer.

AB  - Introduction: This study provides insight into surface and elemental analyses of orthodontic retrieved mini-screw implants (MSIs). The sole purpose was to investigate the behavior of MSIs while they are in contact with bone and soft tissues, fluids, and food in the oral cavity. The information thus gathered may help to understand the underlying process of success or failure of MSIs and can be helpful in improving their material composition and design. Methods: The study was carried out on 28 titanium-alloy MSIs (all from the same manufacturer) split into 3 groups: 18 MSIs were retrieved after successful orthodontic treatment, 5 were failed MSIs, and 5 were as-received MSIs serving as the controls. All MSIs were subjected to energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis to investigate the changes in surface elemental composition and to scanning electron microscopy to analyze their surface topography. Data thus obtained were subjected to suitable statistical analyses. Results: Scanning electron microscope analysis showed surface manufacturing imperfections of the as-received MSIs in the form of stripes. Their elemental composition was confirmed to the specifications of the American Society for Testing of Materials for surgical implants. Retrieved MSIs exhibited generalized surface dullness; variable corrosion; craters in the head, neck, body, and tip regions; and blunting on tips and threads. Energy dispersive x-ray analyses showed deposition of additional elements: calcium had greater significance in its proportion in the body region by 0.056 weight percent; iron was seen in greater proportion in the failed retrieved MSIs compared with the successful miniscrews; cerium was seen in greater proportions in the head region by 0.128 weight percent and in the neck region by 0.147 weight percent than in the body and tip regions of retrieved MSIs. Conclusions: Retrieved MSIs showed considerable surface and structural alterations such as dullness, corrosion, and blunting of threads and tips. Their surfaces showed interactions and adsorption of several elements, such as calcium, at the body region. A high content of iron was found on the failed MSIs, and cerium was seen in the head and neck regions of retrieved MSIs.

AB  - Recurrent sigmoid volvulus is a clinical entity characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete sigmoid volvulus. Although it is commonly seen in the elderly, it can be occasionally seen in younger patients. Patients with recurrent partial sigmoid volvulus are relatively asymptomatic or present with mild abdominal pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to prevent conversion to acute gangrenous volvulus. We present a case of recurrent partial sigmoid volvulus in association with eventration of diaphragm in a 26-year-old man.

AB  - Vascular malformations and hemangiomas are common in children, but gastric hemangioma is extremely rare with less than 15 reported cases in the pediatric age group. Gastric hemangioma accounts for only 0.05% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms, and intra-abdominal hemangiomas are rarely found outside of the liver. We present a unique case of gastric hemangioma, and multiple hemangiomas were detected in a single scan by Tc-99m-labeled RBC blood pool imaging. This case also depicts the incremental role of SPECT/CT over planar acquisition for detecting multiple hemangiomas, especially for those lesions located adjacent to physiological blood pool activity.

AB  - In the present paper optimized dosimetric characteristics of low-Z magnesium tetra-borate MgB4O7:Mn,Tb using a thermoluminescence (TL) technique have been reported. The phosphor material was synthesized using a conventional high temperature solid-state diffusion reaction. The crystalline structure and phase purity of synthesized powder were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The material in the microcrystalline form was found to be in orthorhombic form. The comparative dosimetric properties of the phosphor material have been extensively investigated for its applications in personal and medical dosimetry. It has been found that the codoped MgB4O7:Mn,Tb material, exposed to gamma rays, shows better TL sensitivity and has an edge over the Mn and Tb doped samples as it is much more sensitive than the formers (550 and 40 times, respectively, more than the later ones). It has a simple glow curve structure (two well separated TL peaks centered at around 475 and 650 K). They are sufficiently above the room temperature (RT) to show low fading (similar to 10% in a month after storing in dark at RT). However, the fading is much faster, if exposed to sunlight/room light/UV radiation. This has been a serious problem with many borate based phosphors. A detailed study on bleaching to UV-visible light of different wavelengths (energies) has been carried out and a new mechanism based on redox reactions is proposed. Low fading (similar to 10% in a month) at room temperature on storing in dark, high TL sensitivity (3.5 times than that of TLD-100), tissue equivalence (Z(eff) approximate to 823) and linear dose response up to wide range (0.1 Gy to similar to 5.0 kGy) of gamma rays make it a suitable candidate for the radiation dosimetry and monitoring. However, it needs to be protected from sunlight/room light for fast fading. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was carried out at the Animal Bite Management (ABM) clinic in a primary health centre in the Faridabad district of Haryana. Information about socio-demographic characteristics, animal bite exposure and pre-treatment practices was obtained. Clinical examination determined the severity of the bite. All 619 patients who reported to the ABM clinic during January 2011 to December 2012 were included. Out of the total, 38% had applied chilli-oil paste, and 4% antiseptics to the wound as pre-treatment; only 30.6% had washed the wound with water. There was a direct association between traditional pre-treatment practices and delay in seeking treatment for animal bites which was statistically significant (P=0.01). Health education of the general population with culturally appropriate Information, Education and Communication material is therefore a necessary strategy to reduce delay in seeking appropriate treatment.

AB  - Objective To assess the effectiveness of a multi-component school based intervention in improving knowledge and behavioral practices regarding diet, physical activity and tobacco use in middle schoolchildren of rural-Ballabgarh, North-India.
   Methods A total of 40 middle schools were grouped into two, based on geographic proximity and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group in a cluster randomized controlled trial. The target population consisted of 2,348 children studying in 6th and 7th grades in these schools. The intervention consisted of a school component (policies), a classroom component (activities) and a family component [Information Education & Communication (IEC) material]. The main outcome measures were knowledge and behavioral changes in physical activity, diet and tobacco which were self-reported.
   Results Post-intervention, a significant number of intervention schools adopted the tobacco policy (16/19), physical activity policy (6/19) and healthy food policy (14/19) as compared to the control schools (n= 21). Knowledge about physical activity, diet and tobacco improved significantly in the intervention group as compared to the control group. Proportion of students attending Physical Training (PT) classes for five or more days in a week in the intervention group compared to the control group increased significantly (17.8 %; p< 0.01). Proportion of students consuming fruits increased in the intervention group compared to the control group (10 %; p< 0.01). Pre-post decrease in the prevalence of current smoking was significantly more in the intervention group as compared to the control group (7.7 %; p< 0.01).
   Conclusions Healthy settings approach for schools is feasible and effective in improving knowledge and behavioral practices of non-communicable diseases (NCD) risk factors in adolescents in rural India.

AB  - Pregnancy is accompanied by several haemodynamic, biochemical and haematological changes, which may lead to severe problems, if they are not suitably addressed. The current study highlights the haematological and biochemical differences observed in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP), in the 2nd trimester, in a north Indian population. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the body weight and body temperature of NAP compared with AP. A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in haematological parameters including haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, MCH and MCHC, was observed in AP; however, MCV was found to be significantly higher (p = 0.038). Many biochemical parameters viz. potassium, albumin, total protein and calcium levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in AP, except alkaline phosphatase whose level was found significantly increased (p < 0.01). The findings of the study suggest that haematological and biochemical changes take place in anaemia during pregnancy. Further, the results obtained should be used for establishing normative values for similar populations.

AB  - There is scanty data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the modified Atkins diet in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This study was a retrospective review of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome treated with the modified Atkins diet from May 2009 and March 2011. The diet was initiated in those children who persisted to have daily seizures despite the use of at least 3 appropriate antiepileptic drugs. Twenty-five children were started on a modified Atkins diet, restricting carbohydrate intake to 10 g/d. After 3 months, 2 patients were seizure-free, and 10/25 children had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. At 6 months, of 11 patients on the diet, 3 were seizure free and 8 had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. At 1 year, all 9 children on diet had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The side effects of the diet were mild. The modified Atkins diet was found to be effective and well tolerated in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

AB  - Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids into arachidonic add and lysophospholipids. Arachidonic acid is used as a substrate in the next step of the multistep pathway leading to the production of eicosanoids. The eicosanoids, in extremely low concentrations, are required in a number of physiological processes. However, the increase in their concentrations above the essential physiological requirements leads to various inflammatory conditions. In order to prevent the unwanted rise in the concentrations of eicosanoids, the actions of PLA2 and other enzymes of the pathway need to be blocked. We report here the structures of five complexes of group IIA PLA2 from Daboia russelli pulchella with tightly binding inhibitors, (i) p-coumaric acid, (ii) resveratrol, (iii) spermidine, (iv) corticosterone and (v) gramine derivative. The binding studies using fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance techniques for the interactions of PLA2 with the above five compounds showed high binding affinities with values of dissociation constants (K-D) ranging from 3.7 x 10(-8) M to 2.1 x 10(-9) M. The structure determinations of the complexes of PLA2 with the above five compounds showed that all the compounds bound to PLA2 in the substrate binding cleft. The protein residues that contributed to the interactions with these compounds included Leu2, Leu3, Phe5, Gly6,Ile9, Ala18,Ile19, Trp22, Ser23, Cys29, Gly30, Cys45, His48, Asp49 and Phe106. The positions of side chains of several residues including Leu2, Leu3, Ile19, Trp31, Lys69, Ser70 and Arg72 got significantly shifted while the positions of active site residues, His48, Asp49, Tyr52 and Asp99 were unperturbed.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the temporal macular retinal thickness in normal, early, and advanced glaucomatous eyes using optical coherence tomography 3 (OCT-3) and correlate the superior-to-inferior retinal thickness (S/I RT) ratio with corresponding field defects in early and advanced glaucoma patients.
   Patients and Methods: Forty normal eyes, 40 eyes with early glaucomatous visual field defects, and 33 eyes with advanced visual field defects were included. All participants underwent complete ocular and visual field examinations and OCT-3 imaging on the same day. A 3x3 mm area temporal to the foveal reflex was scanned with the OCT-3 using 6 horizontal, equally spaced raster lines. Retinal thickness was evaluated at points 500 mm apart for each line and S/I RT ratio computed between similar points above and below the fovea for each patient. One-way ANOVA was used to compare S/I RT ratio between the normal, early, and advanced glaucoma eyes.
   Results: Average retinal thickness increased progressively, as points temporal to the fovea were scanned. There was a statistically significant difference between the average superior and inferior retinal thickness at points 1500, 2000, and 2500 mm temporal to the fovea in both early and advanced glaucoma eyes (P < 0.05) with corresponding significant differences in the S/I RT ratios, when compared with the normal participants (P < 0.017).
   Conclusions: OCT-3-generated S/I RT ratios were successfully able to reproduce the structural damage in eyes with early and advanced glaucoma field defects and can complement optic disc scanning protocols in diagnosing glaucoma at an early stage.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) owes its success as a pathogen in large measure to its ability to exist in a persistent state of 'dormancy' resulting in a lifelong latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. An understanding of bacterial adaptation during dormancy will help in devising approaches to counter latent TB infection. In vitro models have provided valuable insights into bacterial adaptation; however, they have limitations because they do not disclose the bacterial response to the intracellular environment wherein the bacteria are simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses. We describe the pleiotropic response of Mtb in the vitamin C (vit C) model of dormancy developed in our laboratory. Vit C mediates a rapid regulation of genes representing similar to 14% of the genome in Mtb cultures. The upregulated genes were better represented in lipid, intermediary metabolism and regulatory protein categories. The downregulated genes mainly related to virulence, detoxification, information pathways and cell wall processes. A comparison of this response to that in other models indicates that vit C generates a multiple-stress environment for axenic Mtb cultures that resembles a macrophage-like environment. The bacterial response to vit C resembles responses to gaseous stresses such as hypoxia and nitric oxide, oxidative and nitrosative stresses, nutrient starvation and, notably, the activated macrophage environment itself. These responses demonstrate that the influence of vit C on Mtb gene expression extends well beyond the DevR dormancy regulon. A detailed characterization of the response to vit C is expected to disclose useful strategies to counter the adaptive mechanisms essential to Mtb dormancy.

AB  - Background CDC25 proteins play a pivotal role in controlling cell proliferation during development and tumorigenesis. The aim of the study is to elucidate the role of CDC25A and CDC25B proteins in retinoblastoma and their association with the clinical and histopathological parameters.
   Methods One hundred and nine prospective cases of primary enucleated retinoblastomas were included in the present study. Expression of CDC25A and CDC25B proteins was investigated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and mRNA expression by reverse-transcriptase PCR.
   Results lmmunohistochemistry showed CDC25A expression in (57/109) 52.29%, whereas CDC25B expressed in (69/109) 63.30% cases. Western blotting confirmed the immunoreactivity results on representative cases. mRNA expression of CDC25A and CDC25B was found in 29/60 (48.33%) and 35/60 (58.33%) cases, respectively. Expression of CDC25A and CDC25B showed significant correlation with poor tumour differentiation and tumour invasion (p<0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the overall survival of patients with CDC25B expression (p=0.0270).
   Conclusions Our results suggest that expression of CDC25B may be used as a potential prognostic marker in the pathogenesis of retinoblastoma. These findings demonstrate an important role of CDC25 phosphatase proteins and inhibition of these proteins may have therapeutic potential in retinoblastoma.

AB  - BackgroundRegulation of apoptosis is a complex process that involves a number of genes, including Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bax and other Bcl-2 family members. The aim of the present study is to assess the expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax in retinoblastoma, and correlate them with clinical and histopathological parameters.
   MethodsThe expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were examined using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a series of 60 prospective cases of primary retinoblastoma tissues.
   ResultsImmunohistochemistry showed expression of Bcl-2 in 40/60 (66.6%), whereas Bax expression was found only in 18/60 (30%) cases, and these correlated with mRNA expression. The Western blotting results also correlated well with the immunohistochemical expression of Bcl-2 (25kDa) and Bax (21kDa) proteins. Bcl-2 was expressed in 96% (24/25) of invasive tumours and in 45.7% (16/35) of non-invasive tumours. Expression of Bcl-2 significantly correlated with tumour invasiveness (P=0.0274) and poor differentiation (P=0.0163), whereas loss of Bax correlated with massive choroidal invasion and Pathological Tumor-Node-Metastasis (pTNM) (P=0.0341). However, no correlation was found between Bax and Bcl-2 expression.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that these apoptotic regulatory proteins may serve as poor prognostic markers and can be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of invasive retinoblastoma. Further functional studies are required to explore the role of Bax and Bcl-2 in retinoblastoma.

AB  - Factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors present major clinical challenge as a complication of hemophilia A in patients on treatment with FVIII concentrates and as acquired autoantibodies in patients without hemophilia A. We aimed to study the prevalence of FVIII inhibitors in Indian settings, risk factors involved in early development of inhibitors in patients with hemophilia, differences in their clinical behavior, and approach to treatment, in comparison to patients with acquired hemophilia. The overall prevalence of FVIII inhibitors in patients with severe hemophilia A was found to be 22.3%. Two cases of acquired hemophilia were reported. Due to heterogeneity of our study population, cases have been discussed individually. We observed that the early development of FVIII inhibitors in patients with hemophilia A is dependent upon an interplay of several risk factors that need to be studied in a multivariable analysis to bring out significant correlation with response to treatment. Also, they differ from patients without hemophilia A entirely in terms of presentation and management.

AB  - Introduction: Somatic mutation in the exon 14 of Janus Kinase 2 gene is an established diagnostic marker in bcr-abl negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, especially primary idiopathic myelofibrosis (PIMF). Aim: Our primary aim was to find out the correlation between the JAK2V617F mutational status and the clinico-hematologic characteristics, as well as the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) scoring of patients with PIMF. Materials and Methods: Clinical and hematologic features were reviewed for 68 patients with primary idiopathic myelofibrosis (PIMF). JAK2V617F mutation status was analyzed by amplification refractory mutation screening-polymerase chain reaction. The patients were further stratified into low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high-risk groups on the basis of IPSS scoring. Results: The JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 58.8% patients. Univariate analysis of variables at presentation identified that JAK2V617F negative patients were significantly associated with more severe anemia (P = 0.045), younger age (P = 0.008), higher transfusion requirement (P = 0.017), and thrombocytopenia (P = 0.015). Patients who were homozygous for JAK2V617F mutation were associated with thrombocytosis (P = 0.014) and also had higher median total leucocyte count (P = 0.20) than the other groups. No significant correlation was detected between JAK2V617F mutational status and the presence of constitutional symptoms, spleen size, grade of bone marrow fibrosis or prognostic risk stratification of the PIMF patients. Conclusion: The variations in the prognostic implication of PIMF patients with mutation status as stated by various publications worldwide, reinstates the need for larger prospective studies using standardized JAK2V617F quantification methods as well as estimation of other newer molecular markers to develop deeper insight into various molecular alterations involving PIMF patients in India as well as worldwide.

AB  - PURPOSE To assess the visual field defects in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) and to identify associated risk factors.
   METHODS In this cross-sectional study visual fields of consecutive PCG patients were examined using Humphery Field Analyzer (HFA) or Goldmann visual field (GVF). All patients had maintained an intraoaular pressure (TOP) <= 14 mm Hg on standard care. Mean deviation, pattern standard deviation (PSD), foveal threshold in HFA, and global visual field extent (degrees) in 24 meridians for targets V4e, I4e, I2e in GVF were recorded and evaluated with respect to baseline TOP and age at detection. Statistical analysis was performed by Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney test. Qualitative analysis of GVF and reliable fields in HFA was performed.
   RESULTS A total of 100 eyes of 77 patients were included: 56 eyes of 47 patients were in the HFA group; 44 eyes of 30 patients, in the GVF group. On HFA, mean deviation detected at <= 1 month of age was significantly lower than eyes detected after 1 year (P < 0.001). On GVF, the global visual field extent for target I4e and I2e was significantly lower for PCG detected at <= 1 month of age compared to those seen at >1 year (I4e, P < 0.001; I2e, P = 0.005). Mean deviation, PSD, and foveal threshold were significantly lower in PCG with baseline TOP of >30 mm Hg than with TOP of 20-25 mm Hg (mean deviation, P < 0.001; PSD, P = 0.002; foveal threshold, P = 0.002). Extent for targets V4e and I4e on GVF were significantly lower in patients with baseline TOP of >30 mm Hg compared to those with baseline TOP of 20-25 mm Hg (V4e, P = 0.002; I4e, P = 0.003). Definitive glaucomatous defects were found in 36 eyes (41%), most ommon being arcuate scotoma (19 eyes [22%]).
   CONCLUSIONS PCG detected at age <= 1 month and those having a baseline TOP of >30 mm Hg show greater visual field loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors are predisposed to obesity. However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not known. AIMS: The study was done to assess the role of biomarkers of obesity in acute leukemia survivors. SETTINGS AND DESIGNS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences in survivors of acute leukemia who had completed treatment at least 1 year before enrollment in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Obesity was studied by determining the body mass index. Potential biomarkers were studied by assessing serum leptin, resistin, and adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, and the results were compared in obese versus nonobese survivors. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis for baseline demographic factors and Student's t-test for comparing the mean levels of biomarkers among the obese and nonobese survivors. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-nine acute leukemia patients were enrolled in this study with a median follow-up of 36.8 months. The median age was 10 (range: 3-18) years, and 123 (77.3%) patients were males. The overall prevalence of overweight/obesity was 26.4%, and this was similar in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia sub-groups (26.2% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.9). Mean serum leptin and resistin were similar in obese and nonobese leukemia survivors (3.7 vs. 2.85 pg/mL, P = 0.064; 8.01 vs. 9.33 ng/mL, P = 0.36). However, mean serum adiponectin was significantly lower in obese leukemia survivors (7.97 vs. 11.5 mu g/mL, P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Obese leukemic survivors had lower serum adiponectin levels than nonobese survivors. However, serum resistin and leptin levels were similar in the two groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large data pertaining to indicators of malnutrition in children with cancer is lacking from India. In view of this, we prospectively analyzed consecutive de novo childhood patients with cancer presenting at a tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Height and weight of each child (n = 690) were compared with World Health Organization child growth standards-2006 for that particular age and sex to get weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height indices and below 2SD of the reference median on these indices were considered as underweight, stunted, and wasted, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) for age was also analyzed for thinness and obesity. RESULTS: Prevalence of malnutrition based on Z-score for weight-for-age, height-for-age, weight-for-height, and BMI-for-age was 30%, 31%, 35%, and 41%, respectively. Weight-for-age (underweight) was significantly associated (P = 0.018) with solid tumors. Height-for-age, weight-for-age, and BMI-for-age were significantly associated (P = 0.007, P = 0.016, and P = 0.001, respectively) with rural community. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition was observed in approximately one-third of children with cancer. Malnutrition is associated with solid tumors and those coming from rural community. Wasting has a higher prevalence in children with cancer in <5 years of age group.

AB  - Background Vitiligo is an autoimmune depigmentation disease, and defects in regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been proposed in the pathogenesis of generalized vitiligo (GV). However, the role of programmed cell death (PD)1(+) Tregs has not been studied.
   Objectives To investigate the status of Tregs, PD1(+) Tregs and associated parameters in active GV (aGV) during the first episode of disease attack and to establish the clinical correlation.
   Methods The percentages of circulating Tregs, PD1(+) Tregs and CD3(+)CD4(+)PD1(+) T cells were evaluated in 50 patients with aGV and 51 controls. Expression levels of FOXP3, TGFB1, CTLA4 and genes for chemokine receptors (CCR4, CCR7) and their ligands (CCL21, CCL22) were quantified in peripheral blood and in lesional, perilesional, nonlesional and normal skin sections. The corresponding proteins were immunolocalized in tissue of aGV.
   Results The percentage of Tregs was decreased (P = 0.001) and that of PD1(+) Tregs increased (P = 0.001) in peripheral blood of patients with aGV compared with controls. The abundance of TGFB1 and CCL21 mRNA was significantly decreased in the peripheral blood of patients with aGV. Significant differences in forkhead box P3, transforming growth factor-beta and CCL21 protein expression were found in skin sections.
   Conclusions Deficiency in Treg frequency and decreased expression of Treg-associated parameters (TGFB and CCL21) suggested a possible defect in Tregs that may alter their suppression function and skin homing in aGV. The increased PD1(+) Tregs suggests that the PD1/PD ligand pathway may be involved in aGV and may have a role in Treg exhaustion. Further study is required to delineate the effect of PD1 in regulating Treg function in aGV.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe a modified technique of sutureless DSAEK with continuous pressurized internal air tamponade. This was a prospective interventional case series, single-center, institutional study. Twenty-seven patients with corneal decompensation without scarring were included. Aphakic patients and patients with cataractous lens requiring IOL implantation surgery were excluded. Following preparation of the donor tissue, a corneal tunnel was made nasally with two side ports. All incisions were kept long enough to be overlapped by the peripheral part of the donor tissue. Descemet membrane scoring was done using a reverse Sinskey hook, following which it was removed with the same instrument or by forceps. The donor lenticule was then inserted using Busin's glide. Continuous pressurized internal air tamponade was achieved by means of a 30-gauge needle, inserted through the posterior limbus, for 12-14 min. At the end of the surgery, air was partially replaced with BSS, leaving a moderate-sized mobile air bubble in the anterior chamber. At the 6 month's follow-up, CDVA improved from counting fingers at half meter-6/24 preoperatively to 6/9-6/18 postoperatively, and the mean endothelial cell count decreased: to 1,800 from 2,200 cell/mm(2) preoperatively (18.19 % endothelial cell loss). Donor lenticule thickness as documented on AS-OCT was 70-110 A mu on Day 1 and 50-80 A mu at 6 months postoperative. None of the cases had flat AC or peripheral anterior synechiae formation. None of the patients required a second intervention. There were no cases of primary graft failure, pupillary block glaucomax or donor lenticule dislocation postoperatively. Our modified technique is simple and effective with reduction in postoperative complications associated with DSAEK, thereby maximizing anatomic and functional outcomes associated.

AB  - Cushings syndrome (CS) is the multisystem disorder which is due to cortisol excess. It is very difficult to diagnose in early stages, especially when psychiatric manifestations are the predominant complaints. It could result in significant morbidity and mortality. We report a case of resistant bipolar affective disorder secondary to CS. Early diagnosis and treatment will lead to better functional outcome and prevention of neurocognitive side-effects of excessive cortisol.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of heparinized saline administered as intermittent flush on functional duration of the peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) in neonates.
   STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Neonatal intensive care unit of a teaching hospital. Participants: Term and preterm neonates born at 432 weeks of gestation who required PIVC only for intermittent administration of antibiotics. Intervention: Eligible neonates were randomized to receive 1ml of either heparinized saline (10 Uml(-1)) (n = 60) or normal saline (n = 60) every 12 h before and after intravenous antibiotics. Main outcome measure: Functional duration of first peripheral intravenous catheter.
   RESULT: A total of 120 neonates were randomized to two groups of 60 neonates each. The mean (s.d.) of age of babies in case and control group was 5.7 (2.5) days and 4.6 (3.1) days, respectively. The average weight of babies in both the groups was 2.1 kg. Mean functional duration of first catheter was more in heparinized saline group, mean (s.d.) of 71.68 h (27.3) as compared with 57.7 h (23.6) in normal saline group (P<0.005). The mean (95% confidence interval) difference in functional duration in the two groups was 13.9 h (4.7-23.15). Mean duration of patency for any catheter was also significantly more in heparinized saline group than control group.
   CONCLUSION: Heparinized saline flush increases the functional duration of peripheral intravenous catheter.

AB  - Presence of point mutations within the drug resistance determining regions of Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) genome confers molecular basis of drug resistance to dapsone, rifampin and ofloxacin in leprosy. This study is focused on the identification of mutations within the rpoB gene region of M. leprae that are specific for rifampin interaction, and further in silico analysis was carried out to determine the variations in the interactions. DNA and RNA were isolated from slit skin scrapings of 60 relapsed leprosy patients. PCR targeting rpoB gene region and amplicon sequencing was performed to determine point mutations. mRNA expression levels of rpoB and high-resolution melt analysis of mutants were performed using Rotor Gene Q Realtime PCR. Molecular docking was performed using LigandFit Software. Ten cases having point mutations within the rpoB gene region were identified and were clinically confirmed to be resistant to rifampin. A new mutation at codon position Gln442His has been identified. There is a 9.44-fold upregulation in the mRNA expression of rpoB gene in mutant/resistant samples when compared with the wild/sensitive samples. In silico docking analysis of rifampin with wild-type and Gln442His mutant RpoB proteins revealed a variation in the hydrogen-bonding pattern leading to a difference in the total interaction energy and conformational change at position Asp441. These preliminary downstream functional observations revealed that the presence of point mutations within the rifampin resistance determining regions of rpoB gene plays a vital role in conferring genetic and molecular basis of resistance to rifampin in leprosy.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide (CyP) in acute macular serpiginous choroiditis (SC). Methods: Patients with acute macular SC with lesions threatening and/or involving fovea were enrolled. All patients received CyP (1 g/m(2)) for 3 days followed by high-dose oral steroids (1.5 mg/kg) tapered over 6 months and monitored for visual acuity, response to treatment and systemic side effects. Results: Eight patients (seven unilateral and one bilateral) with median age of 27 years (range: 13-40 years) were recruited. Mean visual acuity at presentation was 0.71 +/- 0.35 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution while postpulse visual acuity was 0.40 +/- 0.32. Final mean visual acuity at 1-year was 0.31 +/- 0.23 (P <= 0.05). Three eyes had recurrence and 3 patients developed transient hair loss with no other adverse effect. Conclusion: Intravenous CyP provides rapid resolution of lesion activity and thereby helps in maintaining good functional acuity.

TI  - A Two-Year Follow-Up Case of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Substantial Improvement in Personality Following a Yoga-Based Lifestyle Intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
AB  - Background and Objective: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is characterized by excessive fatigue after minimal physical or mental exertion, muscle and joint pain, poor concentration, dizziness, and sleep disturbances. We report here the effect of a yoga-based lifestyle intervention in a 30-year old male patient with a documented diagnosis of CFS with compromised quality of life (QoL) and altered personality.
   Methods: The patient initially attended a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention program that consisted of yoga-postures, breathing exercises (pranayama), meditation, group discussions, and individualized advice on stress management, diet and physical activity besides group support. Thereafter, patient attended 5 more such programs.
   Results: There was a notable and consistent improvement in his clinical profile, positive aspects of personality and subjective well-being, and reduction in anxiety following this yoga-based lifestyle intervention.
   Conclusion: Overall, the results suggest that lifestyle intervention may improve clinical condition and personality in patients with CFS.

AB  - Background. Plasmodium vivax synthesizes the largest number of 36 tryptophan-rich proteins belonging to the Pv-fam-a family. These parasite proteins need to be characterized for their biological function because tryptophanrich proteins from other Plasmodium species have been proposed as vaccine candidates.
   Methods. Recombinant P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens (PvTRAgs) were used to determine their erythrocyte-binding activity by a cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and a rosetting assay.
   Results. Only 4 (PvTRAg26.3, PvTRAg34, PvTRAg36, and PvTRAg36.6) of 21 PvTRAgs bind to host erythrocytes. The cross-competition data indicated that PvTRAg36 and PvTRAg34 share their erythrocyte receptors with previously described proteins PvTRAg38 and PvTRAg33.5, respectively. On the other hand, PvTRAg26.3 and PvTRAg36.6 cross-compete with each other and not with any other PvTRAg, indicating that these 2 proteins bind to the same but yet another set of erythrocyte receptor(s). Together, 10 of 36 PvTRAgs possess erythrocyte-binding activity in which each protein recognizes >1 erythrocyte receptor. Further, each erythrocyte receptor is shared by >1 PvTRAg.
   Conclusions. This redundancy may be useful for the parasite to invade red blood cells and cause disease pathogenesis, and it can be exploited to develop therapeutics against P. vivax malaria.

KW  - POLYMERIZATION
KW  - SEQUENCE
KW  - REGION
AB  - Antithrombin III (AT) is the main inhibitor of blood coagulation proteases like thrombin and factor Xa. In this study we report the identification and characterization of several variants of AT for the first time in Indian population. We screened 1950 deep vein thrombosis (DVT) patients for AT activity and antigen levels. DNA sequencing was further carried out in patients with low AT activity and/or antigen levels to identify variations in the AT gene. Two families, one with type I and the other with type II AT deficiency were identified. Three members of family I showed an increase in the coagulation rates and recurrent thrombosis in this family was solely attributed to the rs2227589 polymorphism. Four members of family II spanning two generations had normal antigen levels and decreased AT activity. A novel single nucleotide insertion, g.13362_13363insA in this family in addition to g.2603T>C (p.R47C) mutation were identified. AT purified from patient's plasma on hi-trap heparin column showed a marked decrease in heparin affinity and thrombin inhibition rates. Western blot analysis showed the presence of aggregated AT. We also report a novel point mutation at position g.7549A>G (p.T280A), that is highly conserved in serpin family. Variant protein isolated from patient plasma indicated loss of regulatory function due to in-vivo polymerization. In conclusion this is the first report of AT mutations in SERPINC1 gene in Indo-Aryan population where a novel point mutation p.T280A and a novel single nucleotide insertion g.13362_13363insA are reported in addition to known variants like p.R47C, p.C4-X and polymorphisms of rs2227598, PstI and DdeI.

KW  - HEALTH-CARE
AB  - Background: Antenatal Care (ANC) is one of the crucial factors in ensuring healthy outcomes in women and newborns. Nutrition education and counselling is an integral part of ANC that influences maternal and child health outcomes. A cross sectional study was conducted in Pregnant Women (PW) and mothers who had delivered in the past three months; Recently Delivered Women (RDW) in urban slums of North-east district of Delhi, India, to explore ANC utilization, dietary practices and nutritional outcomes.
   Methods: A household survey was conducted in three urban slums to identify PW and RDW. Socio-economic and demographic profile, various components of ANC received including nutrition counselling, dietary intake and nutritional outcomes based on anthropometric indices and anaemia status were assessed. Socio-demographic characteristics, nutrient intake and nutritional status were compared between those who availed ANC versus those who did not using logistic regression. Descriptive summary for services and counselling received; dietary and nutrient intake during ANC were presented.
   Results: Almost 80% (274 out of 344) women received some form of ANC but the package was inadequate. Determinants for non-utilization of ANC were poverty, literacy, migration, duration of stay in the locality and high parity. Counselling on nutrition was reported by a fourth of the population. Nutrient intake showed suboptimal consumption of protein and micronutrients like iron, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin niacin, zinc and vitamin B12 by more than half of women. A high prevalence of anaemia among PW (85%) and RDW (97.1%) was observed. There was no difference in micronutrient intake and anaemia prevalence among women who received ANC versus who did not.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women living in urban poor settlements have poor nutritional status. This may be improved by strengthening the nutrition counselling component of ANC which was inadequate in the ANC package received. Empowering community based health workers in providing effective nutrition counselling should be explored given the overburdened public health system.

AB  - Background and Aim
   In health, TLR signaling protects the intestinal epithelial barrier and in disease, aberrant TLR signaling stimulates diverse inflammatory responses. Association of TLR polymorphisms is ethnicity dependent but how they impact the complex pathogenesis of IBD is not clearly defined. So we propose to study the status of polymorphisms in TLR family of genes and their effect on cytokines level in UC patients.
   Methods
   The genotypes of the six loci TLR1-R80T, TLR2-R753Q, TLR3-S258G, TLR5-R392X, TLR5-N592S and TLR6-S249P were determined in 350 controls and 328 UC patients by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA in blood plasma samples. Data were analyzed statistically by SPSS software.
   Results
   TLR5 variants R392X and N592S showed significant association (p = 0.007, 0.021) with UC patients but TLR 1, 2, 3, 6 variants did not show any association. Unlike other studies carried out in different ethnic groups, TLR 6 (S249P) SNP was universally present in our population irrespective of disease. Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis revealed that the patients having combination of multiple SNPs both in TLR5 and TLR4 gene suffered from severe disease condition and diagnosed at an early age. The level of TNF alpha (p = 0.004), IL-6 (p = 0.0001) and IFN gamma (p = 0.006) significantly increased in patients as compared to controls having wild genotypes for the studied SNPs. However, there was decreased level of TNF alpha (p = 0.014), IL-6 (p = 0.028) and IFN gamma (p = 0.001) in patients carrying TLR5-R392X variant as compared to wild type patients. Patients carrying two simultaneous SNPs D299G in TLR4 gene and N592S in TLR5 gene showed significant decrease in the levels of TNFa (p = 0.011) and IFN. (p = 0.016).
   Conclusion
   Polymorphisms in TLR 5 genes were significantly associated with the UC in North Indian population. The cytokine level was significantly modulated in patients with different genotypes of TLR4 and TLR5 SNPs.

AB  - Facial nerve schwannoma occurring within the parotid gland is a rare tumour. We report a case of schwannoma within the parotid gland in a young female patient, who underwent ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent surgical excision of the lesion. The lesion showed hyperintensity on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI. There was no adjacent lymphadenopathy. Although hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted MRI could suggest malignant tumours, the characteristic "string sign" provided the clue for the diagnosis of schwannoma.

AB  - Background: The available pharmacokinetic data on anti-tubercular drugs in children raises the concern of suboptimalplasma concentrations attained when doses extrapolated from adult studies are used. Also, there is lack of consensus regarding the effect of malnutrition on pharmacokinetics of anti-tubercular drugs in children. We conducted this study with the aims of determining the plasma concentrations of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol achieved with different dosage of the anti-tubercular drugs so as to provide supportive evidence to the revised dosages and to evaluate the effects of malnutrition on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in children. We also attempted to correlate the plasma concentrations of these drugs with clinical outcome of therapy.
   Method: Prospective drug estimation study was conducted in two groups of children, age 6 months to 15 years, with tuberculosis, with or without severe malnutrition, receiving different dosage of daily anti-tubercular therapy. The dosage (range) of isoniazid was 5 (4-6) and 10 (7-15) mg/kg in the two groups, respectively, that of rifampicin-10 (8-12) and 15 (10-12) mg/kg, respectively, both the groups received same dose of pyrazinamide (30-35 mg/kg) and ethambutol (20-25 mg/kg). All four drugs were simultaneously estimated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   Results and conclusion: The median (IQR) C-max of isoniazid increased significantly from 0.6 (0.3,1.2) mu g/mL to 3.4 (1.8, 5.0) mu g/mL with increase in the dose. Plasma rifampicin concentrations increased only marginally on increasing the dose [median (IQR) C-max: 10.4 (7.2, 13.9) mu g/mL vs. 12.0 (6.1, 24.3) mu g/mL, p = 0.08]. For ethambutol, 55.9% of the children had inadequate 2-hour concentrations. Two-hour plasma concentrations of at least one drug were low in 59 (92.2%) and 54 (85.7%) children in the two dosing regimen, respectively. We did not observe any effect of malnutrition on pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs studied. We did not observe an association between low plasma drug concentrations and poor outcome. We may have to be cautious while increasing the doses and strive to asses other factors influencing the drug concentrations and treatment outcomes in children.

AB  - Background: Galectins are a family of carbohydrate binding proteins that regulate several cellular functions such as growth, migration, adhesion and apoptosis.
   Methods: We investigated the expression of galectin (gal)-1 and galectin (gal)-3 in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and observed their effects on growth and survival of OSCC cell lines.
   Results: OSCC patients expressed significantly higher levels of gal-1 and gal-3 in circulation (p < 0.0001) and at the tumour sites (p < 0.01) as compared to controls. Patients with higher tumour load showed significantly higher expression of both galectins than those with lower tumour load. In ROC analysis, serum levels of gal-1 and gal-3 at cut-off values of 4.875 and 0.871 ng/ml respectively, discriminated between healthy subjects and patients with more than 80% sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, logistic regression analysis revealed about 3-times higher risk of OSCC in subjects over expressing these proteins. Further, exogenous gal-1 and gal-3 significantly increased survival, proliferation and angiogenesis in OSCC cell lines.
   Conclusions: Serum levels of gal-1 and gal-3 may serve as plausible markers for oral squamous cell carcinoma and may be useful in screening population at a higher risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) represents a malignancy of B-cells characterized by proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). Versican (VCAN), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, appears to be involved in multiple processes in several cancers. Identifying optimum diagnostic markers and delineating its association with disease severity might be important for controlling MM.
   Methods: Expression of VCAN and its associated molecules (beta-catenin, 1 beta integrin and FAK) were investigated in 60 subjects to evaluate their usefulness as diagnostic marker. Circulatory and molecular levels of above molecules were analyzed in their BM and Blood using ELISA, Q-PCR and western blotting along with their ROC curve analysis.
   Results: Circulatory levels of VCAN, beta-catenin and FAK were significantly higher in patients with varying significance in each stage. beta-Catenin and FAK intracellular levels were significantly elevated in patients. mRNA levels of all molecules were significantly higher in BMMNCs while VCAN and beta-catenin also showed increase in PBMCs. Upregulation of these molecules was also observed at protein level. ROC curve analysis for VCAN showed absolute combination of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis in serum.
   Conclusions: Significant elevation of VCAN and its associated molecules imply their role in MM. Optimal sensitivity and specificity of VCAN might utilize its importance as potential marker for active disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Pharmacological stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) has been recognized as a molecular switch in alleviating myocardial injury through modulating oxidative, inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways. This study was designed to elucidate the effect of chrysin, a novel PPAR-gamma agonist and its functional interaction with TGF-beta/MAPKs in isoproterenol-challenged myocardial injury in rats.
   Methods: Male Wistar Albino rats were either subjected to vehicle (1.5 mL/kg, p.o.) or chrysin (15-60 mg/kg, p.o.) for 28 days. Isoproterenol (85 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered to rats on 27th and 28th day to induce myocardial injury.
   Results: Chrysin dose dependently improved ventricular (+/- LVdP/dtmax and LVEDP) and hemodynamic (SAP, MAP and DAP) dysfunction in isoproterenol-insulted rats. This beneficial effect of chrysin was well supported with increased expression of PPAR-gamma and decreased expression of TGF-beta as evidenced by western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. Moreover, downstream signaling pathway of TGF-beta viz. P-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 activation and P-JNK/JNK, P-p38/p38 and MMP-2 inhibition were also observed. Chrysin also attenuated NF-kappa Bp65 and IKK-beta expressions, TNF-alpha level and TUNEL positivity thereby validating its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Additionally, chrysin in a dose dependent fashion improved NO level, redox status of the myocardium (GSH and MDA levels and SOD, GSHPx and CAT activities), cardiac injury markers (CK-MB and LDH levels) and oxidative DNA damage marker (8-OHdG level) and displayed preservation of subcellular and ultrastructural components.
   Conclusion: We established that activation of PPAR-. and inhibition of TGF-beta via MAPKs dependent mechanism is critical for cardioprotective effect of chrysin.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to detect fungal hyphae in a corneal scraping sample using a cost-effective assembly of smartphone and pocket magnifier.
   Methods: In this case report, a tissue sample was obtained by conventional corneal scraping from a clinically suspicious case of mycotic keratitis. The smear was stained with Gram stain, and a 10% potassium hydroxide mount was prepared. It was imaged using a smartphone coupled with a compact pocket magnifier and integrated light-emitting diode assembly at point-of-care. Photographs of multiple sections of slides were viewed using smartphone screen and pinch-to-zoom function. The same slides were subsequently screened under a light microscope by an experienced microbiologist. The scraping from the ulcer was also inoculated on blood agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar.
   Results: Smartphone-based digital imaging revealed the presence of gram-positive organism with hyphae. Examination under a light microscope also yielded similar findings. Fusarium was cultured from the corneal scraping, confirming the diagnosis of mycotic keratitis. The patient responded to topical 5% natamycin therapy, with resolution of the ulcer after 4 weeks.
   Conclusions: Smartphones can be successfully used as novel point-of-care, cost-effective, reliable microscopic screening tools.

AB  - Background: Apart from atrial fibrillation, indications for oral anticoagulation common in our clinical practice include rheumatic heart disease and mechanical heart valve replacement. Evaluation of current patient knowledge regarding oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) is the first step in improving the quality of anticoagulation therapy and patient care. The aim of the present study was to assess the knowledge regarding OAT among patients with stroke and those at high risk of thromboembolic events in a tertiary care hospital in India. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used; 240 patients on OAT because of various indications (mechanical heart valve replacement, rheumatic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and stroke) attending the neurology and cardiology outpatient clinics and inpatient services were recruited. A structured self-developed questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge in these patients. Results: Most patients (62.9%) were ignorant about the target prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) levels with only 30% having their recent INR within the target range; 50% of the patients had a poor knowledge score, and the knowledge gap was most prominent in the domains of dietary interactions followed by drug interactions, adverse effects, and PT/INR monitoring. Knowledge score also had a significant association with gender, education, monthly income, and place of residence (P < .05). Conclusion: Patient's knowledge about OAT was suboptimal. The findings support the need for educational interventions to improve the knowledge regarding OAT and, thereby, achieve an appropriate and safe secondary prevention of stroke.

AB  - Procalcitonin (PCT) is an acute-phase reactant that has been used to diagnose and potentially track the treatment of sepsis. Procalcitonin values rise initially as the infection sets in and eventually fall with resolution. Its level has been reported to be significantly higher in potential nonsurvivors of a septic episode than among survivors. However, there is also a significant amount of evidence against this. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to pool data from all the available studies regarding PCT levels in survivors and nonsurvivors of sepsis. An extensive literature search was conducted using the key words procalcitonin, sepsis, and prognosis. The references of the relevant studies were also scanned. The data from the eligible studies were extracted and analyzed for any significant pooled mean difference between survivors and nonsurvivors both on days 1 and 3. The mean difference in the day 1 PCT values between survivors and nonsurvivors was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.02). The mean difference on day 3 was also statistically significant (P = 0.002). However, in a subgroup consisting of studies on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, day 1 difference was not found to be significant (P = 0.62). We found heterogeneity of 90% in our study population, which decreased to 62% after exclusion of studies conducted in emergency department patients. Procalcitonin levels in early stages of sepsis are significantly lower among survivors as compared with nonsurvivors of sepsis.

AB  - Background: Immune dysfunction may be a contributing factor for infections during induction chemotherapy of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML); but this has not been evaluated as yet. Procedure: From April 2010 to May 2011, 45 consecutive de novo pediatric AML patients were prospectively evaluated along with nine healthy controls. Immunoglobulins (Ig) (n = 45) were measured at diagnosis and day 15. Results: There were 25 male and 20 female patients with a median age of 9 years (range 1-18 years). Baseline Ig did not correlate with any of the infection-related parameters during induction. At day 15, Ig levels reduced from baseline (IgG p = 0.46, IgA p = 0.027, IgM p < 0.001). Day 15 IgG levels were lower in patients with persistent fever >7 days (p = 0.029) and fungal infection (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This is the first study which has evaluated derangement in Ig with infection-related parameters in pediatric AML. At day 15, immunoglobulins decrease and reduced IgG levels correlate with infection-related parameters. Use of intra-venous immunoglobulins in pediatric AML cases needs to be further evaluated to assess whether it can reduce infection-related morbidity.

AB  - In recent years, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) reemerged and numerous outbreaks were reported all over the world. After screening CHIKV-positive sera, we had already reported many dominant epitopes within the envelope E2 protein of CHIKV. In the present study, we aimed at developing a highly sensitive immunodiagnostic assay for CHIKV based on a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) approach using selective epitopes of the E2 protein. MAPs in four different E2 peptide combinations were screened with CHIKV-positive sera. The MAPs reacted with all CHIKV-positive sera and no reactivity was seen with healthy or dengue-positive sera. Our results indicate that MAP 1 seems to be an alternate antigen to full-length protein E2 for immunodiagnosis of CHIKV infections with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - AIM: Primary pineal melanoma is a rare tumor. We herein review the histogenesis, pathology, radiology and therapeutic options of this rare tumor.
   MATERIAL and METHODS: We conducted a PUBMED search using a combination of keywords such as "primary pineal melanoma", "CNS melanoma", and "pineal tumor" and identified 16 cases of primary pineal melanoma. Clinical features, pathologic characteristics and treatment details of these patients were noted from respective case reports. We also describe a case of a 45-year-old Indian woman with primary pineal melanoma treated with a combination of surgery and post-op radiation.
   RESULTS: The median age at presentation is 50 years. Median duration of symptoms is 6 weeks. Common symptoms at presentation include headache (58.8%), personality changes (41.2%), gait disturbance (35.3%) and Parinaud's syndrome (29.4%). Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been used in 29.4%, 47.1% and 23.5% of patients respectively. Median overall survival is 56 weeks. Leptomeningeal dissemination and ventricular ependymal spread were noted in 70.6% and 35.3% patients, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Combined modality treatment comprising maximal safe surgery and post-operative radiation should be preferred in patients with localized pineal melanoma without leptomeningeal dissemination. Taking a cue from other subsites of melanoma, chemotherapy can perhaps be deferred until recurrence.

AB  - Objectives/HypothesisData on the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) of the head and neck region with uniform chemotherapy protocols are minimal. We evaluated outcome and prognostic factors in these patients treated with a uniform chemotherapy protocol.
   Study DesignSingle institution observational study.
   MethodsThis is a single-institution review of patients treated between June 2003 and November 2011. Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), surgery, and/or radiotherapy as a local treatment followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.
   ResultsThirty-five cases of head and neck ESFT were treated with a uniform chemotherapy protocol. The median age was 12 years (range, 1-43 years); three (9%) had metastases. Nine patients underwent surgery, of which eight received adjuvant radiotherapy; 23 received definitive radiotherapy post-NACT. At a median follow-up of 58 months (range. 3.7-133.7 months), 5-year event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and local control rate were 55.19.2%, 68.38.3%, and 74.1 +/- 8.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that baseline white blood cell (WBC) count independently prognosticated EFS (P=.04), with patients who had WBC 11,000/mu L had superior EFS, although no difference for OS was observed.
   ConclusionsThis is one of the largest studies of head and neck ESFT treated with a uniform chemotherapy protocol with intent-to-treat analysis. Within the limitations of the small size, baseline low WBC count appeared to have a superior outcome.

AB  - Background. The impact of early valve surgery (EVS) on the outcome of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) prosthetic valve infective endocarditis (PVIE) is unresolved. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between EVS, performed within the first 60 days of hospitalization, and outcome of SA PVIE within the International Collaboration on Endocarditis-Prospective Cohort Study.
   Methods. Participants were enrolled between June 2000 and December 2006. Cox proportional hazards modeling that included surgery as a time-dependent covariate and propensity adjustment for likelihood to receive cardiac surgery was used to evaluate the impact of EVS and 1-year all-cause mortality on patients with definite left-sided S. aureus PVIE and no history of injection drug use.
   Results. EVS was performed in 74 of the 168 (44.3%) patients. One-year mortality was significantly higher among patients with S. aureus PVIE than in patients with non-S. aureus PVIE (48.2% vs 32.9%; P = .003). Staphylococcus aureus PVIE patients who underwent EVS had a significantly lower 1-year mortality rate (33.8% vs 59.1%; P = .001). In multivariate, propensity-adjusted models, EVS was not associated with 1-year mortality (risk ratio, 0.67 [95% confidence interval,.39-1.15]; P = .15).
   Conclusions. In this prospective, multinational cohort of patients with S. aureus PVIE, EVS was not associated with reduced 1-year mortality. The decision to pursue EVS should be individualized for each patient, based upon infection-specific characteristics rather than solely upon the microbiology of the infection causing PVIE.

AB  - ObjectiveDistant metastases, although rare, account for maximum disease-related mortality in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Lungs and bones are the most frequent sites of metastases. We sought to identify the prognostic factors in adult DTC patients presenting with pulmonary metastases at initial diagnosis.
   DesignRetrospective cohort study.
   PatientsFrom the medical records of 4370 patients, 200 patients aged more than 21years who were identified to have pulmonary metastases at the time of diagnosis were included in the analysis.
   ResultsThe sites of metastases were lungs alone in 133 (67%) patients, and additional sites in remaining 67 (33%) patients were as follows: bones in 59, liver in 4, brain in 2 and both bone and liver in two patients. During the mean follow-up of 61months (range, 12-312months), 76 patients achieved remission, 121 (605%) patients had biochemically and/or structurally persistent disease and three patients showed disease progression. Multivariate analysis revealed presence of macro-nodular (chest X-ray positive) pulmonary metastases and concomitant skeletal metastases as independent factors decreasing the likelihood of remission. Of the 76 patients with remission, 16 (21%) developed subsequent recurrence. Patient age >45years and follicular histopathology were independently associated with greater hazards of developing recurrence.
   ConclusionThis study suggests that the patients with macro-nodular lung metastases and/or concomitant skeletal metastases have reduced odds of achieving remission. Moreover, significant number of patients recur even after complete remission with RAI treatment, hence strict surveillance is recommended especially in patients with age >45years and/or with follicular histology of DTC.

AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to observe the effect of a structured educational program on drug adherence and self-care management in people with epilepsy in a developing country.
   Methods: A total of 180 consecutive people with epilepsy were enrolled from the epilepsy clinic of a tertiary care hospital in North India. Out of these, 90 were randomized to the epilepsy health education group and received the educational program and 90 were in the control group and received the standard of care but did not receive any structured educational program. The modified Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) and Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES) were administered to assess drug adherence and self-care, respectively, on the day of enrollment. The patients enrolled in the epilepsy health education group received 4 sessions of the structured educational program. The MMAS and ESES questionnaires were again administered to both groups after 6 months.
   Statistical methods: Continuous and categorical variables were compared between control and epilepsy health education groups using a chi-square test, with p value less than 0.05 considered significant. A comparison between pretest and posttest MMAS scores and ESES scores was done using a paired t-test.
   Results: In the epilepsy health education group, the pretest mean MMAS score was 6.58 whereas the posttest mean MMAS score was 7.53; the difference was significant (p = 0.001). The mean MMAS scores for the control group's pretest and posttest were 6.46 and 6.58, respectively, which were not significantly different (p = 0.224). On comparing the ESES scores at the beginning of the study and after 6 months, there was no significant change in both groups.
   Conclusions: The present study proves the efficacy of a structured educational program in improving drug adherence in a cohort of people with epilepsy with low educational background. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Calvarial tuberculosis is rare. It presents with single or multiple discharging sinus or a localized focal scalp swelling with overlying skin discoloration. Usually subgaleal collection is associated with evolution of sinus formation in different stages. However, extensive scalp swelling spreading across bifrontal area and overlying healthy scalp is not reported. Pathologically it causes significant destruction of calvarium including erosion of both the tables with concurrent significant epidural granulation tissue deposits as dura acts as barrier to trans-dural spread. Concurrent surgical management and antitubercular medication is the standard treatment modality. Authors report a unique presentation of calvarial tuberculosis in 17-year-female presented with complaint of large painless scalp swelling extensively spreading over both frontal area from supraorbital margin to coronal suture without discoloration, puckering of overlying scalp or sinus formation, and neuroimaging showed absence of extradural granulation tissue deposits with very subtle bony architecture changes of adjacent calvarium. The swelling completely subsided with medical therapy alone. To the best of knowledge of authors such case of calvarial tuberculosis having large scalp swelling in western literature has not been reported. Clinical presentation, imaging, management and pertinent literature are reviewed.

AB  - Background: Unintentional acid ingestion is less commonly encountered than alkali ingestion. The injury develops for hours to days after ingestion and often results in progressively increasing difficulty in airway management. However, gastric perforation is rare.
   Case: A 3-year-old boy presented to us with an orotonsillopharyngeal membrane and severe upper airway obstruction. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with a case of gastric perforation due to unintentional hydrochloric acid ingestion. He was treated with partial gastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy, and the recovery was good.
   Conclusions: Unintentional hydrochloric acid ingestion is rare in children. The manifestations masquerade many other clinical conditions, and the diagnosis is difficult in cases in which history of ingestion is not available. Treatment is symptomatic, and emergency surgery is indicated in case of gastrointestinal perforation.

AB  - Identification of cytogenetic abnormalities plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of leukemias. Isolated trisomy 6 is a rare abnormality, the prognostic significance of which is not well established. We report one case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M5 variant) with trisomy 6 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Previously, trisomy 6 has been reported in aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and AML, usually associated with hypocellular marrow. However, our patient had a very short history and hypercellular marrow infiltrated with blasts. We report this case due to the rarity of the condition. More studies are required to ascertain the role of trisomy 6 in the development of leukemia as well as in prognosis.

AB  - We report 2 bilateral cases that presented as primary ocular hypertension and primary angle-closure glaucoma, respectively; however, they were subsequently discovered to be harboring secretory pituitary tumors. After transsphenoidal tumor resection, intraocular pressures (IOPs) in all 4 eyes returned to normal levels. Sudden rise in IOP then again served as a primary manifestation of relapse in the second patient with growth hormone secreting pituitary tumor. It was not found feasible for resurgery; thus, patient needed trabeculectomy in both eyes to achieve an optimum control of intraocular tension. We conclude that pituitary adenomas may mimic primary glaucoma without producing vertical hemianopia and cause a reversible rise in IOP. Furthermore, a careful ongoing expert ophthalmologic assessment may serve as a useful clinical marker for early relapse in these tumors.

AB  - AimTo estimate rates of progression and to asssess the projected lifetime risk of blindness among treated eyes of juvenile-onset primary open glaucoma (JOAG) patients.
   MethodsRates of change of the visual field index of JOAG patients (diagnosed between the age of 10-40years), with at least 5year follow up, were used to estimate the lifetime risk of perimetric blindness. Both the eyes of patients were included in the analysis wherever possible. Average life expectancy of the population was used to calculate the lifetime risk of perimetric blindness. A regression analysis of factors contributing to faster rates of progression was performed.
   ResultsOne hundred and two eyes of 54 patients were included in the study. Mean age at the time of baseline visual field was 26.69.8years (15-40years). The average visual field index change per year was -0.9% (range -6.4 to +2.0% per year) and 18 eyes (17%) showed a progression greater than -2% per year. The cumulative risk of an eye losing 50% and 100% of its visual field index was 30% and 22% respectively over the patients' lifetime. The projected risk of bilateral blindness among JOAG patients over their lifetime was 10%. Long term IOP fluctuation was significantly associated with faster rates of progression (Odds ratio=2.74; p=0.012).
   ConclusionsThough the rate of visual field deterioration with treatment, among juvenile glaucoma patients is lower compared to that among other types of primary glaucoma, the projected lifetime risk of perimetric blindness in these eyes is similar, despite the longer duration of disease in this age group.

AB  - The benefits of long-term low-dose antibiotics in preventing urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal damage in children with primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) are unclear.
   Children aged between 1 and 12 years with VUR grade I-IV and a microbiologically proven UTI were randomized into two groups to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis [2 mg/kg trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)] daily or placebo, respectively, for 12 months. Primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic UTI. Intention-to-treat analysis using time-to-event data was performed.
   A total of 93 children (66.7 % boys) with a median age of 4.6 years were enrolled in this study; VUR grade III-IV was present in 73.1 % of these children. At least one symptomatic UTI occurred in ten (21.3 %) patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and in three (6.5 %) patients receiving placebo [hazard ratio in antibiotic group 3.9; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1- 14; log rank test P = 0.02). Compared to the group receiving placebo, the antibiotic group had a 14.8 % increased risk for developing UTI (95 % CI 1-28; P = 0.03). Of the total number of episodes of UTI, 58.3 % of those in the antibiotic group were caused by TMP-SMX-resistant bacteria compared to 20 % in the placebo group (P = 0.15). A renal scan at 12 months revealed that six of 37 (16.2 %) patients in the antibiotic group and seven of 43 (16.3 %) patients in the placebo group had new or worsening of pre-existing scar.
   Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis with TMP-SMX is associated with increased risk of symptomatic UTI compared to placebo in children with grade I-IV VUR.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Introduction: Several agents have been tried in the management of mastalgia. Centchroman (Ormeloxifene), a novel non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has also been recently used in the management of mastalgia.
   Methods: Eligible patients, who had mastalgia for more than 3 months, were randomized into two groups - Group A received centchroman 30 mg daily and Group B received tamoxifen 10 mg daily. Treatment was continued for a total of 12 weeks; thereafter, patients were followed for another 12 weeks without medication to assess the continuum of relief. Pain severity was measured with VAS score. Patients were considered to have complete pain relief if their VAS score decreased to 3 or less.
   Results: Patients, in both the groups, showed gradual improvement in mastalgia with passage of time up to 12 weeks. Following cessation of treatment at 12 weeks, partial relapse of pain was observed at 24 weeks. There was no significant difference between Group A and Group B in terms of mean VAS Score and proportion of women reporting pain relief at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Fifteen patients in Group A had side effects namely dizziness, menstrual irregularities and development of ovarian cysts. There was no side effect noted in group B.
   Conclusion: Centchroman and tamoxifen were found to be of similar effectiveness in providing pain relief in mastalgia. High frequency of side effects, particularly development of ovarian cyst, in patients receiving centchroman is a matter of concern. (C) 2015 Surgical Associates Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorderwith lifetime prevalence of similar to 1% worldwide. A genotyping studywas conducted using a custom panel of Illumina 1536 SNPs in 840 schizophrenia cases and 876 controls (351 patients and 385 controls from North India; and 436 patients, 401 controls and 143 familial samples with 53 probands containing 37 complete and 16 incomplete trios fromSouth India). Meta-analysis of this population of Indo-European and Dravidian ancestry identified three strongly associated variants with schizophrenia: STT3A (rs548181, p = 1.47 x 10(-5)), NRG1 (rs17603876, p = 8.66 x 10(-5)) and GRM7 (rs3864075, p = 4.06 x 10(-3)). Finally, a meta-analysis was conducted comparing our data with data from the Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study Consortium (PGC-SCZ) that supported rs548181 (p = 1.39 x 10(-7)). In addition, combined analysis of sporadic case-control association and a transmission disequilibrium test in familial samples from South Indian population identified three associations: rs1062613 (p = 3.12 x 10(-3)), a functional promoter variant of HTR3A; rs6710782 (p = 3.50 x 10(-3)), an intronic variant of ERBB4; and rs891903 (p = 1.05 x 10(-2)), an intronic variant of EBF1. The results support the risk variants observed in the earlier published work and suggest a potential role of neurodevelopmental genes in the schizophrenia pathogenesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assess anthropometric characteristics and estimate the prevalence of undernutrition among older persons in rural Ballabgarh, Haryana, India. A total of 948 participants aged 60 years and above were examined. Their weight, arm span, mid-upper-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, and calf circumference were measured using standard techniques. The prevalence of undernutrition was estimated to be 53.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 50.5-56.9). Logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors independently associated with undernutrition. In the assessment of anthropometric characteristics, the strongest correlation was observed between body mass index and mid-upper-arm circumference (r = 0.88; P < .0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that mid-upper-arm circumference has a higher ability (area under curve = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.91-0.96) of detecting undernutrition among older persons than triceps skinfold thickness and calf circumference. The high prevalence of undernutrition among older persons in rural India warrants major public health interventions.

KW  - CHILDHOOD
AB  - Background: Anemia is a major public health problem among children under 5 years of age in India. Cobalamin and folate deficiencies play an important role in the etiology of anemia. This study was done to assess the prevalence of cobalamin and folate deficiencies among children in the age group of 12-59 months. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 470 children were included. Non-fasting venous blood samples were collected from each child for the estimation of serum cobalamin and folate levels. Pattern of dietary consumption of the each child was assessed with the help of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) method. Results: The median levels (interquartile range) of serum cobalamin (n = 469) and folate (n = 416) were found to be 275 (202-427) pg/ml and 3.02 (2.02-4.94) ng/ml, respectively. The overall prevalence of cobalamin and folate deficiencies was found to be 180/469 [38.4%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 34.1-42.8%] and 263/416 (63.2%; 95% CI: 58.5-67.7%), respectively. Conclusions: A high prevalence of cobalamin and folate deficiencies was found in children under 5 years of age.

AB  - Purpose: Various selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are known to have effects on development and progression of seizures. In the present study, the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitor etoricoxib on seizures, oxidative stress, and learning and memory was studied.
   Method: Male Wistar rats were kindled using subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (30 mg/kg, i.p.), on alternating days until animals were fully kindled. After a one-week PTZ-free period, kindled rats were challenged with PTZ 30 mg/kg, and the latency, duration, and severity of seizures were recorded. Etoricoxib was then administered intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg in kindled rats for nine days (days 6-14). On the ninth day of etoricoxib treatment, PTZ challenge (30 mg/kg) was given, and seizure parameters were noted. On day 15, behavioral assessment was carried out. The Morris water maze (MWM) apparatus and the passive avoidance (PA) apparatus were used for studying cognitive impairment. The rats were then sacrificed, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), markers of oxidative stress, were estimated in the brain samples.
   Results: Etoricoxib at lower dose (1 mg/kg) had an anticonvulsant effect which was reduced or reversed at higher dose (10 mg/kg). Etoricoxib also impaired the learning and memory in rats as tested by passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that use of etoricoxib, especially at low dose, in patients with epilepsy may not be detrimental with regard to seizure control. However, attention should be paid to cognitive parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anti-complement factor H (anti-CFH) antibody-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is an important cause of acute kidney injury in Indian children. While management comprises plasma exchange and immunosuppression, information on the impact on serial antibody titers and outcomes is limited.
   This retrospective study included 45 patients with anti-CFH-associated HUS who were followed for a parts per thousand yen12 months. Following the initial plasma exchange sessions, patients received prednisolone and either intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (n = 31) or IV rituximab (n = 14), followed by maintenance immunosuppression.
   The median anti-CFH antibody titers fell from 3,215.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 1,977.9-8,453.9 to 414.6 (IQR 251.6-1,368.2) AU/ml with plasma exchange therapy (P < 0.0001), and the decline was similar with three, five, or seven plasma exchange sessions (P = 0.08). Serial anti-CFH titers were similar in patients receiving IV cyclophosphamide- and rituximab-based regimens during the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.63). Renal outcomes and relapse frequencies at the 15.4-month follow-up were comparable. Seven patients relapsed 6.5 (IQR 2.2-12.3) months from treatment onset. Patients with relapse had higher antibody titers during remission (P = 0.017). Titers of a parts per thousand yen1,300 AU/ml at 6 months predicted subsequent relapses.
   Our patients with anti-CFH antibody-associated HUS showed a significant fall in antibody titers following daily plasma exchange sessions. Therapy with cyclophosphamide- or rituximab-based regimens was associated with similar outcomes and a comparable decline in antibody titers.

AB  - Clubfoot describes a range of foot abnormalities usually present at birth, in which the foot of a baby is twisted out of shape or position. In order to develop an effective treatment plan for clubfoot and/or assess the extent to which existing interventions are successful, medical practitioners need to be able to accurately measure the nature and extent of the deformity. This is typically performed using a goniometer. However, this device is only able to measure one dimension at a time. As such, a complete assessment of the condition of a foot can be extremely burdensome and time-consuming. This article describes a new device that can quickly and efficiently take several measurements on feet of various sizes and shapes. The use of this device was verified by measuring the deformities of real clubfeet. A silicone rubber clubfoot model was also used in this study to clearly illustrate the effectiveness with which the proposed device can measure the various deformities of clubfoot. It is envisaged that the use of this device will significantly reduce the time and effort orthopedists require to measure clubfoot deformities and develop and assess treatment plans.

AB  - Pediatric oligodendrogliomas (pODGs) are rare central nervous system tumors, and comparatively little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. Co-deletion of 1p/19q; and IDH1, CIC, and FUBP1 mutations, which are molecular signatures of adult oligodendrogliomas, are extremely rare in pODGs. In this report, two pODGs, one each of grade II and grade III, were evaluated using clinical, radiological, histopathologic, and follow-up methods. IDH1, TP53, CIC, H3F3A, and BRAF-V600 E mutations were analyzed by Singer sequencing and immunohistochemical methods, and 1p/19q co-deletion was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. PDGFRA amplification, BRAF gain, intragenic duplication of FGFR-TKD, and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (validated by Sanger sequencing) were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Notably, both cases showed the oncogenic KIAA1549_Ex15-BRAF_Ex9 fusion transcript. Further, immunohistochemical analysis showed activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in both of these cases. However, neither 1p/19q co-deletion; IDH1, TP53, CIC, H3F3A, nor BRAF-V600 E mutation; PDGFRA amplification; BRAF gain; nor duplication of FGFR-TKD was identified. Overall, this study highlights that pODGs can harbor the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion with aberrant MAPK/ERK signaling, and there exists an option of targeting these pathways in such patients. These results indicate that pODGs with the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion may represent a subset of this rare tumor that shares molecular and genetic features of pilocytic astrocytomas. These findings will increase our understanding of pODGs and may have clinical implications.

AB  - Background: Various procedures have been used for the management of neglected and resistant clubfoot. The aim of our study was to assess the clinical and radiological correction by Joshi's external stabilization system (JESS fixator) and Simons subtalar release in resistant and neglected idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus in children between the ages of 1 and 2 years.
   Methods: A total of 50 resistant and neglected clubfeet were randomly divided into two equal groups of 25 feet each. Group I was treated with JESS fixator and group II was treated with complete subtalar release as described by Simons. Assessment of correction achieved was done both clinically and radiologically. Functional outcome was assessed with Ponseti scale.
   Results: The change in clinical deformity and radiological correction of deformity were statistically significant within each group, but not significant when compared to each other. In group I excellent results were obtained in 17 (68%) and good in 8 (32%) of the feet. In group II, excellent results were found in 16 (64%) and good in 9 (36%) feet out of the 25 feet. Pin-site infections were seen in two cases in group I and serious skin problems occurred in two feet in group II.
   Conclusion: We conclude that there were no statistical significant differences between the outcomes of the two techniques in this short-term follow-up of 2.4 years. Thus, functional distraction using JESS can be utilized as an alternative method in cases of neglected and resistant clubfoot. (C) 2014 European Foot and Ankle Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the biochemical profile of blood plasma of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and angiographically normal subjects (controls) to determine biomarkers for their differentiation. In this double blind study, 5 mL venous blood was drawn before angiography from CAD patients (n=60) and controls (n=13) comprising angiography normal individuals. In vitro high-resolution NMR spectroscopy of these blood plasma samples was carried out at 400 MHz, and intensity data were analysed with partial least square discriminant analysis. Categorization of subjects as controls or CAD patients and the patients further as single vessel disease (SVD), double vessel disease (DVD) and triple vessel disease (TVD) was done at the end of the study based on their angiography reports. Raised levels of lipids, alanine (Ala) and isoleucine/leucine/valine (Ile/Leu/Val) were observed in CAD patients compared with controls. Partial least square discriminant analysis showed separation between controls vs CAD patients. TVD patients showed increased levels of Ile/Leu/Val and Ala compared with controls and SVD. Alanine, Ile/Leu/Val, and LDL/VLDL appear as possible biomarkers for distinguishing between controls and patients with SVD and TVD. A metabolic adaptation of myocardium may play a role in raising the Ala level.

KW  - FOLLOW-UP
AB  - Patients with light-chain deposition disease (LCDD) frequently do not meet criteria for myeloma. In such cases, despite low tumor burden, the circulating monoclonal immunoglobulins cause renal damage, are responsible for post-transplant recurrence, and are rightly categorized as monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) requiring chemotherapy. A 65-year male with uncharacterized nodular glomerulopathy presented with proteinuria 3 years postrenal transplant. His allograft biopsies were diagnostic of light-chain deposition disease (likely recurrent), and in the absence of myeloma, he was labeled as MGRS. Based on the limited literature available, he was treated with bortezomib which resulted in normalization of serum-free light-chain ratios and resolution of proteinuria. He, however, later succumbed to complications of chemotherapy. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulties in LCDD, the importance of an accurate pretransplant diagnosis, and treatment of the malignant clone, in the absence of which post-transplant management of recurrence is challenging with poor outcomes.

AB  - Background: Bicondylar tibial plateau fractures are complex injuries and treatment is challenging. Ideal method is still controversial with risk of unsatisfactory results if not treated properly. Many different techniques of internal and external fixation are used. This study compares the clinical results in single locked plating versus dual plating (DP) using two incision approaches. Our hypothesis was that DP leads to less collapse and change in alignment at final followup compared with single plating.
   Materials and Methods: 61 cases of Type C tibial plateau fractures operated between January 2007 and June 2011 were included in this prospective study. All cases were operated either by single lateral locked plate by anterolateral approach or double plating through double incision. All cases were followed for a minimum of 24 months radiologically and clinically. The statistical analysis was performed using software SPSS 10.0 to analyze the data.
   Results: Twenty nine patients in a single lateral locked plate and 32 patients in a double plating group were followed for minimum 2 years. All fractures healed, however there was a significant incidence of malalignment in the single lateral plating group. Though there was a significant increase in soft tissue issues with the double plating group; however, there was only 3.12% incidence of deep infection. There was no significant difference in Hospital for special surgery score at 2 years followup.
   Conclusion: Double plating through two incisions resulted in a better limb alignment and joint reduction with an acceptable soft tissue complication rate.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the feasibility and impact of fast track discharge in patients undergoing definitive breast cancer surgery.
   MethodsOne hundred six breast cancer patients older than 20 years of age were assigned to undergo definitive breast cancer surgery. It was ensured that enrolled patients had a ready access to hospital, reasonable home circumstances. They were assessed by using post-anesthesia discharge scoring system (PADSS) for fast track discharge. Quality of life both in preoperative and postoperative period was assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast cancer version 4 (FACT-B4) questionnaires.
   ResultOverall 90 patients (84.9%) were fit for fast track discharge. Eighty-nine patients (83.96%) were successfully discharged within 48hr. One patient (0.94%) could not be discharged despite being fit as she was of concern that it would put too much responsibility on the family. Mean duration of postoperative hospital stay in patients fit for fast track surgery was 42.275.73hr with a median of 44hr. All patients undergoing breast conservation could be discharged on fast track basis with a mean postoperative hospital stay of 32.12hr.
   ConclusionFast track discharges in breast cancer patients after definitive surgery are feasible in Indian setting. J. Surg. Oncol. 2015 111:265-269. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Environmental pollution due to mercury has raised serious concern over the last few decades. Various anthropogenic sources including the health sector play a vital role in increasing the mercury load on the environment. Mercury poses an important health issue because of its indiscriminate disposal into the environment. There are numerous mercury-containing devices being used in the health-care setup. The objective of the study was to obtain information on the procurement and consumption of mercury-containing items in the current year, the methods adopted for disposal and the contamination of the hospital effluents with mercury. A questionnaire-based study was conducted in government and corporate hospitals from different states of India, for the quantitative assessment of use of mercury-based items in tertiary care hospitals in India (n=113). The results showed that mercury-containing items are still being used in India. The most common method adopted for disposal was collection in plastic bags and labeling them as hazardous waste. The hospital effluents contained mercury below the permissible limits. In view of the environmental pollution due to mercury and its adverse impact on health, efforts by the government are on for phasing out mercury-containing equipments from the health-care setup in India.

AB  - A middle aged male presented to us with an unusual problem when his acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) disappeared without any chemotherapy. We faced a dilemma whether to go ahead and treat his initial diagnosis or wait. Eventually he did relapse and was treated, albeit with a fatal outcome. Such spontaneous remission in acute leukemia are a very rare event, more common in acute myeloid leukemia and in children. Spontaneous remission in adult ALL is rarely described in literature.

AB  - Intracranial tuberculoma in infants are a rare occurrence. We report a 7-month-old male infant presenting to our tertiary care referral center with complaints of global developmental delay and right hemiparesis for 3 months. Radiologic imaging was suggestive of large left frontoinsular space-occupying lesion with initial differential of primitive neuroectodermal tumor or desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma. Considering the clinicoradiologic findings and no history suggestive of immunodeficiency or contact with tuberculosis, surgical decompression was done. Final histopathology revealed multiple epithelioid granulomas suggestive of tubercular etiology or intracranial Langerhans cell histiocytosis. He was started on antitubercular therapy after ruling out Langerhans cell histiocytosis using CD1a and Langerin immunohistochemistry staining. Interpretation of tuberculous etiology in infants can be challenging for clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose such lesions, predominantly in endemic regions.

AB  - Objectives: To study the clinical profile of leprosy patients; to assess dehabilitation in leprosy patients and to study the factors affecting dehabilitation.
   Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was carried out on 100 leprosy patients visiting the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi between February 2009 and February 2010. Demographic and clinical data were collected and subjects were administered the 52-item Anandaraj Dehabilitation scale which measures the negative impact of leprosy on family relationships, vocational condition, social interaction and self-esteem.
   Results: The mean patient age was 30.9 years, 81% were males, 51% were at the lepromatous end of the spectrum, 87% had multibacillary leprosy, 22% each had Type 1 and Type 2 reactions, 22% had Grade 1 disability and 39% had Grade 2 disability. The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 20 months. On the Anandaraj scale, 23% had high levels of dehabilitation; on an average, scores were in the range of medium level dehabilitation. Nearly 80% of patients avoided meeting friends, one-third hid the diagnosis from their families and worried about losing their jobs due to the disease, while around a quarter avoided sexual relations, used separate utensils and avoided touching children. Over 40% of unmarried patients faced matrimonial difficulty due to leprosy. Anxiety and guilt were common and incidence of suicidal ideas was much higher than the lifetime incidence in general population. Lack of education, Type 2 reactions, Grade 2 disability and lower age were predictors of greater dehabilitation.
   Conclusions: Dehabilitation of leprosy patients continues in this post-elimination era of rehabilitation. A large segment of preventable disability and resultant dehabilitation is likely being missed. There is an urgent need for corrective and preventive measures.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the stress patterns in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during mandibular protraction at different horizontal advancements with constant vertical height in a construction bite using a three-dimensional finite element method.
   Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional computer-aided model was developed from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a growing boy (age 12 years) using MIMICS software (version 7.0, Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). Stresses with constant vertical opening of 5 mm changing the sagittal advancements from 0 mm to 5 mm and 7.5 mm were recorded. Differences in magnitude and pattern of stresses were compared.
   Results: The tensile stresses in the posterosuperior aspect of the condylar head and on the posterior aspect of the glenoid fossa migrated posteriorly with increased bite advancements. The location of tensile stresses changed in the condylar head and fossa on mandibular protraction of 5 mm to 7 mm.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that larger horizontal advancements of construction bites may not be favorable for tissues of TMJ. Clinical application necessitates study on an animal model.

AB  - The clpC operon is known to regulate several processes such as genetic competence, protein degradation and stress survival in bacteria. Here, we describe the role of clpC operon in Bacillus anthracis. We generated knockout strains of the clpC operon genes to investigate the impact of CtsR, McsA, McsB and ClpC deletion on essential processes of B.anthracis. We observed that growth, cell division, sporulation and germination were severely affected in mcsB and clpC deleted strains, while none of deletions affected toxin secretion. Growth defect in these strains was pronounced at elevated temperature. The growth pattern gets restored on complementation of mcsB and clpC in respective mutants. Electron microscopic examination revealed that mcsB and clpC deletion also causes defect in septum formation leading to cell elongation. These vegetative cell deformities were accompanied by inability of mutant strains to generate morphologically intact spores. Higher levels of polyhydroxybutyrate granules accumulation were also observed in these deletion strains, indicating a defect in sporulation process. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the vital role played by McsB and ClpC in physiology of B.anthracis and open up further interest on this operon, which might be of importance to success of B.anthracis as pathogen.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive disease with rapid invasion and early encasement of blood vessels. Hence, levels of circulating nucleic acids and tumor-associated mutations in them may have clinical importance. We analyzed the levels of circulating tumor DNA and oncogenic k-ras mutation in plasma of patients with pancreatic cancer and correlated their levels with survival and clinicopathological parameters. Higher levels of plasma DNA (> 62 ng/mL) was found to associate significantly with lower overall survival time (p = .002), presence of vascular encasement (p = .030) and metastasis (p = .001). However, k-ras mutation status did not correlate with any of the clinicopathological parameters or survival. We conclude that circulating DNA in plasma can be an important predictor of prognosis in pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Goals: We reviewed our celiac disease (CeD) database to study if anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody (ab) titers correlate with severity of villous abnormalities in Indian patients and to find out a cutoff value of anti-tTG ab fold-rise, which could best predict CeD.
   Background: Guidelines for diagnosing CeD suggest that biopsy could be avoided in some patients with high anti-tTG ab titer. Study: We reviewed a cohort of 366 anti-tTG ab positive individuals in whom duodenal biopsies were performed. Anti-tTG ab was obtained before initiation of gluten-free diet. Anti-tTG ab results were expressed in terms of fold-rise by calculating ratio of observed values with cutoff value. CeD was diagnosed if in addition to positive serology, patients had villous atrophy (>Marsh grade 2) and unequivocal response to gluten-free diet.
   Results: The mean anti-tTG fold-rise in groups with Marsh grade <= 2 was 2.6 (+/- 2.5), grade 3a was 4.0 (+/- 3.9), 3b was 5.7 (+/- 5.1), and 3c was 11.8 (+/- 8.0). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosing CeD was 15.4 and 27.4 at 12- and 14-fold-rise of anti-tTG ab titer, respectively. The positive predictive value of diagnosis of CeD was 100% when anti-tTG ab titer was 14-fold higher over the cutoff value. Fifty-seven (43.9%) individuals with anti-tTG titer rise < 2-fold high also had CeD.
   Conclusions: As severity of villous abnormality increases, titer of anti-tTG also rises. Presence of villous atrophy can be predicted at very high anti-tTG ab titer. In contrast to emerging belief, mucosal biopsies should be performed even if anti-tTG ab titer is <2 times, because many patients with CeD have low titers.

AB  - The mammalian haem peroxidase superfamily consists of myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). These enzymes catalyze a number of oxidative reactions of inorganic substrates such as Cl-, Br-, I- and SCN- as well as of various organic aromatic compounds. To date, only structures of MPO and LPO are known. The substrate-binding sites in these enzymes are located on the distal haem side. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is a potent antithyroid drug that acts by inhibiting the function of TPO. It has also been shown to inhibit the action of LPO. However, its mode of binding to mammalian haem peroxidases is not yet known. In order to determine the mode of its binding to peroxidases, the structure of the complex of LPO with PTU has been determined. It showed that PTU binds to LPO in the substrate-binding site on the distal haem side. The IC50 values for the inhibition of LPO and TPO by PTU are 47 and 30 mu M, respectively. A comparision of the residues surrounding the substrate-binding site on the distal haem side in LPO with those in TPO showed that all of the residues were identical except for Ala114 (LPO numbering scheme), which is replaced by Thr205 (TPO numbering scheme) in TPO. A threonine residue in place of alanine in the substrate-binding site may affect the affinity of PTU for peroxidases.

AB  - Object: To evaluate the outcome of patients undergoing a decompressive craniectomy (DC) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the factors predicting outcome.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 1,236 patients with TBI operated with a DC from January 2008 to December 2013 at a tertiary care hospital were included in the study. The data from the hospital computerized database was retrospectively analyzed and 324 (45%) patients were followed-up for a mean duration of 25.3 months (range 3-42 months) among the cohort of 720 alive patients. The institute's ethical committee clearance was obtained before the start of the study.
   Results: There were 81% males with a median age [interquartile range (IQR)] of 32 (23-45) years. The mortality rate and median (IQR) Glasgow outcome score (GOS) at discharge in patients presenting with minor, moderate, and severe head injury were 18%, 5 (4-5); 28%, 4 (1-5); and 47.4%, 2 (1-4), respectively. An overall favorable outcome (GOS 4 and 5) at discharge was observed in 46.5% patients and in 39% patients who presented with severe TBI. Only 7.5% patients were in a persistent vegetative state (PVS), while 78% had an overall favorable outcome at the last follow-up of surviving patients (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the factors predictive of a favorable GOS at discharge were: a younger age (odds ratio (OR) 1.03, confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.04; P < 0.001), no pupillary abnormalities at admission (OR 2.28, CI = 1.72-3.02; P < 0.001), absence of preoperative hypotension (OR 1.91, CI = 1.08-3.38; P = 0.02), an isolated TBI (OR 1.42, CI = 1.08-1.86; P=0.01), absence of a preoperative infarct (OR 3.68, CI = 1.74-7.81; P=0.001), presence of a minor head injury (OR 6.33, CI = 4.07-9.86; P <0.001), performing a duraplasty (OR 1.86, CI = 1.20-2.87; P = 0.005) rather than a slit durotomy (OR 3.95, CI = 1.67-9.35; P = 0.002), and, avoidance of a contralateral DC (OR 3.58, CI = 1.90-6.73; P < 0.001)
   Conclusions: The severity of head injury, performing a duraplasty rather than a slit durotomy, avoidance of a contralateral DC, and the presence of preoperative hypotension, infarct, and/or pupillary asymmetry have the highest odds of predicting the short term GOS at the time of discharge, after a DC in patients with TBI. Although DC carries a high risk of mortality, the probability of the survivors having a favorable outcome is significantly more as compared to those who remain in a PVS.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of illuminated microcatheter-assisted circumferential trabeculotomy vs combined mitomycin C-augmented trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy for primary congenital glaucoma.
   DESIGN: Prospective, randomized trial.
   METHODS: Of the 30 patients (60 eyes) analyzed with bilateral primary congenital glaucoma aged <= 2 years, 1 eye of, each patient was randomized to: illuminated microcatheter assisted trabeculotomy (Group I) or combined trabeculotomy with trabeculectomy augmented with mitomycin C (Group II). Primary outcome measure was intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Categorization into absolute success (IOP <= 15 mm Hg without medication) and qualified success (IOP <= 15 mm Hg with medication). was done. Secondary outcomes included change in corneal diameter and clarity, optic disc status, refraction, need for anti-glaucoma therapy, and occurrence of complications.
   RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 6.63 +/- 5.74 months. IOP fell by 49.3% (22.25 +/- 10.88 to 11.56 +/- 3.33 mm Hg) in Group I and 46.6% in Group II (21.73 +/- 8.89 to 11.60 +/- 3.03 mm Hg) (P < .001 in both). At 1 year, absolute success was achieved in 86.7% (26/30) and 90.0% (27/30 in Groups I and II, respectively (P > .99) and qualified success in 93.3% (28/30) in both groups (P = 1). There was significant improvement in corneal clarity (P < .001) and cup-to-disc ratio (P <= .01) in both groups at 1 year. Though incidence of hyphema was significantly more in Group I (P = .0001), no vision-threatening complications occurred in either group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Illuminated microcatheter assisted circumferential trabeculotomy achieved comparable surgical outcomes to mitomycin C augmented combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy and may be recommended as the initial surgical procedure for primary congenital glaucoma.

AB  - Crescent fractures of the pelvis are usually described as posterior sacro iliac fracture dislocations. Rarely anterior displacement of the fractured iliac fragment along with dislocation has been reported in crescent fractures. Four cases of anterior fracture dislocation of the sacro iliac joint managed in the last two years by a single surgeon are presented. The injury mechanism, radiological diagnosis, management protocol along with functional outcomes of all the four patients have been discussed. CT scan is essential in the diagnosis and preoperative planning of this injury pattern. Early fixation along with proper reduction leads to excellent functional outcome in this subset of lateral compression injuries of the pelvis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drilling of the anterior clinoid process (ACP) is an integral component of surgical approaches for central and paracentral skull base lesions. The technique to drill ACP has evolved from pure intradural to extradural and combined techniques.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the computerized morphometric evaluation of exposure of optic nerve and internal carotid artery with proposed tailored intradural (IDAC) and complete extradural (EDAC) anterior clinoidectomy.
   METHODS: We describe a morphometric subdivision of ACP into 4 quadrangles and 1 triangle on the basis of fixed bony landmarks. Computerized volumetric analysis with 3-dimensional laser scanning of dry-drilled bones for respective tailored IDAC and EDAC was performed. Both approaches were compared for the area and length of the optic nerve and internal carotid artery. Five cadaver heads were dissected on alternate sides with intradural and extradural techniques to evaluate exposure, surgical freedom, and angulation of approach.
   RESULTS: Complete anterior clinoidectomy provides a 2.5-times larger area and 2.7-times larger volume of ACP. Complete clinoidectomy deroofed the optic nerve to an equal extent as by proposed the partial tailored clinoidectomy approach. Tailored IDAC exposes only the distal dural ring, whereas complete EDAC exposes both the proximal and distal dural rings with complete exposure of the carotid cave.
   CONCLUSION: Quantitative comparative evaluation provides details of exposure and surgical ease with both techniques. We promote hybrid/EDAC technique for vascular pathologies because of better anatomic orientation. Extradural clinoidectomy is the preferred technique for midline cranial neoplasia. An awareness of different variations of clinoidectomy can prevent dependency on any particular approach and facilitate flexibility.

AB  - BackgroundTo report the treatment outcomes of mycotic keratitis with collagen cross-linking.
   DesignRetrospective study.
   ParticipantsPatients with smear-positive moderate mycotic keratitis.
   MethodsA retrospective case-file analysis was performed to identify cases of moderate mycotic keratitis treated with and without additional collagen cross-linking, in addition to intensive topical antifungal therapy. Patients in which collagen cross-linking was performed on the day of presentation (group 1) were compared with patients who received medical treatment alone in the form of 5% natamycin eye drops (group 2).
   Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome measure was the time taken for resolution of infection.
   ResultsOverall, 41 cases were included for analysis (group 1, 20 cases; group 2, 21 cases). Mean age of the patients was comparable in both groups (46.517.01 vs. 41.2 +/- 20.7 years; P=0.36). Average infiltrate size was 16.35 +/- 6.8mm(2) in group 1 and 17.09 +/- 7.4mm(2) in group 2 (P=0.83). Overall, Aspergillus was the most commonly isolated organism (n=4 group 1; n=6 group 2). Resolution of infection was observed in 18 cases (90%) in group 1 and 18 (85.71%) cases in group 2. The average healing time was 30.85 +/- 26.6 days in group 1, while it was 31.28 +/- 19.97 days in group 2 (P=0.94). Final best-corrected visual acuity in group 1 was 1.13 +/- 0.55 and 1.25 +/- 0.46 in group 2 (P=0.46). A tectonic keratoplasty was performed in two cases in group 1 and three cases in group 2 (P=1.00).
   ConclusionsIn our study, additional collagen cross-linking treatment did not have any advantage over medical management in cases with moderate mycotic keratitis.

AB  - Pancreatic necrosis is an important determinant of patient outcome in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). This prospective study was conducted to evaluate if perfusion CT (PCT) can predict the development of necrosis at an early stage in SAP.
   PCT was performed within 72 h of abdominal pain in 57 consecutive admitted patients of acute pancreatitis, out of which four patients were excluded. Thirty-two patients were classified as SAP and 21 as mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) on the basis of APACHE II or SIRS criteria or presence of organ failure. All patients underwent a follow-up CECT at 3 weeks to look for pancreatic necrosis.
   Out of 32 patients of SAP, 14 patients showed perfusion defects. The mean blood flow (BF) in these areas was 11.47 +/- A 5.56 mL/100 mL/min and median blood volume (BV) was 3.92 mL/100 mL (0.5-8.49 mL/100 mL). All these patients developed necrosis on follow-up scan. Two patients who did not show perfusion defects also developed necrosis. Remaining 37 patients (16 SAP and 21 MAP) did not show perfusion defect and did not develop necrosis on follow-up. All regions showing BF less than a parts per thousand currency sign23.45 mL/100 mL/min and BV a parts per thousand currency sign8.49 mL/100 mL developed pancreatic necrosis. The values of perfusion parameters may vary with the scanner, mathematical model and protocol used. The sensitivity and specificity of PCT for predicting pancreatic necrosis were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. The cut off values of BF and BV for predicting the development of pancreatic necrosis were 27.29 mL/100 mL/min and 8.96 mL/100 mL, respectively, based on ROC curve.
   PCT is a reliable tool for early prediction of pancreatic necrosis, which may open new avenues to prevent this ominous complication.

AB  - SAP-1 is a low molecular weight cysteine protease inhibitor (CPI) which belongs to type-2 cystatins family. SAP-1 protein purified from human seminal plasma (HuSP) has been shown to inhibit cysteine and serine proteases and exhibit interesting biological properties, including high temperature and pH stability. Heparin is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (with varied chain length) which interacts with a number of proteins and regulates multiple steps in different biological processes. As an anticoagulant, heparin enhances inhibition of thrombin by the serpin antithrombin III. Therefore, we have employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to improve our understanding of the binding interaction between heparin and SAP-1 (protease inhibitor). SPR data suggest that SAP-1 binds to heparin with a significant affinity (K-D=158nm). SPR solution competition studies using heparin oligosaccharides showed that the binding of SAP-1 to heparin is dependent on chain length. Large oligosaccharides show strong binding affinity for SAP-1. Further to get insight into the structural aspect of interactions between SAP-1 and heparin, we used modelled structure of the SAP-1 and docked with heparin and heparin-derived polysaccharides. The results suggest that a positively charged residue lysine plays important role in these interactions. Such information should improve our understanding of how heparin, present in the reproductive tract, regulates cystatins activity.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women world-wide. Incidence rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are lower than in high income countries; however, the rates are increasing very rapidly in LMICs due to social changes that increase the risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer mortality rates in LMICs remain high due to late presentation and inadequate access to optimal care. Breast Surgery International brought together a group of breast surgeons from different parts of the world to address strategies for improving outcomes in breast cancer for LMICs at a symposium during International Surgical Week in Helsinki, Finland in August 2013. A key strategy for early detection is public health education and breast awareness. Sociocultural barriers to early detection and treatment need to be addressed. Optimal management of breast cancer requires a multidisciplinary team. Surgical treatment is often the only modality of treatment available in low-resource settings where modified radical mastectomy is the most common operation performed. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy require more resources. Endocrine therapy is available but requires accurate assessment of estrogen receptors status. Targeted therapy with trastuzumab is generally unavailable due to cost. The Breast Health Global Initiative guidelines for the early detection and appropriate treatment of breast cancer in LMICs have been specifically designed to improve breast cancer outcomes in these regions. Closing the cancer divide between rich and poor countries is a moral imperative and there is an urgent need to prevent breast cancer deaths with early detection and optimal access to treatment.

AB  - Purpose
   Assess prevalence of myopia and identify associated risk factors in urban school children.
   Methods
   This was a cross-sectional study screening children for sub-normal vision and refractive errors in Delhi. Vision was tested by trained health workers using ETDRS charts. Risk factor questionnaire was filled for children with vision < 6/9.5, wearing spectacles and for a subset (10%) of randomly selected children with normal vision. All children with vision < 6/9.5 underwent cycloplegic refraction. The prevalence of myopia <-0.5 diopters was assessed. Association of risk factors and prevalence of myopia was analyzed for children with myopia and randomly selected non myopic children and adjusted odds ratio values for all risk factors were estimated.
   Results
   A total number of 9884 children were screened with mean age of 11.6 + 2.2 years and 66.8% boys. Prevalence of myopia was 13.1% with only 320 children (24.7%) wearing appropriate spectacles. Mean myopic spherical error was -1.86 + 1.4 diopters. Prevalence of myopia was higher in private schools compared to government schools (p< 0.001), in girls vs. boys (p = 0.004) and among older (> 11 years) children (p< 0.001). There was a positive association of myopia with studying in private schools vs. government schools (p< 0.001), positive family history (p< 0.001) and higher socio-economic status (p = 0.037). Positive association of presence of myopia was observed with children studying/reading > 5 hours per day (p < 0.001), watching television > 2 hours/day (p < 0.001) and with playing computer/video/mobile games (p < 0.001). An inverse association with outdoor activities/playing was observed with children playing > 2 hours in a day.
   Conclusion
   Myopia is a major health problem in Indian school children. It is important to identify modifiable risk factors associated with its development and try to develop cost effective intervention strategies.

AB  - Objective To study the impact of national economic and human development status on patient profiles and outcomes in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
   Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes trial (TRILOGY ACS) population (51 countries; 9301 patients). Outcome measures compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes through 30 months by 2010 country-level United Nations Human Development Indices (HDIs) and per-capita gross national income.
   Results TRILOGY ACS enrolled 3659 patients from 27 very-high HDI countries, 3744 from 18 high-HDI countries and 1898 from 6 medium-HDI countries. Baseline characteristics of groups varied significantly, with the medium-HDI group having a lower mean age (63.0 years, vs 65.0 and 68.0 years for high-HDI and very-high HDI, respectively; p<0.001), lower baseline Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score and lower rate of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (58.0%, vs 62.2% and 83.9% among high-HDI and very-high HDI, respectively). Medium-HDI and high-HDI patients had lower unadjusted 30-month rates for the composite of cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction/stroke (17.6%, 16.9% and 23.1% for medium-HDI, high-HDI and very-high HDI, respectively); this difference disappeared after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Adjusted HRs for the composite endpoint were lower in lower-income/middle-income countries vs upper-income/middle-income (0.791 (95% CI 0.632 to 0.990)) and high-income countries (0.756 (95% CI 0.616 to 0.928)), with differences largely attributable to myocardial infarction rates.
   Conclusions Clinical patient profiles differed substantially by country HDI groupings. Lower unadjusted event rates in medium-HDI countries may be explained by younger age and lower comorbidity burden among these countries' patients. This heterogeneity in patient recruitment across country HDI groupings may have important implications for future global ACS trial design.

AB  - Cripto-1 (CR-1) is involved in various processes in embryonic development and cancer. Multiple pathways regulate CR-1 expression. Our present work demonstrates a possible positive feedback circuit where CR-1 induces its own expression. Using U-87 MG cells treated with exogenous CR-1, we show that such induction involves ALK4/SMAD2/3 pathway. Stochasticity in gene expression gives rise to heterogeneity in expression in genetically identical cells. Positive feedback increases such heterogeneity and often gives rise to two subpopulations of cells, having higher and lower expression of a gene. Using flow cytometry, we show that U-87 MG cells have a minuscule subpopulation with detectable expression of CR-1. Induction of CR-1 expression, by exogenous CR-1, increases the size of this CR-1 positive subpopulation. However, even at very high dose, most of the cells remain CR-1 negative. We show that population behavior of CR-1 induction has a signature similar to bimodal expression expected in a transcriptional circuit with positive feedback. We further show that treatment of U-87 MG cells with CR-1 leads to higher expression of drug efflux protein MDR-1 in the CR-1 positive subpopulation, indicating correlated induction of these two proteins. Positive feedback driven heterogeneity in expression of CR-1 may play crucial role in phenotypic diversification of cancer cells.

AB  - Nephrotoxicity is a major adverse effect of the widely used anticancer drug cisplatin. Oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis are implicated in the pathophysiology of cisplatin-induced acute renal injury. Moreover, cisplatin activates many signal transduction pathways involved in cell injury and death, particularly mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. With this background, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of telmisartan, a widely used antihypertensive drug, in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity model in rats. To accomplish this, male albino wistar rats (150-200 g) were divided into 6 groups: Normal, cisplatin-control, telmisartan (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) and telmisartan per se treatment groups. Normal saline or telmisartan was administered orally to rats for 10 days and cisplatin was given on 7th day (8 mg/kg; i.p.) to induce nephrotoxicity. On 10th day, rats were killed and both the kidneys were harvested for biochemical, histopathological and molecular studies. Cisplatin injected rats showed depressed renal function, altered proxidant-antioxidant balance and acute tubular necrosis which was significantly normalized by telmisartan co-treatment. Furthermore, cisplatin administration activated MAPK pathway that caused tubular inflammation and apoptosis in rats. Telmisartan treatment significantly prevented MAPK mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Among the three doses studied telmisartan at 10 mg/kg dose showed maximum nephroprotective effect which could be due to maintenance of cellular redox status and inhibition of MAPK activation.

AB  - Objective: To measure exhaled breath temperature in patients with cystic fibrosis. Methods: 17 patients (6-18 years) with cystic fibrosis and 15 age- and gender-Matched healthy controls were recruited in this cross sectional study. Exhaled breath temperature was measured in subjects recruited in both the groups with a device X-halo and analyzed as plateau temperature achieved and rate of temperature rise. Results: Patients with cystic fibrosis showed no significant difference in plateau temperature [34.4(32.3-34.6) versus 33.9 (33.0-34.4)degrees C; P=0.35] while mean (SEM.) rate of temperature rise was significantly less in patients [0.09 (0.01) versus 0.14 (0.02) Delta degrees C/s; P=0.04] as compared to controls. Conclusion: There was a slower rise of exhaled breath temperature in patients with cystic fibrosis whereas plateau temperature was not significantly different from controls.

AB  - The success of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is challenged by the emergence of resistance-associated mutations in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). In this study, resistance associated mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) genes in antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive and treated HIV-1 infected pediatric patients from North India were evaluated. Genotyping was successfully performed in 46 patients (30 ART naive and 16 treated) for the RT gene and in 53 patients (27 ART naive and 26 treated) for PR gene and mutations were identified using Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. A major drug resistant mutation in RT gene, L74I (NRTI), and two such mutations, K101E and G190A (NNRTI), were observed in two ART naive patients, while M184V was detected in two ART treated patients. Overall, major resistance associated mutations in RT gene were observed in nine (30%) and seven (36%) of ART naive and treated children respectively. Minor mutations were identified in PR gene in five children. Few non-clade C viral strains (approximate to 30%) were detected, although subtype C was most predominant. The screening of ART naive children for mutations in HIV-1 RT and protease genes, before and after initiation of ART is desirable for drug efficacy and good prognosis.

AB  - Purpose: A systematic epidemiological study on intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired candidemia across India. Method: A prospective, nationwide, multicentric, observational study was conducted at 27 Indian ICUs. Consecutive patients who acquired candidemia after ICU admission were enrolled during April 2011 through September 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables of these patients were recorded. The present study is an analysis of data specific for adult patients. Results: Among 1,400 ICU-acquired candidemia cases (overall incidence of 6.51 cases/1,000 ICU admission), 65.2 % were adult. Though the study confirmed the already known risk factors for candidemia, the acquisition occurred early after admission to ICU (median 8 days; interquartile range 4-15 days), even infecting patients with lower APACHE II score at admission (median 17.0; mean +/- SD 17.2 +/- 5.9; interquartile range 14-20). The important finding of the study was the vast spectrum of agents (31 Candida species) causing candidemia and a high rate of isolation of Candida tropicalis (41.6 %). Azole and multidrug resistance were seen in 11.8 and 1.9 % of isolates. Public sector hospitals reported a significantly higher presence of the relatively resistant C. auris (8.2 vs. 3.9 %; p = 0.008) and C. rugosa (5.6 vs. 1.5 %; p = 0.001). The 30-day crude and attributable mortality rates of candidemia patients were 44.7 and 19.6 %, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant independent predictors of mortality including admission to public sector hospital, APACHE II score at admission, underlying renal failure, central venous catheterization and steroid therapy. Conclusion: The study highlighted a high burden of candidemia in Indian ICUs, early onset after ICU admission, higher risk despite less severe physiology score at admission and a vast spectrum of agents causing the disease with predominance of C. tropicalis.

AB  - Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[Ga-68(HBED-CC)], abbreviated as Ga-68-PSMA, is a novel radiotracer undergoing evaluation for PET/CT imaging of prostate carcinoma. Its major advantage is the sensitive detection of lesions even at low prostate-specific antigen level and high target-to-background ratios obtained in metastatic lesions, which is better than that obtained with F-18-fluoromethylcholine. We present the case of a 28-year-old man with poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation, whose lesions did not show significant Ga-68-PSMA localization. As literature on utility of Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT for imaging prostate carcinoma grows, it is important to be aware of potential false negatives that could influence study results.

AB  - Syphilis affects nearly 1.36 million pregnant women, majority of these cases being concentrated in the developing countries. We aimed at analysing the 11 years' trends in syphilis seroprevalence in antenatal clinics (ANC) and STD clinic cases. Laboratory data of syphilis cases from 2002-2012 were retrospectively analysed. Out of the total 73642 cases, 393 (0.53%) tested positive for Syphilis. A statistically significant decline in syphilis prevalence was found in both ANC and STD clinic cases. The efforts of various interventional programs should continue to make the screening and treatment facilities readily accessible to continue the decline in syphilis seropositivity.

AB  - Purpose: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the commonest pathogen causing congenital infection globally. The diagnosis of congenital infection is based either on viral isolation (in cell culture) or demonstration of HCMV DNA from the urine. Saliva is also being used as an alternative sample to urine for the same. The objective of this study was to compare the following assays-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from urine, saliva and blood, serology (anti-HCMV IgM) and antigen detection (HCMV pp65 antigenaemia) for the diagnosis of congenital HCMV infection. Materials and Methods: Urine and blood samples were collected from 31 infants (median age: 13 weeks) with suspected HCMV infection. For 18 infants, additional saliva samples were collected and all the above assays were compared. Results: PCR for HCMV DNA from urine and anti-HCMV IgM were performed for all 31 infants. Of these, 22 (70.9%) were positive for both assays. In 18 (of the 22) infants positive by both assays, PCR for HCMV DNA from saliva was positive in all 18 (100%), PCR from blood in 7/18 (38.8%) and HCMV pp65 antigenaemia only in 1/18 (5.5%) of the infants. Conclusion: Detection of HCMV DNA in urine combined with anti-HCMV IgM are suitable assays to diagnose HCMV infection in infants. Both PCR from the blood and HCMV pp65 antigenaemia lack sensitivity in infants. Salivary PCR combines convenience with high sensitivity and can substitute PCR from urine, especially in the outpatient and field settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study from India to evaluate salivary PCR for the diagnosis of congenital HCMV infection.

AB  - Cochlear implant is a commonly performed surgery for hearing loss in pre-school and school children. However, data on anesthesia management and anesthesia-related complications are sparse. We retrospectively reviewed the data of our institute from January, 2007 to December, 2012. Medical records and anesthesia charts of all the patients who had undergone cochlear implant under general anesthesia between this period were reviewed. Information related to the demographic profile, preoperative evaluation, anesthetic techniques, and perioperative complications were collected and analyzed. A total of 190 patients underwent cochlear implant surgery for pre-lingual (175) and post-lingual (15) deafness. General endotracheal anesthesia with inhalational agents was used in all the cases. Difficult intubation was encountered in three patients. Anesthesia-related complications were laryngospasm at extubation (4.73 %), emergence agitation (2.63 %), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (1.05 %). Major surgical complications were CSF leak without meningitis (3.15 %), device migration/failure (1.05 %), and flap infection (1.57 %). Cochlear implant under general anesthesia in small children is safe and anesthesia-related complications were minimal. Surgical complications, although more frequent, were predominantly minor and self-limiting.

AB  - Background: Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a dreaded adverse event of acute pancreatitis (AP). Most patients with IPN require drainage and necrosectomy, preferably by a minimally invasive method.
   Objective: To study the success and safety of an alternative form of minimally invasive necrosectomy for IPN.
   Design: Observational study.
   Setting: Tertiary care academic center.
   Patients: Consecutive patients with IPN formed the study group.
   Intervention: Patients with IPN were initially treated conservatively including percutaneous drainage. Those who failed to improve underwent percutaneous endoscopic necrosectomy (PEN). Single-or multiport PEN was performed by using a flexible endoscope through the percutaneous tract. PEN involved vigorous lavage and suction followed by necrosectomy. Multiple sessions were undertaken depending on the size and number of collections and the amount of necrotic debris.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Control of sepsis and resolution of collection(s) without the need for surgical necrosectomy.
   Results: During the period from October 2012 to July 2013, 165 patients (mean age, 38.82 +/- 14.99 years; 119 male patients) were studied. Of them, 103 patients had necrotizing pancreatitis and IPN had developed in 74. Of these 74 patients with IPN, 15 underwent PEN after a mean interval of 39.2 days. Fourteen of the 15 patients improved after a mean of 5 sessions of PEN. Two of 15 patients had minor adverse events: self-limiting bleeding and pancreatic fistula in 1 patient each. One patient required surgery but died of organ failure.
   Limitations: Lack of a control arm.
   Conclusion: PEN is a safe and effective minimally invasive technique for necrosectomy for IPN.

AB  - Purpose: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in serum is frequently used in clinical settings however saliva could be an alternative to measure free concentration of drugs. In the present study, we observed the possible correlation of VPA concentration between serum and saliva in persons with epilepsy (PWE).
   Methods: A total of 59 paired serum and saliva samples were assayed from 65 consecutive PWE (51 males and 14 females; age range 9-65 years). Patients were subjected to either VPA monotherapy or its combination with other AEDs for at least three months. Steady state trough concentration of unbound VPA drug was quantified using HPLC. The correlation between serum and saliva free VPA concentration was evaluated.
   Results: Out of 65 patients, 27 were on monotherapy of VPA and 38 were on VPA with other antiepileptic drugs. Saliva VPA concentration significantly correlated with serum free VPA concentration (p < 0.05). Poor correlation was observed between serum and saliva VPA concentration with the daily dose (p > 0.05) respectively.
   Conclusions: Our study reveals that serum and saliva VPA concentrations are significantly associated in PWE. These associations may facilitate monitoring and evaluation of VPA levels non-invasively for PWE. (C) 2014 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background & objectives : Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is a rare form of neurodegenerative disorder with the clinical manifestation of cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration. In this study we describe the clinico-genetic characteristics of nine SCA7 families of Indian origin and cross compare these with other available worldwide studies.
   Methods: Thirty five individuals from nine SCA7 families were clinico-genetically characterized and CAG repeat distribution analysis was carried out in 382 control DNA samples from healthy controls (derived from 21 diverse Indian populations based on ethnic and linguistic and geographical location).
   Results: Of the nine families studied, 22 affected individuals and one asymptomatic carrier were identified. The average age at disease onset was 23.412.6 yr. The length of expanded CAG ranged from 40-94 with mean value of 53.213.9. The main clinical findings in affecteds individuals included cerebellar ataxia, and retinal degeneration along with hyper-reflexia (95%), slow saccades (85%) and spasticity (45%). Analysis of the association of number of CAG repeats with disease onset revealed that < 49 repeats were associated with earlier age at onset in South East Asians compared to European populations. Further analysis of CAG repeats from 21 diverse Indian populations showed pre-mutable repeats (28-34) alleles in the IE-N-LP2 population. Six of the nine families identified in this study belonged to the same ethnic population.
   Interpretations conclusion : Our results show that presenece of SCA7 is relatively rare and confined to one ethnic group from Haryana region of India. We observed a homogeneous phenotypic expression of SCA7 mutation as described earlier and an earlier age of onset in our patients with CAG < 49. The identification of pre-mutable allele in IE-N-LP2 suggests this population to be at the risk of SCA7.

AB  - Background. Arachnoid cysts account for 1% of intracranial mass lesions. Quadrigeminal cistern arachnoid cysts are even rarer lesions. We report 18 cases of quadrigeminal cistern arachnoid cysts treated at our institute from 2002 to 2012. Methods. We retrospectively analysed 18 patients with quadrigeminal cistern arachnoid cyst for clinical presentation, demographic profile, management and outcome. The age of the patients ranged from 29 days to 50 years (mean 17 years). The cysts were classified into 3 subtypes based on MRI findings. Surgical intervention was carried out in all the patients. Results. Two patients had Type 1 cysts, 4 had Type 2 cysts and 12 had Type 3 cysts. Two patients (Type 1) underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy (alone). Craniotomy and cyst wall excision along with ventriculocystostomy and cystocisternostomy were done in 4 patients with Type 2 cysts, and endoscopic fenestration of cysts to the subarachnoid space or the ventricles and endoscopic third ventriculostomy were done in 7 patients with Type 3 cysts. Two patients with Type 3 cysts underwent only endoscopic ventriculocystostomy and cystocisternostomy without endoscopic third ventriculostomy, while three patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 48 months (mean 23.7 +/- 12.3 months). Conclusion. Quadrigeminal plate arachnoid cysts are generally symptomatic and require some form of surgical intervention. We believe that endoscopic fenestration of the cyst with cystocisternostomy or cystoventriculostomy, when combined with third ventriculostomy, is the procedure of choice for such patients. We do not recommend the placement of a ventriculoperitnoeal shunt alone. Operative re-exploration should be planned only after obtaining proper clinico-radiological correlation and not on the basis of imaging findings alone, as sometimes the cysts fail to regress but the symptoms improve.

AB  - Among biliary tract cancers, gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a potentially lethal malignancy with abysmal long-term survival. Surgery is central to the management of GBC, and presently, provides the only ray of hope for long-term survival. Radical cholecystectomy, which includes cholecystectomy with a limited hepatic resection, regional lymphadenectomy and adjacent organ resection if required is used to encompass the tumor with negative margins - R'0' resection is the standard surgical treatment for the management of GBC. Absence of randomized controlled trials to address various surgical controversies due to rarity of disease in western world, advanced disease at presentation, high frequency of unresectability/inoperability at surgery, deficient neoadjuvant/adjuvant strategies and nihilistic views of oncologists due to aggressive disease biology has resulted in marked heterogeneity in surgical strategies employed to manage GBC across the surgical centers globally.

AB  - Objective The present population-based study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence, determinants and causes of corneal morbidity and blindness in a rural North Indian population.
   Design Population-based study in India with 12 899 participants of all ages.
   Methods Participants were recruited from 25 village clusters of district Gurgaon, Haryana, India using random cluster sampling strategy. All individuals were examined in detail with a portable slit lamp for evidence of any corneal disease during the door-to-door examination. Comprehensive ocular examination including logMar visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, non-contact tonometry and dilated retinal evaluation was performed at a central clinic site in the respective villages.
   Results Overall, 12 113 of 12 899 people (93.9% response rate) were examined during the household visits. Prevalence of corneal disease was 3.7% (95% CI 3.4% to 4.1%) and that of corneal blindness was 0.12% (95% CI 0.05% to 0.17%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that corneal disease was significantly higher in the elderly (p<0.0001) and illiterates (p<0.0001). Common causes of corneal opacity in the study population were pterygium (34.5%), ocular trauma (22.3%) and infectious keratitis (14.9%). Corneal diseases contributing to blindness were post-surgical bullous keratopathy (46.2%) and corneal degenerations (23.1%).
   Conclusions The study findings demonstrate that currently ocular trauma, infectious keratitis, post-surgical bullous keratopathy, and corneal degenerations are responsible for the major burden of corneal blindness and morbidity in the Indian population. The prevalence of corneal morbidity due to vitamin A deficiency and trachoma was low in this rural population.

AB  - Background: The global burden of influenza is increasingly recognized, but data from India remain sparse. We conducted a multi-site population-based surveillance study to estimate and compare rates of influenza-associated hospitalization at two rural Indian health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) sites at Ballabgarh and Vadu during 2010-2012.
   Methods: Prospective facility-based surveillance for all hospitalizations (excluding those for trauma, elective surgery and obstetric, ophthalmic or psychiatric reasons) was conducted at 72 health facilities. After collection of clinical details, patients had nasopharyngeal swabs taken and tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza viruses. Annual healthcare utilization surveys (HUS) were conducted in HDSS households to identify proportion of hospitalizations occurring at non-study facilities to adjust for hospitalizations missed through facility-based surveillance.
   Results: HUS showed that 69% and 67% of hospitalizations occurred at study facilities at Ballabgarh and Vadu, respectively. Overall, 6004 patients hospitalized with acute medical illness at participating facilities were enrolled (1717 from Ballabgarh; 4287 from Vadu). The proportion of patients with influenza was higher at Vadu than Ballabgarh annually (2010: 21% vs. 5%, p < 0.05; 2011: 18% vs. 5%, p < 0.05; 2012: 23% vs. 5%, p < 0.05). Annual adjusted influenza-associated hospitalization rates were 5-11 fold higher in Vadu (20.3-51.6 per 10,000) vs Ballabgarh (4.4-6.3 per 10,000). At both sites, influenza A/H1N1pdm09 and B predominated during 2010, A/H3N2 and B during 2011, and A/H1N1pdm09 and B during 2012.
   Conclusion: The markedly different influenza hospitalization rates by season and across communities in India highlight the need for sustained multi-site surveillance system for estimating national influenza disease burden. That would be the first step for initiating discussions around Influenza prevention and control strategies in the country.

AB  - Giant cell tumor (GCT) is primarily a bone neoplasm. Rare origin of the tumor from soft tissues has been reported. Involvement of mediastinum by GCT is even rarer. We herein describe an interesting case of huge mediastinal tumor in a young man. Radiologically, no primary osseous lesion was present throughout the body. Morphologically, tumor resembles osseous GCT with increased mitotic activity. Hence, the case was diagnosed as soft tissue GCT of low malignant potential at the rare site of mediastinum. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the fourth reported case. Pathologists and clinicians need to be aware of the rare diagnosis of GCT in mediastinum and should carefully evaluate the clinical and radiological findings.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
KW  - PROMOTER POLYMORPHISM
AB  - BackgroundParthenium dermatitis is a common airborne allergic health problem that induces a cell-mediated hypersensitivity immune response involving activated T lymphocytes, which culminates in injury to the skin. The disease is manifested as itchy erythematous papules and plaques and primarily affects the exposed areas and flexures. This study aimed to identify the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- (-) 308G>A polymorphism in the pathogenesis of parthenium dermatitis.
   Materials and methodsA total of 120 subjects, including 60 patients exclusively diagnosed for parthenium dermatitis and 60 healthy individuals, were included in the study. The genotyping of the TNF- (-) 308G>A region was carried out by the amplification refractory mutational system.
   ResultsIn the present study, we demonstrated that polymorphism of the TNF- (-) 308 position (A and/or G) was not statistically significant, and there was no difference in the distribution of any alleles of this locus in cases and controls.
   ConclusionThe present study suggests that there is a lack of association of potent proinflammatory cytokine TNF- (-) 308G>A polymorphism in parthenium dermatitis in the Indian cohort. It interprets genetically endowed transcriptional capacity due to this particular single nucleotide polymorphism but does not support the prevalence of high serum levels of TNF- in parthenium-induced skin allergic inflammation.

AB  - The role of zinc in seizure models and with antiepileptic drugs sodium valproate (SV) and phenytoin (PHT) was studied using experimental models of seizures in rats. Male Wistar rats, 150-250 g were administered zinc 2, 20, and 200 mg/kg, orally for 14 days. Sixty minutes after the last dose of zinc, rats were challenged with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 60 mg/kg, ip) or maximal electroshock (MES, 70 mA, 0.2 s duration). In another group, SV (150/300 mg/kg, ip) or PHT (40 mg/kg, ip) was administered after 30 min of zinc administration followed by seizure challenge. Zinc pretreatment at all doses had no effect on MES seizures. In PTZ seizures, with the lowest dose used, i.e., 2 mg/kg, a protective effect was observed. Neither the protection offered by the 100 % anticonvulsant dose of SV (300 mg/kg) in PTZ seizures was affected by pre-treatment with zinc nor a combination of subanticonvulsant dose of SV (150 mg/kg) and zinc offer any statistically significant advantage over either drug alone. The combination of phenytoin with zinc had no effect on any of the parameters tested. Apart from this, chronic zinc administration hampered development of chemically (PTZ)-kindled seizures in rats. Zinc supplementation is unlikely to have any undesirable effect when used in epileptics rather it may offer advantage in epileptic and seizure prone patients.

AB  - Smartphone based medical applications (apps) can facilitate self management of hypertension (HTN). The content and consumer interaction metrics of HTN related apps are unknown. In this cross Sectional study to ascertain the content of medical apps designed for HTN management, we queried Google Play and Apple iTunes using the search terms "hypertension" and "high blood pressure." The top 107 apps were analyzed. Major app functionalities including tracking (for blood pressure [BP], pulse, weight, body mass index), medical device (to measure pulse or BP), general information on HTN, and medication adherence tools were recorded along with consumer engagement parameters. Data were collected from May 28 to May 30, 2014. A total of 72% of the apps had tracking function, 22% had tools to enhance medication adherence, 37% contained general information on HTN, and 8% contained information on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. These data showed that a majority of apps for HTN are designed primarily for health management functions. However, 14% of Google Android apps could transform the smartphone into a medical device to measure BR None of these apps employed the use of a BP cuff or had any documentation of validation against a gold standard. Only 3% of the apps were developed by healthcare agencies such as universities or professional organizations. In regression models. the medical device function was highly predictive of greater number of downloads (odds ratio, 97.08; P < .001) and positive consumer reviews (Incidence rate ratios, 1204.39; P < .001). A large majority of medical apps designed for HTN serve health management functions such as tracking blood pressure, weight, or body mass index. Consumers have a strong tendency to download and favorably rate apps that are advertised to measure blood pressure and heart rate, despite a lack of validation for these apps. There is a need for greater oversight in medical app development for HTN, especially when they qualify as a medical device. (C) 2015 American Society of Hypertension. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the commonest malignancy of women in economically emerging countries. Patients have distressing symptoms from presentation through follow-up or end of life. Cervical cancer imposes significant burden on health care system due to distressing symptoms and associated loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Multitude of drugs and surgical measures in various combinations can relieve these distressing symptoms and various clinical conditions. The protocols and guidelines for alleviation or relief of symptoms by general pharmacological and surgical measures form an important policy subject in planning cervical cancer management program. These protocol and guidelines are based on the mechanism of action of drugs, extrapolation from management of similar symptoms, and clinical situations arising out of other non-cancerous conditions and experience of health care professionals. Therefore, rigorous evaluation of effectiveness of supportive health care services in developing countries is the need of hour. However, evaluation of such protocol and guidelines are not feasible in emerging economies due to resource constraint. Industrialized affluent nations are also not able to implement and further support care guidelines despite its recognition as an integral part of multidisciplinary management of cancer. Aforementioned factors have created blind spot zone of management purview of cervical cancer. Hence, we attempt to develop protocol for management of adverse events of cervical cancer. Symptoms' and medical conditions' management guidelines evolved on the basis of empirical clinical practice in community and premier oncology centers in resource-constrained developing countries has been presented in this short report. This report should not be an end in itself but has to attract attention of policy-makers, academicians, researchers, and practitioners toward advancing supportive care needs of cancer patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

AB  - The callus and roots developed from the hypocotyl and cotyledon explants of the germinating seeds of Calotropis procera were grown in culture, and the proteins isolated from them (CP and RP) were evaluated for their efficacy in inhibiting edema formation induced by sub-plantar injection of carrageenan in the hind paw of rat. Intravenous administration of both CP and RP 30 min before inducing inflammation produced a dose-dependent inhibition of edema formation at 1 and 5 mg/kg doses. The extents of inhibition with these proteins ranged between 40 and 70 % at the doses included while the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac produced 50 to 60 % inhibition at 5 mg/kg dose. The inhibitory effect with these proteins was accompanied by a dose-dependent reduction in the tissue levels of inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), and oxidative stress markers namely glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and maintenance of tissue architecture. The present study shows that the proteins isolated from the differentiated and undifferentiated tissues derived from the germinating seeds have therapeutic application in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, and these tissues could be used as an alternative source to minimize variability of plant-derived formulations.

AB  - Antibiotics are prescribed by dentists in dental practice, during dental treatment as well as for prevention of infection. Indications for the use of systemic antibiotics in dentistry are limited because most dental and periodontal diseases are best managed by operative intervention and oral hygiene measures. The use of antibiotics in dental practice is characterised by empirical prescription based on clinical and bacteriological epidemiological factors, resulting in the use of a very narrow range of broad-spectrum antibiotics for short periods of time. This has led to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in a wide range of microbes and to the consequent inefficacy of commonly used antibiotics. Dentists can make a difference by the judicious use of antimicrobials - prescribing the correct drug, at the standard dosage and appropriate regimen - only when systemic spread of infection is evident. The increasing resistance problems of recent years are probably related to the over- or misuse of broad-spectrum agents. There is a clear need for the development of prescribing guidelines and educational initiatives to encourage the rational and appropriate use of drugs in dentistry. This paper highlights the need for dentists to improve antibiotic prescribing practices in an attempt to curb the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and other side effects of antibiotic abuse. The literature provides evidence of inadequate prescribing practices by dentists for a number of factors, ranging from inadequate knowledge to social factors.

AB  - The present study examined the effects of licorice on antioxidant defense, functional impairment, histopathology, and ultrastructural alterations in isoproterenol (ISP)-induced myocardial injury in rats. Myocardial necrosis was induced by two subcutaneous injection of ISP (85mg/kg) at an interval of 24h. Licorice was administered orally for 30days in the doses of 100, 200, 400, or 800mg/kg. ISP-treated rats showed impaired hemodynamics, left ventricular dysfunction, and caused depletion of antioxidants and marker enzymes along with lipid peroxidation from myocardium. ISP also induced histopathological and ultrastructural alterations in myocardium. Pretreatment with licorice prevented the depletion of endogenous antioxidants and myocyte injury marker enzymes, inhibited lipid peroxidation, and showed recovery of hemodynamic and ventricular functions. Licorice treatment also reduced myonecrosis, edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells and showed preservation of subcellular and ultrastructural components. Our results demonstrate that licorice exerts cardioprotection by reducing oxidative stress, augmenting endogenous antioxidants, and restoring functional parameters as well as maintaining structural integrity.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the identification of clinical fungal isolates (yeast and molds) by protein profiling using Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). A total of 125 clinical fungal culture isolates (yeast and filamentous fungi) were collected. The test set included 88 yeast isolates (Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida guilliermondii, Candida kefyr, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida rugosa, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and 37 isolates of molds (Alternaria spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Cunninghamella spp., Histoplasma capsulatum, Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum nanum, Rhizomucor spp. and Trichophyton spp.). The correlation between MALDI TOF MS and conventional identification for all these 125 fungal isolates included in the study was 87.2% at the species level and 90.4% at the genus level. MALDITOF MS results revealed that the correlation in yeast (n = 88) identification was 100% both at the genus and species levels whereas, the correlation in mold (n = 37) identification was more heterogeneous i.e. 10.81% isolates had correct identification up to the genus level, 56.7% isolates had correct identification both at the genus and species levels, whereas 32.42% isolates were deemed Not Reliable Identification (NRI). But, with the modification in sample preparation protocol for molds, there was a significant improvement in identification. 86.4% isolates had correct identification till the genus and species levels whereas, only 2.7% isolates had Not Reliable Identification. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MALDITOF MS could be a possible alternative to conventional techniques both for the identification and differentiation of clinical fungal isolates. However, the main limitation of this technique is that MS identification could be more precise only if the reference spectrum of the fungal species is available in the database.

AB  - Mutations in H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodeling pathway have been reported in pediatric GBMs. H3.3 (H3F3A) mutations may affect transcriptional regulation by altered global histone-methylation. Therefore, we analyzed yet partly understood global histone code (H3K-4/9/27/36) trimethylation pattern in H3F3A-ATRX mutants and wild-type. H3F3A, HIST1H3B, IDH1, ATRX, DAXX and Tp53 mutations were identified by sequencing/immunohistochemistry in 27 pediatric GBMs. Global histone-methylation H3K-4/9/27/36me3 and Polycomb-protein EZH2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. H3F3A-ATRX mutation was observed in 66.7 % (18/27) of pediatric GBMs. K27M and G34R-H3F3A mutations were found in 37 % (10/27) and 14.8 % (4/27) patients respectively. G34V-H3F3A, HIST1H3B and IDH1 mutations were absent. Notably, commonest global histone-methylation mark lost was H3K27me3 (17/25, 68 %) followed by H3K4me3 (45.5 %, 10/22) and H3K9me3 (18.2 %, 4/22). Global H3K36me3 showed no loss. Most significant observation was loss of one or more histone-trimethylation mark in 80 % (20/25) pediatric GBMs. Notably, simultaneous loss of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 were present in 7/22 (31.8 %) of pediatric GBMs. Low expression of EZH2 was found in 12/24 (50 %) of cases. However no significant correlation of loss of histone-marks or EZH2 expression with H3F3A-ATRX mutants (loss of at least one histone-marks in 87.5 % (14/16) cases) versus wild-types (loss of at least one histone-marks in 75 % (6/8) cases) was seen. The present study highlights for the first time combinatorial loss of one or more histone-trimethylation marks associated with majority of pediatric GBMs and the finding suggests significant role of histone-code in the molecular biology that underlies pediatric GBMs. Hence therapies for patients with particular combinations of histone modifications present opportunity to design innovative patient-tailored treatment protocols.

AB  - Growing skull fractures are rare complications of traumatic skull fractures in children. The authors aim to share their experience in management of such lesions and analyse clinicoradiological features, surgical management and outcome in addition to prognostication factors.
   Retrospective study performed to include patients a parts per thousand currency sign18 years operated for growing skull fractures at our trauma centre from December 2007 to February 2014.
   Forty-three children were operated. Mean age at presentation was 4.57 years (range 7 months-18 years). Mean duration of onset of symptoms from initial trauma was 3.34 months (2 days-24 months). Mean interval from symptom onset to surgical repair was 11.6 months (1 week-15 years). Progressive non-tender scalp swelling was the most common symptom and parietal, the most common location. Duraplasty alone was performed in four patients while combined duro-cranioplasty was performed in the rest. Mean follow-up duration was 31 months (4-72 months). Subdural hygroma was associated in six cases. Two patients expired; rest all survivors had good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes.
   Being the second largest series to date, it adds significant valuable contribution to this topic. Poor prognostic factors were age > 8 years, females, large defects (> 7 cm), severe head injury at initial trauma, defects crossing midline and delayed repair (> 8 months). Delayed onset seizures and new onset/progression of pre-existing deficits can be indirect markers of evolution. Surgical repair with water-tight dural closure is the standard treatment. Emphasis on early treatment is highlighted which is probably beneficial in improving neurological deficits. Good-to-excellent outcomes are noted in majority, even in cases with delayed presentations.

AB  - Somatostatin (SST) and the somatostatin receptor type 2 (sstr2) are expressed in the superficial part (Laminae I-III) of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Since the neurons in these laminae also receive nociceptive sensation from the periphery, it was hypothesized that both SST and sstr2 could be involved in the modulation of nociceptive transmission. To the best of knowledge, there are no studies on the involvement of SST and sstr2 in hind paw incision model in rats, which mimics postoperative pain in humans. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to hind paw incision under isoflurane anaesthesia and the resulting mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated for 5 days. In another set of animals, the spinal cord was isolated at specified time intervals after incision and examined for SST and sstr2 expression using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting procedures. Finally, nociceptive parameters were again evaluated in incised rats, which had received SST (400 mu g/kg i.p. three times per day). Blood glucose level and locomotor activity were determined after SST treatment. Both allodynia and hyperalgesia were highest immediately after incision. Spinal SST expression increased at 2 h. A further increase was noted on day 3. Expression of sstr2 increased initially but decreased at day 1. These changes could be due to exocytosis of SST and internalization of the ligand-receptor complex. SST injection significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia but not thermal hyperalgesia. Significant change in blood glucose level or locomotor activity was absent SST appears to contribute to postincisional pain. This finding could be of clinical relevance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - People of South Asian origin are at a high risk of developing diabetes compared to that of other ethnic groups. Recent evidence suggests an emerging epidemic of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the region, in parallel with the childhood obesity epidemic. Many risk factors such as foetal and early-life influences, the South Asian phenotype, family history of diabetes and environment factors are responsible for the early occurrence of T2DM in South Asia. The high risk supports the need for the opportunistic screening of children and adolescents for diabetes in South Asian countries. Early detection, lifestyle modification, weight reduction and drugs are central to the care of children with T2DM. Both population-based preventive strategies and interventions targeting children and adolescents with obesity and impaired glucose tolerance are required to combat the epidemic of youth-onset T2DM in South Asia.

AB  - Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a ciliopathy disorder with pleiotropic effect manifests primarily as retinal degeneration along with renal insufficiency, polydactyly and obesity. In this study, we have performed homozygosity mapping using NspI 250K affymetrix gene chip followed by mutation screening of the candidate genes located in the homozygous blocks. These regions are prioritized based on the block length and candidature of the genes in BBS and other ciliopathies. Gene alterations in known BBS (22) and other ciliopathy genes such as ALMS1 (2) were seen in 24 of 30 families (80%). Mutations in BBS 3 gene, inclusive of a novel recurrent mutation (p.I91T) accounted for 18% of the identified variations. Disease associated polymorphisms p.S70N (BBS2), rs1545 and rs1547 (BBS6) were also observed. This is the first study in Indian BBS patients and homozygosity mapping has proved to be an effective tool in prioritizing the candidate genes in consanguineous pedigrees. The study reveals a different mutation profile in the ciliopathy genes in Indian population and implication of novel loci/genes in 20% of the study group.

KW  - vitreous haemorrhage
AB  - Background: Eales' disease is an idiopathic retinal vasculitis characterized by retinal inflammation, ischemia, and neo-vascularisation. It frequently causes massive vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment leading to blindness. Although the exact etiology is unknown, this condition is considered to be a consequence of hypersensitivity reaction to tubercular protein due to previous Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection. This study is aimed at the detection of association of M. tuberculosis in patients with Eales' disease. Materials and Methods: A prospective case-control study was undertaken in 65 clinically diagnosed cases of Eales' disease. Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neo-vascular proliferation, macular oedema, premacular fibrosis and tractional retinal detachment were taken as controls. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected (MPT64 gene by polymerase chain reaction, PCR) in patients with Eales' disease. Clinical symptoms along with tuberculin skin test (TST) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were used as gold standard for comparing results of PCR. Result: PCR positivity was found in 12 (38.7%) patients with Eales' disease. The PCR positivity was significantly associated with the patients with high TST reading and high ESR values. Conclusion: Patients with a high TST reading and ESR value and a positive PCR in vitreous samples have a high likelihood of having M. tuberculosis as an etiology.

AB  - The trochlear and abducens nerves (TN and AN) control the movement of the superior oblique and lateral rectus muscles of the eyeball, respectively. Despite their immense clinical and radiological importance no morphometric data was available from a wide spectrum of age groups for comparison with either pathological or other conditions involving these nerves. In the present study, morphometry of the TN and AN was performed on twenty post-mortem samples ranging from 12-90 years of age. The nerve samples were processed for resin embedding and toluidine blue stained thin (1 mu m) sections were used for estimating the total number of myelinated axons by fractionator and the cross sectional area of the nerve and the axons by point counting methods. We observed that the TN was covered by a well-defined epineurium and had ill-defined fascicles, whereas the AN had multiple fascicles with scanty epineurium. Both nerves contained myelinated and unmyelinated fibers of various sizes intermingled with each other. Out of the four age groups (12-20y, 21-40y, 41-60y and >61y) the younger groups revealed isolated bundles of small thinly myelinated axons. The total number of myelinated fibers in the TN and AN at various ages ranged from 1100-3000 and 1600-7000, respectively. There was no significant change in the cross-sectional area of the nerves or the axonal area of the myelinated nerves across the age groups. However, myelin thickness increased significantly in the AN with aging (one way ANOVA). The present study provides baseline morphometric data on the human TN and AN at various ages.

AB  - A 55-year-old woman presented with a complaint of post-menopausal bleeding per vaginum. Local examination revealed a mass, protruding from the cervical os, which detached spontaneously. An adnexal mass was felt through the pouch of Douglas on per vaginum examination. Histopathological examination of the avulsed specimen revealed a diagnosis of malignant mixed Mullerian tumor. The patient underwent surgical staging with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, left pelvic lymphadenectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and peritoneal wash cytology. Pathological examination revealed a second primary tumor, that is, a transitional cell carcinoma of the ovary. Both the uterine malignant mixed Mullerian tumor and the ovarian transitional cell carcinoma were staged as IA. Subsequently, the patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The patient is in complete remission at 1 year following the treatment. Synchronous genital tract neoplasms constitute a therapeutic challenge and necessitate an effective multimodality therapeutic approach based on meticulous pathological examination and tumor staging.

AB  - Objective To assess the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in HIV infected children (>5 y) receiving stavudine-based combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for more than 3 mo in a cross-sectional study.
   Methods History, detailed neurological examination and nerve conduction studies were performed.
   Results Forty children [26 boys; median age -11.75 y, Inter quartile range (IQR): 9-16 y] were enrolled. The median duration of ART was 43 mo [IQR: 18-69 mo]. The nerve conduction studies were abnormal in four children (10 %). Symptomatic distal sensory polyneuropathy was present in two children, asymptomatic distal sensory polyneuropathy and subclinical distal sensory polyneuropathy was present in one child each.
   Conclusions Distal sensory polyneuropathy is a potential problem in children on stavudine based ART. Children on stavudine based ART need periodic clinical and electrophysiological screening for its early detection.

AB  - ObjectiveThe utility of impression cytology in ocular diseases has predominantly been restricted to the diagnosis of dry eye, limbal stem cell deficiency and conjunctival neoplasias. Its role in malignant eyelid lesions remains largely unexplored. Although scrape cytology is more popular for cutaneous lesions, impression cytology, being non-traumatic, has an advantage in small and delicate areas such as the eyelid. The present study has been designed to evaluate its role in the diagnosis and management of malignant eyelid lesions.
   MethodsThirty-two histopathologically proven malignant eyelid lesions diagnosed over a 2-year period, including 13 basal cell carcinomas, 11 sebaceous carcinomas, four squamous cell carcinomas, two malignant melanomas and two poorly differentiated carcinomas, formed the study group.
   ResultsThe results of impression cytology were compared with those of histopathology in the study group and with an age- and sex-matched group of benign cases as controls. The sensitivity of impression cytology was 84% (27/32) for the diagnosis of malignancy and 28% (9/32) for categorization of the type of malignancy.
   ConclusionsImpression cytology is a simple, useful, non-invasive technique for the detection of malignant ulcerative eyelid lesions. It is especially useful as a follow-up technique for the detection of recurrences.

AB  - Background: Although chronic risk factors for stroke are reasonably well understood, the acute precipitants, or triggers, of stroke relatively remain understudied. Identification of particular time periods during which stroke risk is elevated could prove a valuable strategy to reduce stroke incidence through the introduction of appropriate prevention strategies during a period of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of trigger factors in acute stroke patients and to investigate the association of the presence of trigger factors with initial stroke severity at presentation (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in ischemic stroke patients and volume of hematoma in hemorrhagic stroke patients). Methods: This was a hospital-based observational cross-sectional study. All consecutive patients of recent stroke (reporting within 1 week of stroke onset) were included in the study. This study examined the prevalence of 11 predefined triggers (including both well-established and potential triggers) in predefined hazard periods. Results: In total, 290 patients participated in the study. Presence of any trigger factor out of 11 trigger factors studied was seen in 128 (44.2%) of 290 patients, 104 (46.4%) of 224 ischemic stroke patients and 24 (36.4%) of 66 hemorrhagic stroke patients. Psychological stress was present in 51 (17.6%) patients, among psychological stress: stressful life event in 34 (11.7%), negative affect in 17 (5.9%), acute alcohol abuse in 31 (10.7%), clinical infections in 24 (8.3%), and anger and coffee intake in 12 (4.1%) each. Sexual activity, trauma, and surgery were present in 5 (1.7%), 4 (1.4%), and 5 (1.7%) patients, respectively. None of the patients reported exposure to recreational drug abuse, startling event, and unusual vigorous physical exertion in hazard periods. Two or more trigger factors were present in 16 (5.5%) patients. Clinical variables independently associated with the presence of trigger factors in acute stroke after multivariate analysis were younger age (<60 years) and stroke severity at initial presentation (ie, higher NIHSS score and higher hematoma volume). Conclusions: Trigger factors were present in 44.2% of acute stroke patients. Psychological stress (17.6%), acute alcohol abuse (10.7%), and clinical infections (8.3%) were the most common triggers. Younger age (<60 years) and stroke severity at initial presentation were independently associated with the presence of trigger factors in acute stroke patients. However, these associations need to be further explored in community-based studies.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT imaging in a large exclusive population of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
   Methods: Data of 141 (mean age 46.2 +/- 15.2 years) patients who underwent 178 Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT studies for diagnosis/staging (n = 88) and restaging (n = 90) of pancreatic NET were retrospectively analyzed. PET/CT results were compared to conventional imaging (CIM) when available (n = 86). Histopathology and/or clinical/imaging follow-up (minimum 6 months) were used as reference standard.
   Results: The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT were 85.7%, 79.1%, and 84.8%. The corresponding values were 73%, 50%, and 70.4% for diagnosis/staging groups and 98.6%, 100%, and 98.8% for restaging groups. The accuracy was significantly higher for restaging as compared to diagnosis/staging (P < 0.0001) and in non-insulinoma tumors than insulinomas (P < 0.0001). The SUVmax of primary tumors was significantly higher than metastatic lesions overall (P = 0.001), as well as in diagnosis/staging (P = 0.041) and restaging (P = 0.0003) subgroups. When available, CIM was less specific than Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT (P < 0.001) and showed fewer lesions.
   Conclusions: Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT is useful for diagnosis/staging and restaging of patients with pancreatic NET. It demonstrates more lesions compared to CIM and is more specific.

AB  - Background & objectives : Epidemiological information on tuberculosis (TB) has always been vital for planning control strategies. It has now gained further importance for monitoring the impact of interventions to control the disease. The present study was done to estimate the prevalence of bacillary tuberculosis in the district of Faridabad in Haryana State of India among persons aged older than 15 years.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, residents of Faridabad district were assessed for the prevalence of tuberculosis. Twelve rural and 24 urban clusters with estimated populations of 41,106 and 64,827 individuals were selected for the study. Two sputum samples were collected from individuals found eligible for inclusion. The samples were also cultured by modified Petroffs method and were examined for growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis once a week for eight weeks. A person found positive by smear and/or culture was identified as sputum-positive pulmonary TB positive.
   Results: A total of 105,202 subjects were enumerated in various clusters of the Faridabad district. There were 50,057 (47.58%) females and 55,145 (52.42%) males. Of these 98,599 (93.7%) were examined by the study group (47,976 females; 50,623 males). The overall prevalence of sputum smear or culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis in our study was found to be 101.4 per 100,000 population.
   Interpretation & conclusions : The present results showed that the prevalence of sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis was higher in Faridabad district than the notification rates recorded by the World Health Organization for the contemporary period, a disparity that could be explained by a difference in case detection strategy employed for the study.

AB  - Objective: To assess the extent to which people with diabetes in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) of Asia and the Middle East met evidence-based care recommendations through a systematic review of published literature.
   Methods: Electronic searches of Medline and Embase were carried out for studies assessing quality of care among people with diabetes in Asia and the Middle East between 1993 and 2012. Benchmarking against American Diabetes Association guidelines, we reported level and proportions meeting recommended risk factor control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA(1)c], blood pressure, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL]) and preventive care processes across different settings.
   Results: One hundred and fifteen publications met eligibility for inclusion (91 reported risk factor control, 7 reported preventive processes, and 17 reported both). Only China, Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines had nationally representative data. Mean HbA1c (6.5-11% or 4897 mmol/mol), SBP (120-152mm Hg), and LDL (2.4-3.8 mmol/l) varied greatly. Despite variation in availability of data, studies consistently showed that recommended care goals were not being achieved.
   Conclusions: The practice of auditing and benchmarking against evidence-based guidelines appears to be uncommon in Asia and the Middle East and there was heterogeneity of reporting across studies, populations, and methods used. The available data showed inadequate care. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our recent studies have focused on the identification and characterization of the tryptophan-rich proteins of the Plasmodium vivax parasite where their role in the elicitation of humoral and cellular responses and erythrocyte-binding activity was investigated. Here, we report the humoral responses of a 32.4-kDa P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigen (PvTRAg32.4) among the sera of P. vivax-infected patients. PvTRAg32.4 also contains an unusually high percentage of tryptophan residues (10.7 %) that are positionally conserved with its orthologues in Plasmodium yoelii (PypAg1 and PypAg2) and Plasmodium falciparum (PfTryThrA and PfMATRA). Thirty-four of the 40 (85.0 %) P. vivax isolates showed seropositivity to recombinant PvTRAg32.4 by ELISA. The mean +/- SD values of optical density (OD) for P. vivax subjects and naive individuals were 1.02 +/- 0.36 and 0.26 +/- 0.11, respectively. In the Western blot analysis, majority of the subjects studied (n= 44) showed reactivity to the recombinant, purified PvTRAg32.4. This antigen does not show binding to the erythrocytes, but the immunofluorescence data reveals that it is expressed in the erythrocytic stages of the parasite. Sequence analysis of the clinical isolates from various parts of the country shows that PvTRAg32.4 is highly conserved. Functional in-depth characterization of more such type of novel proteins in the parasite is warranted for the development of successful malaria intervention methods.

AB  - Purpose. To study changes in near and distance stereoacuity after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).
   Methods. A prospective interventional study was conducted at an apex tertiary care ophthalmology center in India. Near and distance stereoacuity was tested in 40 patients (80 eyes) who underwent LASIK for myopic correction and got unaided vision of 0.67 or better in each eye. Stereoacuity was tested with best spectacle correction before LASIK, and post-LASIK stereoacuity was tested with unaided eye near and distance Randot tests.
   Results. Forty patients (80 eyes) had a mean (+/- SD) pre-LASIK refractive error of -4.70 (+/- 1.72) DSOD and -4.59 (+/- 1.58) DS OS and a mean (+/- SD) anisometropia of 0.55 (+/- 0.51) DS. The median pre-LASIK near stereoacuity was 70 arcsec and distance stereoacuity was 200 arcsec, both of which improved after LASIK to 30 and 60 arcsec, respectively (p < 0.001, both). Amount of refractive error was not associated with stereoacuity but anisometropia of greater than or equal to 1 diopter had significantly worse distance stereoacuity in both the pre-LASIK and post-LASIK period. The post-LASIK near stereoacuity and distance stereoacuity were strongly associated (r = 0.706, p <0.001) unlike the change in stereoacuity.
   Conclusions. Near and distance stereoacuity shows significant improvement after LASIK. Stereoacuity is associated with the degree of anisometropia but not the amount of refractive error corrected.

AB  - The relationship between perfusion pattern and stress-induced changes in left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony (LVMD) on stress-rest thallium-201-gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (Tl-201 SPECT MPI) is not clear. The aim of the study is to assess the relation of perfusion pattern with stress-induced changes in LVMD on Tl-201 MPI.
   Data of 194 patients who underwent exercise-rest Tl-201 MPI between January to December 2012 at our institute was retrospectively evaluated. Institute Ethical committee approval was obtained. Fifty patients who underwent Tl-201 MPI for suspected CAD and had normal LV perfusion and function on MPI were taken as normal group. Patients with perfusion abnormalities (n = 144) were divided into three groups: ischemia (n = 66), infarct (n = 32), and mixed group (n = 46; ischemia and infarct both). Summed stress score, summed rest score, summed difference score (SDS), and LV ejection fraction (EF) were evaluated. Two LVMD parameters, phase standard deviation (PSD) and phase histogram bandwidth (PHB), were assessed in post-stress and rest MPI images. Delta PSD (post-stress PSD - rest PSD) and Delta PHB (post-stress PHB - rest PHB) were calculated to measure stress-induced changes in LVMD.
   In all the groups, mean post-stress LVMD parameters were lower as compared to LVMD parameters at rest. Post-stress PSD was significantly lower than rest PSD in all groups. Similar trend was noted with PHB values also, but it was statistically significant in the normal and ischemia group only. Post-stress worsening of at least one of the LVMD parameters was noted in 28 patients and all these patients had perfusion abnormalities. But on subgroup analysis, no difference was found in proportion of patients showing post-stress worsening of LVMD between ischemia (13.6%), infarct (25%), and mixed (23.6%) groups. No significant correlation was found between Delta PSD/Delta PHB and Delta LVEF/SDS in any group.
   LV mechanical dyssynchrony parameters are smaller in post-exercise stress as compared to rest on Tl-201 MPI, regardless of perfusion pattern. Stress-induced worsening of LV dyssynchrony was observed only in patients with perfusion abnormalities, but this is not related to the type of perfusion abnormality.

AB  - The relationship between microcystin production, microcystin-producing cyanobacteria, including Microcystis spp., and various biological and physicochemical parameters in Sankuldhara and Lakshmikund, situated in the same geographical area was studied over a period of 1.5 years. Seasonal variation in cyanobacterial 16S rRNA, Microcystis spp. 16S rRNA, mcyA and mcyB genes were quantitatively determined by real-time PCR. Microcystis was the dominant microcystin producer in both study sites constituting 67% and 97% of the total microcystin-producing cyanobacteria at Sankuldhara and Lakshmikund, respectively. Microcystin concentrations were 2.19-39.60 mu g/L and 15.22-128.14 mu g/L at Sankuldhara and Lakshmikund, respectively, as determined by LC-MS. Principal component analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between microcystin concentration and the copy number of mcyA and mcyB, chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial biomass at both sites. The higher microcystin concentrations in Lakshmikund pond were attributed to the high copy number of mcy genes present coupled with the pond's eutrophication status, as indicated by high total algal biomass, high chlorophyll a content, high nutrient load and low DO. Therefore, a significant difference in microcystin concentrations, correlating with these various biological and physicochemical parameters, confirms the importance of local environmental variables in the overall regulation of microcystins production.

AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease require renal replacement therapy with maintenance hemodialysis or chronic peritoneal dialysis while awaiting transplantation. In addition to economic issues and limited state funding for advanced health care, the lack of trained medical personnel contributes to scarce dialysis facilities for children in developing countries. The establishment and operation of a hemodialysis unit with multidisciplinary facilities is both cost- and labor-intensive. Hemodialysis is usually carried out three times a week in a hospital setting and affects the curricular and extracurricular activities of the patient. Chronic ambulatory or cyclic peritoneal dialysis is technically simpler and allows better nutrition and growth, but is expensive for the majority of patients who must pay out of their own pocket. Multiple initiatives to enhance the training of pediatricians and nurses in skills related to initiating and managing patients on maintenance dialysis have resulted in the improved survival of children with end-stage renal disease. Support from state governments and philanthropic institutions have helped in establishing pediatric nephrology units that are equipped to provide renal replacement therapy for children.

KW  - ICARE TONOMETER
AB  - To analyze correlation of intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement between new rebound tonometer (RBT) I-Care TA01 and Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT). One hundred eighty-five eyes of 185 subjects presenting with glaucoma or cataract were enrolled in the study. In all patients, IOP was obtained by an ophthalmologist using I-Care TA01 and GAT. IOP between the two were compared at range of 8-15, 16-21, and > 22 mmHg and difference was considered as significant at p < 0.05 (t test). Bland-Altman analysis tested agreement between instruments overall and for each subgroup of patients with glaucoma or no glaucoma (cataract only). Of 185 patients, 86 had glaucoma; 99 did not. Mean age of patients was 55.77 +/- A 14.46 years; with no difference between the two subgroups (p = 0.12). There was no significant difference in mean IOP between the two tonometers at IOP between 8-15 mmHg (p = 0.097) and 16-21 mmHg (p = 0.51). However, a significant difference was observed between the two at IOP > 22 mmHg (p = 0.023) with mean GAT (24.8 mmHg) being higher than mean RBT (23.16 mmHg). Overall, there was no difference between the two (p = 0.59) and they had a high correlation (Pearson correlation r = 0.815; p = 0.01). The mean difference between the two was 0.1 (95 % agreement limits: UL +6 (1.96SD), LL -5.8 (-1.96SD)), in patients with no glaucoma was 0.091 (95 % AL: UL +4.8 (1.96SD), LL -4.6 (-1.96SD)), and in patients with glaucoma was 0.151 (95 % AL: UL +7.25 (1.96SD), LL -6.9 (-1.96SD)). RBT I-Care TA01 and Goldmann tonometer cannot be used interchangeably due to large limits of agreement.

AB  - The anatomical knowledge of arterial variations of lower limb is of utmost significance for the present day surgeons and interventional radiologists for minimizing complications during vascular reconstructive procedures, catheterization procedures and surgical intervention for embolism. Lateral Circumflex Femoral Artery (LCFA) is an important branch of Profunda Femoris artery and precise knowledge of its variations can be of great relevance during surgical and radiological procedures in femoral region. The present study reports a unique case of anomalous route taken by LCFA posterior to femoral nerve associated with a prominent muscular branch from Femoral artery mimicking the course of LCFA. Documentation of such variations is highly significant. It may serve as guideline for surgeons in reducing the incidence of postoperative complications where LCFA is used as a long vascular pedicle in anterolateral perforator thigh flap and in breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Ignorance of such variations can lead to fatal intraoperative haemorrhage and incapacitating sensory and motor deficit due to injury to femoral nerve branches which are closely related to these vessels.

AB  - Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients are at high risk of loco-regional recurrence and 5-year survival rates are about 50%. Identification of patients at high risk of recurrence will enable rigorous personalized post-treatment management. Most novel biomarkers have failed translation for clinical use because of their limited successful validation in external patient cohorts. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of alterations in sub-cellular expression of S100A2, a pro-tumorigenic calcium binding protein, identified as a candidate biomarker in our proteomic analysis in OSCC and validation of its clinical utility in an external cohort.
   Methods: In a retrospective study, immunohistochemical analysis of S100A2 was carried out in 235 Indian OSCC (Test set) and 129 normal oral tissues, correlated with clinicopathological parameters and disease outcome over 122 months for OSCC patients following the REMARK criteria. The findings were validated in an external cohort (Validation set 115 Canadian OSCC and 51 normal tissues) and data analyzed using the R package.
   Results: Significant increase in cytoplasmic and decrease in nuclear S100A2 expression was observed in OSCC in comparison with normal tissues. Cox multivariable regression analysis internally and externally validated cytoplasmic S100A2 association with tumor recurrence. Kaplan Meier analysis of patients stratified to high and low risk groups showed significantly different recurrence free survival (Test set-log rank test, p = 0.005, median survival 16 and 69 months respectively and Validation set - p < 0.00001, median survival 9.4 and 59.9 months respectively); 86% and 81% of patients who had recurrence were correctly stratified into the high risk group. Seventy percent and 81% patients stratified into low risk group did not show cancer recurrence within 1 year in Test and Validation sets.
   Conclusions: Our study provided clinical evidence for the potential of cytoplasmic S100A2 overexpression as a predictor of recurrence risk in OSCC patients. A unique translational aspect of our study is validation of S100A2 as prognostic marker in two independent cohorts (Canadian and Indian) suggesting this protein is likely to find widespread utility in clinical practice for identifying oral cancer patients at high risk of disease recurrence.

AB  - Stroke is a multi-factorial disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The purpose of this case control study was to determine the relationship of beta-1 adrenergic receptor polymorphism with ischemic stroke in North Indian population. In this study, 224 patients and 224 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited from the outpatient department and neurology ward of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Genotyping was performed by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. PCR results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Frequency distributions of genotypes and alleles were compared between cases and controls using logistic regression. Mean age of cases and controls was 53.9 +/- 13.4 and 53.6 +/- 12.9 years respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an independent association between Ser49Gly polymorphism and ischemic stroke under a dominant model of inheritance (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5) and large vessel disease (LVD) under a recessive model of inheritance (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.7 to 23; P = 0.005). Independent association of Arg389Gly polymorphism with small vessel disease (SVD) (OR, 7.09; 95% CI, 1.9 to 25; P = 0.003) under recessive model of inheritance. The findings of the present study Ser49Gly polymorphism of the ADRBI gene confer higher risk of ischemic stroke in a North Indian population and especially in patients with LVD. Our findings also show that Arg389Gly polymorphism of ADRBI confers higher risk of SVD in North Indian population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specifi c all-cause and cause-specifi c mortality is essential for the formation of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence across countries.
   Methods We estimated age-sex-specifi c all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For pathogen-specifi c causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.
   Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65.3 years (UI 65.0-65.6) in 1990, to 71.5 years (UI 71.0-71.9) in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million (UI 46.8-48.2) to 54.9 million (UI 53.6-56.3) over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute diff erences between countries decreased but relative diff erences increased. For women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative diff erences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions.
   Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex specifi c mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.

AB  - SAP-1 is a 113 amino acid long single-chain protein which belongs to the type 2 cystatin gene family. In our previous study, we have purified SAP-1 from human seminal plasma and observed its cross-class inhibitory property. At this time, we report the interaction of SAP-1 with diverse proteases and its binding partners by CD-spectroscopic and molecular docking methods. The circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic studies demonstrate that the conformation of SAP-1 is changed after its complexation with proteases, and the alterations in protein secondary structure are quantitatively calculated with increase of alpha-helices and reduction of beta-strand content. To get insight into the interactions between SAP-1 and proteases, we make an effort to model the three-dimensional structure of SAP-1 by molecular modeling and verify its stability and viability through molecular dynamics simulations and finally complexed with different proteases using ClusPro 2.0 Server. A high degree of shape complementarity is examined within the complexes, stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) and hydrophobic interactions. Using HB analyses in different protein complexes, we have identified a series of key residues that may be involved in the interactions between SAP-1 and proteases. These findings will assist to understand the mechanism of inhibition of SAP-1 for different proteases and provide intimation for further research.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lu-177-EDTMP for pain palliation in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate and breast cancer. The secondary objective was to compare low-dose and high-dose Lu-177-EDTMP in bone pain palliation.
   Included in the study were 44 patients with documented breast carcinoma (12 patients; age 47 +/- 13 years) or castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (32 patients; age 66 +/- 9 years) and skeletal metastases. Patients were randomized into two equal groups treated with Lu-177-EDTMP intravenously at a dose of 1,295 MBq (group A) or 2,590 MBq (group B). Pain palliation was evaluated using a visual analogue score (VAS), analgesic score (AS) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) up to 16 weeks. Toxicity was assessed in terms of haematological and renal parameters.
   The overall response rate (in all 44 patients) was 86 %. Complete, partial and minimal responses were seen in 6 patients (13 %), 21 patients (48 %) and 11 patients (25 %), respectively. A favourable response was seen in 27 patients (84 %) with prostate cancer and in 11 patients (92 %) with breast cancer. There was a progressive decrease in the VAS from baseline up to 4 weeks (p < 0.05). Also, AS decreased significantly from 1.8 +/- 0.7 to 1.2 +/- 0.9 (p < 0.0001). There was an improvement in quality of life of the patients as reflected by an increase in mean KPS from 56 +/- 5 to 75 +/- 7 (p < 0.0001). The overall response rate in group A was 77 % compared to 95 % in group B (p = 0.188). There was a significant decrease in VAS and AS accompanied by an increase in KPS in both groups. Nonserious haematological toxicity (grade I/II) was observed in 15 patients (34 %) and serious toxicity (grade III/IV) occurred in 10 patients (23 %). There was no statistically significant difference in haematological toxicity between the groups.
   Lu-177-EDTMP was found to be a safe and effective radiopharmaceutical for bone pain palliation in patients with metastatic prostate and breast carcinoma. There were no differences in efficacy or toxicity between patients receiving low-dose and high-dose Lu-177-EDTMP.

AB  - Intracellular gene delivery properties of styrene-alt-maleic anhydride based graft co-polymers embedded with various cationic moieties were analyzed. Quaternary nitrogen units were grafted to the polymer via aromatic (quaternized isonicotinic acid), aliphatic (glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) and cyclo aliphatic (quaternized piperazine) molecules. Primary/ secondary amine-grafted polymers were obtained by conjugating L-arginine and spermine. These amphiphilic graft copolymers readily formed core shell type nanoparticles of size < 100 nm. Cytotoxicity, haemo-compatibility, endosomal rupturing properties, polyplex formation and resistance to DNase degradation were evaluated for all the polymeric derivatives, and found to have a strong correlation with the nature of the cationic moieties. The cytotoxic potential of the cations was in the order: quaternized piperazine > spermine > quaternized isonicotinic acid, L-arginine and glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. Excellent endosomal rupturing efficiency (% haemolysis at pH 5.5) was observed for quaternized isonicotinic acid (similar to 86%), spermine (similar to 78%) and L-arginine (similar to 73%) grafts. Polyplexes of the quaternized derivatives showed reduced DNase resistance probably due to electrostatic repulsion of carboxylic side chains. L-Arginine and spermine grafted nanocarriers exhibited efficient DNA complexation and DNase resistance, and hence were evaluated for transfection efficiency in MCF-7 cells. The spermine graft depicted a 1.45 fold higher transfection efficiency than the positive control (branched polyethyleneimine, 25 000 kDa), and the L-arginine graft achieved comparable efficiency to that of the control. These amphiphilic nanocarriers show promising potential for in vivo gene delivery applications due to their lower cytotoxicity, pH responsiveness, large scale production feasibility and ease of chemical modification.

AB  - There is no consensus on how the reliability and predictive ability of noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and computed tomography angiography source image (CTASI) change over time from acute ischemic stroke onset. We hypothesized that the reliability for detecting early ischemic changes (EIC) would be lower in early time periods and that changes identified on CTASI would be more reliable across examiners than changes identified on NCCT. To address this, we compared the relationships between CTASI, NCCT, and final infarct in patients with initial computed tomography (CT) imaging at different time points after stroke onset. Patients with acute ischemic stroke with proximal anterior circulation occlusions (internal carotid artery, middle carotid artery M1, proximal M2) from Calgary CT Angiography (CTA) database were studied. The cohort was categorized in four groups based on time from stroke onset to baseline NCCT/CTA: 0-90 mins (n = 69), 91-180 mins (n = 88), 181-360 mins (n = 46), and >360 mins (n = 58). Median scores of NCCT-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), CTASI ASPECTS, and follow-up ASPECTS among different time categories were compared. To determine reliability, a sub-sample of NCCT brain and CTASI were interpreted at separate sessions weeks apart by two neuroradiologists and two stroke neurologists in random order. Median and mean ASPECTS ratings on NCCT and CTASI were higher than final ASPECTS in each time category (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). CTASI ASPECTS was lower than NCCT ASPECTS in each time category, and differences were significant at 0-90 mins and 91-180 mins (P < 0.001). The least agreement among readers was in detection of EIC on NCCT brain in the ultra-early phase (<90 mins) [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.48. By contrast, there was excellent agreement on EIC on CTASI regardless of time period (ICC = 0.87-0.96). Using ASPECTS methodology, CTASI is more reliable than NCCT at predicting final infarct extent particularly in the early time windows.

AB  - Preclinical studies are essential for translation to disease treatments and effective use in clinical practice. An undue emphasis on single approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to have retarded the pace of translation in the field, and there is much frustration in the public about the lack of an effective treatment. We critically reviewed past literature (1990-2014), analyzed numerous data, and discussed key issues at a consensus conference on Brain Ageing and Dementia to identify and overcome roadblocks in studies intended for translation. We highlight various factors that influence the translation of preclinical research and highlight specific preclinical strategies that have failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. The field has been hindered by the domination of the amyloid hypothesis in AD pathogenesis while the causative pathways in disease pathology are widely considered to be multifactorial. Understanding the causative events and mechanisms in the pathogenesis are equally important for translation. Greater efforts are necessary to fill in the gaps and overcome a variety of confounds in the generation, study design, testing, and evaluation of animal models and the application to future novel anti-dementia drug trials. A greater variety of potential disease mechanisms must be entertained to enhance progress.

AB  - Anemia among adolescent girls is one of the major challenges faced by India. The present study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of anemia and status of other hematological parameters among adolescent girls (11-18 years) residing in an urban slum of Delhi. A total of 794 adolescent girls were recruited for the study. The prevalence of anemia was estimated using the cyanmethemoglobin method. Serum levels of ferritin, folic acid and vitamin B-12 were estimated for anemic subjects. The prevalence of anemia was reported as 58.7%, with 31.6%, 25.7% and 1.4% of subjects being mild, moderate and severely anemic. Hemoglobin levels of subjects who had attained menarche were found to be significantly lower than those who had not attained menarche. The prevalence of serum ferritin, folic acid and vitamin B-12 deficiency among those who were anemic was reported as 41.1 %, 5.0 % and 63.3 % respectively. A total of 23.5 % anemic subjects had concomitant micronutrient deficiencies of serum vitamin B-12 and ferritin. The results indicate that supplemental iron and vitamin B-12 may better address the burden of anemia in adolescent girls in Delhi.

AB  - Background: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon, potentially fatal, hyperinflammatory syndrome that may rarely complicate the clinical course of Orientia tsutsugamushi disease (scrub typhus).
   Methods: Here we describe the clinicopathological features, laboratory parameters, management, and outcome of three adult patients (1 female, 2 males) with scrub typhus associated HLH from a tertiary center. A brief and concise review of international literature on the topic was also added.
   Results: All three patients satisfied the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria; one had multi-organ dysfunction with very high ferritin level (>30,000 ng/ml), and all had a dramatic recovery following doxycyclin therapy. Literature review from January 1990 to March 2014 revealed that scrub typhus associated HLH were reported in 21 patients, mostly from the scrub endemic countries of the world. These included 11 females and 10 males with a mean age of 35 years (range; 8 months to 81 years). Fifteen of 17 patients (where data were available) had a favorable outcome following early serological diagnosis and initiation of definitive antibiotic therapy with (N=6) or without (N=9) immunosuppressive/immunomodulator therapy. Mutation analysis for primary HLH was performed in one patient only, and HLH-2004 protocol was used in two patients.
   Conclusion: We suggest that HLH should be considered in severe cases of scrub typhus especially if associated with cytopenia (s), liver dysfunction, and coagulation abnormalities. Further studies are required to understand whether an immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulator therapy could be beneficial in those patients who remain unresponsive to definitive antibiotic therapy.

AB  - Filicide-suicide is a special category of homicide-suicide event where the victim(s) are children and the perpetrator is one of the parents or both. It is not extensively documented or adequately defined in literature. In developed countries, shooting is a common method of homicide and suicide. Uses of knives, blunt objects, strangulation, poisoning and drowning are other methods frequently employed by the perpetrator. Homicide by hanging in filicide-suicide is rarely reported in forensic literature. We present a rare case of filicide-suicide, where the mother killed both her children by hanging them one by one from a ceiling fan in the same room and later committed suicide by hanging in another room.

AB  - Intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and participate in diverse cellular processes including host-pathogen interactions. ICAM-1 is expressed on various cell types including macrophages, whereas ICAM-4 is restricted to red blood cells. Here we report the identification of an 11-kDa synthetic protein, M5, that binds to human ICAM-1 and ICAM-4, as shown by in vitro interaction studies, surface plasmon resonance and immunolocalization. M5 greatly inhibits the invasion of macrophages and erythrocytes by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum, respectively. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated inhibition of ICAM-1 expression also results in reduced M. tuberculosis invasion of macrophages. ICAM-4 binds to P. falciparum merozoites, and the addition of recombinant ICAM-4 to parasite cultures blocks invasion of erythrocytes by newly released merozoites. Our results indicate that ICAM-1 and ICAM-4 play roles in host cell invasion by M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum, respectively, either as receptors or as crucial accessory molecules.

AB  - Background
   In experimental studies, the outcome of bacterial meningitis has been related to the severity of inflammation in the subarachnoid space. Corticosteroids reduce this inflammatory response.
   Objectives
   To examine the effect of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy versus placebo on mortality, hearing loss and neurological sequelae in people of all ages with acute bacterial meningitis.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 4, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to February 2015), Web of Science (2010 to February 2015), CINAHL (2010 to February 2015) and LILACS (2010 to February 2015).
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for acute bacterial meningitis.
   Data collection and analysis
   We scored RCTs for methodological quality. We collected outcomes and adverse effects. We performed subgroup analyses for children and adults, causative organisms, low-income versus high-income countries, time of steroid administration and study quality.
   Main results
   We included 25 studies involving 4121 participants (2511 children and 1517 adults; 93 mixed population). Four studies were of high quality with no risk of bias, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality, indicating a moderate risk of bias for the total analysis. Nine studies were performed in low-income countries and 16 in high-income countries.
   Corticosteroids were associated with a non-significant reduction in mortality (17.8% versus 19.9%; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.01, P value = 0.07). A similar non-significant reduction in mortality was observed in adults receiving corticosteroids (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.05, P value = 0.09). Corticosteroids were associated with lower rates of severe hearing loss (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88), any hearing loss (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87) and neurological sequelae (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00).
   Subgroup analyses for causative organisms showed that corticosteroids reduced mortality in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) meningitis (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98), but not in Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) orNeisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) meningitis. Corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss in children with H. influenzae meningitis (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.59) but not in children with meningitis due to non-Haemophilus species.
   In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.73), any hearing loss (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73) and short-term neurological sequelae (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.85). There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries.
   Subgroup analysis for study quality showed no effect of corticosteroids on severe hearing loss in high-quality studies.
   Corticosteroid treatment was associated with an increase in recurrent fever (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47), but not with other adverse events.
   Authors' conclusions
   Corticosteroids significantly reduced hearing loss and neurological sequelae, but did not reduce overall mortality. Data support the use of corticosteroids in patients with bacterial meningitis in high-income countries. We found no beneficial effect in low-income countries.

AB  - Background: Dengue infection is a major public health problem. During explosive outbreaks, there is sudden surge in demands of platelet products. The present study was carried out in order to review platelet transfusion practices during the epidemic of dengue. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical details including the platelet counts and haemorrhagic tendencies of dengue patients as well as the transfusion requirements of diagnosed dengue cases admitted at our centre. Results: A total of 1,750 random donor platelet and 114 single donor platelet units were transfused to 531 patients. 23.2% platelet transfusions were found to be inappropriate Mean dosage of platelets transfused was 2 x 10(11) platelets per patient. A total of 347 (65.3%) patients had bleeding diathesis at the time of presentation. Skin and the oropharynx were the most common bleeding sites. Major bleeding was seen in 119 (34.3%) patients, whereas 228 (65.7%) patients had minor bleeding episodes. Conclusion: The study emphasises the need for minimising unnecessary transfusions and for using this scarce resource judiciously, which can be achieved by strict adherence to evidence-based transfusion guidelines and regular review of the on-going transfusion practices.

AB  - To analyze differences in morphokinetic parameters of chromosomally normal and aneuploid embryos utilizing time-lapse imaging and CGH microarray analysis.
   This retrospective cohort study included patients undergoing IVF treatment and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for sex selection. A total of 460 embryos cultured in incubators with time-lapse imaging system (EmbryoScope) were selected for biopsy on day 3 of development. Subsequently, CGH microarray analysis was performed for aneuploidy screening of 24 chromosomes. Kinetic parameters including time for appearance of second polar body (tPB2), time of pronuclei appearance (tPNa), time of pronuclei fading (tPBf), time to division to 2(t2), 3(t3), 4(t4), 5(t5) cells, length of second and third cell cycle (CC2= t3 t2, CC3=t5-t3), synchrony of cell division from 2 to 4 cells (S2=t4-t3) and interval t5-t2 were analyzed to compare chromosomally normal and abnormal embryos.
   The mean time durations for tPNf, t2, t5, CC2, CC3, t5-t2 differed significantly between normal and abnormal embryos.
   Time-lapse imaging morphokinetics may play a role in early prediction of aneuploid embryos due to differences in kinetic behavior that may aid in improving clinical outcome.

AB  - This paper summarizes the panel discussion at the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Point-of-Care Healthcare Technology Conference (POCHT 2013) held in Bangalore India from Jan 16-18, 2013. Modern medicine has witnessed interdisciplinary technology innovations in healthcare with a continuous growth in life expectancy across the globe. However, there is also a growing global concern on the affordability of rapidly rising healthcare costs. To provide quality healthcare at reasonable costs, there has to be a convergence of preventive, personalized, and precision medicine with the help of technology innovations across the entire spectrum of point-of-care (POC) to critical care at hospitals. The first IEEE EMBS Special Topic POCHT conference held in Bangalore, India provided an international forum with clinicians, healthcare providers, industry experts, innovators, researchers, and students to define clinical needs and technology solutions toward commercialization and translation to clinical applications across different environments and infrastructures. This paper presents a summary of discussions that took place during the keynote presentations, panel discussions, and breakout sessions on needs, challenges, and technology innovations in POC technologies toward improving global healthcare. Also presented is an overview of challenges and trends in developing and developed economies with respect to priority clinical needs, technology innovations in medical devices, translational engineering, information and communication technologies, infrastructure support, and patient and clinician acceptance of POC healthcare technologies.

AB  - Two-hundred MRSA strains from inpatients with healthcare-associated (HA) and 100 MRSA strains from outpatients with community-associated (CA) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) toxin, seh and arcA genes. Based on SCCmec typing, HA-MRSA isolates were further divided into HA-SCCmec I/II/III MRSA and HA-SCCmec IV/V MRSA, and CA-MRSA isolates into CA-SCCmec I/II/III MRSA and CA-SCCmec IV/V MRSA. SCCmec types were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa typing and multi-locus sequence typing. Seventy-five (37.5%) HA-MRSA isolates and 83/100 CA-MRSA isolates were SCCmec IV/V genotype. HA-SCCmec IV/V MRSA was associated with malignancy (P=0.03) and bone fractures (P=0.02) compared to CA-SCCmec IV/V MRSA. HA-SCCmec IV/V MRSA was associated with PVL gene carriage compared to HA-SCCmec I/II/III MRSA (P<0.001). ST22-MRSA-IV (EMRSA-15), ST772-MRSA-V, and ST36-MRSA-IV and ST239: EMRSA-I:III were the major clones identified. Our study documents the emergence of SCCmec IV and SCCmec V MRSA clones in an Indian hospital.

AB  - Primary renal lymphoma (PRL) is a rare disease. We here present the case of an 8-year-old child who presented with bilateral renal masses. On biopsy, it was confirmed to be B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) for staging demonstrated F-18-FDG avid bilateral renal masses, with no other abnormal focus. Follow up F-18-FDG PET/CT showed complete resolution of the disease after six cycles of chemotherapy. Here we have highlighted the potential role of F-18-FDG PET/CT in staging and response evaluation of a patient with PRL and presented a brief review. (C) 2014 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and SEMNIM.

AB  - The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic was forecasted through 2030 for 15 countries, and the relative impact of two scenarios was considered: (i) increased treatment efficacy while holding the treated population constant and (ii) increased treatment efficacy and increased annual treated population. Increasing levels of diagnosis and treatment, in combination with improved treatment efficacy, were critical for achieving substantial reductions in disease burden. In most countries, the annual treated population had to increase several fold to achieve the largest reductions in HCV-related morbidity and mortality. This suggests that increased capacity for screening and treatment will be critical in many countries. Birth cohort screening is a helpful tool for maximizing resources. In most of the studied countries, the majority of patients were born between 1945 and 1985.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes of Cultivated Limbal Epithelial Transplantation: Evaluation and Comparison of Results in Children and Adults
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
KW  - STEM-CELLS
AB  - Purpose. To compare the long-term clinical outcomes of cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) in children and adults with limbal stem cell deficiency. Design. Retrospective case series. Methods. Case records of patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) who underwent CLET from April 2004 to December 2014 were studied. Outcome measures were compared in terms of anatomical success and visual improvement. Parameters for total anatomical success were avascular, epithelized, and clinically stable corneal surface without conjunctivalization, whereas partial anatomical success was considered when mild vascularization (sparing centre of cornea) and mild conjunctivalization were noted along with complete epithelization. Results. A total of 62 cases underwent the CLET procedure: 38 (61.3%) were children and 24 (38.7%) were adults. Patients with unilateral LSCD (33 children and 21 adults) had autografts and those with bilateral LSCD (5 children and 3 adults) had allografts. Amongst the 54 autografts partial and total anatomical success were noted in 21.2% and 66.6% children, respectively, and 19.0% and 80.9% in adults, respectively (p value 0.23). Visual improvement of 1 line and >= 2 lines was seen in 57.5% and 21.2% children, respectively, and 38% and 38% in adults, respectively (p value 0.31). Conclusion. Cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation gives good long-term results in patients with LSCD and the outcomes are comparable in children and adults.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify the prognostic factors predicting remission and subsequent disease relapse in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) greater than 60 years of age.
   Materials and Methods: The institute thyroid cancer database had 4370 patients with DTC, of which 447 (10%) were aged > 60. However, 9 patients were excluded due to follow-up less than 1 year. The prognostic factors in the remaining 438 patients were studied.
   Results: Among the 438 patients, 311 (71%) had only loco-regional disease (M-0) and 127 (29%) had distant metastases (M-1) at the time of initial presentation. The host factors predictive of distant metastases at presentation were female gender, primary tumor size (>4 cm), follicular histology, and extra-thyroidal extension. Among M-0 patients, 195 (63%) achieved complete remission while only 12 (9%) M-1 patients did so. Average number of radioactive iodine (I-131) doses administered to achieve complete remission was 2.3 (range, 1-6) and the mean cumulative dose was 3404 MBq (range, 925-46,250 MBq). In multivariate logistic regression among M-0 patients, follicular histology, nodal metastases, and surgical treatment lesser than total/near-total thyroidectomy and among M-1 patients, site of distant metastases (skeletal and multiple sites) were independent factors predicting non-remission. Among the patients (both M-0 and M-1) who achieved remission, factors associated with disease recurrence were primary tumor size (>4 cm), nodal metastases, pulmonary metastases, and non-remission after first dose of radioactive iodine and were associated with greater chances of disease relapse.
   Conclusion: This study highlights that DTC in older patients behaves more aggressively than in adults age < 60 years, and identifies several prognostic factors for remission and subsequent relapse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infection with dengue virus (DENV) is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. The clinical spectrum of dengue, caused by any of the four serotypes of DENV, ranges from mild self-limiting dengue fever to severe dengue, in the form dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Increased rates of hospitalization due to severe dengue, during outbreaks, result in massive economic losses and strained health services. In the absence of specific antiviral therapy, control of transmission of DENV by vector management is the sole method available for decreasing dengue-associated morbidity. Since vector control strategies alone have not been able to satisfactorily achieve reduction in viral transmission, the implementation of a safe, efficacious and cost-effective dengue vaccine as a supplementary measure is a high public health priority. However, the unique and complex immunopathology of dengue has complicated vaccine development. Dengue vaccines have also been challenged by critical issues like lack of animal models for the disease and absence of suitable markers of protective immunity. Although no licensed dengue vaccine is yet available, several vaccine candidates are under phases of development, including live attenuated virus vaccines, live chimeric virus vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines and viral-vectored vaccines. Although some vaccine candidates have progressed from animal trials to phase II and III in humans, a number of issues regarding implementation of dengue vaccine in countries like India still need to be addressed. Despite the current limitations, collaborative effects of regulatory bodies like World Health Organization with vaccine manufacturers and policy makers, to facilitate vaccine development and standardize field trials can make a safe and efficacious dengue vaccine a reality in near future.

AB  - Introduction: Candida species are the major fungal pathogens of humans. Among them, Candida krusei have emerged as a notable pathogen with a spectrum of clinical manifestations and is known to develop resistance against azoles mainly fluconazole. Anti-microbial peptides play important roles in the early mucosal defence against infection and are potent anti-fungal agents since they fight against fungal infection as well as have ability to regulate host immune defence system. The aim of the study was to synthesize a small anti fungal peptide. Materials and Methods: The series of tripeptides were synthesized and screened for antifungal activity against Candida strains according to CLSI guidelines. Toxicity effect of peptide was tested with human erythrocytes. The mode of action of peptide on fungus was resolved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies Results: The tripeptide FAR showed a prominent anti fungal activity among the series. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of tripeptide FAR was found to be 171.25 mu g/ml and 685 mu g/ml, respectively against Candida krusei. The therapeutic index was 2.9. The haemolytic experiment revealed that this peptide is non - toxic to human cells. The SEM studies showed disruption of cell wall and bleb-like surface changes and irregular cell surface. Conclusion: The peptide showed a significant antifungal activity against C. krusei. Thus, it can set a platform for the design of new effective therapeutic agents against C. krusei.

AB  - Labeo rohita (rohu) is one of the most important freshwater carps widely cultured in India, Bangladesh and other adjacent countries in the region. Proteomic analysis from liver tissue samples of riverine L. rohita was carried out with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE). On an average 450 spots were detected in a colloidal Coomassie stained 2-DE gel using PDQuest software. Forty two spots with high abundance and clear separation were selected from the gel and twelve of them were later analyzed with Electronspray Ionization (ESI) - Mass Spectrometry and identified by MASCOT search. The paper describes first attempt for protein profiling of liver tissue samples of L. rohita based on protocol standardized in our lab for optimized yield of total protein as well as 2-D electrophoresis.

TI  - Xanthoma Disseminatum Associated with Inflammatory Arthritis and Synovitis-A Rare Association
T2  - PEDIATRIC DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Xanthoma disseminatum (XD) is a rare, benign, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by disseminated xanthomatous lesions with a predilection for the face, flexures, and mucosae. Approximately 100 cases have been reported in the literature. We report XD in an 8-year-old boy with symmetric synovitis and arthritis involving the wrists and knees. This case is interesting in view of the association between arthritis and synovitis and XD, which to our knowledge has not been reported in the literature. This case has to be differentiated from multicentric histiocytosis, another non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, in which joint involvement is common.

AB  - Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, was approved for seasonal flu by US Food and Drug Administration in 1999. A number of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis emphasized a favorable efficacy and safety profile. Majority of them were funded by Roche, which also first marketed and promoted this drug. In 2005 and 2009, the looming fear of pandemic flu led to recommendation by prominent regulatory bodies such as World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Medicines Agency and others for its use in treatment and prophylaxis of influenza, and its stockpiling as a measure to tide over the crisis. Serious Adverse Events, especially neuropsychiatric events associated with Tamiflu started getting reported leading to a cascade of questions on clinical utility of this drug. A recent Cochrane review and related articles have questioned the risk-benefit ratio of the drug, besides raising doubts about the regulatory decision of approving it. The recommendations for stockpiling the said drug as given by various international organizations viz WHO have also been put to scrutiny. Although many reviewers have labeled the Tamiflu saga as a "costly mistake," the episode leaves us with some important lessons. This article takes a comprehensive relook on the subject, and we proceed to suggest some ways and means to avoid a similar situation in the future.

AB  - Background: Neonatal illness is a leading cause of death worldwide; sepsis is one of the main contributors. The etiologies of community-acquired neonatal bacteremia in developing countries have not been well characterized.
   Methods: Infants < 2 months of age brought with illness to selected health facilities in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ghana, India, Pakistan and South Africa were evaluated, and blood cultures taken if they were considered ill enough to be admitted to hospital. Organisms were isolated using standard culture techniques.
   Results: Eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine infants were recruited, including 3177 0-6 days of age and 5712 7-59 days of age; 10.7% (947/8889) had a blood culture performed. Of those requiring hospital management, 782 (54%) had blood cultures performed. Probable or definite pathogens were identified in 10.6% including 10.4% of newborns 0-6 days of age (44/424) and 10.9% of infants 7-59 days of age (39/358). Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated species (36/83, 43.4%) followed by various species of Gram-negative bacilli (39/83, 46.9%; Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. were the most common organisms). Resistance to second and third generation cephalosporins was present in more than half of isolates and 44% of the Gram-negative isolates were gentamicin-resistant. Mortality rates were similar in hospitalized infants with positive (5/71, 7.0%) and negative blood cultures (42/557, 7.5%).
   Conclusions: This large study of young infants aged 0-59 days demonstrated a broad array of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens responsible for community-acquired bacteremia and substantial levels of antimicrobial resistance. The role of S. aureus as a pathogen is unclear and merits further investigation.

AB  - In the current study, we have evaluated the performance of magnetic resonance (MR) T1rho (T-1 rho) imaging and CSF biomarkers (T-tau, P-tau and A beta-42) in characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and control subjects. With informed consent, AD (n = 27), MCI (n = 17) and control (n = 17) subjects underwent a standardized clinical assessment and brain MRI on a 1.5-T clinical-scanner. T-1 rho images were obtained at four different spin-lock pulse duration (10, 20, 30 and 40 ms). T-1 rho maps were generated by pixel-wise fitting of signal intensity as a function of the spin-lock pulse duration. T-1 rho values from gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of medial temporal lobe were calculated. The binary logistic regression using T-1 rho and CSF biomarkers as variables was performed to classify each group. T-1 rho was able to predict 77.3% controls and 40.0% MCI while CSF biomarkers predicted 81.8% controls and 46.7% MCI. T-1 rho and CSF biomarkers in combination predicted 86.4% controls and 66.7% MCI. When comparing controls with AD, T-1 rho predicted 68.2% controls and 73.9% AD, while CSF biomarkers predicted 77.3% controls and 78.3% for AD. Combination of T-1 rho and CSF biomarkers improved the prediction rate to 81.8% for controls and 82.6% for AD. Similarly, on comparing MCI with AD, T-1 rho predicted 35.3% MCI and 81.9% AD, whereas CSF biomarkers predicted 53.3% MCI and 83.0% AD. Collectively CSF biomarkers and T-1 rho were able to predict 59.3% MCI and 84.6% AD. On receiver operating characteristic analysis T-1 rho showed higher sensitivity while CSF biomarkers showed greater specificity in delineating MCI and AD from controls. No significant correlation between T-1 rho and CSF biomarkers, between T-1 rho and age, and between CSF biomarkers and age was observed. The combined use of T-1 rho and CSF biomarkers have promise to improve the early and specific diagnosis of AD. Furthermore, disease progression form MCI to AD might be easily tracked using these two parameters in combination. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) helps to optimize the dose of antiepileptic drugs. Only limited information is available about the clinical utility of TDM of antiepileptic drugs in India. Hence, we aimed to study the clinical utility of antiepileptic TDM in a tertiary care hospital in India and to explore the association between the plasma drug levels and the occurrence of breakthrough seizures and drug toxicity.
   Methods: All patients taking antiepileptic drugs for whom TDM was done from January 2008 to December 2010 were included in the study. All relevant information was obtained from patient medical records. Trough levels were measured for all drugs using chemiluminescence assay. Drug levels were interpreted as within, below, and above the reference range, as recommended by the International League Against Epilepsy guidelines.
   Results: Of the 420 samples analyzed during this period, 396 samples were included in this study for analysis. The maximum number of requests was for phenytoin (50%) followed by valproic acid (26%). The most common indication for TDM was dosage adjustment (38%) followed by breakthrough seizures (34%). Among the 135 samples received with breakthrough seizures as indication, more than 50% had drug levels either within or above the reference range. Among the 62 samples referred with clinical symptoms of suspected toxicity, drug levels were above the reference range in only 52% of the samples.
   Conclusions: Therapeutic drug monitoring was found to be useful in practice, in tailoring drug dosage in accordance with the needs of individual patient, in distinguishing nonresponders from noncompliants, and in aiding in making critical decisions. However, the "reference range" of these antiepileptic drugs was not reliable in predicting the occurrence of breakthrough seizures and clinical symptoms of suspected drug toxicity.

AB  - Morbidity and mortality attributable to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are increasing in many countries as the infected population ages. Models were developed for 15 countries to quantify and characterize the viremic population, as well as estimate the number of new infections and HCV related deaths from 2013 to 2030. Expert consensus was used to determine current treatment levels and outcomes in each country. In most countries, viremic prevalence has already peaked. In every country studied, prevalence begins to decline before 2030, when current treatment levels were held constant. In contrast, cases of advanced liver disease and liver related deaths will continue to increase through 2030 in most countries. The current treatment paradigm is inadequate if large reductions in HCV related morbidity and mortality are to be achieved.

AB  - Background: Some infectious agents have been shown to be human carcinogens. The current study focused on estimation of cancer burden attributable to infection in different regions of Asia.
   Methods: By systematically reviewing previous studies of the infection prevalence data of 13 countries in Asia and relative risks of specific cancers, we calculated the population attributable fraction of carcinogenic infections. Using data from GLOBOCAN 2012, the overall country-specific and gender-specific number of new cancer cases and deaths resulting from infection were estimated.
   Results: Across 13 principal Asian countries, the average prevalence and range was 6.6% (0.5% in Japanese women to 15.0% in Vietnamese men) for hepatitis B virus (HBV), 2.6% (0.3% in Iran to 5.1% in Saudi Arabia) for hepatitis C virus (HCV), 7.9% (2.8% in Pakistan to 17.7% in China) for human papillomavirus (HPV), and 61.8% (12.8% in Indonesia to 91.7% in Bangladesh) for Helicobacter pylori (HP). The estimated total number of cancer cases and deaths caused by infection in these 13 countries were 1 212 026 (19.6% of all new cancer cases) and 908 549 (22.0% of all deaths from cancer). The fractions of cancer incidence attributable to infection were 19.7% and 19.5% in men and women, respectively. The percentages of cancer deaths attributable to infection were 21.9% and 22.1% in men and women, respectively. Among the main infectious agents, HP was responsible for 31.5% of infection-related cancer cases and 32.8% of infection-related cancer deaths, followed by HBV (28.6% of new cases and 23.8% of deaths), HPV (22.0% of new cases and 27.3% of deaths), and HCV (12.2% of new cases and 10.6% of deaths).
   Conclusions: Approximately one quarter of all cancer cases and deaths were infection-associated in Asia, which could be effectively prevented if appropriate long-term controls of infectious agents were applied.

AB  - Background: Valproate is a commonly used anticonvulsant drug. Uridine 5'-diphospho (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) contributes to around 50% of valproate metabolism and its polymorphisms may be important for explaining the considerable variation in valproate levels in patients with epilepsy.
   Aim: This study was aimed to analyze the genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A6 in Indian children with epilepsy and their potential influence on the pharmacokinetics of valproate.
   Setting and Design: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Pediatrics, All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, between March 2011 and July 2012.
   Materials and Methods: Children aged 3-12 years diagnosed with epilepsy on valproate monotherapy for at least 1 month were enrolled. They underwent a detailed clinical examination. The UGT1A6 polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Random samples were checked by genetic sequencing. The steady-state plasma concentrations of valproate were measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and associated with UGT1A6 polymorphisms.
   Results: A total of 80 children were studied. The prevalence of UGT1A6 T19G was as follows: TT (45%), TG (38.8%), and GG (16.3%); that of UGT1A6 A541G was: AA (48.8%), AG (38.8%), and GG (12.5%); and that of UGT1A6 A552C was: AA (43.8%), AC (40%), and CC (16.3%). The association between valproate doses or standardized serum valproate concentration and the various UGT1A6 genotypes could not be studied reliably in this small study population.
   Conclusions: The frequencies of UGT1A6 geneotypes and alleles were reported in the study population.

AB  - Background
   Bronchiolitis is one of the most frequent causes of respiratory failure in infants; some infants will require intensive care and mechanical ventilation. There is lack of evidence regarding effective treatment for bronchiolitis other than supportive care. Abnormalities of surfactant quantity or quality (or both) have been observed in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Exogenous surfactant administration appears to favourably change the haemodynamics of the lungs and may be a potentially promising therapy for severe bronchiolitis. This is an update of a review published in Issue 9, 2012. We did not identify any new studies for inclusion, and our conclusions remain unchanged.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy of exogenous surfactant administration (i.e. intratracheal administration of surfactant of any type (whether animal-derived or synthetic), at any dose and at any time after start of ventilation) compared to placebo, no intervention or standard care in reducing mortality and the duration of ventilation in infants and children with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1948 to June week 3, 2015); EMBASE (1974 to June 2015); CINAHL (1982 to June 2015); LILACS (1985 to June 2015); and Web of Science (1985 to June 2015).
   Selection criteria
   We considered prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effect of exogenous surfactant in infants and children with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors selected studies independently. We extracted the data using a predefined proforma, independently analysed the data, and performed meta-analyses.
   Main results
   We included three small RCTs enrolling 79 participants. Two trials did not use a placebo in the control arms and the third trial used air placebo. Two included studies reported no mortality. We judged all three of the included studies to be at low risk or unclear risk across all risk of bias categories; we did not judge any of the studies to be at high risk of bias in any category. Our pooled analysis of the three trials revealed that duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different between the groups (mean difference (MD) -63.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) -130.43 to 4.35 hours) but duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was less in the surfactant group compared to the control group: MD -3.31, 95% CI -6.38 to -0.25 days. After excluding one trial which produced significant heterogeneity, the duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU stay were significantly lower in the surfactant group compared to the control group: MD -28.99, 95% CI -40.10 to -17.87 hours; and MD -1.81, 95% CI -2.42 to -1.19 days, respectively. Use of surfactant had favourable effects on oxygenation and CO2 elimination. No adverse effects and no complications were observed in any of the three included studies. The level of evidence for duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of intensive care unit stay, oxygenation parameters, and carbon dioxide parameters was of moderate quality.
   Authors' conclusions
   Use of surfactant had favourable effects on duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay, oxygenation, and CO2 elimination. However, the studies are few and small (n = 79) so available evidence is insufficient to establish the effectiveness of surfactant therapy for bronchiolitis in critically ill infants who require mechanical ventilation. There is a need for larger trials with adequate power and a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of exogenous surfactant therapy for infants with bronchiolitis who require intensive care management.

AB  - Background
   Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with an approximate prevalence of 1 in 3500 live births. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillus-induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole. The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects. The monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics. The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using anti-IgE antibodies. Therefore, anti-IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of anti-IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books.
   We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 27 July 2015.
   We searched the ongoing trial registry clinicaltrials.gov for any ongoing trials. Latest search for clinicaltrials.gov: 23 October 2015.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing anti-IgE therapy to placebo or other therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager.
   Main results
   Only one study enrolling 14 participants was eligible for inclusion in the review. The double-blind study compared a daily dose of 600 mg omalizumab or placebo along with twice daily itraconazole and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment lasted six months but the study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available. We contacted the study investigator and were told that the study was terminated due to the inability to recruit participants into the study despite all reasonable attempts. One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) participants in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti-IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is a need for large prospective randomized controlled studies of anti-IgE therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with both clinical and laboratory outcome measures such as steroid requirement, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations and lung function.

AB  - Background
   Acute bronchiolitis is one of the most frequent causes of emergency department visits and hospitalisation in infants. There is no specific treatment for bronchiolitis except for supportive therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is supposed to widen the peripheral airways of the lung, allowing deflation of over-distended lungs in bronchiolitis. The increase in airway pressure also prevents the collapse of poorly supported peripheral small airways during expiration. In observational studies, CPAP is found to be beneficial in acute bronchiolitis.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy and safety of CPAP compared to no CPAP or sham CPAP in infants and children up to three years of age with acute bronchiolitis.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to April 2014), CINAHL (1981 to April 2014) and LILACS (1982 to April 2014).
   Selection criteria
   We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTS, cross-over RCTs and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data using a structured proforma, analysed the data and performed meta-analyses.
   Main results
   We included two studies with a total of 50 participants under 12 months of age. In one study there was a high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting, and both studies had an unclear risk of bias for several domains including random sequence generation. The effect of CPAP on the need for mechanical ventilation in children with acute bronchiolitis was uncertain due to imprecision around the effect estimate (two RCTs, 50 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.63; low quality evidence). Neither trial measured our other primary outcome of time to recovery. One trial found that CPAP significantly improved respiratory rate compared with no CPAP (one RCT, 19 participants; mean difference (MD) -5.70 breaths per minute, 95% CI -9.30 to -2.10), although the other study reported no difference between groups with no numerical data to pool. Change in arterial oxygen saturation was measured in only one trial and the results were imprecise (one RCT, 19 participants; MD-1.70%, 95% CI -3.76 to 0.36). The effect of CPAP on the change in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) was also imprecise (two RCTs, 50 participants; MD -2.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.29 to 0.05; low quality evidence). Duration of hospital stay was similar in both of the groups (two RCTs, 50 participants; MD 0.07 days, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.50; low quality evidence). Both trials reported no cases of pneumothorax and there were no deaths in either study. Change in partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)), hospital admission rate (from emergency department to hospital), duration of emergency department stay, need for intensive care unit admission, local nasal effects and shock were not measured in either study.
   Authors' conclusions
   The effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis is uncertain due to the limited evidence available. Larger trials with adequate power are needed to evaluate the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis.

AB  - Glycogen branching enzyme deficiency/Andersen disease can manifest with a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, making the diagnosis difficult. An 11-year-old Pakistani boy presented with a history of progressive weakness and delayed milestones. Echocardiography showed features of dilated cardiomyopathy. He was suspected to have congenital myopathy and was evaluated further. Muscle biopsy showed subsarcolemmal accumulation of basophilic material, which stained positively with Periodic acid-Schiff reagent (diastase-resistant). Ultrastructural examination revealed accumulation of structurally abnormal forms of filamentous glycogen, confirming the diagnosis as Andersen disease. As histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of muscle biopsies is not always diagnostic, ultrastructural examination may serve as a valuable adjunct in difficult cases.

AB  - Objective: Thrombocytopenia poses a significant problem in the elderly. Not only are there varied causes, but it is also associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We carried out a study to learn the causes of isolated thrombocytopenia in elderly patients and to correlate the severity of thrombocytopenia and bleeding manifestations with various etiologic factors and comorbidities.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 108 patients above 50 years of age presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet counts of <100x10(9)/L with normal hemoglobin and total leukocyte counts) were enrolled in the study. Detailed history and clinical examinations were carried out for each patient. Complete blood counts were analyzed by automated cell counter. Peripheral smears were examined in all cases. HbsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was done in all patients. Wherever clinically indicated, bone marrow aspiration biopsy and cytogenetic studies were done.
   Results: Out of 108 patients, 102 (94.4%) presented with bleeding tendencies. Twenty-nine (26.8%) presented with serious (World Health Organization grade 3/4) bleedings. Major findings were immune thrombocytopenic purpura in 79 (73.1%), myelodysplastic syndrome in 7 (6.5%), drug-induced thrombocytopenia in 7 (6.5%), and connective tissue disorder in 4 (3.7%) cases. Ten patients presented with intracranial bleedings. Upon logistic regression analysis, comorbidities in the form of essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with occurrence of intracranial bleeding. There was no correlation of serious bleedings with platelet counts.
   Conclusion: Isolated thrombocytopenia in the elderly is associated with significant morbidity. Diligent clinical and laboratory evaluation is required to elucidate the cause of thrombocytopenia in the elderly. Comorbidities in this population are associated with serious bleedings and not low platelet counts as is commonly thought.

AB  - Spinal hemangiopericytoma is a rare neoplasm that behaves similar to intracranial hemangiopericytoma, with approximately 60 cases being reported in the literature of which only 10 are located in the intradural extramedullary (IDEM) location.
   We report a rare case of recurrent IDEM hemangiopericytoma of dorsal spine in a 16-year-old boy treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy.
   Patient is disease free at 5 years posttreatment with residual neurological deficit, but is able to carry out his activities of daily living.
   Gross total resection, if feasible, followed by radiotherapy is the initial treatment of choice as radiotherapy improves recurrence free survival as well as overall survival.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a safe technique for in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in pediatric cataract patients who undergo lens aspiration with primary posterior capsulorhexis and anterior vitrectomy.
   Methods: Sixty eyes of 45 consecutive patients with congenital/developmental cataract underwent lens aspiration with primary posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (PCCC) with anterior vitrectomy and in-the-bag IOL implantation using the described technique of IOL implantation using anterior capsule as support.
   Results: All eyes had stable IOL at the end of surgery and none of the eyes had lens decentration/dislocation in posterior vitreous.
   Conclusions: Implantation of in-the-bag IOL is difficult in children who undergo primary PCCC with anterior vitrectomy. Our technique of implanting IOL by pushing it against the back surface of anterior capsule is a safe method and results in no complications related to faulty IOL implantation.

AB  - We estimate the contribution of influenza to hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in Kashmir, India. Prospective surveillance for influenza among patients hospitalized with AECOPD was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Patients had clinical data collected and nasal/throat swabs tested for influenza viruses. Outcomes among patients with and without influenza were compared with logistic regression adjusting for age and underlying conditions. During October 2010-September 2012, 498 patients hospitalized with AECOPD were enrolled, of whom 40 (8%) had received influenza vaccine. Forty (8%) had influenza; influenza virus detection peaked in winter (January-March). Patients with influenza were more likely to die during hospitalization (adjusted OR 34, CI 10-114) than those without.

AB  - Objective: To describe clinical profile, etiology and outcome in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Methods: A chart review of children diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, attending pediatric chest clinic of tertiary care hospital. Results: The underlying cause was identified in 51 (63.8%) out of 80 children. (mean age, 9.6 y). Common causes were post-infectious in 19 (23.8%), suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia in 12 (15%), and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in 6 (7.5%). One or more complications were observed in 76 (95%) patients; 14 (17.5%) children required surgery and 5 (11.1%) children died. Conclusions: Common causes of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis are post infectious and primary ciliary dyskinesia. There is a need to create awareness about early diagnosis of bronchiectasis as it is often delayed.

KW  - MORTALITY
AB  - Background: Stroke is a multifactorial disease and is influenced by complex environmental interactions. The contribution of various risk factors to the burden of stroke worldwide is not well known, particularly in developing countries. The present case-control study is aimed at exploring the association between a low socioeconomic status and the risk of ischemic stroke among the North Indian population. Methods: The study design was a hospital-based, case-control study. Age- and sex-matched controls were included. The demographic characteristics and risk factor variables were documented by means of a personal interview through a standardized case record form. The household asset index for determining the socioeconomic status (HAISS) was used for the assessment of the socioeconomic status of the population. HAISS was validated with the widely used Kuppus-wamy scale for measurement of socioeconomic status. The multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio associated with stroke. Results: In all, 224 ischemic stroke patients and 224 controls were recruited between February 2009 and February 2012. The mean age of cases and controls was 53.47 +/- 14 and 52.92 +/- 13.4, respectively. The low economic status was independently associated with the risk of ischemic stroke after adjustment for demographic and risk factor variables (OR 2.8; 95% Cl 1.2-6.3). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there is a significant association between a low socioeconomic status and the risk of ischemic stroke risk in North Indian population. Well-designed studies embedded with long-term prospective cohorts are required for confirming the results. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Glutathione sensitive polymeric nanoparticles composed of poly(ester-urethane) and (-PCL-PEG-PCL-urethane-ss-) random multiblock copolymers with multiple disulfide linkages were developed for targeted doxorubicin delivery in cancer. The multiblock copolymers were synthesized via ring opening polymerization (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone by polyethylene glycol followed by isomerization polymerization with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) content of similar to 20% in the multiblock copolymers led to the formation of nanoparticles with size similar to 80 nm. A high doxorubicin loading content of similar to 26% was achieved in the polymeric nanoparticles. Disulfide linkages in the multiblock copolymers facilitate nanoparticle degradation by glutathione (GSH), resulting in intracellular drug release. Drug release studies confirmed the glutathione sensitive nature of polymeric nano-systems by achieving similar to 80% drug release at pH 5.5 in the presence of 10 mM GSH concentration as compared to similar to 19% at pH 7.4. In vitro studies in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and BT474) showed a similar to 20 fold increase in cellular uptake efficiency of dual targeted nanoparticles with a subsequent higher apoptosis as compared to non-targeted polymeric nanoparticles. In vivo studies in Ehrlich's ascites tumor (EAT) bearing Swiss albino mice showed a superior tumor regression of similar to 89% as compared to free doxorubicin (similar to 42%) without any significant toxicity. These promising results show the potential of the above synthesized multiblock copolymeric nanosystem as a drug delivery nanocarrier in cancer therapeutics with an enhanced antitumor efficacy and a reduced toxicity.

AB  - Background & objectives: In the traditional system of medicine in India Ashwagandha powder and Sidh Makardhwaj have been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, safety and efficacy of this treatment have not been evaluated. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic treatment (Ashwagandha powder and Sidh Makardhwaj) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty five patients with joint pain were screened at an Ayurvedic hospital in New Delhi, India. Eighty six patients satisfied inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Detailed medical history and physical examination were recorded. Patients took 5g of Ashwagandha powder twice a day for three weeks with lukewarm water or milk. Sidh Makardhwaj (100 mg) with honey was administered daily for the next four weeks. The follow up of patients was carried out every two weeks. The primary efficacy end point was based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response. Secondary end points were ACR50, ACR70 responses, change from baseline in disease activity score (DAS) 28 score and ACR parameters. Safety assessments were hepatic function [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and beta 2 microglobulin], renal function (urea and creatinine and NGAL) tests and urine mercury level.
   Results: The study was completed by 90.7 per cent (78/86) patients. Patients with moderate and high disease activity were 57.7 per cent (45/78) and 42.3 per cent (33/78), respectively. All patients were tested positive for rheumatoid factor and increased ESR level. Ashwagandha and Sidh Makardhwaj treatment decreased RA factor. A significant change in post-treatment scores of tender joint counts, swollen joint counts, physician global assessment score, patient global assessment score, pain assessment score, patient self assessed disability index score and ESR level were observed as compared to baseline scores. ACR20 response was observed in 56.4 per cent (44/78) patients (American College of Rheumatology criteria) and moderate response in 39.74 per cent (31/78) patients [European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria]. Ayurvedic treatment for seven weeks in rheumatoid arthritis patients showed normal kidney and liver function tests. However, increased urinary mercury levels were was observed after treatment.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest that this Ayurvedic treatment (Ashwagandha powder and Sidh Makardhwaj) has a potential to be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, due to small sample size, short duration, non randomization and lack of a control group as study limitations, further studies need to be done to confirm these findings.

   Material and Methods: The flexural and fracture strength of three-unit FRC FPDs were evaluated using three design preparations of the abutments (conventional full crown [group A], box-shaped [group B], and tub-shaped [group C]). Thirty three-unit FRC FPDs were fabricated (10 specimens per group) for the replacement of missing mandibular first molars and were adhesively luted to extracted human teeth. The flexural and fracture strength were determined using a universal testing machine with a steel loading pin of 20 mm diameter with a 3-mm-diameter hardened circular tip. Each specimen was evaluated under SEM to determine mode of failure.
   Results: Mean fracture strength for group A was 820.00 +/- 56.51 N, group B was 536.94 +/- 65.62 N, and group C was 501.24 +/- 66.71 N. The highest mean flexural strength was found in group A (68.33 +/- 4.71 MPa), followed by group B (44.74 +/- 5.46 MPa) and lowest in group C (41.77 +/- 5.56 MPa). The SEM evaluation showed partial or complete debonding of veneering composite from fiber framework, leaving intact fiber frameworks in all the specimens.
   Conclusion: Full-coverage design had significantly higher flexural and fracture strengths than box and tub-shaped designs. Since both values were noted to be in the order of masticatory stresses, the full coverage design is a good alternative for the replacement of missing molar teeth; however, the framework veneering composite interface was the weakest phase of FRC FPDs, thus indicating that further improvement in veneering composite or fiber framework is needed to improve the compatibility of veneering composite with that of fiber framework for long-term clinical implications.

AB  - Antibody targeted cytoplasmic delivery of drugs is difficult to achieve as antigen-antibody interaction results in the payload being directed to the endosomal compartment. However, Sendai viral envelopes can bring about cytoplasmic delivery due to F-protein mediated membrane fusion. In this study we have generated and fused a recombinant scFv directed to the onco-fetal antigen, the Placental isozyme of Alkaline Phosphatase (PAP) with the trans-membrane and part of the cytoplasmic domain of the Sendai F protein (F-TMC). Reconstituted virosomes, having both the fusion protein as well as the native F-protein were able to specifically bind and deliver drugs to PAP expressing cells. About 75% of the delivery was cytoplasmic in nature. Hence, this immuno-virosome, which is devoid of the comparatively more toxic HN protein, has the novel ability to combine specific antibody mediated targeting with cytoplasmic delivery. The scFv ensured specific binding to PAP expressing cells, without cross reacting with the other isozymes of alkaline phosphatase. The advantages of cytoplasmic delivery would include reduced degradation and lowered immunogenicity of the payload and carrier. The ubiquitous expression of PAP on a variety of cancers like seminoma, choriocarcinoma, cervical and breast cancers also suggests its potential usefulness in a number of malignancies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify the pain experienced by the patients in the Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) and to design an Electroencephalogram (EEG) based system which could monitor the pain in real time and display the quantified value as pain index. Research has established that the EEG from different lobes of brain can be used to find out individual indices for different components of balanced anaesthesia. In the present study, the focus was on analgesia. During the study, EEG of 31 patients was recorded from different regions of brain in the pre-operative (normal) and post-operative (painful) state. After analysis, it was observed that EEG parameters 'Hjorth Activity' and 'Spectral Entropy' from parietal region reflect the pain experienced by the patient during post-operative recovery period. Based on these parameters, a pain estimation system was developed which gave a numerical graded output between 0 and 10. This developed pain scale by analyzing EEG signals of the patients in the post operative period was correlated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and was found to be accurate to estimate the level of pain, when compared with the pain experienced by the patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) is a widely used integrated prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer. NPI has been correlated with tumor size, grade, lymph node stage and patient survival. The present study aimed at evaluating and correlating the various clinical and pathologic features of breast carcinoma with NPI. METHODS: This study included 100 consecutive cases of primary breast carcinoma over a period of 2 years. Demographic data was noted and histomorphological features like tumor size, grade, lymph node involvement, necrosis, vascular invasion etc., were assessed. NPI was calculated as reported in the literature. Immunohistochemical staining for hormone receptors and CD34 (to calculate microvessel density [MVD]) was performed. Statistical analysis was used for correlation. RESULTS: Of the 100 cases, 54% of the tumors were in T2 tumor size category (2-5 cm) and lymph node metastasis in 48% of the cases. NPI ranged from 2.3 to 7.3 with 54% of the cases in the intermediate NPI group (3.41-5.4). The mean MVD was 160.93 (+/- 69.4/mm(2)). On statistical analysis, tumor size and grade, lymph node stage, mitotic rate, nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and MVD showed a correlation with NPI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: NPI is an important and useful prognostic indicator for breast cancer patients, which shows the correlation with other histomorphological prognostic features as well.

AB  - Folic acid and trastuzumab functionalized pH responsive biodegradable polymeric nanosystem comprising of poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-poly(polyethylene glycol methacrylate)-poly(caprolactone)-poly(polyethylene glycol methacrylate)-poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) [PDMAEMA-PPEGMA-PCL-PPEGMA-PDMAEMA] was designed and developed for improving the chemotherapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin while minimizing its cardiotoxicity in breast cancer therapy. The nanosystem consists of multiple polyethylene glycol chains, which impart stealth nature to the nanoparticles. The polymer-doxorubicin conjugate via acid responsive hydrazone linkage resulted in enhanced doxorubicin release (similar to 89%) at endo-lysosomal pH when compared to that at physiological pH (similar to 29%). The nanoparticles also exhibited a proton sponge effect leading to endo-lysosomal escape of the nanoparticles, which resulted in minimal drug degradation and faster drug action. Folic acid and trastuzumab were incorporated in the nanosystem to selectively target breast cancer cells. In vitro and in vivo studies in breast cancer cell lines and Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing Swiss albino mice showed enhanced cellular uptake and improved therapeutic efficacy of the nanosystem with nanoparticles achieving similar to 92% tumor regression when compared to similar to 36% tumor regression observed with free doxorubicin. This enhanced therapeutic efficacy was achieved with minimal cardiotoxicity as observed in histopathology and blood biochemistry. The findings highlight the potential of the nanosystem in the chemotherapeutic management of breast cancer with its high therapeutic efficacy and minimal cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Until 1970s, celiac disease (CD) was considered to be an uncommon disease except in Western Europe. The global epidemiology of CD continues to evolve with improvement in the diagnostic tests, simplification of the diagnostic criteria and increase in awareness about the disease. The Asian region is currently at the crossroads of the frontier of knowledge and awareness of CD. In many Asian nations, CD is still considered to be either nonexistent or very rare. A notable exception is India, where CD has been well recognized, especially in the northern part, and 2 population-based studies have revealed a prevalence of 0.3-1.04%. Initial reports from Malaysia, China, Japan and Singapore suggest the existence of CD in these countries. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the predisposing factors predicts a high probability of occurrence of CD in fair numbers in China. There are no formal reports on CD from Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan and many other nations in this region. With the impending CD epidemic in Asia, there are many challenges. Some of the efforts which are required include determination of prevalence of CD across the region, spreading of awareness among physicians and patients, training of dieticians for proper counseling and supervision of patients, creation of gluten-free food infrastructure in the food supply and creation of patient advocacy organizations. Although the absolute number of patients with CD at present is not very large, this number is expected to increase over the next few years/decades. It is thus appropriate that the medical community across Asia define the extent of the problem and get prepared to handle the impending CD epidemic. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Purpose: To assess the efficacy of radiation in the treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA).
   Materials and Methods: Data were retrieved for JNA treated with radiotherapy from 1987-2012. The demographics, treatment and outcome data were recorded in predesigned proforma.
   Results: Data of 32 patients were retrieved. Median age was 17 years (range: 12-33 years). All patients received radiation because of refractory, residual or unresectable locally advanced disease. All patients were planned with a three-dimensional conformal technique (3DCRT). The median radiation dose was 30 Gray (range: 30-45 Gray). Median follow-up was 129 months (range: 1-276 months). At the last follow-up, 13 patients were found to have a radiological complete response. Two patients progressed 38 and 43 months after completion of treatment and opted for alternative treatment. One patient developed squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal ale 15 years after radiation.
   Conclusion: Conformal radiotherapy shows promise as an alternative treatment approach for locally advanced JNA and confers long-term disease control with minimal toxicity.

AB  - A rare R1a1 Y-haplogroup (Y-HG) L657 clade subtype designated as LPKSTR is found in most male members of a clan of "founder" families within the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community in Lotli town in Western India. TMRCA calculations using pairwise comparisons to control cohorts suggested a probable migration history distinct from the canonical narrative for medieval migration of orthodox Brahmin families to South India. Using Y-HG centroid analysis, chi-square analysis of TMRCA distributions and archeological find-spots, and discriminant function analysis we show that the parental Z93 L342.2 subclade in which LPKSTR occurs originated in West Asia and that LPKSTR individuals migrated toward the southeast by a Bolan Pass route distinct from the traditionally presumed route of Brahmin ingress into the Indian subcontinent. The proposed migration route is supported by archeological, toponymic, numismatic, linguistic, iconographic, and literary data. Lastly, we present cultural metrics demonstrating that these LPKSTR lineages retained distinct family practices with respect to literacy, religious practice, and emigration not shared with orthodox Brahmins of canonical geographic origin within the same community, despite centuries of intermarriage. Long-term transmission of differentiated family practices within a patrilineal endogamous community has rarely been documented.

AB  - Purpose: Device-associated infections constitute the majority of health care-associated infections (HAIs) in ICUs. Trauma patients are predisposed to acquire such infections due to various trauma-related factors. The prevalence of HAIs is underreported from developing nations due to a lack of systematic surveillance. This study reports the impact of an intensive surveillance on the rates and outcome of device-associated infections in trauma patients from a developing country and compares the rates with a previous pilot observation. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at a level-1 trauma centre of India. Surveillance for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated blood stream infections (CLA-BSIs) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTIs) was done based on centre for disease control-National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN) definitions. The impact of an intensive surveillance, education and awareness drive on the rates of infections over the study period, and compliance to preventive bundles and hand hygiene was assessed. Results: A total of 15,462 ventilator days, 12,207 central line days and 17,740 urinary catheter days were recorded in the study population. The overall rates of VAP, CLA-BSI and CA-UTI were respectively 17, 7.2 and 15.5/1000 device days. There was a significant correlation between device days and the propensity to develop infections. Infections were the cause of death in 36.6% of fatal trauma cases. A significantly higher rate of VAP, CLA-BSI and CA-UTIs was noted in fatal cases. The compliance to ventilator bundle, central line bundle, bladder bundle and hand hygiene were 74.5%, 86%, 79.3% and 64.6%, respectively. A high rate of multi-drug-resistance was observed in all pathogens. A gross reduction in the rates of all infections was observed over time during the study due to implementation of a stringent surveillance system, feedbacks and education. The compliance to hand hygiene and preventive bundles also increased over time. Conclusion: The automated surveillance was easy and useful for data entry and analysis. Surveillance had a significant impact on reduction of HAIs and mortality in trauma patients.

AB  - Symphysis pubis is an uncommon site of tuberculosis and only few cases have been reported in the literature. It is important to distinguish it from the more common entities like Osteitis pubis and Osteomyelitis of pubis symphysis to prevent delay in diagnosis and minimize morbidity and prevent complications. We report a rare case of tuberculosis of symphysis pubis in a 50-year-old Indian female from low socioeconomic status. Diagnosis is not difficult if one is aware of the condition. A high index of suspicion along with radiograph and fine needle aspiration led to the diagnosis. The patient had an excellent outcome following a complete course of anti-tuberculous chemotherapy for tuberculosis.

TI  - Oral zinc for the prevention of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
KW  - BILIRUBIN
KW  - SALTS
AB  - Background
   Between 6% and 15% of neonates develop hyperbilirubinaemia requiring treatment. Successful management of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia relies on prevention and early treatment, with phototherapy being the mainstay of treatment. Oral zinc has been reported to decrease the serum total bilirubin (STB), presumably by decreasing the enterohepatic circulation.
   Objectives
   To determine the effect of oral zinc supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment on the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates during the first week of life and to assess the safety of oral zinc in enrolled neonates.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to November 30, 2014), and EMBASE (1990 to November 30, 2014).
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion if they enrolled neonates (term and preterm) to whom oral zinc, in a dose of 10 to 20 mg/day, was initiated within the first 96 hours of life, for any duration until day seven, compared with no treatment or placebo.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group for data collection and analysis.
   Main results
   Only one study met the criteria of inclusion in the review. This study compared oral zinc with placebo. Oral zinc was administered in a dose of 5 mL twice daily from day 2 to day 7 postpartum. The drug was administered into the mouth of the infant by the plastic measure provided with the bottle or with a spoon. Incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia, defined as serum total bilirubin (STB) >= 15 mg/dL, was similar between groups (N = 286; risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 1.52). Mean STB levels, mg/dL, at 72 +/- 12 hours were comparable in both the groups (N = 286; mean difference (MD) -0.20; 95% CI -1.03 to 0.63). Although the duration of phototherapy in the zinc group was significantly shorter compared to the placebo group (N = 286; MD -12.80, 95% CI - 16.93 to -8.67), the incidence of need for phototherapy was comparable across both the groups (N = 286; RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.66 to 2.18). Incidences of side effects like vomiting (N = 286; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.25), diarrhoea (N = 286; RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.31 to 27.71), and rash (N = 286; RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.03) were found to be rare and statistically comparable between groups.
   Authors' conclusions
   The limited evidence available has not shown that oral zinc supplementation given to infants up to one week old reduces the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia or need for phototherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are known to interfere with homocysteine metabolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia may be a risk factor associated in the long-term treatment with AEDs. Both genetic and non-genetic factors are responsible for hyperhomocysteinemia. MTHFR C677T. Polymorphism leads to the reduction in enzyme activity and subsequent elevation of plasma homocysteine. This study aimed to investigate the role of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in epileptic patients receiving AEDs as monotherapy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, and sodium valproate) and showing toxicity and non-toxicity, and the impact of AEDs on hyperhomocysteinemia in North Indian population.
   DESIGN AND SETINGS: Blood samples for this case-control study were collected from the outpatient department and wards of the Department of Neurosciences at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, between July 2008 and May 2010.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 200 epileptic patients and 100 normal controls were assessed for total homocysteine (tHcy), vitamin B-12, and folate levels using enhanced chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay method (ImmuliteR, 1000 systems, DPC, United States); genotyping of MTHFR C677T was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
   RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase in tHcy levels in epileptic patients with toxicity and non-toxicity than in normal controls (P<.005). The allelic and genotypic distributions were found to be statistically significant in toxicity and non-toxicity groups (P<.05).
   CONCLUSION: The result confirmed that hyperhomocysteinemia is common in adults receiving AED treatment for epilepsy with toxicity and non-toxicity groups. This increase in tHcy is mainly related to low folate and vitamin B-12 levels, which are the main determinants for tHcy.

AB  - The development of transplantable cell sheets of functional keratocytes embedded within an aligned collagen type I matrix is a viable approach for constructing a bioequivalent of corneal stroma. Thermoresponsive materials based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PolyNIPA) have been utilized to recover carrier-free corneal cell sheets by inducing temperature changes. In this study, we employed direct-write assembly (DWA) to develop microperiodic parallel patterns of silk-PolyNIPA and gelatin-PolyNIPA. Semi-interpenetrating networks of PolyNIPA hybrids (with silk/gelatin) exhibited temperature-responsive nature and thereby have potential use in cell sheet engineering. Silk-PolyNIPA and gelatin-PolyNIPA hybrids demonstrated a hydrophobic surface at 37 degrees C (i.e. above their lower critical solution temperature) with a contact angle of 59 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees and 55 degrees +/- 3 degrees, respectively, whereas the surface roughness of silk-PolyNIPA was double that of gelatin-PolyNIPA. The reduction of temperature to 20 degrees C resulted in a decrease in the value of surface roughness and water contact angle for both hybrids. All four parallel patterned substrates guided corneal cell alignment along the direction of the patterns. Collagen type-I and aggrecan gene expression was higher when the cells were grown over the gelatin-PolyNIPA matrix after 3 weeks of culture when compared to silk-PolyNIPA. In addition, a significantly higher metabolic activity as well as enhanced vinculin expression of keratocytes on the gelatin-PolyNIPA matrix indicated the improved cytocompability compared to the silk, gelatin and silk-PolyNIPA matrices. Interestingly, the detachment of keratocytes cell sheet was achieved from the silk-PolyNIPA and gelatin-PolyNIPA planar films only within 10 min and 30 min, respectively, but the patterns could not yield intact sheet recovery. Hence, we conclude that while gelatin-PolyNIPA hybrids with parallel patterns fabricated using DWA will benefit from the application of cellular alignment, some optimization in the pattern parameters may be required for rapid sheet recovery from such substrates. Understanding the keratocytes responses to such hybrid biomaterials suggests viable options to develop a corneal stromal bioequivalent.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the socioeconomic impact of long-term glaucoma therapy. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifty consecutive glaucoma patients on medical therapy, following up at our glaucoma service for at least 6 months were recruited. A questionnaire regarding monthly income, cost of glaucoma medications prescribed, availability of medications, travel time, time spent in review clinics, compliance, education status, medical insurance and systemic or local side-effects was administered. Results: The patients seen at the tertiary government hospital had an average monthly income of Rs. 10,912/- (range: Rs. 500/- to Rs. 50,000/-) with approximately 56% of the patients having an income of less than Rs. 5000/month. The expenditure on anti-glaucoma medications ranged from 0.3% in high income group to 123% of their monthly gross income in low income group (P < 0.0001). The total expenditure including travel, stay, and loss of wages of patients and accompanying persons ranged from 1.6% in high income group to 137% of the monthly income in low income group (P < 0.0001). Mean time required for a glaucoma clinic visit was 15.66 h, (range: 6-96 h/month). About 2.7% experienced systemic side-effects and 21.3% had complaints of ocular adverse effects. About 90% of the patients were compliant. 92% were not covered by any insurance plan/government reimbursement for their treatment. Conclusions: Medical therapy for glaucoma is an economic burden to many patients and should be individualized, according to the socioeconomic status, availability of drugs and the required distance to travel to reach the specialist clinics.

AB  - The present study was aimed at investigating the cardioprotective activity of thymoquinone(TMQ), an active principle of the herb, Nigella sativa, which is used for the management of various diseases. The present study examined the cardioprotective effect of TMQ in isoproterenol-(ISP-) induced myocardial infarction in rats. Myocardial infarction was induced by two subcutaneous injections of ISP(85 mg/kg) at an interval of 24 hr. TMQ(20 mg/kg) was administered orally for 21 days. ISP-treated rats showed depletion of antioxidants and marker enzymes from myocardium along with lipid peroxidation and enhanced levels of proinflammatory cytokines. ISP also induced histopathological alterations in myocardium. Treatment with TMQ prevented the depletion of endogenous antioxidants and myocyte injury marker enzymes and inhibited lipid peroxidation as well as reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. TMQ pretreatment also reduced myonecrosis, edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells and showed preservation of cardiomyocytes histoarchitecture. The present study results demonstrate that TMQ exerts cardioprotective effect by mitigating oxidative stress, augmenting endogenous antioxidants, and maintaining structural integrity. The results of the present study indicate that TMQ may serve as an excellent agent alone or as adjuvant to prevent the onset and progression of myocardial injury.

AB  - Objective: To study the clinical features and topography of the cornea in eyes with childhood glaucoma.
   Design: Cross-sectional, observational study.
   Participants: Fifty-eight eyes with childhood glaucoma and 28 eyes of age-matched controls.
   Methods: Clinical and topographic corneal changes were evaluated.
   Main Outcome Measures: Corneal topographic changes were evaluated on Orbscan (Orbscan Topography System II; Bausch & Lomb, Salt Lake City, UT) in eyes with childhood glaucoma and those changes were compared with the control eyes.
   Results: Fifty-eight eyes with childhood glaucoma and 28 eyes of age-matched controls were evaluated. Thirty-six eyes (62.1%) were classified as having primary childhood glaucoma and 22 eyes (37.94%) as having childhood glaucoma with associated ocular anomalies. The corneas in 18 of 58 eyes (31.0%) with childhood glaucoma were clear, whereas 24.1% of eyes (14/58 eyes) had some corneal opacification. Haab's striae were noted in 44.8% of eyes (26/58 eyes) and were most frequently present between 3 and 5 mm from the optical axis. The mean posterior elevation recorded in eyes with childhood glaucoma controlled with medication or surgery was significantly higher than that in control eyes: 0.043 +/- 0.027, 0.042 +/- 0.017, and 0.018 +/- 0.058 mm, respectively (P < 0.0001). The presence of Haab's striae was correlated significantly with a higher posterior elevation (P = 0.0396) and poor vision. The mean anterior elevation in eyes with childhood glaucoma (0.022 +/- 0.015 mm) and in control eyes (0.015 +/- 0.078 mm) was comparable (P = 0.08). Corneal astigmatism in eyes with childhood glaucoma was significantly higher and irregular compared with that in control eyes: 2.09 +/- 1.40 versus 0.93 +/- 0.60 diopter cylinder (P = 0.0001); the irregularity index was 2.8 (range, 1-18.1) and 2.3 (range, 0.6-2.3) at 3 mm (P = 0.0005) and 3.2 (range, 1.4-21.3) and 1.8 (range, 0.5-2.9) at 5 mm, respectively (P = 0.0003). Best-corrected visual acuity correlated significantly with cup-to-disc ratio, axial length, refractive error, astigmatism, and posterior corneal elevation. Multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation only with cup-to-disc ratio and axial length.
   Conclusions: Childhood glaucoma causes a significant increase in posterior corneal elevation and irregular astigmatism, which contribute to visual disability in such eyes. (C) 2015 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

AB  - Background
   Surgery on fingers is a common procedure in emergency and day care surgery. Adrenaline combined with lidocaine can prolong digital nerve block and provide a bloodless operating field. Extended postoperative pain relief can reduce the need for analgesics and can facilitate hand rehabilitation. Conventionally, adrenaline is avoided at anatomical sites with end arteries such as digits, penis and pinna because of concerns about arterial spasm, ischaemia and gangrene distal to the site of drug infiltration.
   Objectives
   To assess the safety and efficacy of use of adrenaline (any dilution) combined with lidocaine (any dilution) for digital nerve blocks (fingers and toes).
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 11, 2014), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1966 to 18 November 2014) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1980 to 18 November 2014).

   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of adrenaline with lidocaine and plain lidocaine in patients undergoing surgery on digits (fingers and toes). Our primary outcomes were duration of anaesthesia, adverse outcomes such as ischaemia distal to the injection site and cost analysis. Our secondary outcomes were duration of postoperative pain relief and reduced bleeding during surgery.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We performed all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a fixed-effect model when no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies was found and a random-effects model when heterogeneity was likely.
   Main results
   We included four RCTs with 167 participants. Risk of bias of the included studies was high, as none of them reported method of randomization, allocation concealment or blinding. Only one trial mentioned our primary outcome of duration of anaesthesia. The mean difference in duration of anaesthesia with use of adrenaline with lidocaine was 3.20 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.48 to 3.92 hours; one RCT, 20 participants; low-quality evidence). No trial reported adverse events such as ischaemia distal to the injection site, and no trial reported cost analysis. One trial mentioned the secondary outcome of duration of postoperative pain relief, but available data were insufficient for analysis of the findings. Two trials reported the secondary outcome of reduced bleeding during surgery.
   Bleeding during surgery was observed in nine out of 52 participants as compared with 25 out of 51 participants in the adrenaline with lidocaine and plain lidocaine groups, respectively. The risk ratio for bleeding in the adrenaline with lidocaine group was 0.35 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; two RCTs, 103 participants; low-quality evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   From the limited data available, evidence is insufficient to recommend use or avoidance of adrenaline in digital nerve blocks. The evidence provided in this review indicates that addition of adrenaline to lidocaine may prolong the duration of anaesthesia and reduce the risk of bleeding during surgery, although the quality of the evidence is low. We have identified the need for researchers to conduct large trials that focus on other important outcomes such as adverse events, cost analysis and duration of postoperative pain relief.

AB  - Background
   This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 8, 2012.
   Failure to respond to antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled seizure activity such as refractory status epilepticus (RSE) has led to the use of anaesthetic drugs. Coma is induced with anaesthetic drugs to achieve complete control of seizure activity. Thiopental sodium and propofol are popularly used for this purpose. Both agents have been found to be effective. However, there is a substantial lack of evidence as to which of the two drugs is better in terms of clinical outcome.
   Objectives
   To compare the efficacy, adverse effects, and short-and long-term outcomes of RSE treated with one of the two anaesthetic agents, thiopental sodium or propofol.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (26 March 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 2, February 2015) and MEDLINE (1946 to 26 March 2015). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (26 March 2015), the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials and IndMED (a bibliographic database of Indian Medical Journals).
   Selection criteria
   All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled studies (regardless of blinding) of control of RSE using either thiopental sodium or propofol in patients of any age and gender.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of relevant and eligible trials before retrieving the full-text publications.
   Main results
   One study with a total of 24 participants was available for review. This study was a small, single-blind, multicentre trial studying adults with RSE receiving either propofol or thiopental sodium for the control of seizure activity. This study cannot be considered of high methodological quality. This study was terminated early due to recruitment problems. This study showed a wide confidence interval suggesting that the drugs may differ in efficacy up to more than two-fold. Days of mechanical ventilation were more in patients receiving thiopental sodium when compared with propofol. At three months there was no evidence of a difference between the drugs with respect to outcome measures such as control of seizure activity and functional outcome. Adverse events reported in this study were infection, hypotension and intestinal ischaemia.
   Authors' conclusions
   Since the last version of this review we have found no new studies.
   There is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence that can clarify the efficacy of propofol and thiopental sodium compared to each other in the treatment of RSE. There is a need for large randomised controlled trials for this serious condition.

AB  - Introduction: Traumatic posterior fossa extradural hematomas (PFEDH) are rare lesions constituting <10% of all extradural hematomas. Reliance on clinical findings alone is not recommended as these are nonspecific; for all suspicious cases, it is advisable to conduct a CT scan. Only a handful of pediatric studies have been reported analyzing the outcome of such lesions. The aim of our study was to analyze outcomes for children with PFEDH managed at our apex trauma center. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (<= 18 years) admitted with a diagnosis of traumatic PFEDH from January 2008 to February 2014. Results: Of 22 patients, 16 were managed surgically (group 1) and 6 conservatively (group 2); 1 failed conservative treatment (due to an increased EDH volume). Mean age was 11.7 years (range 2-18 years). Falls were the most common cause of injury. Vomiting and loss of consciousness were the most frequent presenting features. There were 18 mild, 2 moderate and 2 severe head injuries. The mean volume of EDH was 37.1 ml (range 18-100 ml) and 10.3 ml (8-16 ml) in the operative and conservative subgroups, respectively. Occipital bone fracture was seen in 16 cases with supratentorial extension in 11. Four complications were noted in 3 cases. Mean follow-up duration was 25.1 months (range 3-34 months). Except for 1 patient, all had excellent outcomes. There was no mortality. Conclusions: Traumatic pediatric PFEDHs are rare. Both the clinical status of the patient and the volume of the hematoma need to be assessed before deciding on surgery. Most cases have associated occipital bone fractures and around half have supratentorial extension; these need to be carefully assessed preoperatively. Torrential venous bleeding can be a major problem due to rupture of the adjacent sinuses. Timely intervention is crucial for achieving good outcome, keeping in view a low threshold for surgical evacuation. Although not innovative, this second-largest case series provides additional data and contributes to the existing literature on such lesions in pediatric patients. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes causes mild to acutely life-threatening diseases. Herein, we report our experience with five cases of fatal bacteraemia due to various groups of Streptococci, three of them due to Group G Streptococcus and one case each due to Group A Streptococcus and Group F Streptococcus. The peculiarity of all these cases was the rapidity of deaths occurring in these patients despite all the strains being sensitive to Penicillin. Hence, timely intervention in all suspected cases is strongly advocated. All isolates of beta-haemolytic Streptococci should be identified up till the species level and antimicrobial susceptibility be performed so that proper and early management can be done.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate neuropsychiatric co-morbidities (depression, psychosis and anxiety) in non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Background: Non-motor symptoms like neuropsychiatric co-morbidities are common in Parkinson's disease and may predate motor symptoms. Currently there is scarcity of data regarding neuropsychiatry manifestations in Indian patients with PD. Methods: In this cross-sectional study consecutive 126 non-demented patients with PD (MMSE >= 25) were enrolled. They were assessed using Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage, Schwab and England (S&E) scale of activity of daily life. Mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) was used for diagnosis of depression, psychosis and anxiety. Beck's depression inventory (BDI), Brief psychiatric rating scale (BSRS) and Hamilton rating scale for anxiety (HAM-A) scales were used for assessment of severity of depression, psychosis and anxiety respectively. Results: Mean age and duration of disease was 57.9 +/- 10.9 years and 7.3 +/- 3.6 years respectively. At least one of the neuropsychiatric co-morbidity was present in 64% patients. Depression, suicidal risk, psychosis and anxiety were present in 43.7%, 31%, 23.8% and 35.7% respectively. Visual hallucinations (20.6%) were most frequent, followed by tactile (13.5%), auditory (7.2%) and olfactory hallucinations (1.6%). Patients with depression had higher motor disability (UPDRS-motor score 33.1 +/- 14.0 vs 27.3 +/- 13.3; and UPDRS-total 50.7 +/- 21.8 vs 41.0 +/- 20.3, all p values < 0.05). Patients with psychosis were older (63.6 +/- 8.0 years vs 56.1 +/- 11.1 years, p < 0.05) and had longer duration of illness (8.6 +/- 3.4 years vs 6.9 +/- 3.5, p < 0.05). Conclusions: About two third patients with Parkinson's disease have associated neuropsychiatric co-morbidities. Depression was more frequent in patients with higher disability and psychosis with longer duration of disease and older age. These co-morbidities need to be addressed during management of patients with PD.

AB  - Introduction: Cognitive impairment has long been recognized as a co-morbidity or sequel to refractory epilepsy. This study was conducted to evaluate the degree and selectivity of involvement of memory, language and executive functions performance among patients with temporal (TLE) versus extratemporal epilepsy (ETLE).
   Methods: We prospectively enrolled adolescent and adult patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy, who had undergone pre-surgical evaluation. Language, memory and executive function assessment was done using Western Aphasia Battery, PGI memory scale and battery of four executive function tests (trail making test A a B, digit symbol test, Stroop Task and verbal fluency test), respectively.
   Results: Among 02 patients enrolled (TLE-59, ETLE-43), mean age of patients 23.04 +/- 8.3 years, 83 (82%) had impairment of more than one cognitive domain and 21(21%) had all three domains involved. Severely impaired memory scores were found in 8.6% patients with MTLE-HS, 8% of the rest of the patients with TLE and 7% patients with ETLE. The differences in the mean scores were also not found statistically significant (p = 0.669). Naming impairment was the most common language abnormality, although all aphasia subscores were similar for the ETLE and TLE groups. Executive function impairment was the most common cognitive domain affected. Overall performance on executive function tests was found impaired in almost all patients of both groups without any significant inter-group difference, except on Trail-A test, which revealed better results in patients with mTLE-HS as compared to all other sub-groups.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that impairment of memory, language and executive function is common among patients with drug refractory epilepsy. The most prevalent impairment is in executive function. There is no significant difference in the degree, prevalence or selectivity of impairment in either of the three domains, between the TLE versus ETLE groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: India is a subtropical country with clear seasonal variations in weather conditions. Seasonal and circadian variation in occurrence of subtypes of cerebrovascular disease has been of interest in several studies from different countries and climate zones, but discrepant results have made the conclusions unclear. The aim of the present study was to observe the seasonal and circadian variation in the occurrence of stroke and its subtypes among our population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study based on new cases and past cases of stroke on follow-up, conducted between January 2011 and December 2012 in the Department of Neurology, at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. The date and time of onset of the stroke was recorded. The categorization of months into season was in accordance with the Indian Meteorological Department guidelines. The time of onset was distributed into 6 hourly intervals. Statistical calculations were performed using Stata version 12.1 and SPSS version 20. Results: A total of 583 patients were included for the study. The rate of occurrence of stroke was highest in the late morning 0600-1159 hours (P value,. 001) compared with other times of the day, regardless of gender or age for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It was lowest in late evening (1800-2359 hours) quadrant compared with other quadrants. Although there was no significant difference found by dichotomizing the groups into two 6-month periods, there was an increasing trend in number of patients with stroke during the months November-February. There was no difference in stroke occurrence between the types of stroke or within each type among different seasons with different temperatures. Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification of ischemic strokes also did not show any association with season or circadian rhythm. Conclusions: There is a significant increase in occurrence of strokes between 0600 and 1159 hours and lowest between 1800-2359 hours. No significant variation in stroke occurrence or subtype for any of the seasons was observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The significant impact of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on cardiac morbidity in patients of early breast cancer (EBC) undergoing breast-conserving surgery has been shown in different studies. The present study was conducted to assess the impact of surgery and the side of involvement on radiation dose to left anterior descending artery (LAD) and Left circumflex coronary artery (LCx). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totally, 58 patients of EBC were randomly chosen for this dosimetric study and planned with tangential field technique without intensity modulation (IM). Heart, LAD, and LCx (n = 55) were contoured. Dose volume histograms were analyzed to determine the Dmax (maximum dose) and Dmean (mean dose) of LAD and LCx. Student's t-test was used for comparative analysis of the means. RESULTS: The mean Dmax of LAD for left (L) EBC was 3.17 Gray (Gy) while for right (R) EBC it was 0.86 Gy (P = 0.007; 95% C.I, 1.14-3.48). The mean Dmean of LAD for L-EBC and R-EBC were 1.97 Gy and 0.79 Gy, respectively (P = 0.029; 95% C.I, 0.77-1.60). The mean-Dmax of LCx for patients with L-EBC (2.9 Gy; range: 1.2-4.35 Gy) was statistically higher than that for R-EBC (1.3 Gy; range: 0.7-3.2 Gy) (P = 0.045). The mean-Dmean of LCx for L-EBC (2.1 Gy; range: 0.6-3.6 Gy) was also significantly higher than that of L-EBC (0.9 Gy; range: 0.7-2.1 Gy) (P = 0.03). There was no significant impact of the pattern of surgery on LAD dose, but significance was noted for LCx dose parameters (P = 0.04 and 0.08 for m-Dmax and m-Dmean of LCx). CONCLUSION: This pilot dosimetric study confirms the assumption that patients with left-sided EBC are at higher risk of developing long-term cardiac morbidity when treated with PORT due to increased dose to LAD.

AB  - HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In spite of successful interventions and treatment protocols, an HIV vaccine would be the ultimate prevention and control strategy. Ever since identification of HIV/AIDS, there have been meticulous efforts for vaccine development. The specific aim of this paper is to review recent vaccine efficacy trials and associated advancements and discuss the current challenges and future directions. Recombinant DNA technologies greatly facilitated development of many viral products which were later incorporated into vectors for effective vaccines. Over the years, a number of scientific approaches have gained popularity and include the induction of neutralizing antibodies in late 1980s, induction of CD8 T cell in early 1990s, and combination approaches currently. Scientists have hypothesized that stimulation of right sequences of somatic hypermutations could induce broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) capable of effective neutralization and viral elimination. Studies have shown that a number of host and viral factors affect these processes. Similarly, eliciting specific CD8 T cells immune responses through DNA vaccines hold future promises. In summary, future studies should focus on the continuous fight between host immune responses and ever-evasive viral factors for effective vaccines.

AB  - PurposeTo investigate the potential of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and in vivo proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) in the differentiation of breast tissue of healthy lactating women volunteers and breast cancer patients.
   Materials and MethodsDWI and MRS were carried out at 1.5 Tesla on 12 breast cancer patients and 12 normal lactating women volunteers. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and total choline (tCho) concentration were determined.
   ResultstCho was observed in all breast cancer patients and in 10/12 lactating women. Additionally a peak at 3.8 ppm corresponding to lactose was seen in 10/12 of lactating women. Concentration of tCho was similar in malignant breast tissue of patients (3.511.72 mmol/kg) and in normal breast tissue of lactating women (3.52 +/- 1.70 mmol/kg). However, ADC was significantly higher in the normal breast tissue of lactating women (1.62 +/- 0.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) compared with the malignant breast tissue of patients (1.01 +/- 0.10 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s).
   ConclusionObservation of lactose peak with higher ADC in the breast tissue of healthy lactating women volunteers may aid in differentiation of changes that occur in breast tissue due to normal physiological conditions like lactation compared with malignant transformation.

AB  - A new high sensitivity Na2LiPO4:Eu optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) material was prepared by a simple solid-state diffusion method. The formation of the material was confirmed by comparing the experimental data with that available in the literature (JCPDF # 80-2110). The dosimetric properties of the phosphor material using a continuous wave-optically stimulated luminescence (CW-OSL) technique were studied. The material was studied for different concentrations of the impurity and also for different heating treatments. The material doped with 1.0 mol% and annealed at 873 K was found to be the most sensitive. The phosphor was found to have all the good dosimetric characteristics, such as tissue equivalence (low-Z, Z(eff) similar to 10.8), high sensitivity (similar to 3 times less than the commercially available Al2O3:C, Landauer Inc., USA and BeO, Thermalox (R) 995, Materion Inc., USA), low fading (similar to 6.2% in 40 days), wide range of dose response (0.1-1.0 kGy), excellent reusability, easy optical bleaching (annealing) for its reuse, etc., which makes the material useful for dosimetry of high-energy radiations using OSL. The advantages of our OSLD phosphor are the easily available and inexpensive ingredients and a very simple method of preparation that makes it cost effective as compared to the commercially available OSLD phosphors. Also, it is easy to handle, unlike the Thermalox (R) 995 (BeO) dosimeters which are very toxic, and require a special method of preparation and handling.

AB  - Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver related morbidity and mortality. In many countries, there is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological data that are crucial in implementing disease control measures as new treatment options become available. Published literature, unpublished data and expert consensus were used to determine key parameters, including prevalence, viremia, genotype and the number of patients diagnosed and treated. In this study of 15 countries, viremic prevalence ranged from 0.13% in the Netherlands to 2.91% in Russia. The largest viremic populations were in India (8666000 cases) and Russia (4162000 cases). In most countries, males had a higher rate of infections, likely due to higher rates of injection drug use (IDU). Estimates characterizing the infected population are critical to focus screening and treatment efforts as new therapeutic options become available.

AB  - Introduction: Odontoid fractures constitute 9-20% of all adult cervical spine fractures. The present study was carried out to focus on the nuances involved in the surgical management of odontoid fractures.
   Materials and Methods: Patients with an odontoid fracture, admitted for surgical stabilization, between January 2008 and March 2014, were included in the study.
   Results: Among 142 patients [127 male and 15 female patients; median age: 28 years range 4-75 years], type II odontoid fractures were present in 111, type IIA fractures in 8, and type III fractures in 23 patients. 58.5% patients had been involved in a motor vehicular accident while 38.7% had sustained a fall. Eighty-five patients (59.9%) with a well-reduced fracture and an intact transverse ligament underwent anterior odontoid screw (OS) placement; the other 57 patients (40.1%) underwent posterior fixation (PF). The mean follow-up duration was 22 months (range: 6 months-5.4 years). OS placement was successful in 82 patients (96.5%) with a fusion rate of 95% (95.8% in type II, 100% in type III, and 75% in type IIA odontoid fractures). The procedure-related morbidity was 11.7%. One patient died of sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that occurred during OS placement. The PF procedures had a better fusion rate (96.5%). The latter patients, however, had significant restriction of their neck movements and an overall morbidity of 8.7%. The revision surgery rates after OS placement and PF fixation were 7% and 3.5%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Anterior OS fixation shows excellent fusion rates and should be the first-line management in reduced/non-displaced acute type II (including type IIA) and high type III odontoid fractures as it preserves cervical motion. PF, that has also been associated with an excellent fusion rate, should be reserved for patients where OS fixation has either failed or has not been feasible.

AB  - Sulfated polysaccharide was isolated from Monostroma oxyspermum through hot water extraction, anion-exchange and gel permeation column chromatography. The sulfated polysaccharide contained 92% of carbohydrate, 0% of protein, 7.8% of uronic acid, 22% of ash and 33% of moisture respectively. The elemental composition was analyzed using CHNS/O analyzer. The molecular weight of sulfated polysaccharide determined through PAGE was found to be as 55 kDa. Monosaccharides analysis revealed that sulfated polysaccharide was composed of rhamnose, fructose, galactose, xylose, and glucose. The structural features of sulfated polysaccharide were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Further the sulfated polysaccharide showed total antioxidant and DPPH free radical scavenging activity were as 66.29% at 250 mu g/ml and 66.83% at 160 mu g/ml respectively. The sulfated polysaccharide also showed ABTS scavenging ability and reducing power were as 83.88% at 125 mu g/ml and 15.81% at 400 mu g/ml respectively. The anticoagulant activity was determined for human plasma with respect to Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and Prothrombin Time (PT) was 20.09IU and 1.79IU at 25 mu g/ml respectively. These results indicated that the sulfated polysaccharide from M. oxyspermum had potent antioxidant and anticoagulant activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with congenital ichthyosis, especially those with darker skin types, are at increased risk of developing vitamin D deficiency and rickets. The relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone health have not been studied previously, in ichthyosis.
   ObjectivesTo determine the threshold levels of 25(OH)D and PTH for impaired bone health in children with congenital ichthyosis.
   MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 119 children with ichthyosis and 168 controls were recruited. Serum 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured. Radiological screening for rickets was carried out only in children with ichthyosis.
   ResultsForty-seven children with ichthyosis had either clinical or radiological evidence of rickets. The correlation between serum 25(OH)D and PTH showed that a serum level of 25(OH)D 8ngmL(-1) was associated with a significant increase in PTH. The correlation between PTH and ALP showed that a serum PTH level of 75pgmL(-1) was associated with a significant increase in ALP levels. Of the different clinical phenotypes of ichthyosis, both autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) and epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI) were found to have significantly increased PTH, ALP and radiological rickets scores compared with common ichthyosis.
   ConclusionsSerum levels of 25(OH)D8ngmL(-1) and PTH 75pgmL(-1) significantly increases the risk for development of rickets [odds ratio (OR) 28; 95% confidence interval (CI) 105-740; P=004] in ichthyosis. Among the different types, patients with ARCI (OR 483; 95% CI 174-1345; P<001) and EI (OR 571; 95% CI 174-1879; P<001) are at an increased risk of developing rickets.

AB  - Objective: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), simultaneous expression of proliferative (FLT3, KIT) and anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2) is unknown. The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene transcripts, their interrelationship and impact on the outcome in pediatric AML patients.
   Methods: We assessed proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene transcripts by Q-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan probe) in 64 consecutive pediatric AML patients. Survival data was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves followed by log rank test to compare statistical significance between groups. Stepwise multivariable Cox regression method was used to evaluate independent prognostic factors.
   Results: In univariate analysis, transcript ratio of FLT3/BCL2 and FLT3 + KIT/BCL2 significantly predicted event free survival (EFS) (<0.01 and <0.01 respectively) and overall survival (OS) (<0.01 and <0.01 respectively). In stepwise Cox-regression model, high white blood cell count and high FL13 + KIT/BCL2 ratio predicted EFS (HR: 2.2 and 23); high hemoglobin and high FLT3 + KIT/BCL2 ratio predicted OS (HR: 0.45 and 3.85). Prognostic index (PI) was calculated using the hazard coefficient of independent prognostic factors; at 57.3 months, predicted OS of patients with the highest PI of 1.8 was 8% versus 73% for the lowest PI of -0.3. The mean PI of patients who died was 1.8 +/- 0.72 versus 0.54 +/- 0.70 for those who are alive, P = 0.004.
   Conclusions: This first study showed that individual expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic transcripts is not as important in AML patients, rather their interrelationship and relative level probably determines the outcome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: There is limited data on the prevalence of impulse control disorder and related behaviors (ICD-RBs) in Indian patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). In the context of potential genetic and environmental factors affecting the expression of ICD-RBs, studying other multiethnic populations may bring in-sights into the mechanisms of these disorders. Objectives: To ascertain point prevalence estimate of ICD-RBs in Indian PD patients, using the validated " Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease (QUIP)" and to examine their association with Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). Materials and Methods: This was a hospital based observational cross-sectional study. After taking informed consent, patients and their informants (spouse, or primary caregiver) were made to complete the QUIP, and were instructed to answer questions based on behaviors that occurred anytime during PD that lasted at least four consecutive weeks. Results: Total of 299 patients participated in the study. At least one ICD-RB was present in 128 (42.8%), at least one Impulse control disorder (ICD) was present in 74 (24.75%) and at least one Impulse control related compulsive behaviour (ICRB) was present in 93 (31.1%) patients. Punding was the most frequent (12.4%) followed by hyper sexuality (11.04%), compulsive hobbyism (9.4%), compulsive shopping (8.4%), compulsive medication use (7.7%), compulsive eating (5.35%), walkabout (4%) and pathological gambling (3.3%). >= 2 ICD-RBs were observed in 15.7% of patients. After multivariate analysis, younger age of onset, being unmarried were specifically associated with presence of ICD. Longer disease duration was specifically associated with presence of ICRB. Whereas smoking and higher dopamine levodopa equivalent daily doses (DA LEDD) were associated with both presence of ICD and ICRB. Higher LD LEDD was specifically associated with presence of ICD-RB. Conclusions: Our study revealed a relatively higher frequency of ICD-RBs, probably because of the use of screening instrument and because we combined both ICDs and ICRBs. Also high proportion of DA use (81.6%) among our patients might be responsible. The role of genetic factors that might increase the risk of developing ICD-RBs in this population needs further exploration.

AB  - Introduction. Cases with microcytosis not responding adequately to iron supplementation are diagnostic dilemma and have been reported to harbor alpha (alpha) thalassemia mutations. The aim of this study was to determine the common alpha globin gene deletions in cases with microcytic anemia.
   Methods Fifty four patients selected (22 females and 32 males) had microcytic anemia (MCV < 80 fl, Hb < 12gm/dl) with raised TRBC (> 5M/mm3) but normal Hb HPLC. They had either low or normal Transferrin Saturation (TS). Gap-PCR for four common alpha-gene deletions (-alpha(3.7), -alpha(4.2), -alpha(SA) and -alpha(SEA)) was done.
   Results Out of the total fifty-four cases nineteen (35.2%) cases were found to have. gene mutations; Three homozygous and sixteen heterozygous cases including -alpha(3.7) deletions and a single case of -alpha(SA); but no -alpha(4.2) and -(SEA) mutations were found.
   Conclusion alpha gene mutations can confound iron deficiency anemia, but no RBC indices, or a discriminant function can identify it is presence Molecular studies have to be resorted to. Gap PCR for common alpha thalassemia mutation including -alpha(SA) should be done even in the face of low iron stores in subjects who respond incompletely to iron supplementation.

AB  - Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) or Williams syndrome (OMIM 194050) is a multisystem disorder manifested by neurodevelopmental delay and is caused by a hemizygous deletion of similar to 1.5-1.8 Mb in the 7q11.23 region. Clinical features include cardiovascular anomalies (mainly supravalvular aortic stenosis), peripheral pulmonary stenosis, distinctive facies, intellectual disability (usually mild), unique personality characteristics, and growth and endocrine abnormalities. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available for WBS; however, the mainstay of diagnosis is the detection of the contiguous gene deletion. Although FISH remains the most widely used laboratory test, the diagnosis can also be established by means of qPCR, MLPA, microsatellite marker analysis, and chromosomal microarray (CMA). We evaluated the utility of MLPA to detect deletion/duplication in the 7q11.23 region in 43 patients suspected to have WBS using MLPA kits for microdeletion syndromes. A hemizygous deletion in the 7q11.23 region was found in 41 (95.3%) patients using MLPA. One patient had an atypical deletion detected by CMA. During the initial period of this study, the results of 12 patients tested by MLPA were also confirmed by FISH. Compared to FISH and CMA, MLPA is a cheaper, high-throughput, less labor-intensive and less time-consuming technique for the diagnosis of WBS. Although CMA is expensive and labor-intensive, its effectiveness is demonstrated to detect an atypical deletion and to delineate the breakpoints. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - This randomized, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 103 children hospitalized with septated parapneumonic empyema (PPE) who were randomized to receive thoracoscopy (n=53) or urokinase (n=50). The main outcome variable was the length of hospital stay after treatment. The secondary outcomes were total length of hospital stay, number of days with the chest drain, number of days with fever, and treatment failures. No statistically significant differences were found between thoracoscopy and urokinase in the median postoperative stay (10 vs 9 days), median hospital stay (14 vs 13 days), or days febrile after treatment (4 vs 6 days). A second intervention was required in 15% of children in the thoracoscopy group versus 10% in the urokinase group (P = 0.47). The authors concluded that drainage plus urokinase instillation is as effective as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery as first-line treatment of septated PPE in children.

This study was planned to understand Th-like cytokine profiles of iNKT-cell subsets and modulation of their functions in response to glycolipid ligand and tumour cell lysate (TL).
   Subjects and MethodsCytokine profile of iNKT-cell subsets was evaluated from the peripheral blood of eight oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while antitumour activity of iNKT cells was measured by methyl tetrazolium salt assay.
   ResultsCD4(+) (CD4(+)CD8(-)) iNKT subset from OSCC patients showed significant (P<0.01) expansion and higher IL-4 production following activation with -GalCer-pulsed DCs, while CD4(-)CD8(-) double negative (DN) and CD8(+) (CD4(-)CD8(+)) iNKT subsets produced IFN- predominantly. iNKT cells showed significantly (P=0.02) increased secretion of IFN- and enhanced cytotoxicity to KB and SCC-4 tumour cells in response to -GalCer and TL-pulsed DCs.
   ConclusionIt appears that mutual balance/ratio of iNKT subsets may be important for their effector functions. Selectively expanded DN and CD8(+) iNKT cells with -GalCer and TL may be a better candidate vaccine for iNKT-cell-based adoptive cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Background & objectives: Tuberculosis is a major health problem in India, and the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has further complicated the situation. Though several studies characterizing drug sensitive and drug resistant strains are available in literature, almost all studies are done on unrelated strains. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the proteomic data of four sequential isolates of Mtb from a single patient who developed MDR-TB during the course of anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT).
   Methods: In this study, using two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we compared and analyzed the cell lysate proteins of Mtb sequential clinical isolates from a patient undergoing anti-TB treatment. The mRNA expression levels of selected identified proteins were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
   Results: The genotypes of all four isolates remained homologous, indicating no re-infection. The initial isolate (before treatment) was sensitive to all first-line drugs, but the consecutive isolates were found to be resistant to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) and developed mutations in the katG, inhA and rpoB. the intensities of 27 protein spots were found to be consistently overexpressed in INH and RIF resistant isolates. The most prominent and overexpressed proteins found during the development of drug resistance were GarA (Rv1827), wag31 (Rv2145c), Rv1437 and Rv2970c.
   Interpretation & conclusions: This preliminary proteomic study provides an insight about the proteins that are upregulated during drug resistance development. These upregulated proteins, identified here, could prove useful as immunodiagnostic and possibly drug resistant markers in future. However, more studies are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background: Post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a sequel to visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar seen predominantly in the Indian subcontinent and Africa. Histopathological descriptions of the condition are limited. Methods: Biopsies of 88 skin and 16 mucosal lesions were evaluated for histopathological findings on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Results: There were 71 (80.7%) males and 17 (19.3%) females with a mean age of 24.8 and 28.5 years, respectively. A past history of kala azar was present in 64 (72.7%) patients and post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis developed a mean of 6.2 years after visceral leishmaniasis. Of the biopsies studied, the clinical lesions were macular in 14 (15.9%), papulo-nodular in 32 (36.3%) and showed both macules and papulo-nodules in 42 (47.8%). Follicular plugging was a common epidermal finding. A clear Grenz zone was frequently noted. The dermal infiltrates were arranged mainly in three patterns: superficial perivascular infiltrates in 16 (18.1%), perivascular and perifollicular infiltrates in 24 (27.3%) and diffuse infiltrates in 41 (46.6%) biopsies. Leishman-Donovan (LD) bodies were noted in 13 (44.9%) of 69 cases on slit-skin smear and in 25 (28.4%) of 88 biopsies. In 16 patients, where both skin and mucosal biopsies were available, LD bodies were identified in 10 (62.5%) mucosal biopsies as compared to 3 (18.7%) skin biopsies. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study and the lack of controls were limitations. Conclusion: The various histomorphological patterns of post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis are a useful clue to the diagnosis even when LD bodies have not been detected. This study also suggests that LD bodies are more frequently seen in mucosal biopsies in comparison to cutaneous biopsies.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of interventions to control cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus in South Asia: protocol for a systematic review
T2  - BMJ OPEN
KW  - BURDEN
KW  - QUALITY
AB  - Introduction: While a number of strategies are being implemented to control cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the cost-effectiveness of these in the South Asian context has not been systematically evaluated. We aim to systematically review the economic (cost-effectiveness) evidence available on the individual-, group-and population-level interventions for control of CVD and T2DM in South Asia.
   Methods and analysis: This review will consider all relevant economic evaluations, either conducted alongside randomised controlled trials or based on decision modelling estimates. These studies must include participants at risk of developing CVD/T2DM or with established disease in one or more of the South Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, Bhutan and Afghanistan). We will identify relevant papers by systematically searching all major databases and registries. Selected articles will be screened by two independent researchers. Methodological quality of the studies will be assessed using a modified Drummond and a Phillips checklist. Cochrane guidelines will be followed for bias assessment in the effectiveness studies.
   Results: Results will be presented in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-analysis) checklist, and overall quality of evidence will be presented as per the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.
   Ethics and dissemination: The study has received ethics approval from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. The results of this review will provide policy-relevant recommendations for the uptake of cost-effectiveness evidence in prioritising decisions on essential chronic disease care packages for South Asia.

AB  - Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are effective immunosuppressive agents for the successful treatment of childhood steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Because these patients require long-term treatment, the identification of early markers of CNI-induced nephrotoxicity (CNIN) is imperative. The monitoring of CNI trough levels, serum creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate is not an accurate marker of CNIN. The present study has been undertaken to identify early markers of CNIN in SRNS patients. Twenty-four pediatric SRNS patients were included with paired renal biopsies, before initiation (time zero biopsy) and at least 1 year after CNI therapy (protocol renal biopsy) with standard dosage. Semiquantitative morphologic grading of the histologic features was done for assessing CNIN. Immunohistochemical markers for oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine [NT]), fibrogenic cytokine (transforming growth factor beta 1 [TGF-beta 1], and endothelial injury (endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS]) were evaluated. In addition, ultrastructural study was done to assess mitochondrial injury in endothelial and tubular epithelial cells. The protocol renal biopsies in comparison with time zero biopsies showed significant increase in glomerulosclerosis, juxtaglomerular apparatus hyperplasia, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, arteriolar hyalbaosis, and smooth muscle vacuolization (P < .05 P < .001). Significantly higher immunoexpression of eNOS (91.6%), NT (71%), and TGF-beta 1 (87.5%) was noted in posttreatment biopsies. Mean mitochondrial injury grade among post-CNI cases in endothelial cells and proximal tubular cells was 2.28 and 1.4, whereas in pre-CNI, it was 0.28 and 0.27, respectively. We propose that immunohistochemical overexpression of NT, eNOS, and TGF-beta 1 is an early marker of CNIN. Endothelial and proximal tubular mitochondrial injury may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CNIN. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is a serious complication of valve replacement. In developing countries, fibrinolysis with streptokinase (SK) is often used as the first line of treatment. Anti-streptokinase (anti-SK) antibodies are widely prevalent in the general population, but their effect on the efficacy and outcome of fibrinolysis with SK in patients with PVT is not known.
   Methods Patients with rheumatic heart disease and prosthetic valve replacement presenting with a first episode of left-sided PVT were enrolled. All patients underwent fibrinolysis with SK. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect anti-SK antibodies before fibrinolysis. Relationship of these antibodies to the outcome of fibrinolysis was evaluated.
   Results Forty-four patients treated for left-sided PVT were included. Thrombosis affected 33 mitral and 11 aortic prosthetic valves. On fibrinolysis with SK, 32 (73%) patients achieved complete success, whereas it was unsuccessful in the remaining 12 patients. There were 3 bleeding events, 1 stroke, and 3 deaths. Mean anti-SK antibody levels were not significantly different between patients who had complete success and those who did not (8.81 +/- 2.43 vs 7.67 +/- 1.26 Au/mL; P = .13) and did not correlate with the outcome after adjustment with other variables. Patients in New York Heart Association class III or IV had a greater chance of failed fibrinolytic therapy, even after adjustment for other prognostic variables (odds ratio 9.0; 95% CI 1.29-63.02; P = .027).
   Conclusion Anti-SK antibody titers are not associated with success of fibrinolytic therapy using SK in patients with leftsided PVT.

AB  - While studies show that prolonged initial prednisone therapy reduces the frequency of relapses in nephrotic syndrome, they lack power and have risk of bias. In order to examine the effect of prolonged therapy on frequency of relapses, we conducted a blinded, 1: 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 5 academic hospitals in India on 181 patients, 1-12 years old, with a first episode of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Following 12 weeks of standard therapy, in random order, 92 patients received tapering prednisolone while 89 received matching-placebo on alternate days for the next 12 weeks. On intention-to-treat analyses, primary outcome of number of relapses at 1 year was 1.26 in the 6-month group and 1.54 in the 3-month group (difference -0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.75, 0.19). Relative relapse rate for 6-vs. 3-month therapy, adjusted for gender, age, and time to initial remission, was 0.70 (95% CI 0.47-1.10). Similar proportions of patients had sustained remission, frequent relapses, and adverse effects due to steroids. Adjusted hazard ratios for first relapse and frequent relapses with prolonged therapy were 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36-1.07) and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.61-1.67), respectively. Thus, extending initial prednisolone treatment from 3 to 6 months does not influence the course of illness in children with nephrotic syndrome. These findings have implications for guiding the duration of therapy of nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Background. Rituximab has emerged as an important medication for patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.
   Patients. We report the efficacy and safety of therapy with intravenous rituximab, administered once weekly for 2-4 doses, in 193 patients (mean age 10.9, range 2.2-18.7 years) with difficult-to-treat steroid dependence (n = 101), calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-dependent steroid resistance (n = 34) and CNI-resistant nephrotic syndrome (n = 58) managed at this center during 2006-13.
   Outcomes. Therapy in patients with steroid dependence and CNI-dependent steroid resistance led to significantly reduced relapse rates (respective mean difference 2.7 relapses/year and 2.2 relapses/year, corresponding to a decrease in relapses by 81.8 and 71.0%; both P < 0.0001). This resulted in a significant reduction in steroid requirement (mean difference 104.5 and 113.6 mg/kg/year, respectively; both P < 0.0001) and a trend to improved standard deviation scores for height (P = 0.069) and body mass index (P = 0.029). Remission was longer in patients with steroid dependence compared with CNI-dependent steroid resistance (median 16 versus 10 months; P < 0.0001). Prior response to cyclophosphamide predicted a lower risk of relapse in the former (hazard ratio, HR 0.56; P = 0.045); patients with initial resistance and CNI-dependent steroid resistance had increased risk of relapse (HR 2.66; P = 0.042). B-cell recovery, noted in 62.5% patients at 6 months, was not related to occurrence of relapse; redosing (n = 42 patients) was safe and effective. Response to therapy was unsatisfactory in patients with steroid-and CNI-resistant nephrotic syndrome, with remission in 29.3%. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was associated with higher odds of non-response (odds ratio 11.1; P = 0.028) and lack of response was associated with progressive chronic kidney disease (HR 9.97; P = 0.035). Therapy with rituximab was safe; adverse effects or infections were noted in 19 (9.8%) patients.
   Conclusions. Therapy with rituximab is effective and safe in reducing relapse rates and need for immunosuppressive medications in patients with steroid-dependent and CNI-dependent steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the suitability of 5 mm millennium multileaf collimator (MMLC) for volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-based lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Thirty lung SBRT patient treatment plans along with their planning target volumes (ranging from 2.01 cc to 150.11 cc) were transferred to an inhomogeneous lung phantom and retrospectively planned using VMAT technique, along with the high definition multileaf collimator (HDMLC) and MMLC systems. The plans were evaluated using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG-0813) treatment planning criteria for target coverage, normal tissue sparing, and treatment efficiency for both the MMLC and HDMLC systems using flat and flattening filter-free (FFF) photon beams. Irrespective of the target volumes, both the MLC systems were able to satisfy the RTOG-0813 treatment planning criteria without having any major deviation. Dose conformity was marginally better with HDMLC. The average conformity index (CI) value was found to be 1.069 +/- 0.034 and 1.075 +/- 0.0380 for HDMLC and MMLC plans, respectively. For the 6 MV FFF beams, the plan was slightly more conformal, with the average CI values of 1.063 +/- 0.029 and 1.073 +/- 0.033 for the HDMLC and MMLC plans, respectively. The high dose spillage was the maximum for 2 cc volume set (3% for HDMLC and 3.1% for MMLC). In the case of low dose spillage, both the MLCs were within the protocol of no deviation, except for the 2 cc volume set. The results from this study revealed that VMAT-based lung SBRT using 5 mm MMLC satisfies the RTOG-0813 treatment planning criteria for the studied target size and shapes.

AB  - Background: Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by cutaneous and ocular photosensitivity and an increased risk of developing cutaneous neoplasms. Progressive neurological abnormalities develop in a quarter of XP patients. Aim: To study the clinical profile and perform a mutation analysis in Indian patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. Methods: Ten families with 13 patients with XP were referred to our clinic over 2 years. The genes XPA, XPB and XPC were sequentially analyzed till a pathogenic mutation was identified. Results: Homozygous mutations in the XPA gene were seen in patients with moderate to severe mental retardation (6/10 families) but not in those without neurological features. Two unrelated families with a common family name and belonging to the same community from Maharashtra were found to have an identical mutation in the XPA gene, namely c.335_338delTTATinsCATAAGAAA (p.F112SfsX2). Testing of the XPC gene in two families with four affected children led to the identification of the novel mutations c.1243C>T or p.R415X and c.1677C>A or p.Y559X. In two families, mutations could not be identified in XPA, XPB and XPC genes. Limitation: The sample size is small. Conclusion: Indian patients who have neurological abnormalities associated with XP should be screened for mutations in the XPA gene.

TI  - Process evaluation of the impact and acceptability of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease
T2  - BMJ OPEN
KW  - RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL
KW  - HIGH-RISK
KW  - ADHERENCE
KW  - STRATEGY
AB  - Importance: The Use of a Multidrug Pill In Reducing cardiovascular Events (UMPIRE) trial has shown improved adherence with the use of a polypill strategy when compared with usual medications for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. To advance from efficacy to impact, we need a better understanding of why and how such a strategy might be deployed in complex health systems.
   Objective: To understand, from the perspective of UMPIRE trial participants and professionals, how and why a polypill strategy improves adherence compared with usual care, why improvement is greater in some subgroups, and to explore the acceptability of a polypill strategy among trial participants and healthcare professionals.
   Design, setting and participants: A preplanned process evaluation, based on qualitative interviews, was conducted with a subsample of 102 trial participants and 41 healthcare professionals at the end of the UMPIRE trial in India and Europe.
   Results: Most patients contrasted the simplicity of the polypill with usual medications that they found complex and, for many in India, expensive. Patients with low baseline adherence struggled most with complex medication lists, and those without established disease described less motivation to adhere when compared with people who had already been diagnosed with CVD; people in the latter group had already undertaken self-directed measures to adhere to CVD preventive medicines prior to entering the trial. Taking medication was one of many adaptations described by patients; these included dietary changes, stopping smoking and maintaining exercise. Most patients liked the polypill strategy, although some participants and health professionals were concerned that it would provide less tailored therapy for individual needs.
   Conclusions: Adherence to treatment lists with multiple medications is complex and influenced by several factors.
