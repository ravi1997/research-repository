AB  - BACKGROUND: Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the lower urinary tract (CCACLUT) is a rare primary malignant neoplasm with heterogenous morphology. There is a paucity of data in the literature regarding its immunohistochemical profile.
METHODS: The immunohistochemical features (extent and intensity) of a multinational cohort of CCACLUT were evaluated with comparison between clear cell adenocarcinoma of the female genital tract (CCACFGT, tissue microarray) and nephrogenic adenoma (NA).
RESULTS: 33 CCACLUT (24 female, 9 male; mean age 59 years) were collected. CCACLUT most commonly arose from the urinary bladder (26/33, 78%), particularly from the trigone (10/33, 30.3%) followed by the urethra (8/33, 22%). All 12 NA cases were located at the urinary bladder, whereas the most common CCACFGT location was the ovary (29/56, 52%). None of the CCACLUT patients had, intestinal metaplasia, NA, or urothelial carcinoma. One patient had concurrent endometriosis of the sigmoid colon. Most frequently observed morphology in CCACLUT was papillary/tubulocystic (9/3; 27.3%), followed by papillary/tubular (6/33; 18.2%) and papillary/solid (5/33; 15.2%). GATA3 expression was significantly higher in CCACLUT (18/33, 54.5%) and NA (6/12, 50%), when compared to CCACFGT cases 6/56, 11.7%)(p = 0.001 and p = 0.022, respectively). The extent of GATA3 was significantly higher in CCACLUT group (19.2 ± 16.6%) than the other groups (9.6 ± 22.5% in NA and 2.6 ± 9% in CCACFGT group) (p = 0.001). 4/33 patients (12.1) had weak, 10/33 patients (30.3%) had moderate, and 4/33 patients (12.1%) had strong GATA3 intensity in CCACLUT group. In NA group, one patient (8.3%, 1/12) had weak, one patient (8.3%, 1/12) had moderate and 4 patients (33.3%, 4/12) had strong GATA3 intensity. Most cases (CCACLUT 29/33, 88%; NA 11/12, 92%; CCACFGT 46/56, 82.1%) had positive Napsin A expression, by which CCACLUT had significantly more cases with Napsin A expression (p = 0.034). p63 was consistently negative in all cases (30/33 (91.9%) CCACLUT; 12/12 (100%) NA; 42/56 (75%) CCACFGT. Ki67 (MIB) proliferation index was significantly higher in CCACLUT group (54.6 ± 21%) when compared to NA group (4.5 ± 2.7%) and CCACFGT group (35.5 ± 25.8%) (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: CCACLUT has consistent GATA3 expression, which may cause challenge in the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma but can be used to distinguish CCACLUT from CCACFGT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare their outcome with case-matched controls from the prepandemic phase.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study in which all patients with TBI admitted during COVID-19 pandemic phase (Arm A) from March 24, 2020 to November 30, 2020 were matched with age and Glasgow Coma Scale score-matched controls from the patients admitted before March 2020 (Arm B).
RESULTS: The total number of patients matched in each arm was 118. The length of hospital stay (8 days vs. 5 days; P < 0.001), transit time from emergency room to operation room (150 minutes vs. 97 minutes; P = 0.271), anesthesia induction time (75 minutes vs. 45 minutes; P = 0.002), and operative duration (275 minutes vs. 180 minutes; P = 0.002) were longer in arm A. Although the incidence of fever and pneumonia was significantly higher in arm A than in arm B (50% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.001 and 27.1% vs. 1.7%, P < 0.001, respectively), outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended) and mortality (18.6% vs. 14.4% respectively; P = 0.42) were similar in both the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of the patients managed for TBI during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to matched patients with TBI managed at our center before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that the guidelines followed during the COVID-19 pandemic were effective in dealing with patients with TBI. This model can serve as a guide for any future pandemic waves for effective management of patients with TBI without compromising their outcome.

AB  - Pregestational diabetes (PGDM) leads to developmental impairment, especially cardiac dysfunction, in their offspring. The hyperglycemic microenvironment inside the uterus alters the cardiac plasticity characterized by electrical and structural remodeling of the heart. The altered expression of several transcription factors due to hyperglycemia during fetal development might be responsible for molecular defects and phenotypic changes in the heart. The molecular mechanism of the developmental defects in the heart due to PGDM remains unclear. To understand the molecular defects in the 2-days old neonatal rats, streptozotocin-induced diabetic female rats were bred with healthy male rats. We collected 2-day-old hearts from the neonates and identified the molecular basis for phenotypic changes. Neonates from diabetic mothers showed altered electrocardiography and echocardiography parameters. Transcriptomic profiling of the RNA-seq data revealed that several altered genes were associated with heart development, myocardial fibrosis, cardiac conduction, and cell proliferation. Histopathology data showed the presence of focal cardiac fibrosis and increased cell proliferation in neonates from diabetic mothers. Thus, our results provide a comprehensive map of the cellular events and molecular pathways perturbed in the neonatal heart during PGDM. All of the molecular and structural changes lead to developmental plasticity in neonatal rat hearts and develop cardiac anomalies in their early life.

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is the key feature of majority of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) as well as many patients with post-COVID-19. The pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis is a complex molecular process that involves myriad of cells, proteins, genes, and regulatory elements. The non-coding RNA mainly miRNA, circRNA, and lncRNA are among the key regulators of many protein coding genes and pathways that are involved in pulmonary fibrosis. Identification and molecular mechanisms, by which these non-coding RNA molecules work, are crucial to understand the molecular basis of the disease. Additionally, elucidation of molecular mechanism could also help in deciphering a potential diagnostic/prognostic marker as well as therapeutic targets for IIPs and post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we have provided the latest findings and discussed the role of these regulatory elements in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis associated with Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia and Covid-19.

T2  - IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering: a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
AB  - Functional electrical stimulation has been widely used in the neurologically disabled population as a rehabilitation method because of its intrinsic and higher ability to activate paralyzed muscles. However, the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the muscle against exogenous electrical stimulus makes it very challenging to achieve optimal control solutions in real-time, that results in difficulty in achieving functional electrical stimulus-assisted limb movement control in the real-time rehabilitation process. Model-based control methods have been suggested in many functional electrical stimulations elicited limb movement applications. However, in the presence of uncertainties and dynamic variations during the process the model-based control methods are unable to give a robust performance. In this work, a model-free adaptable control approach is designed to regulate knee joint movement with electrical stimulus assistance without prior knowledge of the dynamics of the subjects. The model free adaptive control with a data-driven approach is provided with recursive feasibility, compliance with input constraints, and exponential stability. The experimental results obtained from both able-bodied participants and a participant with spinal cord injury validate the ability of the proposed controller to allocate electrical stimulus for regulating seated knee joint movement in the pre-defined trajectory.

AB  - Cobalamin C disease is the most common inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, resulting from mutations in methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C protein (MMACHC) gene. There is associated elevation of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid and decreased synthesis of methionine. It is a multisystem disorder characterised by cognitive impairment, psychiatric manifestations, haematological manifestations and thromboembolic phenomena. Its variable clinical presentation and wide age distribution at presentation necessitates a high index of diagnostic suspicion. The diagnosis is suggested by amino acid chromatography and confirmed by sequencing analysis of the MMACHC gene Parenteral hydroxycobalamin and betaine can bring significant clinical and biochemical improvement and is the recommended long-term therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) such as methotrexate has a proven efficacy in the management of paediatric non-infectious uveitis. However, many children experience significant intolerance to methotrexate while on this combination, leaving a dilemma for clinicians for choosing the subsequent therapeutic roadmap. Continuation of adalimumab monotherapy might be an alternative feasible option under such settings. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of adalimumab monotherapy in paediatric non-infectious uveitis.
METHODS: Children with non-infectious uveitis on adalimumab monotherapy (from August 2015 to June 2022) following intolerance to accompanying methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil were included in this retrospective study. Data were collected at the initiation of adalimumab monotherapy and at three monthly intervals until the last visit. The primary outcome was to evaluate disease control on adalimumab monotherapy as determined by the proportion of patients who had less than a 2-step worsening in uveitis (as per SUN score) and no additional systemic immunosuppression during follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were visual outcome, complications and side-effect profile of adalimumab monotherapy.
RESULTS: Data was collected for 28 patients (56 eyes). The most common uveitis type and course were anterior and chronic uveitis respectively. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis was the most common underlying diagnosis. During the study period, 23 (82.14%) of the study subjects met the primary outcome. On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 81.25% (95% CI; 60.6-91.7%) children maintained remission at 12 months on adalimumab monotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Continuation of adalimumab monotherapy is an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis in children who are intolerant to the combination of adalimumab and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil.

AB  - PURPOSE: The knowledge regarding meniscus has vastly evolved over the past few decades. The meniscus's intact, injured, and repaired status can affect other joint structures, i.e., ligaments, articular surfaces, and overall biomechanics of the knee joint. Due to available evidence's extensiveness, it is challenging to determine the most influential topics and the emerging trends in concurrent meniscus research. This study aims to identify the top fifty cited papers in meniscus research and concurrent knee issues and analyse their characteristics.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted on the Thompson Reuters Web of Science database to prepare a list of top fifty cited articles that included original articles and review articles concerning meniscus. The included articles were analysed for the source journal, investigating institution, country of the corresponding author, year of publication, total citations, annual citation rate, and a qualitative review.
RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in 6768 original articles and 453 review articles. The top fifty cited articles were published from 1969 to 2014 and belonged to 14 journal sources. There were 43 original articles and seven review articles. The average citations per article were 417.4 and the average citations per paper per year were 22.6. Besides the meniscus, a general interest in the clinical assessment scores, anterior cruciate ligament, long-term osteoarthritis, and cartilage was observed.
CONCLUSION: Most of the research concerning meniscus relates to the importance of meniscus preservation, the link between meniscus injuries and concomitant anterior cruciate ligament and chondral injuries, and its role in long-term gonarthrosis. The western countries have contributed the maximum to the top-cited evidence concerning meniscus. The meniscus repair and transplantation techniques have recently gained importance and need further research to qualify for the top-cited evidence.

AB  - PURPOSE: Multi-stranded hamstring-tendon autografts have been widely used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgeries. Recently, smaller diameter hamstring autografts have been linked with the risk of failure or graft rupture. However, there is limited evidence concerning the optimal diameter of the hamstring autografts for ACLR. The current systematic review and meta-analysis analysed the association of ACLR failure with the diameter of hamstring autografts.
METHODS: A systematic search of three major scientific databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) was conducted to identify studies that presented ACLR failure-related outcomes with different diameters of hamstring autografts. The pooled data from the included studies were analysed to investigate the association between ACLR failure and the cut-off diameters of 6, 7, 8, and 9 mm. Subgroup analyses based on the level of evidence and follow-up duration were also performed at each cut-off diameter.
RESULTS: Of the 2282 studies screened, 16 reported failure rates with hamstring autografts of different diameters, 15 of which were included in the meta-analysis. A graft diameter ≥ 7 mm was associated with significantly lower ACLR failure rates than a graft diameter < 7 mm (p = 0.005), based on pooled data of 19,799 cases. Age < 20 years and higher physical activity were associated with significantly higher ACLR failure rates.
CONCLUSION: The current systematic review suggests that the hamstring graft diameter for ACLR should be more than 7 mm considering the significantly higher failure rates with graft diameters less than 7 mm.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The use of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) in the treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 infection has been controversial. Early administration of CCP before hospital admission offers a potential advantage. This manuscript summarizes current trials of early use of CCP and explores the feasibility of this approach in different countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) CCP working group. We recorded respondents' input on existing trials on early/outpatient CCP and out-of-hospital (OOH)/home transfusion (HT) practices in their countries and feedback on challenges in initiating home CCP infusion programmes. In addition, details of existing trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov were summarized.
RESULTS: A total of 31 country representatives participated. Early/OOH CCP transfusion studies were reported in the United States, the Netherlands, Spain and Brazil. There were a total of six published and five ongoing trials on the prophylactic and therapeutic early use of CCP. HT was practised in Australia, the UK, Belgium, France, Japan, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Norway, the United States and some provinces in Canada. Thirty-four representatives indicated a lack of OOH CCP or HT in their institutions and countries. Barriers to implementation of OOH/HT included existing legislation, lack of policies pertaining to outpatient transfusion, and associated logistical challenges, including lack of staffing and resources.
CONCLUSION: Early administration of CCP remains a potential option in COVID-19 management in countries with existing OOH/HT programmes. Legislation and regulatory bodies should consider OOH/HT practice for transfusion in future pandemics.

AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease and stroke. We estimated prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension along with its determinants in India. We used data from the National NCD Monitoring Survey-(NNMS-2017-2018) which studied one adult (18-69 years) from a representative sample of households across India and collected information on socio-demographic variables, risk factors for NCDs and treatment practices. Blood pressure was recorded digitally and hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg or currently on medications. Awareness was defined as being previously diagnosed with hypertension by a health professional; on treatment as taking a dose of medication once in the last 14 days and; control as SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg. Multivariate Logistic regression was performed to estimate determinants. Out of 10,593 adults with a blood pressure measurement (99.4%), 3017 (28.5%; 95% CI: 27.0-30.1) were found to have hypertension. Of these hypertensives, 840 (27.9%; 95% CI: 25.5-30.3) were aware, 438 (14.5%; 95% CI: 12.7-16.5) were under treatment and, 379 (12.6%; 95% CI: 11.0-14.3) were controlled. Significant determinants of awareness were being in the age group 50-69 years (aOR 2.45 95% CI: 1.63-3.69), women (1.63; 95% CI: 1.20-2.22) and from higher wealth quintiles. Those in the age group 50-69 (aOR 4.80; 95% CI: 1.74-13.27) were more likely to be under treatment. Hypertension control was poorer among urban participants (aOR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33-0.90). Significant regional differences were noted, though without any clear trend. One-fifth of the patients were being managed at public facilities. The poor population-level hypertension control needs strengthening of hypertension services in the Universal Health Coverage package.

AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify liver stiffness measurement (LSM) changes after endovascular intervention for Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and evaluate whether LSM changes predict restenosis after endovascular intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with BCS who underwent endovascular intervention and had at least 2 LSM values available after the intervention were included. ΔLSM was the difference between LSMs estimated at the last and second last hospital visits. In patients with restenosis, 2 LSM values before restenosis were included. ΔLSM% was calculated as the ratio of ΔLSM to the LSM at the second last visit and expressed as a percentage. Odds ratio (OR) with confidence interval (CI) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were calculated for the predictors of restenosis.
RESULTS: The median baseline and postinterventional 1-week, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month LSM values were 47.2 kPa (33.8-68.4 kPa), 29.2 kPa (24.5-43.0 kPa), 26.2 kPa (18.6-38.9 kPa), 20.9 kPa (13.3-29.8 kPa), and 17.3 kPa (11.8-25.4 kPa), respectively. Of the 118 patients, including 67 men, restenosis developed in 10 patients after a median (interquartile range) duration of 19 months (11-46 months). ΔLSM% was higher (more positive) in patients with restenosis than in those without restenosis (44.7 [8.3-134.3] vs -6.6 [-19.4 to 14.9], P = .001). ΔLSM% was a significant predictor of restenosis with an OR of 1.032 (95% CI, 1.015-1.050; P < .001). The AUROC for ΔLSM% was 0.831 (95% CI, 0.750-0.893; P = .001), and a ΔLSM% increment of 13.2% predicted restenosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.0% and 74.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: LSM gradually decreases after endovascular intervention, and transient elastography is a promising test for detecting restenosis after the endovascular treatment of patients with BCS.

AB  - Background 
          Pancreatic trauma (PT) accounts for less than 1% of all trauma admissions. Occasionally, PT is undetected during the primary survey and becomes apparent only when complications arise. It occurs in up to 5% of blunt abdominal trauma cases and 12% of individuals with penetrating abdominal injuries. Management is determined by the status of the main pancreatic duct and associated injuries.
          Methods 
          This was an ambispective study conducted at the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from January 2015 to December 2017 (retrospective), and January 2019 to December 2020 (prospective). In total, 113 patients with PT were included in this study.
          Results 
          We analyzed the data of 113 patients with PT included in this study, of which males predominated (93.7%). Blunt PT was present in 101 patients (89.4%) and penetrating PT in 12 patients (10.6%). Half of the patients (51.3%) had the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade III PT, followed by grade II (18.6%), and grade I (15%). Of the total 113 patients, 68 (60.2%) were treated with operative management, and 45 (39.8%) with nonoperative management. Distal pancreatectomy, with or without splenectomy, was the most common procedure performed in our study, followed by drainage. There were 27 mortalities (23.8%) during the study period, of which 7 were directly related to PT and 20 were due to other organ-related sepsis and hemorrhagic shock.
          Conclusion 
          Pancreatic trauma is rare but challenging for trauma surgeons, with persistent management controversies. Early diagnosis is important for favorable results; however, a delay in diagnosis has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Low-grade pancreatic injuries can be successfully managed nonoperatively, whereas high-grade pancreatic injuries require surgical intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyse causes of failure of medical management in benign prostate enlargement (BPE) in patients who undergo surgery following medical treatment and to elucidate parameters which warrant for early surgical treatment.
METHODS: Records of 747 patients who underwent surgery for BPE were reviewed for prostate volume, median lobe enlargement, post void residual urine, duration and type of medical treatment given for BPE. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to find out significant parameters for medical treatment failure.
RESULTS: A total of 601 patients (80.45%) received medical treatment for their lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), for a duration ranging between 3 months and 2 years. Statistically significant difference was found between age, prostate volume, intravesical projection, PSA and acute urinary retention with failure of medical treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: BPE patients with failure to respond with medical management within 3-6 months and/or associated with large size prostate, intravesical projection and raised serum PSA should better be offered surgical treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Multiple definitions of sarcopenia exist and the acceptable criterion that best predicts outcome is lacking. We estimated the prevalence of sarcopenia based on four criteria and assessed their utility in predicting mortality in cirrhotics.
METHODS: In a prospective observational study, consecutive Asian patients with cirrhosis underwent testing for handgrip strength (HGS) and estimation of skeletal muscle index (SMI) using computed tomography at the third lumbar vertebra. Sarcopenia was defined based on the Western cut-off (WC; SMI < 50 cm2/m2 for men and <39 cm2/m2 for women), Asian cut-off (AC; SMI < 36.5 cm2/m2 for men and 30.2 cm2/m2 for women), European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People-2nd meeting (EWGSOP2) definition incorporating low HGS (<27 kg for men and <16 kg for women) with low SMI (defined by the WC), and EWGSOP2 definition with low HGS and low SMI (defined by AC). Risk factors for mortality were assessed using multivariate Cox-proportional hazards.
RESULTS: We included 219 patients with cirrhosis (168 men; mean age 42.6 years) with 50.2% patients having decompensation. Alcohol was the commonest aetiology (33.3%). The prevalence of sarcopenia was highest with the WC (men: 82.1%; women: 62.7%). There was a weak concordance among all criteria (Fleiss' kappa 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.37). Overall, 12-month survival was 86.1% (81.1-91.3%) over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 12 (6-15) months. Ascites (hazards ratio [HR] 6.27 [95% CI 1.6-24.1]; P < 0.007) and SMI (HR 0.92 [0.85-0.98]; P = 0.021) were independent predictors of mortality. The 12-month mortality rate was higher in patients with sarcopenia, irrespective of criteria (log rank P < 0.05). Low HGS and low SMI (defined by AC) was the best for predicting mortality (HR 3.04 [1.43-6.43]; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: A weak concordance exists amongst various diagnostic definitions of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia diagnosed by a combination of low HGS and population-specific SMI cut-off (AC) best predicts mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pathophysiology of sarcopenia in cirrhosis is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the histological alterations in the muscle tissue of patients with cirrhosis and sarcopenia, and identify the regulators of muscle homeostasis.
METHODS: Computed tomography images at third lumbar vertebral level were used to assess skeletal muscle index (SMI) in 180 patients. Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on the SMI cut-offs from a population of similar ethnicity. Muscle biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis in 10 sarcopenic patients with cirrhosis, and the external oblique in five controls (voluntary kidney donors during nephrectomy). Histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for phospho-FOXO3, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, and apoptosis markers (annexin V and caspase 3). The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions for MSTN, FoxO3, markers of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (FBXO32, TRIM63), and markers of autophagy (Beclin-1 and LC3) were also quantified.
RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia was 14.4%. Muscle histology in sarcopenics showed atrophic angulated fibers (P = 0.002) compared to controls. Immunohistochemistry showed a significant loss of expression of phospho-mTOR (P = 0.026) and an unaltered phospho-AKT (P = 0.089) in sarcopenic patients. There were no differences in the immunostaining for annexin-V, caspase-3, and phospho-FoxO3 between the two groups. The mRNA expressions of MSTN and Beclin-1 were higher in sarcopenics (P = 0.04 and P = 0.04, respectively). The two groups did not differ in the mRNA levels for TRIM63, FBXO32, and LC3.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant muscle atrophy, increase in autophagy, MSTN gene expression, and an impaired mTOR signaling were seen in patients with sarcopenia and cirrhosis.

AB  - Introduction Even after advances in medical and surgical treatment, infective endocarditis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative mortality in surgically treated infective endocarditis patients and its correlation with the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) I. Methods This retrospective observational study included 43 patients treated surgically for infective endocarditis, between 2014 and 2019, at a tertiary care center. Mortality in surgically treated infective endocarditis patients was determined in terms of frequency (%). Patients were divided into two groups—survivors and nonsurvivors (died within 30 days of surgery). Mean EuroSCORE I of survivors and nonsurvivors was compared using the unpaired t-test with equal variance. A correlation was sought between mortality and EuroSCORE I as well. The prediction ability of EuroSCORE I for mortality was determined by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Out of 43 patients who underwent surgery for infective endocarditis,11 patients (25.58%) died. Mean EuroSCORE I was 15.90 ± 2.02 in nonsurvivors and 7.84 ± 3.19 in survivors. EuroSCORE I was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (p < 0.05). The area under curve value was 0.9744 (p < 0.001), thus showing that EuroSCORE I predicts mortality in surgically treated infective endocarditis patients. Conclusion The 30-day mortality in patients who underwent surgery for infective endocarditis was 25.58%. There is a significant correlation between EuroSCORE I and mortality. A EuroSCORE I value >14 predicts mortality in surgically treated infective endocarditis patients with sensitivity and specificity of 90.91 and 90.63%, respectively.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of regional versus global charts for identifying small-for-gestational age (SGA) neonates with short-term adverse outcomes.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Level-3 neonatal unit in India.
PATIENTS: Neonates were categorised into SGA and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA; 10th-90th centile) using four charts, namely, the AIIMS, Lubchenco, Fenton and Intergrowth 21st charts. They were followed up for adverse outcomes until 28 days.
OUTCOMES: We evaluated the (1) burden of SGA, (2) sensitivity and diagnostic OR (DOR), (3) relative risk (RR) and number needed to screen (NNS) to detect adverse outcomes in SGA versus 'optimal' AGA (50th-90th centile) and (4) RR of morbidities in 'additional SGA' (ie, classified as SGA by others but not by AIIMS chart).
RESULTS: Among 1367 neonates, 19.6%, 4.5% and 12.5% were classified as SGA by Intergrowth 21st, AIIMS and Lubchenco charts, respectively. Intergrowth 21st had the highest sensitivity (39.1%) but the least DOR (2.6) to detect adverse outcomes; AIIMS chart had low sensitivity (19.3%) but higher DOR (4.3). RR and NNS were 3.7 and 14; 4.4 and 7; 4.0 and 8; 3.6 and 10 with Intergrowth 21st, AIIMS, Lubchenco and Fenton charts, respectively. 'Additional SGA' identified by Intergrowth 21st had lower risk of adverse outcomes than SGA identified by both the charts (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with AIIMS and Lubchenco charts, Intergrowth 21st runs the risk of overdiagnosing SGA neonates who may not be at a higher risk of short-term morbidities.

AB  - PURPOSE: Skeletal muscle ultrasound is a valuable tool for assessing muscle wasting in ICU. Previous studies on skeletal muscle ultrasound in ICU have been performed on lower limb muscles. The current study is formulated to assess the feasibility and reliability of anterior temporalis (AT) muscle ultrasound for measuring muscle wasting in ICU.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study in 48 critically ill patients with sepsis, muscle layer thicknesses (MLTs) and mean grayscale (GS) values of anterior temporalis muscles and quadriceps femoris (Q) were measured at baseline and serially till 7 days. Correlation was made between baseline and change in MLT and GS values of AT and Q muscle and these parameters were compared between ICU survivors and non survivors.
RESULTS: Baseline anterior temporalis MLTs or their longitudinal changes over 7 days did not correlate significantly with the corresponding parameters of quadriceps femoris muscles. The baseline GS values of two muscle groups correlated weakly at baseline, but the change in GS over 7 days showed no correlation. The baseline MLTs of both muscle groups and their longitudinal change over 7 days did not correlate with ICU length of stay. The change in MLT of AT over 7 days was significantly greater in ICU non-survivors compared to survivors.
CONCLUSION: Measurement of ultrasonographic muscle layer thickness and grayscale parameters of anterior temporalis muscle did not show good correlation with that of quadriceps muscle.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the clinical profile, management options, and outcomes of children with stage 4S neuroblastoma (NB 4S) diagnosed at a tertiary care center in a resource-challenged nation. The authors also intend to highlight the factors associated with an unfavorable prognosis in this series of patients.
METHODS: The archives for children with NB 4S, diagnosed over a 24-y period (January 1996-December 2019), were retrospectively retrieved. Data on patient characteristics, management protocols, oncologic outcomes, and overall survival (OS) were reviewed. Multivariate logistic- regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently predicting unfavorable outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 22 children (59% males) were included. Adrenal was the most common (82%) primary site. Liver involvement (100%), bone marrow infiltration (23%), and subcutaneous nodules (9%) were observed upon evaluation. Management involved supportive treatment (22%), chemotherapy only (41%), chemotherapy and tumor excision (28%). Ventral hernia was created in two children (9%) due to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Four children died (4/22; 18%) due to ACS (n = 2) and refractory coagulopathy (n = 2). There were no recurrences and all survivors were disease-free. The 5-y OS was 81.8% with a median follow-up duration of 31 mo (range 9 mo-22 y). Age < 2 mo (p = 0.002), respiratory distress at presentation (p < 0.001), and chemotherapy nonresponsiveness (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with mortality. All three factors were independent predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: Children with NB 4S have a favorable outcome with 5-y OS of 81.8%. Age < 2 mo, respiratory distress at presentation, and chemotherapy nonresponsiveness are independent predictors of a poor outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the daily health-care services. The era of physical consultations is slowly being replaced with teleconsultation, and this current pandemic has tipped the scales further. This study highlights the preliminary experience in providing teleconsultation to pediatric surgical patients at a tertiary care hospital in north India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the electronic medical record system records of the patients undergoing teleconsultation at the authors' department between the June 26, 2020 and the September 26, 2020 was performed. The data were categorized on the basis of the type of consultation (urgent, semi-urgent, or routine) and the type of intervention. A comparison with the data from the corresponding months of 2019 was also performed.
RESULTS: A total of 261 teleconsultations were conducted during the study period, with a success rate of 69% (181/261). Of these, 96% (171/178) were follow-up patients and 56% (99/178) presented with genitourinary complaints. After triaging, only 10% (18/178) of the patients required urgent medical/surgical attention.
CONCLUSION: In the current as well as postpandemic phase, teleconsultation can act as a potent triaging tool and can help in better utilization of resources alongside helping in the maintenance of social distancing by decreasing the number of physical visits to the hospital.

AB  - Environmental and lifestyle factors play an important role in the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A group of international experts from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases voted on a series of consensus statements to inform the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The recommendations include avoiding traditional cigarette smoking in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, screening for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial stressors at diagnosis and during flares (with referral to mental health professionals when appropriate), and encouraging regular physical activity as tolerated. Patients using dietary approaches for treatment of their IBD should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. We recommend formal assessment for obesity and nutritional deficiencies, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a normal body-mass index. A shared decision-making approach to contraception should include the consideration of IBD-related factors, and risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Long-term or frequent use of high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. For primary prevention of disease in the offspring of patients with IBD, we recommend avoiding passive exposure to tobacco, using antibiotics judiciously, and considering breastfeeding when able.

AB  - A man in his early 80s presented to the otorhinolaryngology department with progressively worsening dysphagia to solids and a recent episode of difficulty breathing accompanied by a very brief expulsion of a solid mass from the mouth. Based on the endoscopic appearance of a fatty lesion of an elongated mass with a thick stalk on the posterior pharyngeal wall, a diagnosis of the benign fibrovascular polyp was given after clinical and radiological correlation. The pharyngeal polyp was resected at the base of its pedicle by transoral endoscopy with a thunder beat vessel sealing device. Histopathological examination of the mass revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma composed of mature adipocytes. Following surgical excision, the patient made a full recovery. This case signifies the integrated role of preoperative biopsy, new surgical technologies and targeted therapies in managing pharyngoesophageal polyps.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of submucosally administered platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on the rate of maxillary canine retraction. Levels of soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κb ligand (sRANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were also measured over 2 months.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This split-mouth trial involved 20 sites in 10 subjects randomly assigned to PRP (experimental) side and control side. After alignment, the freshly prepared PRP was injected submucosally distal to the experimental side maxillary canine, and retraction was performed using NiTi closed-coil springs (150 g) on 0.019 × 0.025-inch stainless steel wire. The rate of canine movement was assessed using digital model superimposition at 0, 30, and 60 days. The OPG and sRANKL were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from GCF collected at 0, 1, 7, 21, 30, and 60 days.
RESULTS: Twenty sites were analyzed using paired t test. The rate of tooth movement increased significantly by 35% on the PRP side compared with the control side in the first month (P = .0001) and by 14% at the end of the second month (P = .015). Using the Mann-Whitney U test, OPG levels were found to be significantly decreased on the 7th (P = .003) and 30th day on the PRP side (P = .01), while sRANKL became detectable by the third week postinjection on the PRP side (P = .069).
CONCLUSIONS: Submucosal injection of platelet-rich plasma significantly increased tooth movement during the 60-day observation period. Local injection of PRP significantly altered the levels of OPG and sRANKL in GCF.

AB  - Bloodstream infections are life-threatening. They are responsible for prolonged hospital stays and high healthcare costs. Clinical microbiology has an essential role to play in its management. Direct Gram-stain reporting from positive blood culture bottles has been found helpful. We aimed to evaluate the use of the automated blood culture system in adjunct to the conventional Gram-stain technique, with a direct antimicrobial susceptibility test on the second day. Concordance was highly satisfactory.

AB  - PURPOSE: Systemic absorbtion of topically applied mitomycin C (MMC) during trabeculectomy needs to be evaluated to look for any systemic toxicity, which might be a major concern in certain conditions like pregnancy.
METHODS: After obtaining ethical committee clearance, female patients in the reproductive age group undergoing trabeculectomy with MMC were included. Pregnant/lactating patients, patients with any systemic illness were excluded. During trabeculectomy, 0.02% MMC was applied subconjunctivally for 2 min and then washed. Blood samples were withdrawn at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hrs after the surgery and analyzed of MMC levels using Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 29 ± 12 years. MMC was not detected in any of the plasma samples analyzed as it was less than the detection limit (<1.56 ng/mL) of the employed LC-MS/MS assay.
CONCLUSION: It can be deduced that the systemic absorption of MMC is negligible or the plasma concentration is less than 1.56 ng/ml (1000 times less than the concentration where systemic toxicity was not observed).

AB  - N95 masks filter 95% of the small particles and respiratory droplets (>0.3 µm diameter). Therefore, they are widely used both by general public and health workers during pandemic. When physical activity or exercise is performed wearing N95 mask, it induces hypercapnic environment. The heat burden is also increased leading to discomfort and reduced compliance. This study was done to compare physiological effects and subjective perceptions while wearing N95 mask and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) (2 fans, N95 filter) during incremental exercise. ECG, respiratory movement, SpO2, temperature inside the mask were recorded and perception of discomfort was also assessed. Heart rate variability (HRV) values during baseline were within normal limits in both the mask conditions signifying that cardiac autonomic tone is comparable. During incremental exercise, fall in SpO2 was significantly lesser in PAPR as compared to N95 mask at 60-70% and 70-80% of maximum achievable heart rate. The temperatures inside both the mask conditions were significantly higher than ambient temperature. The scores of humid, hot, breath resistance and fatigue were significantly lower in PAPR than N95 mask. In conditions where prolonged use of mask is required with strenuous physical exertion or exercise, PAPR could be preferred over N95 mask.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To derive macronutrient recommendations for remission and prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Asian Indians using a data-driven optimization approach.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Dietary, behavioral, and demographic assessments were performed on 18,090 adults participating in the nationally representative, population-based Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study. Fasting and 2-h postglucose challenge capillary blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were estimated. With HbA1c as the outcome, a linear regression model was first obtained for various glycemic categories: newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD), prediabetes (PD), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Macronutrient recommendations were formulated as a constrained quadratic programming problem (QPP) to compute optimal macronutrient compositions that would reduce the sum of the difference between the estimated HbA1c from the linear regression model and the targets for remission (6.4% for NDD and 5.6% for PD) and prevention of progression in T2D in PD and NGT groups.
RESULTS: Four macronutrient recommendations (%E- Energy) emerged for 1) diabetes remission in NDD: carbohydrate, 49-54%; protein, 19-20%; and fat, 21-26%; 2) PD remission to NGT: carbohydrate, 50-56%; protein,18-20%; fat, 21-27%; 3 and 4) prevention of progression to T2D in PD and NGT: carbohydrate, 54-57% and 56-60%; protein, 16-20% and 14-17%, respectively; and fat 20-24% for PD and NGT.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend reduction in carbohydrates (%E) and an increase in protein (%E) for both T2D remission and for prevention of progression to T2D in PD and NGT groups. Our results underline the need for new dietary guidelines that recommend appropriate changes in macronutrient composition for reducing the burden due to diabetes in South Asia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information on comprehensive diabetes care comprising glycaemic, lipid, and blood pressure control in India; therefore, we aimed to assess the achievement of treatment targets among adults with self-reported diabetes.
METHODS: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-India Diabetes (INDIAB) study is a cross-sectional, population-based survey of adults aged 20 years or older in all 30 states and union territories of India. We used a stratified multistage sampling design, sampling states in a phased manner, and selected villages in rural areas and census enumeration blocks in urban areas. We used a three-level stratification method on the basis of geography, population size, and socioeconomic status for each state. For the outcome assessment, good glycaemic control was defined as HbA1c of less than 7·0% (A), blood pressure control was defined as less than 140/90 mm Hg (B), and the LDL cholesterol target was defined as less than 100 mg/dL (C). ABC control was defined as the proportion of individuals meeting glycaemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol targets together. We also performed multiple logistic regression to assess the factors influencing achievement of diabetes treatment targets.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2008, and Dec 17, 2020, 113 043 individuals (33 537 from urban areas and 79 506 from rural areas) participated in the ICMR-INDIAB study. For this analysis, 5789 adults (2633 in urban areas and 3156 in rural areas) with self-reported diabetes were included in the study population. The median age was 56·1 years (IQR 55·7-56·5). Overall, 1748 (weighted proportion 36·3%, 95% CI 34·7-37·9) of 4834 people with diabetes achieved good glycaemic control, 2819 (weighted proportion 48·8%, 47·2-50·3) of 5698 achieved blood pressure control, and 2043 (weighted proportion 41·5%, 39·9-43·1) of 4886 achieved good LDL cholesterol control. Only 419 (weighted proportion 7·7%) of 5297 individuals with self-reported diabetes achieved all three ABC targets, with significant heterogeneity between regions and states. Higher education, male sex, rural residence, and shorter duration of diabetes (<10 years) were associated with better achievement of combined ABC targets. Only 951 (weighted proportion 16·7%) of the study population and 227 (weighted proportion 36·9%) of those on insulin reported using self-monitoring of blood glucose.
INTERPRETATION: Achievement of treatment targets and adoption of healthy behaviours remains suboptimal in India. Our results can help governments to adopt policies that prioritise improvement of diabetes care delivery and surveillance in India.

AB  - PURPOSE: VEGF and HIF-1α are important regulators of angiogenesis, overexpressed in various tumors. Lacrimal gland Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a malignant tumor whose angiogenic properties remain unexplored. This study was designed to evaluate the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in lacrimal gland ACC.
METHODS: VEGF and HIF-1α immunoexpression was undertaken in 30 lacrimal gland ACC cases. mRNA expression of VEGF and HIF-1α was analysed in 17 cases by quantitative real time PCR. The results obtained were correlated with clinicopathological features and survival of the patients to determine the prognostic significance.
RESULTS: Immunoexpression of HIF-1α and VEGF was seen in 36.6% and 46.6% ACC cases. HIF-1α expression showed significant association with advanced T-stage (P = 0.001) and VEGF with intracranial extension (P = 0.014) and solid histological pattern (P = 0.045). HIF-1α mRNA expression was seen in 29.4% cases and showed significant association with perineural invasion (P = 0.027). Recurrence occurred in 60%, distant metastasis in 20% and death in 20% cases. Survival analysis revealed that patients with HIF-1α, VEGF immunoexpression, solid histological pattern, perineural invasion, bone erosion, intracranial extension, metastasis, advanced T-stage, and exenteration had poor survival. On multivariate analysis VEGF immunoexpression (hazard ratio, 16.785; 95% confidence interval, 1.872-150.495; P = 0.012) was the most significant poor prognostic factor.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that VEGF is a potential predictor for poor clinical outcome in lacrimal gland Adenoid cystic carcinoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the use of serial ultrasound gastric residual volume (GRV) measurements in predicting feed intolerance in critically ill patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in various intensive care units (ICUs) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Forty-three critically ill patients aged more than 18 years were studied for a total of 130 enteral feeding days. Gastric residual volume was obtained by calculating the antral cross-sectional area (CSA), which is the product of anteroposterior (AP) and craniocaudal (CC) diameters of gastric antrum obtained using ultrasound in the right lateral decubitus position. A baseline measurement was done before the initiation of the enteral feed and termed GRV0, the ultrasound scanning was repeated every 1 hour for the first 4 hours and termed GRV1, GRV2, GRV3, and GRV4, respectively, and the patients were watched for feed intolerance. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to correlate the GRV at each time with feed intolerance.
RESULTS: The data from 43 medical and surgical critically ill patients were analyzed. Out of 130 feeding days, 13 were noted to be feed intolerant. Gastric residual volume at the end of the fourth hour of feed, that is, GRV4 was the best predictor of feed intolerance with 99.3% area under the curve (AUROC), sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 99.3%, and 95% CI, 0.89-0.98 followed by GRV3, with AUROC of 96% and sensitivity and specificity of 92.3 and 96%, respectively, with 95% CI, 0.92-0.99.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Auditory perception and associated cognition involve visual and auditory cortical areas for inference of meaningful soundscape.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate auditory perception of ambiguous and non-ambiguous stimulation in auditory and visual cortical networks for categorical discrimination.
METHODOLOGY: Functional mapping was carried out in twenty early (EB), twenty late blind (LB) and fifteen healthy children, during auditory ambiguous and non-ambiguous stimulation task in a 3 T MR scanner to estimate hemodynamic signal alteration and its effect on functional connectivity. The degree of amplitude low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), correlation analysis and multiple comparison was carried out to map the impact of duration of education and onset of blindness (EB and LB).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Increased functional connectivity (FC) and cross-modal reorganization was observed in auditory, visual and language networks in EB children. FC was increased in contralateral hemisphere in both the blind children (EB and LB) groups and was positively correlated with duration of education performance. Cognitive assessment scores correlated (p < 0.01) with cluster coefficient of FC and BOLD response.
CONCLUSION: FC alterations depend on onset age and audio-haptic training in children associated with increased auditory language and memory perception.

AB  - Introduction
Visual deprivation affects learning and cognition, and maybe associated with structural and functional changes in the cerebral and cerebellar areas. We explored the role of the cerebellum in sensory-motor integration with the visual cortex and their correlation with education duration and age of onset.
Methodology
T1W MRI and two functional tasks (Braille reading and auditory semantics (synonyms and antonyms)) were acquired using a 3T MR scanner in twenty congenital blind (CB) subjects and twenty sighted controls (SC), and analysis was done with the SUIT and CONN tools respectively.
Results
Volumetric changes were observed in the vermis, crus I, II, cerebellum 45,6,3,7b,8b, and posterior cerebral areas of CB compared to SC. ROI analysis for auditory tasks revealed increased functional connectivity (FC) between the posterior cerebellar network, salience network, and language network, and reduced FC between the posterior cerebellar network and default mode network. For both the functional tasks, FC was increased between language regions and bilateral Cerebellum regions (crus I, crus II, cerebellum 45).
Discussion
Increased BOLD activity in cerebellum, visual cortex, and language areas; intact connectivity between the visual and language networks; a positive correlation between the duration of education and functional cluster coefficient and changes in volume suggest integrated semantic language processing by the cerebellum, visual cortex, and language networks indicating functional and structural plasticity of cerebellum.
Conclusion
The cerebellum exhibits neural plasticity for processing auditory perception and Braille reading and supports the visual cortex after visual deprivation. Education enhances sensory-motor coordination in congenital blind participants.

AB  - The B cell "help" function of CD4+ T cells is an important mechanism of adaptive immunity. Here, we describe improved antigen-specific T-B cocultures for quantitative measurement of T cell-dependent B cell responses, with as few as ∼90 T cells. Utilizing M. tuberculosis (Mtb), we show that early priming and activation of CD4+ T cells is important for productive interaction between T and B cells and that similar effects are achieved by supplementing cocultures with monocytes. We find that monocytes promote survivability of B cells via BAFF and stem cell growth factor (SCGF)/C-type lectin domain family 11 member A (CLEC11A), but this alone does not fully recapitulate the effects of monocyte supplementation. Importantly, we demonstrate improved activation and immunological output of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific memory CD4+ T-B cell cocultures with the inclusion of monocytes. This method may therefore provide a more sensitive assay to evaluate the B cell help quality of memory CD4+ T cells, for example, after vaccination or natural infection.

T2  - Aging and Disease
AB  - The population of older individuals is increasing rapidly, but only a small fraction among them is able to experiences a healthy life. Due to lack of physical exercise and oxidative stress, aging leads to sarcopenia and finally end up with frailty. Sarcopenia is a component of the frailty and described as age related degenerative changes in the skeletal muscle mass, strength and quality. Though the loss of muscle strength and mass gradually seem inevitable during aging, it can be partially prevented or overcome by a deeper insight into the pathogenesis. Sirtuin protein leads to longevity across different organisms ranging from worms to mammals. Expression of sirtuin protein increases during physical exercise and thus strengthens muscle mass. Satellite cells leads to muscle repair in a SIRT1 dependent manner. In addition, SIRT1 improves insulin sensitivity and induces autophagy in the aged mice. The current paper discussed the putative role of sirtuins in sarcopenia and frailty. Moreover, it highlighted the pathways by which sirtuins can inhibit ROS production, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions and therefore confers a protective role against frailty and sarcopenia. The critical role of sirtuins in the sarcopenia and frailty pathogenesis can eventually fuel the development of novel interventions by targeting sirtuins.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accurate localization of the pathological parathyroid gland is a prerequisite for minimally invasive surgical management of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Poor imaging or discordance in odd situations like ectopic adenomas, parathyroid hyperplasia, syndromic HPT results in localization dilemma thus causing failed parathyroidectomy. We studied the impact of Fluoro-Choline (FCH) PET/CT imaging in reduction in localization failure of parathyroid adenoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective observational study (2018-2021) of HPT among which 97 patients underwent focused parathyroidectomy (FP). All patients had undergone ultrasound imaging and 99mTc-sestaMIBI scan with early SPECT/CT (MIBI). When this preliminary imaging was doubtful or negative or multiple lesions were expected, FCH PET/CT was performed. We compared the localization accuracy of MIBI scan and FCH PET/CT with surgical outcomes as reference standard.
RESULTS: MIBI scan showed overall lesion detection rate (LDR) of 88.65% in localization of pathological parathyroid gland in 97 patients. The addition of FCH PET/CT improved the overall lesion detection to 97.9%. The overall possible localization failure was reduced from 11.34 to 2.06% with the addition of FCH PET/CT (p < 0.05). Out of 97 patients of FP, 87 patients showed features of parathyroid adenoma. Single hyperplastic gland was seen in 7 patients, lipoadenoma was seen in 1 patient and 1 patient had features suggestive of parathyroiditis on histopathology. FCH PET/CT was a useful adjunct and showed significant reduction in localization failure of parathyroid adenoma.

AB  - ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) insertion is often difficult. Suction catheter-guided PLMA insertion was compared with the standard introducer tool-assisted technique. One hundred sixty female patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic procedures under general anesthesia were randomized into two groups-the suction catheter group (Group SC) and the introducer tool group (Group IT). First-attempt success rate, insertion time, manipulation required, incidence of trauma, and incidence and severity of throat discomfort were compared. PLMA was inserted successfully in the first attempt in 72 of 80 patients in Group SC and in 67 of 80 patients in Group IT (P = .241). Time for successful insertion was 17.31 ± 6.50 seconds in Group SC and 22.65 ± 7.17 seconds in Group IT (P = .001). Manipulation to get a proper fit was required in 9 of 80 patients in Group SC compared with 19 of 80 patients in Group IT (P = .037). Minor airway trauma was noted in 11% of patients in Group SC and 28% of patients in Group IT (P = .001). The incidence and severity of sore throat was significantly lower with the suction catheter than with the introducer tool. Suction catheter-guided PLMA insertion requires less time, fewer manipulations, and results in lower incidence and severity of sore throat than with the introducer tool. Both techniques have a similar first-attempt success rate.

AB  - Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism presenting with a wide variety of organ dysfunctions affecting predominantly the neurological, hepatic, and hematological systems. Due to its multi-systemic nature, administering anesthesia to a patient with WD is challenging and requires an in-depth knowledge of the disease pathophysiology. A systematic search for literature pertaining to the anesthetic management of patients with WD yielded 19 case reports, which we have included in this review to explore and summarize peri-operative concerns and the safe anesthesia practices in this condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of modified Atkins diet (MAD) among children with non-surgical drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) to levetiracetam, when added to on-going anti-seizure medications.
METHODS: An open-label, randomized controlled trial among children aged 2-12 years with non-surgical DRE was conducted. Eligible children were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive add-on MAD or levetiracetam. Baseline and post-intervention seizure frequency at 12 weeks was determined from seizure logs maintained by parents. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, i.e., patients who achieved > 50% seizure reduction from baseline. Adverse events were compared. Analysis was intention-to-treat. (NCT04172311) RESULTS: One hundred and one children were enrolled (MAD-51, levetiracetam-50). The majority of the enrolled children had generalized seizures of mixed types secondary to structural brain lesions and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was the most common electroclinical syndrome (46%). The proportion of children with >50% seizure reduction at 12 weeks was significantly higher in the MAD arm compared to the levetiracetam arm (27/51(52.9%) vs 11/50(22%); p < 0.001). At 12-weeks post-intervention, the change in mean seizure frequency compared to baseline was -47.33 ± 39.57% in the MAD arm and -31.15 ± 32.18% in the levetiracetam arm (p = 0.03). Constipation (41.1%) was the most frequent adverse effect with MAD. Sedation/lethargy (18%) and anxiety and irritability (14%) were the most frequent adverse effects in the levetiracetam group.
CONCLUSION: Addition of MAD was found to be superior to levetiracetam among children with non-surgical DRE with predominant generalized seizures in achieving seizure reduction at 12 weeks. Both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse effects, although higher with MAD, were expected side effects.

AB  - Globally, populations are ageing and the estimated number of hip fractures will increase from 1.7 million in 1990 to more than 6 million in 2050. The greatest increase in hip fractures is predicted in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), largely in the Asia-Pacific region where direct costs are expected to exceed $US15 billion by 2050. The aims of this qualitative study are to identify barriers to, and enablers of, evidence-informed hip fracture care in LMICs, and to determine if the Blue Book standards, developed by the British Orthopaedic Association and British Geriatrics Society to facilitate evidence-informed care of patients with fragility fractures, are applicable to these settings. This study utilized semi-structured interviews with clinical and administrative hospital staff to explore current hip fracture care in LMICs. Transcribed interviews were imported into NVivo 12 and analysed thematically. Interviews were conducted with 35 participants from 11 hospitals in 5 countries. We identified five themes-costs of care and the capacity of patients to pay, timely hospital presentation, competing demands on limited resources, delegation and defined responsibility and utilization of available data-and within each theme, barriers and enablers were distinguished. We found a mismatch between patient needs and provision of recommended hip fracture care, which in LMICs must commence at the time of injury. This study describes clinician and administrator perspectives of the barriers to, and enablers of, high-quality hip fracture care in LMICs; results indicate that initiatives to overcome barriers (in particular, delays to definitive treatment) are required. While the Blue Book offers a starting point for clinicians and administrators looking to provide high-quality hip fracture care to older people in LMICs, locally developed interventions are likely to provide the most successful solutions to improving hip fracture care.

AB  - Death due to abuse and accidental ingestion of methanol is widely known around the globe. The paper presents the postmortem changes in concentrations of methanol in the vitreous humor, aqueous humor, and ocular tissues in a rabbit model in methanol intoxication. Rabbits were intoxicated with methanol at a dose of 6.3 ml/kg through oral gavage. After 3.5 h of methanol administration, the rabbits were sacrificed. Vitreous humor, aqueous humor, and ocular tissues were collected both, perimortem (immediately) and postmortem (17 h post-death). Whole blood and plasma samples were also collected to explore the correlation between levels of methanol in whole blood/plasma and ocular fluids/ocular tissues if any. All the samples were analyzed by Headspace Gas Chromatography. The analysis revealed a decrease in methanol levels at postmortem for all the matrices, except for retina-choroid than its perimortem value. For retina-choroid, no significant change in methanol levels at postmortem was found.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle intervention is the mainstay therapy for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). We aimed to assess the efficacy of an intensive (9 contact points in 6 months) weight-loss intervention among patients with obesity (BMI 25-39.9 kg/m2) and NAFLD in north India.
METHODS: A total of 140 patients (18-60 years) with obesity and NAFLD were randomized into intervention (n = 70) and control (n = 70) groups, at a tertiary-care hospital. Weight, anthropometric parameters, Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP), Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM), liver enzymes, grade of fatty liver and HOMA-IR were measured at baseline (T0) and 6 months (T6). There was a high drop-out, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Completers comprised of 59 participants (n = 30 intervention, n = 29 control). Intention to treat analysis was done.
RESULTS: At T6, ALT normalized in significantly higher (p = 0.03) number of cases in the intervention arm (66.7%) versus control arm (18.2%). No significant improvement was seen in other metabolic, ultrasound or anthropometric outcomes. Weight (p < 0.001), AST (p = 0.01), ALT (p = 0.02), body fat% (p < 0.001), WC (p < 0.001) and CAP (p < 0.001) significantly improved within the intervention arm along with a trend of improvement in steatosis and HOMA-IR. Control group showed significant decrease in weight (p < 0.001), WC (p < 0.001) and CAP (p = 0.02). Twice the number of patients in intervention arm (46.7%) lost ≥5% weight, compared to control arm (24.1%) (p = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: The intensive weight-loss intervention was not effective in improving the treatment outcomes among patients with obesity and NAFLD. However, given the potential of our intervention, we recommend larger trials with more intensive weight-loss interventions.

AB  - Human skin is continually exposed to internal and external forces, dynamic as well as static. The skin is normally flexible and can resist mechanical trauma due to friction, pressure, vibration, suction and laceration to a considerable degree. However, an excess of these forces can abnormally affect the structure and function of the skin, setting the stage for the development of a skin disorder. Repetitive trauma can cause lichenification, hyperpigmentation, erythema, scaling, fissuring, blisters, ulceration and chronic alterations. Frictional dermatoses is an under-recognised entity with no clear-cut definition and encompasses a variety of terms such as frictional dermatitis, frictional melanosis, frictional pigmentary dermatoses and certain other named entities, many of which are confusing. The authors propose to define frictional dermatoses as 'a group of disorders caused by repetitive trauma to the skin as a result of friction of varied aetiology which can have a wide range of cutaneous manifestations depending on the type of insult.' The exact prevalence of frictional dermatoses as a separate entity is unknown. Authors who conducted this review include a group of dermatologists and post graduate students from various institutions. Literature was reviewed through PubMed, Medscape, Medline, ResearchGate and Google Scholar using the terms 'frictional dermatitis,' 'friction and skin,' 'dermatoses and culture,' 'clothing dermatitis,' 'friction melanosis,' 'PPE induced dermatoses in COVID-19 era,' etc. A total of 122 articles were reviewed and 100 articles among them were shortlisted and included in the study, after removing duplications. The review was followed up with further deliberation which resulted in the formulation of a new definition and classification of frictional dermatoses taking into account the morphology, histopathological characteristics, anatomical region affected and the major predisposing factors. The rising incidence of mechanical dermatoses in the COVID-19 era was also emphasised.

AB  - Myelopathy in central nervous system tuberculosis is notorious for poor outcomes, determined by the severity of inflammation and cord level involved. Acute-onset quadriplegia or paraplegia in these cases represents a neuro-emergency. We report a young female with disseminated tuberculosis who presented with acute onset flaccid quadriparesis with loss of bladder and bowel function. Imaging helped identify the extensive involvement of the neuraxis. We propose that, in addition to anti-tubercular therapy, high-dose corticosteroids such as pulse methylprednisolone may result in a meaningful improvement and show greater rapidity of response in cases of severe central nervous system inflammation such as arachnoiditis or myelopathy.

AB  - Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) lead to severe neurological sequalae. Though currently thought to be different syndromes, literature suggests a relation between the two. We present the case of a 45-year-old male who was found to have chronic severe hyponatremia and underwent rapid correction of sodium and developed parkinsonism features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed extrapontine myelinolysis (a type of ODS). The patient received haloperidol for agitated behavior and developed new features of rigidity, fever, tachycardia and elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels and thus neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected to overlap with ODS. We report this case highlighting the difficulty in differentiating the between ODS and NMS and their relationship.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of the Coronavirus-disease associated mucormycosis (CAM) syndemic is poorly elucidated. We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies.
METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing cases diagnosed with CAM and taking controls as recovered COVID 19 patients who did not develop mucormycosis. Information on comorbidities, glycemic control, and practices related to COVID-19 prevention and treatment was recorded. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors.
RESULTS: A total of 352 patients (152 cases and 200 controls) diagnosed with COVID-19 during April-May 2021 were included. In the CAM group, symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean of 18.9 (SD 9.1) days after onset of COVID-19, and predominantly rhino-sinus and orbital involvement was present. All, but one, CAM cases had conventional risk factors of diabetes and steroid use. On multivariable regression, increased odds of CAM were associated with the presence of diabetes (adjusted OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-11), use of systemic steroids (aOR 7.7, 95% CI 2.4-24.7), prolonged use of cloth and surgical masks (vs. no mask, aOR 6.9, 95%CI 1.5-33.1), and repeated nasopharyngeal swab testing during the COVID-19 illness (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). Zinc therapy was found to be protective (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.01-0.19). Notably, the requirement of oxygen supplementation or hospitalization did not affect the risk of CAM.
CONCLUSION: Judicious use of steroids and stringent glycemic control are vital to preventing mucormycosis. Use of clean masks, preference for N95 masks if available, and minimizing swab testing after the diagnosis of COVID-19 may further reduce the incidence of CAM.

AB  - Background: 
          Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been highly effective in weight loss and it has been the procedure of choice for patients suffering from diabetes. There is a high attrition rate in long-term follow-up. Hence, limited long-term data are available.
          Methodology: 
          We collected retrospectively data from a prospectively maintained institutional database. To increase the long-term follow-up rate, a telephonic interview was conducted with patients who had not come for long-term follow-up. Standard definitions were used for weight loss, weight regain, comorbidities, comorbidity resolution, and nutritional parameters.
          Results: 
          Of 142 patients who underwent laparoscopic RYGB between 2008 and 2018, 125 patients (M: 33, F: 92; Age: 42.4 ± 5.2 years) were included in the study. The mean % weight loss at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years was 28.9, 31.8, 31.3, and 31.7, respectively. Mean % excess body mass index loss (% EBMIL) at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years was 67.6 ± 18, 73.7 ± 17.9, 71.7 ± 20.7, and 69.5 ± 24.6, respectively. Median weight regain at 3, 5, and 7 years was 8.4%, 12.7%, and 24% of weight lost. Significant weight regain was seen in 1 patient at 3 years and 3 patients at 5 and 7 years of follow-up. Among patients suffering from diabetes, 50.9% had remission and 45.3% had improvement at 1 year. At 5 years, this was 56% and 40%, respectively. Among patients suffering from hypertension, at 5 years, remission was seen in 11 (64.7%) out of 17. Significant improvements were seen in hypothyroidism, OSA, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and lipid profile. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean levels of fasting blood sugar, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hemoglobin, serum calcium, insulin, c-peptide, serum albumin, and total protein and there was an increase in mean Vitamin D levels at 1 year follow-up. There was a decrease in mean levels of folate, total iron-binding capacity, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase and an increase in mean Vitamin B12, iron, and ferritin postsurgery. However, this was statistically not significant. Nutritional deficiencies were noted. Seven complications were noted out of 142 procedures and no surgery-related mortality. Three patients had significant weight regain beyond 5 years.
          Conclusion: 
          RYGB is a safe and effective bariatric procedure with well-sustained results in long run. Nutritional supplementation is required to correct deficiencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is scanty evidence on the impact of bariatric surgery on urinary incontinence (UI) in the Asian population.
METHODOLOGY: Patients who underwent bariatric surgery from June 2018 to June 2019 were screened using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) questionnaire. Patients having UI were identified and followed until 1 year of surgery using the ICIQ-UI-SF. These were classified as having stress, urge, or mixed type of UI. The prevalence, change in scores, and the number of pads used were compared at baseline and at follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 148 patients underwent bariatric surgery of whom, 41 patients (M = 2, F = 39) had UI. Stress incontinence was seen in 70.7%, 19.5% had urge incontinence, and rest had the mixed type. Using logistic regression, it was found that female gender was the most important predictor of having UI (OR: 8.33). The prevalence of UI decreased from 27.7% at baseline to 8.1% at 6 months and 3.4% at 12 months. The mean ICIQ-UI-SF score improved from 8.76 (SD = 3.2) at baseline to 0.66 (SD = 2.1) at 12 months of follow-up. The proportion of patients with UI using any number of pads decreased from 92.7% at baseline to 9.8% at 12 months. There was a decrease in the number of patients having moderate to very severe UI from 35 (85.4%) at baseline to 2 (4.9%) at 12 months. Proportion of patients showing resolution was highest among the stress incontinence group at 96.5%. Presence or absence of comorbidities did not significantly influence the ICIQ-UI-SF scores.
CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery leads to profound improvement in UI in obese individuals which is well sustained until 1 year of follow-up. Resolution rates might be higher in Asian population.

AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major public health threat for the past three years. The RNA virus has been constantly evolving, changing the manifestations and progression of the disease. Some factors which impact the progression to severe COVID-19 or mortality include comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. In this study, we followed a cohort of patients to evaluate the risk factors leading to severe manifestations and mortality from COVID-19. Methodology We conducted a prospective observational study of 589 COVID-19 patients to assess the risk factors associated with the severity and mortality of the disease. Results In our cohort, 83.5% were male, with a median age (p25, p75) of 39.71 (30-48) years. The most common comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (7.8%) and hypertension (7.9%). About 41.7% had an asymptomatic disease, and of the symptomatic, 45% were mild, 6% moderate, and 7% severe. The mortality rate was 4.1%. Risk factors for severity included breathlessness (p=0.02), leukocytosis (p=0.02), and deranged renal function (p=0.04). Risk factors for mortality included older age (p=0.04), anemia (p=0.02), and leukocytosis (p=0.02). Conclusions COVID-19 commonly leads to asymptomatic or mild illness. The major factors we found that were associated with severity include breathlessness at presentation, leukocytosis, and deranged renal functions. The factors associated with mortality include older age, anemia, and leukocytosis.

AB  - Diphtheria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Although the disease is seen infrequently in the postvaccination era, sporadic cases continue to occur. Cardiac involvement, in the form of myocarditis, is the most serious manifestation of diphtheria and is the most common cause of mortality in these patients. The features of diphtheritic myocarditis on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not been reported previously. In this brief report, we describe the cardiac MRI and histopathologic features on endomyocardial biopsy of a patient with acute heart failure who was later diagnosed to be a case of diphtheritic myocarditis.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a musculoskeletal ailment that affects millions globally. The pain is disturbing associated with impaired motor activity, reduced flexibility, decreased productivity and strained interpersonal relationships leading to poor quality of life. Inflammatory mediators in vicinity of nociceptors and amplification of neural signals cause peripheral and central sensitization presented as hyperalgesia and/or allodynia. It could be attributed to either diminished descending pain inhibition or exaggerated ascending pain facilitation. Objective measurement of pain is crucial for diagnosis and management. Nociceptive flexion reflex is a reliable and objective tool for measurement of a subject's pain experience. Medical Yoga Therapy (MYT) has proven to relieve chronic pain, but objective evidence-based assessment of its effects is still lacking. We objectively assessed effect of MYT on pain and quality of life in CLBP patients. We recorded VAS (Visual analogue scale), McGill Pain questionnaire and WHOQOL BREF questionnaire scores, NFR response and Diffuse noxious inhibitory control tests. Medical yoga therapy consisted of an 8-week program (4 weeks supervised and 4 weeks at home practice). CLBP patients (42.5 ± 12.6 years) were randomly allocated to MYT (n = 58) and SCT groups (n = 50), and comparisons between the groups and within the groups were done at baseline and at end of 4 and 8 weeks of both interventions. (VAS) scores for patients in both the groups were comparable at baseline, subjective pain rating decreased significantly more after MYT compared to SCT (p = < 0.0001*, p = 0.005*). McGill Pain questionnaire scores revealed significant reduction in pain experience in MYT group compared to SCT. Nociceptive Flexion Reflex threshold increased significantly in MYT group at end of 4 weeks and 8 weeks, p < 0.0001#, p = < 0.0001∞ respectively) whereas for SCT we did not find any significant change in NFR thresholds. DNIC assessed by CPT also showed significant improvement in descending pain modulation after MYT compared to SCT both at end of 4 and 8 weeks. Quality of life also improved significantly more after MYT. Thus, we conclude with objective evidence that Medical Yoga Therapy relieves chronic low back pain, stress and improves quality of life better than standard care.

AB  - Fracture healing is a physiological process resulting in the regeneration of bone defects by the coordinated action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoanabolic drugs have the potential to augment the repair of fractures but have constraints like high costs or undesirable side effects. The bone healing potential of a drug can initially be determined by in vitro studies, but in vivo studies are needed for the final proof of concept. Our objective was to develop a femur osteotomy rodent model that could help researchers understand the development of callus formation following fracture of the shaft of the femur and that could help establish whether a potential drug has bone healing properties. Adult male Wistar albino rats were used after Institutional Animal Ethics Committee clearance. The rodents were anesthetized, and under aseptic conditions, complete transverse fractures at the middle one-third of the shafts of the femurs were created using open osteotomy. The fractures were reduced and internally fixed using intramedullary K-wires, and secondary fracture healing was allowed to take place. After surgery, intraperitoneal analgesics and antibiotics were given for 5 days. Sequential weekly x-rays assessed callus formation. The rats were sacrificed based on radiologically pre-determined time points, and the development of the fracture callus was analyzed radiologically and using immunohistochemistry.

AB  - Rectal foreign body is not an uncommon encounter these days in the current medical practice. It usually occurs due to sexual eroticism, sexual abuse, assault, or rarely accidental involuntary insertion. This condition possesses a significant challenge among general surgeons on handling these cases. Diagnosis is usually made by history taking, physical and radiological examination. Here, we present a case of a 22-year-old young male college student with retained rectal foreign body of 3 h duration who presented with impacted foreign body per rectum, nonspecific abdominal pain, abdominal mass, and nonpassage of stool and flatus. Successful removal of rectal foreign body was done manually under local anesthesia in lithotomy position in the operation theater.

METHODS: In this ambispective observational study, we collected data for 146 patients with ACTH-dependent CS (EAS, n = 23; CD, n = 94; occult ACTH source, n = 29). Relevant details were filled in a predesigned proforma and outcomes were ascertained at the most recent visit.
RESULTS: EAS was more common in males (65.2 vs. 27.6%, p < 0.001). Patients with EAS had a shorter duration of symptoms [12 (6-12) vs. 31.5 (15-48) months, p < 0.001] and were more likely to have hypokalemia (82.6 vs. 21.0%, p = 0.001), pedal edema (65.2 vs. 34.2%, p = 0.015), weight loss (34.8 vs. 4.0%, p < 0.001) and systemic infection (30.4 vs. 6.5%, p = 0.006). They also had significantly higher 8 a.m. serum cortisol, midnight serum and salivary cortisol and 8 a.m. plasma ACTH levels. Bronchial carcinoid (n = 10, 43.5%) was the most common etiology of EAS. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in 11 (47.8%) patients with EAS. Eight patients (34.8%) with EAS died at the last follow-up, of whom 7 (87.5%) had metastatic disease. In CD group, overall remission rate was 69.4% (56.1%, early and 13.3%, delayed) and 26.3% of patients with an initial remission had recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial carcinoid was the most common cause of EAS in our cohort. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in approximately every 1 in 2 patients with EAS and approximately every 1 in 3 patients expired till the last follow-up.

AB  - The GNE-associated V727M mutation is one of the most prevalent ethnic founder mutations in the Asian HIBM cohort; however, its role in inducing disease phenotype remains largely elusive. In this study, the function of this hotspot mutation was profoundly investigated. For this, V727M mutation-specific altered expression profile and potential networks were explored. The relevant muscular disorder-specific in vivo studies and patient data were further analyzed, and the key altered molecular pathways were identified. Our study found that the GNEV727M mutation resulted in a deregulated lincRNA profile, the majority of which (91%) were associated with a down-regulation trend. Further, in silico analysis of associated targets showed their active role in regulating Wnt, TGF-β, and apoptotic signaling. Interestingly, COL6a3 was found as a key target of these lincRNAs. Further, GSEA analysis showed HIBM patients with variable COL6A3 transcript levels have significant alteration in many critical pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, myogenesis, and apoptotic signaling. Interestingly, 12 of the COL6A3 coexpressed genes also showed a similar altered expression profile in HIBM. A similar altered trend in COL6A3 and coexpressed genes were found in in vivo HIBM disease models as well as in multiple other skeletal disorders. Thus, the COL6A3-specific 13 gene signature seems to be altered in multiple muscular disorders. Such deregulation could play a pivotal role in regulating many critical processes such as extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, and skeletal muscle development. Thus, investigating this novel COL6A3-specific 13 gene signature provides valuable information for understanding the molecular cause of HIBM and may also pave the way for better diagnosis and effective therapeutic strategies for many muscular disorders.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterised by low bone mineral density (BMD), degeneration of bone micro-architecture, and impaired bone strength. Cissus quadrangularis (CQ), popularly known as Hadjod (bone setter) in Hindi, is a traditional medicinal herb exhibiting osteoprotective potential in various bone diseases, especially osteoporosis and fractures. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning its direct effect on bone health through altering the host immune system have never been elucidated. In the present study, we interrogated the osteoprotective and immunoporotic (the osteoprotective potential of CQ via modulating the host immune system) potential of CQ in preventing inflammatory bone loss under oestrogen-deficient conditions. The current study outlines the CQ's osteoprotective potential under both ex vivo and in vivo (ovariectomized) conditions. Our ex vivo data demonstrated that, in a dose-dependent manner CQ, suppresses the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (p < 0.001) as well as inhibiting the osteoclast functional activity (p < 0.001) in mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs). Our in vivo µ-CT and flow cytometry data further showed that CQ administration improves bone health and preserves bone micro-architecture by markedly raising the proportion of anti-osteoclastogenic immune cells, such as Th1 (p < 0.05), Th2 (p < 0.05), Tregs (p < 0.05), and Bregs (p < 0.01), while concurrently lowering the osteoclastogenic Th17 cells in bone marrow, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and spleen in comparison to the control group. Serum cytokine analysis further supported the osteoprotective and immunoporotic potential of CQ, showing a significant increase in the levels of anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines (p < 0.05) (IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10) and a concurrent decrease in the levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines (p < 0.05) (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17). In conclusion, our data for the first time delineates the novel cellular and immunological mechanism of the osteoprotective potential of CQ under postmenopausal osteoporotic conditions.

AB  - Background: Crocin is a well-known carotenoid with established anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic, anti-tumor, and antioxidant properties. Previous studies have also identified crocin as a potential drug candidate for osteoporosis treatment; however, the mechanisms underlying its direct influence on the host osteo-immune system is unexplored. Hypothesis: In the present study we presume that crocin may enhance bone health via modulating the host osteo-immune system in post-menopausal osteoporotic mice model. Study design and methods: The present study delineates the osteoprotective potential of crocin both under in vitro as well as under in vivo (ovariectomized-Ovx mice model) conditions. For in vitro studies, osteoclast differentiation and functional activity was performed on mice bone marrow cells in osteoclastogenic media supplemented with M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of crocin at different concentrations (10, 50 and 100 µM). For in vivo study, we randomly allocated 8–10 weeks old female Balb/c mice into three groups (Sham, Ovx, and Ovx+crocin). Ovx+crocin group animals were orally administered with crocin (50 mg/kg/day) for 45 days. At the end of experiment, mice were sacrificed and analysis of various osteo-immune parameters was performed for investigating the anti-osteoporotic activity of crocin via various cutting-edge techniques i.e., Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Micro-computed tomography (µ-CT), Flow cytometry, and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results: From the in vitro studies, it was observed that crocin significantly reduced RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis along with inhibiting the functional activity of osteoclasts in a dose dependent manner in mouse bone marrow cells. Moreover, our in vivo data (µ-CT and Flow cytometry) suggested that crocin administration enhances bone health via significantly enhancing the percentage of anti-osteoclastogenic regulatory T cells (Tregs) along with significantly reducing osteoclastogenic Th17 cells in comparison to control group. Immunomodulatory potential of crocin was further confirmed from serum cytokine data where it was observed that there is a significant enhancement in the level of anti-osteoclastogenic interleukin (IL)-10 cytokine along with simultaneous reduction in the levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17. Conclusion: Altogether, the present study for the first time establishes the immunological & cellular mechanisms for crocin mediated enhanced bone health in Ovx induced post-menopausal osteoporotic mice model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effectively addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the new pathogen requires continuous generation of evidence to inform decision-making. Despite an unprecedented amount of research occurring globally, the need to identify gaps in knowledge and prioritize a research agenda that is linked to public health action is indisputable. The WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR) is likely to have region-specific research needs.
METHODS: We aimed to identify a priority research agenda for guiding the regional and national response to the COVID-19 pandemic in SEAR countries. An online, anonymous research prioritization exercise using recent WHO guidance was conducted among the technical staff of WHO's country and regional offices engaged with the national COVID-19 response during October 2020. They were each asked to contribute up to five priority research ideas across seven thematic areas. These research ideas were reviewed, consolidated and scored by a core group on six parameters: regional specificity, relevance to the COVID-19 response, feasibility within regional research capacity, time to availability for decision-making, likely impact on practice, and promoting equity and gender responsiveness. The total scores for individual suggestions were organized in descending order, and ideas in the upper tertile were considered to be of high priority.
RESULTS: A total of 203 priority research ideas were received from 48 respondents, who were primarily research and emergency response focal points in country and regional offices. These were consolidated into 78 research ideas and scored. The final priority research agenda of 27 items covered all thematic areas-health system (n=10), public health interventions (n=6), disease epidemiology (n=5), socioeconomic and equity (n=3), basic sciences (n=1), clinical sciences (n=1) and pandemic preparedness (n=1).
CONCLUSIONS: This exercise, a part of WHO's mandate to "shape the research agenda", can help build a research roadmap ensuring efficient use of limited resources. This prioritized research agenda can act as a catalyst for Member States to accelerate research that could impact the COVID-19 response in SEAR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The advent of molecular driver alterations has brought in a revolutionary transformation in the treatment landscape of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). However, there is a paucity of data regarding mutational testing prevalence and associated outcomes from India.
METHODS: It was a retrospective study. We reviewed the case records of all patients diagnosed with GIST in a tertiary care centre from 2015 to 2021. The clinicopathological, mutational analysis and treatment plans were recorded. The study cohort was characterised by descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Our study included 120 patients with a median age of 53 years (range: 28-77), with a male preponderance of 2:1. The most common site of the primary was the stomach (50%), followed by the small intestine (37%), with 55.8% of the patients having disseminated disease at presentation with a predominance of liver metastasis (67%). The prevalence of mutational analysis among patients prior to referral was 4%. 60.8% of the patients at our clinic had mutational analysis performed, and unavailability of analysis in the rest was due to financial constraints (12.5%), exhaustion of tissue (7.5%), reluctance to repeat biopsy (4.1%) and low-risk patients. We report c-kit in the majority (52%), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) in 19.2% and wild type in 16.4% along with the rarer subtypes: succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST in 10.9% and Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion in 1.3%. Four of the eight SDH-deficient GIST patients had germline mutations (50%). The knowledge of driver mutations led to a change of treatment in 39.7% (29/73), i.e. stoppage of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in 3, switch of TKI in 23, increase in TKI dose in 2 and upfront surgery in 1. The most common change was the use of sunitinib and regorafenib in patients with SDH-deficient GIST.
CONCLUSION: Our study is one of the largest comprehensive series describing the clinical and mutational profile of GIST from India. The mutation testing rates at primary care centres continue to be low. Despite the hurdles, a large percentage of our patients underwent molecular testing, aiding in therapeutic decision-making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a huge burden in India with the majority of patients presenting in advanced unresectable stages. Innovative, low-cost but efficacious regimens that can be easily administered in the outpatient setting are the need of the hour. We envisaged assessing whether a readily available triplet therapy of erlotinib + methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil (EMF) is efficacious in terms of extending life and maintaining the quality of life in such patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-arm, phase II, investigator-initiated interventional study. Thirty-five platinum-resistant/refractory patients of HNSCC were treated with a combination of erlotinib 150 mg, methotrexate 40 mg/m2 (d1, d8) and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 (d1, d8) every 28 days till progression or unacceptable toxicities. The primary endpoint was overall response rates (ORRs) at 3 months; additional endpoints were disease control rate (DCR) at 3 months, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), safety and patient-reported quality of life.
RESULTS: The ORR and DCR at 3 months were 45.7% and 68.5%, respectively. The PFS was 5 months (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 3.9-6 months) and the OS was 9 months (95% CI: 7.4-10.5 months). The 3- and 6-month PFS rates were 86% ± 6% and 45% ± 9%, respectively, while the OS rates at 3 and 6 months were 91% ± 5% and 68% ± 8%, respectively. Rash, mucositis and fatigue were common adverse events occurring in 23 (65%), 14 (40%) and 9 (25.7%), respectively. The most common grade 3 events seen were rash in 5 (14.2%) and diarrhoea in 2 (5.7%). Clinically significant improvement from baseline was seen in many domains of Quality of Life Core Questionnaire and Quality of Life Head and Neck Module.
CONCLUSIONS: The triplet regimen of EMF is a feasible and safe therapeutic option in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory HNSCC. It has demonstrated favourable response rates and improvement in quality of life; however, a randomised phase III study would add more robust value (NCT: CTRI/2020/02/023378).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disparities in healthcare access to internal migrants exist, and the gaps may widen further if appropriate steps are not taken. Innovative approaches are needed to better align the healthcare services with the migrants' needs.
AIM: The aim was to develop and test a supportive strategy of healthcare, which would achieve the desired level of access and delivery of maternal healthcare services to internal migrants living in nine Indian cities.
METHODS: This intervention with the quasi-experimental design was conducted with pre- vs post-intervention comparisons within the interventional groups and with the control group. The intervention was implemented with an inclusive partnership approach. Advocacy and community mobilization were the main intervention components.
FINDINGS: An increased proportion of women sought antenatal care during the intervention. More women initiated seeking antenatal care in the first trimester. Due to intervention, health workers' prenatal (41.7% in the post- against 14.7% in the pre-interventional phase) and postnatal home visits increased (11.6% to 34.7%) considerably.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions with inclusive partnership would improve healthcare access to vulnerable communities such as migrants. Hence, efforts to strengthen the government healthcare system through novel strategies are crucial to provide better healthcare to migrants.

AB  - Although chronic otitis media is a major cause of conductive and mixed hearing loss, auditory rehabilitation is currently not optimal for this patient group. Planning for hearing rehabilitation must accompany strategies for infection control when surgically managing patients with chronic otitis media. Several barriers prevent adequate hearing restoration in such a heterogeneous patient population. A lack of standardized reporting of surgical interventions, hearing, and quality of life outcomes impedes meta-analyses of existing data and the generation of high- quality evidence, including cost-effectiveness data, through prospective studies. This, in turn, prevents the ability of clinicians to stratify patients based on prognostic indicators, which could guide the decision-making pathway. Strategies to improve reporting standards and methods have the potential to classify patients with chronic otitis media preoperatively, which could guide decision-making for hearing restoration with ossicu- loplasty versus prosthetic hearing devices. Appropriately selected clinical guidelines would not only foster directed research but could enhance patient-centered and evidence-based decision-making regarding hearing rehabilitation in the surgical planning process.

AB  - Acute-onset ophthalmoplegia is a perplexing diagnosis in a young child. When the full-blown picture of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia is evident, the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), is almost certain. However, the same is not true for isolated external ophthalmoplegia as it is etiologically heterogeneous. Only anecdotal case reports of childhood-onset acute ophthalmoplegia exist in the literature. Adult series suggest that acute onset external ophthalmoplegia is often immune-mediated and is secondary to anti-GQ1b antibodies. We present a 30-month-old boy with acute-onset bilateral external ophthalmoplegia with highly elevated serum anti-GQ1b antibodies. The child had a rapid and complete recovery with intravenous immunoglobulin. A review of all published cases of childhood anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome was performed. The case highlights that anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome should be considered even in young children with acute-onset external ophthalmoplegia. The disease has a favorable prognosis. The majority improve on conservative management. Treatment with steroids or IVIG may be considered in some after weighing the risks and benefits.

AB  - Retrograde flow in endothelial cell cultures has been shown to induce a pro-atherogenic phenotype. Despite its potential role as a pathophysiological link between cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerotic disease, resting retrograde flows between patients with cardiovascular disease and healthy subjects have not been compared. Further, the vascular characteristics governing retrograde flow in human arteries have not been systematically investigated. Association of central and peripheral vascular characteristics with retrograde flow profile was investigated in 32 healthy subjects and 47 patients with ischemic heart disease. Endothelial dysfunction was assessed by brachial ultrasound-based calculation of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and sub-clinical atherosclerosis was estimated from carotid-intima media thickness (CIMT). Retrograde blood flow velocity (RBFV) and shear rate were comparable between the two groups (RBFV 1.82(0.97-3.32) vs 1.78(1.24-2.65) cm/s p  =  0.79). Augmentation index was a significant determinant of retrograde flow in both patients and healthy subjects. Carotid artery incremental elastic modulus was an independent determinant of retrograde flow patterns in healthy subjects while ejection fraction, cf/cr PWV ratio and forearm vascular conductance emerged as independent determinants in patients. Retrograde flow patterns were also associated with FMD (RBFV r  =  -0.43, p  =  0.004) and CIMT (r  =  0.30, p  =  0.041) in patients. The results of the study suggest a difference in the determinants of retrograde flow in patients and healthy subjects, with central arterial stiffness being a major contributor in healthy subjects while interaction between central, peripheral, and cardio-arterial factors influence retrograde flow in patients with ischemic heart disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a novel modification of tuck-in Tenon's patch graft (TPG) using temporary horizontal mattress sutures and fibrin glue to hitch the graft in the management of corneal perforations.
DESIGN: Ambispective interventional case series.
METHODS: Modified technique of autologous TPG was used to seal corneal perforations measuring 3-5 mm, using horizontal mattress sutures to hitch the graft in a lamellar pocket, followed by application of fibrin glue. The horizontal mattress sutures were removed after the reformation of the anterior chamber. The primary outcome measure was a well formed anterior chamber in the post-operative period and the secondary outcome was epithelization time.
RESULTS: The surgery was performed in 22 eyes. The mean age was 43.86 ± 16.02 (26-66) years, with 14 males and eight females. The etiologies of corneal perforation included dry eye (n = 10), neurotrophic keratitis (n = 6), trauma (n = 2), chemical injury (n = 2) and exposure (n = 2). The mean size of the perforation with the thinned-out area was 4.3 mm (range 3-5 mm). The mean duration of epithelialization was 14.31 ± 2.63 days (7-21 days). No intraoperative complications were observed. All eyes had a well-formed anterior chamber in the immediate postoperative period. Postoperatively, two eyes had graft pseudoectasia due to a thick graft and supra tenon haemorrhage each; one eye each had graft thinning with the formation of pseudopterygium and graft melting.
CONCLUSION: Tenon's patch graft, along with the use of temporary horizontal mattress sutures and fibrin glue, is an effective modification of the technique for managing corneal perforations measuring 3-5 mm.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent literature on managing traumatic duodenal injuries suggests the superiority of primary repair. We hypothesized that duodenal trauma repair by primary closure might not be a safe strategy in an environment dealing predominantly blunt injuries with limited resources.
METHODS: Data analysis was done from the prospectively maintained trauma registry. The study period chosen was from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018. Data of 63 patients were analyzed for demographics, injuries, management, and outcome. Logistic regression was used to identify mortality predictors.
RESULTS: The most common mechanism of injury was blunt (56/63, 88.9%). Forty (63.5%) patients had associated intraabdominal injuries. The most common American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade of injury to the duodenum was three in 21 patients. Univariate analysis showed that mortality was associated with hypotension on presentation, higher duodenal grade, associated abdominal vascular injuries, primary closure, and duodenal leak. Logistic regression showed associated associated abdominal vascular injuries, primary closure, and leak remained significant predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary repair was found to be an independent predictor of mortality. A patient's physiology is a critical determinant of the outcome. Liberal use of tube duodenostomy over primary repair seems reasonable for blunt duodenal injury management.

T2  - Asian Cardiovascular & Thoracic Annals
AB  - Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare pediatric primary lung tumor. We report a case of a child with Down syndrome and a large ventricular septal defect presenting with pleuropulmonary blastoma initially misdiagnosed as spontaneous pneumothorax. Following tube thoracostomy drainage of the pneumothorax, the child underwent surgical closure of the ventricular septal defect. However, the postoperative period was complicated by recurrent left pleural collection requiring prolonged intercostal tube drainage and two thoracotomies to evacuate the necrotic pleural material. The biopsy of the necrotic material was suggestive of type III pleuropulmonary blastoma. In view of the high propensity of metastasis associated with this variant of a tumor, the patient was started on chemotherapy. This case report highlights the possibility of pleuropulmonary blastoma presenting as pneumothorax and emphasizes the need to consider the etiology, before intervening in a child presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: International IgA nephropathy (IgAN) network (IIgANN) prediction tool was developed to predict risk of progression in IgAN. We attempted to externally validate this tool in an Indian cohort because the original study did not include Indian patients.
METHODS: Adult patients with primary IgAN were stratified to low, intermediate, higher, and highest risk groups, as per the original model. Primary outcome was reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by >50% or kidney failure. Both models were evaluated using discrimination: concordance statistics (C-statistics), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, R2d, Kaplan-Meier survival curves between risk groups and calibration plots. Reclassification with net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) was used to compare the 2 models with and without race.
RESULTS: A total of 316 patients with median follow-up of 2.8 years had 87 primary outcome events. Both models with and without race showed reasonable discrimination (C-statistics 0.845 for both models, R2d 49.9% and 44.7%, respectively, and well-separated survival curves) but underestimated risk of progression across all risk groups. The calibration slopes were 1.234 (95% CI: 0.973-1.494) and 1.211 (95% CI: 0.954-1.468), respectively. Both models demonstrated poor calibration for predicting risk at 2.8 and 5 years. There was limited improvement in risk reclassification risk at 5 and 2.8 years when comparing model with and without race.
CONCLUSION: IIgANN prediction tool showed reasonable discrimination of risk in Indian patients but underestimated the trajectory of disease progression across all risk groups.

TI  - Revisiting live attenuated influenza vaccine efficacy among children in developing countries
AU  - Bagga, Sumedha
AU  - Krishnan, Anand
AU  - Dar, Lalit
T2  - Vaccine
AB  - Seasonal influenza epidemics cause significant pediatric mortality and morbidity worldwide. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) can be administered intranasally, induce a broad and robust immune response, demonstrate higher yields during manufacturing as compared to inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), and thereby represent an attractive possibility for young children in developing countries. We summarize recent pediatric studies evaluating LAIV efficacy in developing countries where a large proportion of the influenza-virus-associated respiratory disease burden occurs. Recently, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV in children reported contradictory results; vaccine efficacy varied between Bangladesh (41 %) and Senegal (0.0 %) against all influenza viral strains. Prior to 2013, Ann Arbor-based LAIV demonstrated superior efficacy as compared to IIV. However, due to low effectiveness of the Ann Arbor-based LAIV against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-like viruses, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended against the use of LAIV during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 influenza seasons. Reduced replicative fitness of the A(H1N1)pdm09 LAIV strains is thought to have led to the low effectiveness of the Ann-Arbor-based LAIV. Once the A(H1N1)pdm09 component was updated, the ACIP reintroduced the Ann-Arbor-based LAIV as a vaccine choice for the 2018-19 influenza season. In 2021, results from a 2-year RCT evaluating the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV in rural north India reported that LAIV demonstrated significantly lower efficacy compared to IIV, but in Year 2, the vaccine efficacy for LAIV and IIV was comparable. A profounder understanding of the mechanisms underlying varied efficacy of LAIV in developing countries is warranted. Assessing replicative fitness, in addition to antigenicity, when selecting annual A(H1N1)pdm09 components in the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIVs is essential and may ultimately, enable widespread utility in resource-poor settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) is the most frequently used generic quality of life (QOL) measure in many countries and cultures worldwide. However, no single study has been carried out to investigate whether this questionnaire performs similarly across diverse cultures/countries. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the Q-LES-Q-SF across ten different countries.
METHODS: The Q-LES-Q-SF was administrated to a sample of 2822 university students from ten countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Croatia, India, Nepal, Poland, Serbia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. The Bayesian approximate measurement invariance approach was used to assess the measurement invariance of the Q-LES-Q-SF.
RESULTS: Approximate measurement invariance did not hold across the countries for the Q-LES-Q-SF, with only two out of 14 items being non-invariant; namely items related to doing household and leisure time activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not support the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the Q-LES-Q-SF; thus, considerable caution is warranted when comparing QOL scores across different countries with this measure. Item rewording and adaptation along with calibrating non-invariant items may narrow these differences and help researchers to create an invariant questionnaire for reliable and valid QOL comparisons across different countries.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes in children with MIS-C receiving different immunomodulatory treatment.
METHODS: In this multicentric, retrospective cohort study, data regarding treatment and outcomes of children meeting the WHO case definition for MIS-C, were collected. The primary composite outcome was the requirement of vasoactive/inotropic support on day 2 or beyond or need of mechanical ventilation on day 2 or beyond after initiation of immunomodulatory treatment or death during hospitalization in the treatment groups. Logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses were used to compare the outcomes in different treatment arms based on the initial immunomodulation, i.e., IVIG alone, IVIG plus steroids, and steroids alone.
RESULTS: The data of 368 children (diagnosed between April 2020 and June 2021) meeting the WHO case definition for MIS-C, were analyzed. Of the 368 subjects, 28 received IVIG alone, 82 received steroids alone, 237 received IVIG and steroids, and 21 did not receive any immunomodulation. One hundred fifty-six (42.39%) children had the primary outcome. On logistic regression analysis, the treatment group was not associated with the primary outcome; only the children with shock at diagnosis had higher odds for the occurrence of the outcome [OR (95% CI): 11.4 (5.19-25.0), p < 0.001]. On propensity score matching analysis, the primary outcome was comparable in steroid (n = 45), and IVIG plus steroid (n = 84) groups (p = 0.515).
CONCLUSION: While no significant difference was observed in the frequency of occurrence of the primary outcome in different treatment groups, data from adequately powered RCTs are required for definitive recommendations.

AB  - The outcome for children with rheumatic diseases has been dramatically altered by the use of biological therapies. Increasing use of these agents will need careful monitoring for long term safety, particularly in children. Current data on safety of these drugs stem exclusively from Western literature. There is clear need for a registry of all children with rheumatic diseases who are commenced on biological agents to ensure appropriate pharmacovigilance. In this perspective, we discuss the need for and the role of a biologics registry for children with rheumatic diseases in India.

AB  - Currently, there are no FDA approved antiviral drugs available to treat COVID-19 patients. Also, due to emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the protective efficacy of vaccines could be reduced, hence it is urgent to have alternative treatments for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since, there is a long-standing history of herbal medicine in the treatment of respiratory diseases. In the present study, we investigated two polyherbal oil blend viz. Sudarshan AV and Elixir AV (SAV and EAV) in inhibiting SARS-COV-2. From GC-MS analysis of polyherbal oils (SAV and EAV) a total of 11 active compounds were selected, on the basis of their abundance and activity. Further, from the molecular docking studies, we found an inhibitory effect of these compounds on viral envelope and membrane, spike proteins whilst an agonistic effect with human host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) implicating the crucial role of the individual compound in resistance of SARS-CoV-2. Since, the in-silico results suggest that polyherbal oil (SAV and EAV) contributes in preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human body, we further investigated the efficacy of polyherbal formulated essential oil (FEO; SAV & EAV) in prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in hamster model. The male golden Syrian hamsters (n = 23) were divided into 5 groups i.e., Group 1: Control (n = 3); Group 2: Infected (n = 5); Group 3: Infected + Remdesivir (n = 5); Group 4: Infected + FEO (n = 5) and Group 5: Prophylactic FEO + Infected (n = 5). In both treatment and prophylactic groups, the FEO's significantly reduced the lung injury investigated histo-pathologically and viral load expression measured by real time PCR in comparison to infected hamsters. Furthermore, cytokines expression analysis clearly highlighted the efficacy of FEO's due to its anti-inflammatory activity and overall protection in treatment groups. In conclusion, the FEO (SAV & EAV) seem to be potent in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and related lung injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is important to aid personalized treatment in osteosarcoma. Diffusion-weighted Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI was used to evaluate the predictive value for response to NACT and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Total fifty-five patients with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were recruited prospectively, among them 35 patients were further analysed. Patients underwent 3 cycles of NACT (Cisplatin + Doxorubicin) followed by surgery and response adapted adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes were histopathological response to NACT (good-response ≥ 50% necrosis and poor-response < 50% necrosis) and survival outcome (event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)). IVIM MRI was acquired at 1.5T at baseline (t0), after 1-cycle (t1) and after 3-cycles (t2) of NACT. Quantitative IVIM parameters (D, D*, f & D*.f) were estimated using advanced state-of-the-art spatial penalty based IVIM analysis method bi-exponential model with total-variation penalty function (BETV) at 3 time-points and histogram analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Good-responders: Poor-responders ratio was 13 (37%):22 (63%). EFS and OS were 31% and 69% with 16.27 and 25.9 months of median duration respectively. For predicting poor-response to NACT, IVIM parameters showed AUC = 0.87, Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 77% at t0, and AUC = 0.96, Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 100% at t1. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed smaller tumour volume (HR = 1.002, p = 0.001) higher ADC-25th-percentile (HR = 0.047, p = 0.005) & D-Mean (HR = 0.1, p = 0.023) and lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.052, p = 0.039) were independent predictors of longer EFS (log-rank p-values: 0.054, 0.0034, 0.0017, 0.0019 respectively) and non-metastatic disease (HR = 4.33, p < 10-3), smaller tumour-volume (HR = 1.001, p = 0.042), lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.045, p = 0.056) and higher D*.f-skewness (HR = 0.544, p = 0.048) were independent predictors of longer OS (log-rank p-values: < 10-3, 0.07, < 10-3, 0.019 respectively).
CONCLUSION: IVIM parameters obtained with a 1.5T scanner along with novel BETV method and their histogram analysis indicating tumour heterogeneity were informative in characterizing NACT response and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Existing research on erector spinae plane block and intrathecal morphine in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery is limited.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, 60 patients aged between 18 and 60 years were randomized into two groups (erector spinae plane block and intrathecal morphine). In the erector spinae plane block group, ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block was performed, following which a mixture of 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine and 0.5 mcg/kg of clonidine was injected. In the intrathecal morphine group, 150 mcg preservative-free morphine with 2 mL of normal saline was administered intrathecally. The primary outcome was to evaluate the perioperative opioid consumption in the first 24 h. The secondary outcomes were to evaluate hemodynamic response to surgical stimulus, visual analogue scale score, time to first analgesic requirement, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative opioid consumption, urethral irritation, and incidence of drug-related adverse effects.
RESULTS: Total perioperative opioid consumption in the erector spinae plane block group was 355.0 (265.0, 485.0) μg and 240.0 (145.0, 370.0) μg in the intrathecal morphine group (P = 0.09). However, the patients in the erector spinae plane block group had significantly greater postoperative fentanyl consumption (235.0 [120.0, 345.0] μg) compared with those in the intrathecal morphine group (105.0 [30.0, 225.0] μg). There were no statistically significant differences noted for intraoperative opioid consumption, postoperative visual analogue scale score, time to first analgesic request, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and catheter irritation between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant difference in intraoperative opioid consumption was seen between the erector spinae plane block and intrathecal morphine groups, postoperative opioid consumption was significantly higher in the erector spinae plane block group than in the intrathecal morphine group in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence and genetic spectrum of cardiac channelopathies exhibit population-specific differences. We aimed to understand the spectrum of cardiac channelopathy-associated variations in India, which is characterised by a genetically diverse population and is largely understudied in the context of these disorders.
RESULTS: We utilised the IndiGenomes dataset comprising 1029 whole genomes from self-declared healthy individuals as a template to filter variants in 36 genes known to cause cardiac channelopathies. Our analysis revealed 186,782 variants, of which we filtered 470 variants that were identified as possibly pathogenic (440 nonsynonymous, 30 high-confidence predicted loss of function ). About 26% (124 out of 470) of these variants were unique to the Indian population as they were not reported in the global population datasets and published literature. Classification of 470 variants by ACMG/AMP guidelines unveiled 13 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants mapping to 19 out of the 1029 individuals. Further query of 53 probands in an independent cohort of cardiac channelopathy, using exome sequencing, revealed the presence of 3 out of the 13 P/LP variants. The identification of p.G179Sfs*62, p.R823W and c.420 + 2 T > C variants in KCNQ1, KCNH2 and CASQ2 genes, respectively, validate the significance of the P/LP variants in the context of clinical applicability as well as for large-scale population analysis.
CONCLUSION: A compendium of ACMG/AMP classified cardiac channelopathy variants in 1029 self-declared healthy Indian population was created. A conservative genotypic prevalence was estimated to be 0.9-1.8% which poses a huge public health burden for a country with large population size like India. In the majority of cases, these disorders are manageable and the risk of sudden cardiac death can be alleviated by appropriate lifestyle modifications as well as treatment regimens/clinical interventions. Clinical utility of the obtained variants was demonstrated using a cardiac channelopathy patient cohort. Our study emphasises the need for large-scale population screening to identify at-risk individuals and take preventive measures. However, we suggest cautious clinical interpretation to be exercised by taking other cardiac channelopathy risk factors into account.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anti-GBM nephritis in the pediatric age group is exceedingly rare with concurrent additional pathologies being even rarer. Tissue diagnosis requires a combination of crescentic histomorphology, immunofluorescence showing "paint brush stroke" pattern of linear IgG or rarely IgA, and serum anti-GBM antibodies subject to the disease course and treatment. The authors describe one such case with a dual pathology involving IgA nephropathy and atypical anti-GBM disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old girl presenting with features of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis underwent a renal biopsy showing a mesangioproliferative histology with crescents and an immunofluorescence pattern indicating a dual pathology of IgA nephropathy and anti-GBM nephritis. Additional ancillary testing including staining for IgG subclasses and galactose-deficient IgA (KM55) helped to confirm the diagnosis. She responded to steroid pulses and plasma exchange therapy, was off dialysis after 8 weeks with a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, and however remains proteinuric at last follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Concurrent anti-GBM nephritis and IgA nephropathy is a rare occurrence and possibly arises from a complex interaction between the anti-GBM antibodies and the basement membrane unmasking the antigens for IgA antibodies. Additional newer techniques like immunofluorescence for KM55 are helpful in establishing the dual pathology.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement
AB  - Neuromuscular disorders, especially in patients with cerebral palsy (CP), lead to foot deformities and affect foot biomechanics leading to compromised gait. Thus, the foot kinematic measurement is of particular interest to understand and characterize the walking pattern. The present work aims to develop a wearable instrument to measure foot kinematics such as foot-to-ground angle (FGA) in 3-D planes and to measure the foot clearance, i.e., toe clearance (TC) and heel clearance (HC). A template-based outsole was developed that incorporated optical distance sensors located anatomically on the outsole and a magnetometer to measure the foot kinematics. The developed system was validated against the reference marker-based motion capture system from Noraxon, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. The data from eight able-bodied participants were acquired simultaneously from both the systems (developed and the reference system) at three different walking speeds. A center of pressure (CoP)-based feedback was presented to the participants to shift the sagittal CoP anteriorly, posteriorly, and medially to simulate the walking pattern of patients with neuromuscular disorder at three different foot landing strategies. It was found that more than or equal to 96.48% values of the differences in both the systems is between the limit of agreement, values of Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) were more than or equal to 0.76, and values of root mean square error (RMSE) were less than or equal to 3.45°. Furthermore, a wireless wristband was developed and validated for real-time vibrotactile feedback. Since instrumented outsole (IO) is wearable, low-cost, and easy to use and implement, it has a great potential in real-time foot kinematic measurements.

AB  - High-intensity statins are the cornerstone of medical management in Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS). However, their effect on neurocognition are less clear. In this prospective observational study, we gave guideline-directed high-intensity atorvastatin 40 mg to middle-aged statin-naïve ACS patients. Memory assessments were performed before and 6 months after statin therapy using 2 validated scales-the Post-Graduate Institute Memory Scale (PGI-MS), and the Logical Memory Passage Test (LMPT). There was no significant difference in the mean PGI-MS test scores (baseline 75.4 ± 7.9, 6months 76.5 ± 8.2;p = 0.26) or the overall composite scores (baseline 32.02 ± 3.2, 6months 32.8 ± 3.1; p = 0.20), after 6 months of statin use. There was a small improvement in immediate recall (baseline score 8.5 ± 2.5, 6 months 9.04 ± 1.8; p = 0.05), and delayed recall (baseline 6.1 ± 2.6, 6 months 6.9 ± 1.9, p = 0.002). High-intensity atorvastatin use did not affect memory at 6 months among statin-naïve middle-aged patients with ACS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive aging is a complex phenomenon, which comprises various cognitive skills, broadly categorized into fluid and crystallized intelligence. Crystallized intelligence (gc) tends to be maintained, as opposed to fluid intelligence (gf), which tends to decline rapidly with age. The association of the two with cognitive decline remains a matter of conjecture requiring further research.
AIM: The aim of the study was to identify the variables of gc and gf from a population data of Longitudinal Aging Study in India-Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD) study and investigate its relationship with the onset of cognitive impairment using discrepancy analysis against neuropsychological tests.
METHODS: This analysis of data from LASI-DAD study was carried out on a sample of 3,223 participants. They were assessed on extensive thirteen cognitive tests and one subjective test of cognition. Standardized score was used for discrepancy analysis. Fluid ability minus crystallized ability was used to assess the cognitive impairment. Any statistical significance with the score difference >0.99 SD was defined as a presence of cognitive decline. Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) were used as gold standard.
RESULTS: With increased discrepancy score, each cognitive parameter score declined which was found to be statistically significant. In HMSE (Normal = 25.81 ± 3.39; Impaired = 23.17 ± 3.54; p = <0.001), there was a drop of 2 point scores in identifying cognitive impairment in the population sample as per the gold standard. A similar trend was evident in other neurocognitive domains as well.
CONCLUSION: Crystallized-fluid intelligence discrepancy analysis has a strong potential in predicting the onset of cognitive decline ahead of time, facilitating early intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is important to aid personalized treatment in osteosarcoma. Diffusion-weighted Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI was used to evaluate the predictive value for response to NACT and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Total fifty-five patients with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were recruited prospectively, among them 35 patients were further analysed. Patients underwent 3 cycles of NACT (Cisplatin + Doxorubicin) followed by surgery and response adapted adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes were histopathological response to NACT (good-response ≥ 50% necrosis and poor-response < 50% necrosis) and survival outcome (event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)). IVIM MRI was acquired at 1.5T at baseline (t0), after 1-cycle (t1) and after 3-cycles (t2) of NACT. Quantitative IVIM parameters (D, D*, f & D*.f) were estimated using advanced state-of-the-art spatial penalty based IVIM analysis method bi-exponential model with total-variation penalty function (BETV) at 3 time-points and histogram analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Good-responders: Poor-responders ratio was 13 (37%):22 (63%). EFS and OS were 31% and 69% with 16.27 and 25.9 months of median duration respectively. For predicting poor-response to NACT, IVIM parameters showed AUC = 0.87, Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 77% at t0, and AUC = 0.96, Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 100% at t1. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed smaller tumour volume (HR = 1.002, p = 0.001) higher ADC-25th-percentile (HR = 0.047, p = 0.005) & D-Mean (HR = 0.1, p = 0.023) and lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.052, p = 0.039) were independent predictors of longer EFS (log-rank p-values: 0.054, 0.0034, 0.0017, 0.0019 respectively) and non-metastatic disease (HR = 4.33, p < 10-3), smaller tumour-volume (HR = 1.001, p = 0.042), lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.045, p = 0.056) and higher D*.f-skewness (HR = 0.544, p = 0.048) were independent predictors of longer OS (log-rank p-values: < 10-3, 0.07, < 10-3, 0.019 respectively).
CONCLUSION: IVIM parameters obtained with a 1.5T scanner along with novel BETV method and their histogram analysis indicating tumour heterogeneity were informative in characterizing NACT response and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The InPOG-HL-15-01, a multicentric prospective study, used a risk-stratified and response-based approach with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) backbone to treat children and adolescents with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and reduce the use of radiation therapy (RT). Children/adolescents with bulky disease or inadequate response at early response assessment (ERA) after two cycles of chemotherapy were assigned to receive RT. For ERA, positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) was recommended but not mandatory in view of limited access. This study aimed to compare the impact of using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and PET-CT on treatment decisions and outcomes.
METHODOLOGY: 396 patients were enrolled and 382 had an ERA at the assigned time point. Satisfactory response was defined as Deauville score 3 or less for patients undergoing PET-CT and complete response (CR)/very good partial response (VGPR) for patients undergoing CECT. Outcomes of interest incorporate 5 year event-free survival (EFS), EFS including abandonment (EFSa), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: At ERA, satisfactory response was documented in 277 out of 382 (72.5%) participants and this was significantly higher in PET-CT (151 out of 186, 81.2%) as compared with CECT-based assessments (126 out of 196, 64.3%) respectively (p value < .001). Amongst the 203 patients with nonbulky disease (wherein the indication for RT was entirely dependent on ERA), 96 out of 114 (84.2%) and 61 out of 89 (68.5%) patients achieved a satisfactory response according to the PET-CT and CECT (p value = .008) respectively and hence a lesser proportion of patients in the PET-CT arm received RT. Despite a lower usage of RT the 5 year OS of both groups, ERA based on CECT (91.8%) versus PET-CT (94.1%) was comparable (p value = .391) and so was the 5 year EFS (86.7 vs. 85.5%, p value = .724).
CONCLUSION: Use of PET-CT as the modality for ERA is more likely to indicate a satisfactory response as compared with CECT and thereby decreases the need for RT in response-based treatment algorithm for HL-afflicted children. The reduction in the application of RT did not impact the overall outcome and plausibly would lower the risk of delayed toxic effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Catheter malfunction secondary to omental wrapping is a frequent complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Of the various methods of peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion (PDCI), open surgical insertion under local anesthesia is most widely practiced. Laparoscopic omentectomy is often undertaken as a salvage procedure in case of malfunctioning catheters. However, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the role of prophylactic laparoscopic omentectomy on catheter function. This pilot RCT was undertaken to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic omentectomy on the incidence of catheter malfunction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients were randomized into three groups: laparoscopic PDCI with omentectomy (Group A), laparoscopic PDCI without omentectomy (Group B) and open surgical PDCI (Group C). The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter malfunction at 6 weeks and 3 months.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients completed follow-up, with 16, 11, and 14 patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Incidence of catheter malfunction was 6.2%, 27.3%, and 14.3% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively, at 6 weeks and 6.2%, 36.4%, and 21.4% at 3 months, respectively. In patients with previously failed catheter insertion (n = 23), malfunction at 3 months was 8.3% (1/12) in patients who had omentectomy, compared with 45.5% (5/11) in those who did not (P = 0.069). Operating time was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in Group A.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic omentectomy may be associated with a lower incidence of catheter malfunction, especially in patients with previously failed peritoneal dialysis catheter. Data from this pilot RCT can be used to design a large trial with an adequate number of patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The genetic basis for the spread of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium is largely unexplored in India. The present study aimed to investigate the plasmid diversity and variation of Tn1546 associated with vanA harbouring VREfm isolates.
METHODS: A total of 122 VREfm isolates collected from blood cultures were included in this study. MLST analysis was performed on all isolates, and they were also screened for the presence of vanA and vanB genes. Whole genome sequencing was performed for a subset of fifteen VREfm isolates belonging to ST1643.
RESULTS: All of the 122 VREfm isolates carried the vanA gene. Twenty-four different sequence types were seen; of these, ST1643, ST80 and ST17 were predominant. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 15 VREfm isolates belonging to ST1643. For eight isolates the vanA gene was found on pRUM-like circular plasmids, and for the remaining seven isolates, the vanA gene was found on the linear plasmids. Novel Tn1546 variants carrying vanA were found on both circular and linear plasmids. Interestingly, co-presence of vanA and optrA were seen in the backbone of three linear plasmids.
CONCLUSION: Multiple vanA-carrying plasmids and Tn1546-like elements were involved in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance in VREfm. The co-occurrence of Tn1546 carrying vanA and Tn554 family transposon carrying optrA on the backbone of plasmids is worrisome. The dissemination of such plasmids may pose treatment and infection control challenges.

AB  - Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) plays an important role in the management of thyroid malignancies. Incidentally found FDG avid nodule needs further workup to rule out its malignant potential. 18F-FDG PET/CT has a proven role in detecting recurrent disease or the metastatic workup of the thyroglobulin elevated negative radioiodine scan (TENIS) scenario. In managing histologically aggressive carcinoma of the thyroid, 18F-FDG PET/CT has a proven role. The theranostic potential has been explored with PET/CT using 68Ga-SSA, 68Ga-PSMA,68Ga-FAPI, and 68Ga-DOTA-RGD. The 124I PET/CT role is just being investigated for better spatial resolution and helps in dosimetry.

AB  - Background: Radioactive iodine lobar ablation (RAILA) of the contralateral thyroid lobe has been suggested as an alternative to completion thyroidectomy in patients of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who underwent initial hemithyroidectomy. However, data on long-term outcomes are scarce. In this study, we intended to describe the long-term outcomes of RAILA versus completion thyroidectomy in a cohort of low-risk DTC patients. Methods: Data of patients with low-risk DTC who underwent initial hemithyroidectomy, and were subsequently treated with either completion thyroidectomy or RAILA between 1996 and 2015, were collected and analyzed. The treatment outcomes included ablation rate, recurrence rate, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and adverse events, and were validated by propensity score matching analysis. Results: Of the 1243 patients (median age: 34 years, range: 5-78) with low-risk DTC, 514 patients underwent upfront RAILA while 729 patients underwent completion thyroidectomy followed by remnant ablation. The ablation rate following the first radioactive iodine (131I) cycle was 75.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-78.9] in the RAILA group versus 84.1% [CI 81.2-86.6] in the completion thyroidectomy group (p < 0.001). Over median follow-up of 11.4 years (interquartile range: 8.3-15.8), the recurrence rates between the two groups were not significantly different (1.6% [CI 0.7-3.2] vs. 1.0% [CI 0.4-2.1], respectively, p = 0.343). The product limit estimate of RFS at 10 years was 98.6% [CI 97.6-99.6%] in the RAILA group versus 99.1% [CI 98.3-99.9%] in the completion thyroidectomy group (p = 0.391). The outcomes in 497 matched pairs generated through propensity score analysis were similar. None of the patients in the RAILA group experienced permanent hypocalcemia or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, while the corresponding rates in the completion thyroidectomy group were 10/729 (1.4%) (p = 0.006) and 5/729 (0.7%) (p = 0.080), respectively. Radiation thyroiditis was seen in 25/514 (4.9%) patients in the RAILA group versus 3/729 (0.4%) in the completion thyroidectomy group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Upfront RAILA is seen to be a noninvasive, safe, and effective alternative to surgical completion thyroidectomy in low-risk DTC patients in the absence of macroscopic malignancy in the remaining thyroid lobe.

AB  - Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is known to cause for 8%-24% of all tuberculosis (TB) cases in the world.[1] The commonest extra-pulmonary sites to be affected in EPTB are lymph nodes and pleura, other sites being urogenital system, central nervous system, eye, cutaneous tissue and skeletal system. GUTB is insidious in onset and manifests most commonly as infertility sometimes present with chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, bladder dysfunction and renal failure. We are discussing two case reports of GUTB, first one was an isolated case of tuberculous epididymo-orchitis in a 20 year old male and second a 29 year old male with TB involving the kidney along with genital organs. The cases were unique because of the atypical presentation and delayed effective treatment (in one case), despite the best diagnostic approach used.

AB  - CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Patients undergoing exenteration have significant anxiety and depression, and lower quality of life that worsens after surgery. Therefore, counselling by an eye health-care provider along with the team of psychologist and psychiatrist could be provided pre-operatively to assess baseline psychosocial status and be continued post-operatively to look for any deterioration.
BACKGROUND: Orbital exenteration comes with psychological trauma of disfigurement of face. The study aimed to evaluate the quality of life, anxiety and depression in patients undergoing orbital exenteration, before and after the procedure; and also compared the same with patients previously rehabilitated by spectacle-mounted prosthesis after exenteration.
METHODS: It was a prospective cohort study. Group I included patients who were planned to undergo orbital exenteration, and group II were those already using spectacle-mounted prosthesis post orbital exenteration for at least 3 months. Level of depression was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), anxiety using Generalised Anxiety and Depression scale-7(GAD-7), and quality of life was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) score.
RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were recruited in group I and 10 patients in group II. The baseline demographic factors were comparable. The scores for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were significantly higher at 3-month post-exenteration follow-up, indicating significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression after orbital exenteration in group I. Both these scores were significantly lower in group II compared to group I (3 months follow-up), indicating lower levels of anxiety and depression after rehabilitation with prosthesis. The FACT-G and its subscores were all significantly higher in group II patients compared to post-operative scores of group I patients, indicating higher overall quality of life after rehabilitation with prosthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing exenteration have a significant level of anxiety and depression, and lower quality of life that worsens after orbital exenteration.

The dispersion coating produced a uniform coating of PEEK microparticles on the surface and along the cross-section of CF tow to overcome the low melt flow of PEEK, a high-performance thermoplastic. The PAAS formed a layer of PI nanoparticles on CF acting as an interface between CF and PEEK in the composite. The composites yielded a flexural strength of ∼1160 MPa; tensile strength of ∼1900 MPa; compressive strength of  ∼600 MPa; interlaminar shear strength of ∼70 MPa and free of void evident from micro-CT and microstructure evaluations. A detailed physiochemical study of the dispersion, coated tow and composite are provided to understand the mechanism of the dispersion coating process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies and published reports have not commented on the change in the proportion of the Indian population that consumed alcohol over the years.
METHODS: We report the findings on changes in alcohol use in India over the past two decades, based on a secondary analysis of the data gathered over the successive National Family Health Surveys (NFHS-3 to 5).
RESULTS: There was a significant decline (P < 0.001) of around 8% and 45% for the current use of alcohol among men and women from NFHS-3 to NFHS-4. There was a decline in the proportion of men reporting alcohol use across all but one state in NFHS-5 compared to NFHS-3. The decline was statistically significant (P < 0.001) for all but one state. There was a decline in the proportion of women reporting alcohol use in 12 states and an increase in three states. Also, there was a significant (P < 0.001) decline in the proportion of men reporting alcohol use in all the states in NFHS-5 compared to NFHS-4. There was an increase in the proportion of women reporting alcohol use in nine states (statistically significant in six states) in NFHS-5 compared to NFHS-4. However, the proportions were more than NFHS-3 values in two states.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations on changes in alcohol use in the country over the past two decades will help better understand the trends in alcohol consumption and help better plan the future strategy to address alcohol use and alcohol use disorders.

AB  - AIM: To investigate abnormalities in bone mineral density, trabecular bone score and vertebral fractures in male patients with alcohol use disorder to understand the impact on bone health.
METHODS: The study subjects included 134 male patients. Controls were 134 age matched healthy males. Assessments were made of the bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score (TBS) and vertebral morphometry (VFA) for vertebral fractures. Biochemical measurements included serum total T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25- Hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH) D.
RESULTS: The mean BMD at total forearm, proximal forearm (or distal 1/3) and mid forearm was significantly higher in the alcohol use disorders (AUD) group than the controls (P < 0.01). Around 15% of patients with AUD had VFs compared with 9.0% of the healthy controls (P = 0.19). For each kg/m2 gain in body mass index (BMI), lumbar spine and total hip BMD increased by 0.009 and 0.014 g/cm2, respectively. Lumbar and hip BMD decreased by 0.002 and 0.003 g/cm2 per year increase in duration of alcohol used. For every 5 years increase in age of the patients the odds of having VFs increased by 39% (odds ratio 1.393 [95% confidence interval = 1.031-1.881, P = 0.03]).
CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study suggest that persons with AUD in third and fourth decades of life, with BMI in normal range and with alcohol use disorder duration of around one decade might have no major alteration in BMD and TBS. Impact of alcohol use in this population was manifest by marginal increase in the prevalence of mild grade of vertebral fractures, mostly in the thoracic region.

AB  - Gaming disorder is a health concern associated with significant impairment. Digital technology can be helpful for implementing preventive measures for gaming disorder. This randomized trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of an e-Health intervention to prevent gaming disorder among college students. This randomized trial compared an online intervention module aimed at improving knowledge, skill and attitude of the students and empower them with self- help strategies to monitor and regulate their gaming behavior with an aim to prevent gaming disorder, with wait list control. The sample comprised of 30 cases and 33 controls. The understanding of the concept of gaming, understanding of difference between gaming and gaming disorder, understanding of adverse effects associated with gaming disorder, understanding of screening of gaming disorder and self-help techniques of regulating gaming disorder increased more in the intervention group than control. The participants most favored self-monitoring and strategies to promote healthy lifestyles for regulating gaming. Online digital intervention can be effectively used as a strategy to prevent gaming disorder among college students. Such an intervention can empower students with strategies to regulate their extent of gaming.

AB  - Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016 was promulgated in the state and a complete prohibition on alcohol was declared within the state of Bihar. We aimed to assess the impact of the prohibition on extent and pattern of alcohol use in the state of Bihar using the National Family Health Survey data. We also compared the data from Bihar with the data for the whole country, its neighbouring states and the state of Gujarat. There was a 41.78% reduction in the proportion of men who reported alcohol use in Bihar. Among those who reported alcohol use proportion of those who used 'almost every day' reduced by 29.72%. There was a 69.56% reduction in the proportion of women in Bihar who reported alcohol use. There was a significant increase in proportion of men reporting use of tadi madi and country liquor. Since the prohibition of alcohol in the state of Bihar there has been a reduction in self-reported alcohol use among men and women. However, alcohol use continues to be reported in the state even after the prohibition. There are states in the country that have similar extent of alcohol use as compared to Bihar, despite lack of prohibition. This warrants a relook at the policy to address what the prohibition could not achieve.

AB  - AIMS: To assess recent changes in the extent and pattern of alcohol use in India using the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data.
METHODS: We used unit-level data from both rounds of NFHS. The pattern of alcohol use was categorized as: 'almost every day', 'almost once a week' and 'less than once a week'. The information was segregated for the urban and rural settings. Information was also available on the type of alcoholic beverage used by the respondents. The z test for differences in proportions was carried out for the study variables.
RESULTS: Findings suggest a 22.37 and 39.02% reduction in the proportion of men and women who reported alcohol use, respectively. The proportion of men reporting 'almost every day' and 'about once a week' consumption of alcohol increased by 24.19 and 7.14%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: With the caveats of expected limitations of surveys, the findings suggest an overall decrease in alcohol use in India, though the proportion of men with more frequent alcohol has increased. There is a need to strengthen the investment in the initiatives targeted at the harms due to alcohol use.

AU  - Balhara, Yatan Pal Singh
AU  - Singh, Swarndeep
AU  - Yadav, Zenia
T2  - Asian Journal of Psychiatry
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to study the attributes of the digital media reports on death due to suicide attributed to gaming. We also aimed to assess the overlap between the 'gaming' and 'gambling' activities in these media reports.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The online media reports on the theme of deaths due to suicides attributed to digital gaming in India were retrieved using the Google News online platform. The news reports were searched in the tor browser using the keywords "gaming suicide India" or "gaming death India".
RESULTS: Gaming was identified as the direct reason for death due to suicide in an overwhelming majority (94.8%) of news reports. A large proportion of the reports failed to report death due to suicide in a responsible manner following the guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicide given by the World Health Organization (WHO). Stakeholders' views and opinions mentioned in the news reports included parents, caregivers or friends (17.5%), other gamers (3.1%), gaming industry (8.3%), and mental health professionals (5.2%). Around 24 per cent reports advocated a ban on 'gaming'.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our observations we recommend responsible reporting on death due to suicide in the online news. Also, there should be a more rigorous and systematic attempt before reaching at the conclusion while attributing these deaths to gaming. Finally, the news reports should ensure that the boundaries between 'gaming' and 'gambling' do not get blurred.

AB  - Background: This exploratory study was meant to assess clinical and safety data with a novel fibroblast activation protein inhibitor-based targeted theranostics as a salvage treatment option in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) patients who had progressed on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Methods: Patients with metastatic RR-DTC who progressed on sorafenib/lenvatinib were prospectively recruited. If [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan demonstrated moderate-to-excellent uptake in metastases, and patients had given informed consent, they received intravenous [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 as therapy at eight-weekly intervals. The primary endpoints were thyroglobulin (Tg) response and functional imaging response. The secondary endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. The grading of toxicities was performed by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEV5.0). The sequential images were acquired by a dual-headed gamma camera, and dosimetric calculations were performed by using OLINDA/EXM V2.1. Results: Fifteen patients were recruited [age: 55 ± 9 years (range: 39-67)]. [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 had median whole-body Teff of 88.06 hours (interquartile range [IQR]: 86.6-99). The colon was identified as a critical organ. The whole-body effective dose was 1.62E-01 ± 1.53E-02 mSv/MBq. A total of 45 cycles were administered, and the median cumulative administered activity was 8.2 ± 2.7 GBq (range 5.5-14 GBq). The median absorbed doses to the tumor lesions were 1.08E+01 (IQR: 4.16E+00 to 8.97E+01) mSv/MBq per cycle. The Serum Tg level significantly decreased after treatment [(median Tg: baseline-10,549 ng/mL (IQR: 3066.5-39,450) versus at the time of assessment: 5649 ng/mL (IQR: 939.5-17,099), p = 0.0005)]. Molecular response assessment revealed no complete response; however, partial response was documented in four, and stable disease in three patients. The VASmax scores [pre-therapy: 9 (IQR: 8-10) versus follow-up: 6 (3-6) (p-0.0001)], and ECOG [3, (IQR: 2-3 vs. 2, (IQR: 2-3) (p-0.0078)] performance scores significantly improved after treatment. None of the patients experienced grade III/IV hematological, renal, or hepatotoxicity. Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that the novel molecule [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 is safe, seems effective, and, most importantly, opens up a new avenue for the treatment of aggressive RR-DTC patients who have exhausted all standard line of treatments.

AB  - Recently, great interest has been gained regarding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as an excellent target for theranostics. Several FAP inhibitor molecules such as [68Ga]Ga-labelled FAPI-02, 04, 46, and DOTA.SA.FAPi have been introduced and are highly promising molecular targets from the imaging point of view. FAP inhibitors introduced via bifunctional DOTA and DOTAGA chelators offer the possibility to complex Lutetium-177 due to an additional coordination site, and are suitable for theranostic applications owing to the increased tumor accumulation and prolonged tumor retention time. However, for therapeutic applications, very little has been accomplished, mainly due to residence times of the compounds. In an attempt to develop a promising therapeutic radiopharmaceutical, the present study aimed to evaluate and compare the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi, and [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 in patients with various cancers. The FAPi agents, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi and [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2, were administered in two different groups of patients. Three patients (mean age-50 years) were treated with a median cumulative activity of 2.96 GBq (IQR: 2.2-3 GBq) [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi and seven (mean age-51 years) were treated with 1.48 GBq (IQR: 0.6-1.5) of [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2. Patients in both the groups underwent serial imaging whole-body planar and SPECT/CT scans that were acquired between 1 h and 168 h post-injection (p.i.). The residence time and absorbed dose estimate in the source organs and tumor were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 2.2 software. Time versus activity graphs were plotted to determine the effective half-life (Te) in the whole body and lesions for both the radiotracers. Physiological uptake of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi was observed in the kidneys, colon, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, oral mucosa, lacrimal glands, and urinary bladder contents. Physiological biodistribution of [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 involved liver, gall bladder, colon, pancreas, kidneys, and urinary bladder contents, lacrimal glands, oral mucosa, and salivary glands. In the [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi group, the highest absorbed doses were noted in the kidneys (0.618 ± 0.015 Gy/GBq), followed by the colon (right colon: 0.472 Gy/GBq and left colon: 0.430 Gy/GBq). In the [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 group, the colon received the highest absorbed dose (right colon: 1.160 Gy/GBq and left colon: 2.870 Gy/GBq), and demonstrated a significantly higher mean absorbed dose than [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi (p < 0.011). [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 had significantly longer median whole-body Te compared to that of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi [46.2 h (IQR: 38.5-70.1) vs. 23.1 h (IQR: 17.8-31.5); p-0.0167]. The Te of tumor lesions was significantly higher for [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 compared to [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi [86.6 h (IQR: 34.3-94.6) vs. 14 h (IQR: 12.8-15.5); p-0.0004]. The median absorbed doses to the lesions were 0.603 (IQR: 0.230-1.810) Gy/GBq and 6.70 (IQR: 3.40-49) Gy/GBq dose per cycle in the [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi, and [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 groups, respectively. The first clinical dosimetry study demonstrated significantly higher tumor absorbed doses with [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 compared to [177Lu]Lu-DOTA.SA.FAPi. [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 is safe and unveiled new frontiers to treat various end-stage cancer patients with a theranostic approach.

AB  - A 56-year-old man was diagnosed with calcitonin negative, plasma chromogranin A-positive, immunohistochemistry-negative, high-grade MTC (medullary thyroid cancer) behaving clinically like anaplastic thyroid cancer and presented with progressive disease after conventional therapies. A theranostic approach of 68Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi-guided 177Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 radionuclide therapy was administered on compassionate grounds as per the Declaration of Helsinki because known standard lines of treatment were ineffective. Treatment with a single cycle of 1.65 GBq 177Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 demonstrated a sustainable reduction in the neck mass with significant improvement in the quality of life of the patient. 177Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2 is a potential theranostic option for high-grade MTC refractory to standard therapeutic options.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi with that of [18F]F-FDG PET/CT in detecting primary and metastatic lesions of breast cancer. [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans of histologically proven breast cancer patients were compared according to patient-based and lesion-based analysis. Forty-seven patients with a mean age of 44.8 ± 9.9 years (range: 31-66 years) were evaluated. A total of 85% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, and 15% had invasive lobular carcinoma. The tracer uptake [SULpeak, SULavg, and the median tumor-to-background ratio (TBR)] was significantly higher in [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi than with [18F]F-FDG PET/CT for lymph nodes, pleural metastases, and liver lesions (p < 0.05). However, for brain metastasis, only the median TBR was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to [18F]F-FDG. In patient-based analysis the sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT was higher, but not significant than that of [18F]F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of both primary tumors and metastatic lesions. According to lesion-based analysis, on diagnostic CT, 47 patients had 44 primary tumors, 248 lymph nodes, 15 pleural, 88 liver, and 42 brain metastases. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi scan identified more abnormal lesions than [18F]F-FDG in all the primary and metastatic sites with a maximum marked difference in the primary site [88.6% vs. 81.8%; p-0.001], lymph nodes [89.1% vs. 83.8%; p-0.0001], pleural metastases [93.3% vs. 73%; p-0.096] and brain metastasis [100% vs. 59.5%; p-0.0001]. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT was superior to [18F]F-FDG PET/CT in the imaging of breast cancers.

AB  - Rationale: Although the short-term results of targeted alpha therapy (TAT) with 225Ac-DOTATATE in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) have proven effective, none have assessed the long-term outcome results. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the long-term outcome of 225Ac-DOTATATE targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-expressing advanced-stage metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Methods: Patients with 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT scans showing moderate-to-high SSTR expression were recruited. Systemic TAT was performed in 91 adults with GEP-NET [54 males, and 37 females] mean age 54 years (y) (range: 25-75y)] using 225Ac-DOTATATE (100-120 kBq/kg body weight). All patients were given capecitabine therapy as a radiosensitizer (dose 2 g/day) from day 0 to 14 of every 225Ac-DOTATATE treatment cycle. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the status of prior 177Lu-PRRT: prior 177Lu-PRRT-refractory-group; prior 177Lu-PRRT-disease-control group; and 177Lu-PRRT naïve group. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective tumour response, clinical response, and the assessment of treatment-related toxicities. Results: Among the 91 patients, 57 underwent prior 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy [24 disease controlled (PR/SD), 33 progressive diseases (PD)]. A total of 453 225Ac-DOTATATE TAT cycles were administered [median four cycles per patient; range 1-10] in a median follow-up duration of 24 months (range 5-41mo). Median OS was not attained with a 24-month overall survival probability of 70.8%. In multivariate analysis, prognostic factors associated with a poor OS included, the presence bone metastases [HR: 2.501; 95% CI: 1.826 - 5.791; P<0.032], and 225Ac-DOTATATE therapy refractory disease [HR: 8.781; 95% CI: 3.843 - 20.062; P<0.0001]. Median PFS was also not reached with a 24-month progression-free survival probability of 67.5%. The multivariate analysis revealed only 177Lu-PRRT refractory disease significantly associated with a reduced PFS. [HR: 14.338; 95% CI: 1.853 - 97.698; P = 0.011]. Two of 79 patients (2.5%) with assessable disease experienced complete response; 38 (48%) had a partial response, 23 (29%) had SD, and 16 (20.2%) had PD. PD was observed in more patients from the prior 177Lu-PRRT-refractory group (11/33; 34%) as compared to 177Lu-PRRT-naïve patients (4/24; 11%), P-0.056. Patients from the prior 177Lu-PRRT-refractory group had the highest risk of poor PFS [HR:13.91; 95% CI: 4.45 - 42.271; P = 0.0009]. A significant clinical benefit was achieved post 225Ac-DOTATATE therapy with minimal treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion: The long-term results reveal 225Ac-DOTATATE TAT has shown promising results and improves overall survival, even in patients refractory to prior 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment, with transient and acceptable adverse effects.

AB  - CONTEXT.—: The histologic features in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are evolving, and histologic indicators of patients' poor prognosis are not yet fully established.
OBJECTIVE.—: To evaluate the independent histologic predictors of 28-day mortality in ACLF patients on core-needle liver biopsies.
DESIGN.—: Core-needle biopsies from patients with a diagnosis of ACLF (n = 152) as per the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria were included during 8 years. Liver biopsies from 98 patients with compensated chronic liver disease were included as disease controls for histologic comparison. Features of ongoing changes, such as hepatic necrosis, hepatic apoptosis, cholestasis, hepatocyte degeneration, bile ductular proliferation, Mallory-Denk bodies, steatosis, and extent of liver fibrosis, were analyzed for predicting short-term mortality (28 days). A P value of <.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS.—: In our cohort of ACLF patients, the following etiologies for acute decompensation were identified: alcohol, 47 of 152 (30.9%); sepsis, 24 of 152 (15.7%); hepatotropic viruses, 20 of 152 (13.1%); drug-induced liver injury, 11 of 152 (7.2%); autoimmune flare, 9 of 152 (5.9%); mixed etiologies, 5 of 152 (3.2%); and cryptogenic, 36 of 152 (23.6%). On histologic examination, hepatic necrosis (P < .001), dense lobular inflammation (P = .03), cholestasis (P < .001), ductular reaction (P = .001), hepatocyte degeneration (P < .001), and absence of advanced fibrosis stages (P < .001) were identified significantly more othen in ACLF patients than in disease controls on univariate analysis. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, the absence of advanced Ishak histologic activity index fibrosis stages (P = .02) and the presence of dense lobular inflammation (P = .04) were associated with increased 28-day mortality in ACLF patients. After adjusting the clinical causes of acute decompensation, only dense lobular inflammation was found as an independent predictor of short-term mortality (P = .04) in ACLF patients.
CONCLUSIONS.—: Dense lobular necroinflammatory activity is a clinically independent histologic predictor of 28-day short-term mortality in patients with ACLF.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a probiotic strain Bacillus clausii UBBC-07 on gut microbiota and cytokines in IBD patients.
METHOD: Patients were randomly allocated to either placebo or probiotic Bacillus clausii UBBC-07 for four weeks along with the standard medical treatment (SMT). Enrolled patients were evaluated before and after intervention for presence of the given probiotic, change in gut microbiota, change in serum cytokines, serotonin and dopamine, symptoms of disease, physical, behavioral and psychological parameters.
RESULTS: Probiotic strain Bacillus clausii UBBC-07 showed good survival in IBD patients in the treatment group (p < 0.01) without any reported adverse event. Metagenomic analysis showed that the given probiotic strain was able to modulate the gut microbiota in treated group. Phylum Firmicutes was increased and phylum Bacteroidetes was decreased in the probiotic treated group. A significant increase was observed in the abundance of anaerobic bacterial genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium in the probiotic treated group (p < 0.01) as compared to placebo group. Significant increase was observed in IL-10 (p < 0.05) and variable decrease in the secretion of IL-1β, TNF- α, IL-6, IL -17 and IL -23 in probiotic treated group. In the treatment group a significant decrease in the symptoms of IBD and improvement in the psychological parameter to various degrees was noted.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that probiotic strain B clausii UBBC-07 affected the gut microbiota and cytokine secretion and shown efficacy in IBD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of different diseases including colorectal cancer. The geography, lifestyle, and dietary habits of Indians are different from Western world, thus microbiome studies of Western population could not be extrapolated to their Indian counterparts.
METHOD: Therefore, we have conducted a study on gut microbiota in Indian healthy subjects and patients of colon cancer using 16S ribosomal RNA Amplicon sequencing. Operational taxonomic units were calculated for different bacterial taxon including phylum, class, order, family, and genus level.
RESULTS: Observed results indicated a considerable difference in the bacterial diversity in both the groups. Phylum Firmicutes was significantly dominated in both the groups followed by Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria which clearly indicates the dominance of phylum Firmicutes in Indian population. Phylum Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were significantly abundant in the healthy group while phylum Bacteroidetes in the colon cancer group. Bacterial genera Megamonas, Megasphaera, Mitsuokella, and Streptococcus were significantly abundant in the healthy group and Veillonella, Prevotella, and Eubacterium in the colon cancer group. Bacterial genus Bradyrhizobium was present in the healthy group and Alistipes, Coprococcus, Dorea, and Rhodococcus were present in the colon cancer group but absent in the healthy group.
CONCLUSION: There was a considerable difference in bacterial diversity in both the study groups indicating dysbiosis in the colon cancer group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Syncope is a common clinical condition in the elderly, associated with significant morbidity and risk of recurrence. Recurrent syncope causing a repeated reduction in the cerebral blood flow can predispose to progressive neurodegeneration, a decline in overall health and functionality. Hence, this study was conducted to study the common causes of recurrent syncope and its association with various geriatric syndromes.
METHODOLOGY: This case-control study recruited 50 cases of recurrent syncope and 50 controls, aged 75 years and older. A detailed history and sequential evaluation for aetiologies of recurrent syncope were done. Cognition, frailty, activities of daily living, depression, and nutrition were assessed using various scales.
RESULTS: Most (80%, 80/100) of the participants were males and the mean age was 80.04 ± 4.3 years. In the syncope group, 42% (21/50) of patients had arrhythmia, and 30% (15/30) had valvular heart disease. Recurrent syncope was significantly associated with lower scores on Montreal cognitive assessment scale (OR: 6.47 P < 0.001), four or more comorbidities (OR: 6.29 P < 0.001), and hearing impairment (OR: 6.21 P < 0.004) on multivariate logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: Recurrent syncope is significantly associated with cognitive impairment, the presence of four or more comorbidities, and hearing impairment. Conduction abnormality was the most common etiology of recurrent cardiovascular syncope. Structured evaluation and appropriate management of recurrent syncope might reduce the decline in physical, cognitive, and psychological reserve. A follow-up longitudinal study is needed to establish this.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the correlation between functional parameters and optical coherence tomography (OCT) features in patients of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
METHODS: A prospective observational study in early and established cases of papilledema in IIH presenting from December 2017 to February 2019. Functional parameters (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, mean deviation, VER, and MfERG) and structural parameters (RNFL, GCL-IPL, and optic disc height) were measured at baseline and every 6 weeks for 6 months.
RESULTS: At baseline, average RNFL had a moderate negative correlation with mean deviation (r = -0.45; P = 0.0007) and a positive correlation with logMAR visual acuity (r = 0.18; P = 0.17). On the contrary, baseline GCL and logMAR visual acuity had a negative correlation (r = -0.4, P = 0.02). Optic disc height (ODH) had a negative correlation with visual field mean deviation (r = -0.046; P = 0.0005). At 6 months, ODH and GCL-IPL complex had a statistically significant correlation with functional parameters. However, RNFL values did not show any significant correlation with any of the functional parameters. Baseline GCL-IPL and optic disc height values had a moderate and significant correlation with final functional parameters. However, RNFL did not show any correlation with final functional parameters. Correlation between GCL-IPL thickness at 6 weeks and final functional parameters were stronger than that with baseline GCL values.
CONCLUSION: In the setting of severe papilledema, RNFL can misguide the prognosis. GCL-IPL can be a valuable tool for an objective evaluation of the integrity of the optic nerve in IIH and ODH may be used as an alternative or in combination with GCL-IPL in these cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Complications during trauma management are the main factor responsible for the overall increase in treatment cost. There are very few grading systems to measure the burden of complications in trauma patients. A prospective study was conducted using the Adapted Clavien Dindo in Trauma (ACDiT) scale, with the primary aim of validating it at our center. As a secondary aim, it was also wanted to measure the mortality burden among our admitted patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted at a dedicated trauma center. All patients with acute injuries, who were admitted, were included. An initial treatment plan was made within 24 hours of admission. Any deviation from this was recorded and graded according to the ACDiT. The grading was correlated with hospital-free days and ICU-free days within 30 days.
RESULTS: A total of 505 patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 31 years. The most common mechanism of injury was road traffic injury, with a median ISS and NISS of 13 and 14, respectively. Two hundred and forty-eight out of 505 patients had some grade of complication as determined by the ACDiT scale. Hospital-free days (13.5 vs. 25; p <0.001) were significantly lower in patients with complications than those without complications, and so were ICU-free days (29 vs. 30; p <0.001). Significant differences were also observed when comparing mean hospital free and ICU free days across various ACDiT grades. Overall mortality of the population was 8.3 %, the majority of whom were hypotensive on arrival and required ICU care.
CONCLUSION: We successfully validated the ACDiT scale at our center. We recommend using this scale to objectively measure in-hospital complications and improve trauma management quality. ACDiT scale should be one of the data points in any trauma database/registry.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: 'In-home injuries' are those that occur within the house or its immediate surroundings. The literature on the prevalence and magnitude of home injuries is sparse. This study was designed to characterize the mechanisms of 'in-home' injuries and compare their outcomes with 'outside home injuries'.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Australia-India Trauma Systems Collaboration (AITSC) Project created a multicentric registry consisting of trauma patients admitted at four urban tertiary care hospitals in India from April 2016 to March 2018. This registry data was analysed for this study. All admitted patients except for dead on arrival were included. Patients were categorised into 'in-home' and 'outside home' cohorts based on the place where the trauma occurred. The outcome measures were 30 day in-hospital mortality and the length of hospital stay. Two subgroup analyses were performed, the first comprised pediatric patients (<15 years) and the second elderly patients >64 years).
RESULTS: Among 9354 patients in the AITSC data registry, 8398 patients were included in the study. Out of these, 29 percent were in-home injuries, whereas the rest occurred outside home. The 30 day in-hospital mortality was 10.6 percent in the 'in-home' cohort, as compared to 13.7 percent in the 'outside home' cohort. This difference although significant on univariable analysis (p <0.01), there was no significant difference on multivariable regression analysis, after adjusting for age and injury severity score (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.73-1.04; p = 0.15). The length of hospital stay was shorter in the home injuries group (median = 5 days; IQR = 3-12 days) compared to the outside-home group (median = 7 days; IQR = 4-14 days) (p < 0.01). In the pediatric and the elderly, on multivariable regression analysis, in-home injuries were associated with higher mortality than outside home injuries.
CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the 30 day in-hospital mortality amongst admitted trauma patients sustaining injuries at home or outside the home. However, in pediatric and elderly patients the chances of mortality was significantly higher when injured at home.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease. Smaller sample size and complex nature of the disease pathogenesis has made it challenging to perform well-powered genetic investigations. We performed a systematic review based meta-analysis in GPA to investigate the genetic susceptibility conferred by non-human leukocyte antigen (non-HLA) candidate genes.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed using web-based literature search and eligible studies were included following inclusion-exclusion criteria. Studies were evaluated for their quality of evidence and study outcome was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Grades of Research, Assessment, Development and Evaluation tools. Reviewer's agreement was accessed through Cohen's κ value. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5 tool. Meta-odds ratio (meta-OR) and Z test P value were evaluated to estimate the genetic susceptibility for each of the variants.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were found eligible and 7 genetic variants from only 4 genes, namely CTLA4, PRTN3, SERPINA1 and PTPN22 could be studied for meta-analysis. rs231775-G (49-G) (Meta-OR = 1.42 [1.14-1.76]; P = .001) of CTLA4 and rs7151526-A (Meta-OR = 2.70 [1.51-4.85]; P = .0008) of SERPINA1 were confirmed to be predisposing alleles, and rs5742909-C (318-C) (Meta-OR = 0.65 [0.44-0.97]; P =.03) of CTLA4 was found to be protective for GPA. In concordance with the genetic association of rs7151526-A, serological marker for the same variant "Z" allele of SERPINA1 was found to be predisposing (Meta-OR = 12.60 [5.01-31.68]; P < .00001) for GPA.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variants confirmed in this study play critical roles in T-cell mediated immune function and could be significantly implicated in GPA. Molecular pathology studies are warranted to confirm their role. These markers could be used for efficient patient classification and disease management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is an estimate of autonomic control of cardiovascular system via the baroreflex arc. It has been suggested that exercise pressure reflex and muscle metaboreflex override baroreflex during exercise to decrease baroreflex gain, which facilitates the simultaneous rise in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate during the exercise. This study investigated the effects of isometric handgrip exercise (IHE) on baroreflex gain and frequency dependence of baroreflex sensitivity while fluctuations in arterial BP were generated.
METHODS: Thirteen healthy men performed IHE at 20% and 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), while oscillatory lower body negative pressure (OLBNP) of 40 mmHg was applied in 0.1 and 0.25 Hz frequencies.
RESULTS: Compared to the OLBNP at 0.25 Hz frequency alone, the baroreflex gain for diastolic BP (DBP) was significantly reduced with the addition of IHE at 20% and 30% of MVC in the high frequency band. At rest (without IHE and OLBNP) the baroreflex gain was significantly more in the high frequency band for DBP, but the baroreflex gain for DBP was not significantly different when IHE + OLBNP were applied at 20% and 30% of MVC in both frequencies.
CONCLUSIONS: The significant reduction of DBP baroreflex gain with the addition of graded IHE might indicate that exercise pressure reflex and muscle metaboreflex override baroreflex during exercise to decrease baroreflex gain at a high frequency band (0.25 Hz). The frequency-dependent phenomenon of BRS was altered when IHE and OLBNP were applied, meaning that the frequency dependence of BRS was nullified during IHE.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcomes of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) awaiting surgery admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with acute illness.
METHODS: In this retrospective study from a single center, the outcomes of children up to 18 y of age with unoperated CHD admitted to PICU with acute illness and factors affecting the outcomes, were evaluated.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight (41 boys) children were included. Median age was 3.2 (1.5, 6) mo. Thirty-six (62%) children had acyanotic CHD (ACHD), and 22 (38%) had cyanotic CHD (CCHD). Most common ACHD was ventricular septal defect (n = 14; 38.8%) and CCHD was double-outlet right ventricle (n = 6; 27.2%). Twenty-four (41%) children underwent surgery - 10 (41.6%) palliative procedure and 14 (58.3%) corrective procedure. Hospital mortality was 50%. Of the operated children, 37.5% died and of the nonoperated children, 58.8% died. Type of the heart disease and surgical intervention was not associated with mortality (p = 0.27 and 0.11). Requirement of vasoactive agents was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.02). In children with ACHD, factors associated with mortality were lower score for weight for age (p = 0.03) and weight for length (p = 0.04), lower admission pH (p = 0.02), hemodynamic instability at admission (p = 0.002), and requirement of vasoactive agents (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Children with unoperated CHD with acute illness have high morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and surgical interventions in children with CHD are warranted.

AB  - Our objective was to compare norepinephrine plus dobutamine versus epinephrine as the first-line agent in children with fluid refractory cold septic shock.
DESIGN: Open-label randomized controlled study.
SETTING: A single-center PICU from North India.
PATIENTS: Children 2 months to less than 18 years old with fluid refractory cold septic shock.
INTERVENTIONS: In the intervention group, norepinephrine and dobutamine were started and in the control group, epinephrine was started as the first-line vasoactive agent. The primary outcome was the proportion attaining shock resolution (attaining all the therapeutic endpoints) at 1 hour of therapy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We enrolled 67 children: 34 in the norepinephrine plus dobutamine group (intervention) and 33 in the epinephrine group (control). There was no difference in shock resolution at 1 hour (17.6% vs 9%; risk ratio [RR], 2.0; 95% CI, 0.54-7.35; p = 0.25), 6 hours (76.4% vs 54.5%; RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.92-3.13; p = 0.06), and 24 hours between the intervention and control groups, respectively. Children in the norepinephrine plus dobutamine group attained shock resolution earlier (measured from starting of vasoactive agents to attaining all the therapeutic endpoints) (hazard ratio, 1.84 [1.1-3.08]). The difference in 28-day mortality was not significant (23.5% vs 39.3% in the intervention and control groups, respectively [RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.28-1.25]).
CONCLUSIONS: In children with fluid refractory cold septic shock, with use of norepinephrine plus dobutamine as first-line agents, the difference in the proportion of children attaining shock resolution at 1 hour between the groups was inconclusive. However, the time to shock resolution was earlier in the norepinephrine plus dobutamine group. Also, fewer children in the intervention group were refractory to treatment. Further studies powered to detect (or exclude) an important difference would be required to test this intervention.

AB  - PURPOSE: There is paucity of data regarding T-cells in paediatric AML patients. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate trend of T-cell subset during disease course of paediatric AML patients and to see its correlation with patient characteristics and survival outcome.
METHODS: T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD8) were evaluated by flow-cytometry at diagnosis, post-induction, post-treatment completion, at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment completion, and relapse in 29 pediatric AML patients. Trend of T-cells was plotted between group A (those in continuous remission) and group B (those who relapsed) patients.
RESULTS: Patients with high WBC count had significantly higher number of CD3, CD4 and CD8 cell. Baseline Tcell subsets did not affect CR, EFS and OS; however, higher than median CD4 count predicted improved DFS [58% vs 25%; HR = 0.306 (0.10-0.93); P = 0.037]. On serial follow-up from post-induction till 3 months after completion of therapy, there was no difference in the absolute values of T cell subsets between group A and B patients.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated T cell subsets are increased in AML subjects with high WBC count. CD4 cells have a positive impact on DFS. Serial follow-up has no impact on T cell subsets. Further studies in larger patient cohorts are needed to evaluate if CD4 population may serve as an immune biomarker for AML.

AB  - The integrity of the patella is pivotal for the efficient functioning of the knee extensor mechanism. Thus, patella fracture management cannot be neglected and utmost priority should be determined for its preservation and maintenance of knee functioning. Tension band wiring (TBW) is the most widely and commonly used mode of fixation of patella fractures with consistently favourable outcomes. However, the complications associated with the same could be challenging and may compromise the integrity of the patella. This case report highlights the salvage of the failed TBW for a patella fracture with biomechanically stronger angular stable Star-shaped patella plate.

AB  - Bipolar clavicular dislocation is rare, and therefore its management is contentious. With an increase of patient's physical demand and a near-normal shoulder function, there has been a shift in the paradigm of its management from a conservative one to a stabilized one of anatomical open reduction. Proposed methods of fixation have also evolved with the advent of more biological fixation devices, which elude implant or fixation related complications. This case report highlights the salient features of this rare case and details the management options along with the benefits of biological anatomical repair and reconstruction.

AB  - A 40-year-old man with old neglected, non-union, pelvic ring injury right side was surgically treated with open reduction and internal fixation. In the immediate postoperative day, the patient had a large blister adjacent to the surgical site at the right inguinal region which complicated with eschar formation, and later split skin grafting was done. Accidental burns in operation theatre are very unusual. Burns due to electro-cautery and use of alcohol-based antiseptics are well documented in the literature. Iatrogenic burns due to prolonged operating light exposure are very rare and can cause severe damage in sensitive areas like the inguinal region.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) is increasingly being used for anaesthesia and analgesia of the hip, knee and thigh. It can be administered via two ultrasound-guided approaches, suprainguinal and infrainguinal. This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of the suprainguinal approach of FICB with infrainguinal approach of FICB in patients undergoing above knee orthopaedic surgeries.
METHODS: In this single-centre, double-blinded randomised trial, 32 patients undergoing above knee lower limb orthopaedic surgery under spinal anaesthesia were randomised into group I (infrainguinal FICB) and S (suprainguinal FICB). They were given ultrasound-guided FICB with 30 mL 0.2% ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia using the respective approaches. Injection tramadol was administered as a rescue analgesic when Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ≥4. A blinded observer recorded pain score (NRS) from the initiation of the block every 2 h for 24 h. Time to first rescue analgesia, total duration of analgesia and analgesic consumption, and patient satisfaction score were noted.
RESULTS: The mean pain scores were comparable between the two groups at all time intervals till 24 h except at 12 h and 20 h, when pain intensity was significantly less in group S than in group I. Total tramadol consumption was also significantly less in group S. There was no significant difference in time to first rescue analgesia and total duration of analgesia between the two groups. At 24 h, the patient satisfaction score was significantly better in group S.
CONCLUSION: Suprainguinal FICB has superior analgesic efficacy over infrainguinal FICB in terms of reduced pain intensity, reduced 24-h tramadol consumption and better patient satisfaction.

AB  - These guidelines discuss the epidemiology, screening, diagnosis, posttransplant prophylaxis, monitoring, and management of endemic infections in solid organ transplant (SOT) candidates, recipients, and donors in South Asia. The guidelines also provide recommendations for SOT recipients traveling to this region. These guidelines are based on literature review and expert opinion by transplant physicians, surgeons, and infectious diseases specialists, mostly from South Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) as well as transplant experts from other countries. These guidelines cover relevant endemic bacterial infections (tuberculosis, leptospirosis, melioidosis, typhoid, scrub typhus), viral infections (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E; rabies; and the arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Japanese encephalitis), endemic fungal infections (mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, sporotrichosis), and endemic parasitic infections (malaria, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, strongyloidiasis, and filariasis) as well as travelers' diarrhea and vaccination for SOT candidates and recipients including travelers visiting this region. These guidelines are intended to be an overview of each topic; more detailed reviews are being published as a special supplement in the Indian Journal of Transplantation .

AB  - Spinal involvement in lymphomas is often associated with advanced disease. Primary spinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a rare entity. A 47-year-old male presented with a history of neck pain followed by progressive quadriparesis and bowel bladder involvement over a 5-month period. The magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of an intradural extramedullary lesion at the C1-C2 vertebra level. A surgical excision was done and the histopathology revealed atypical lymphoid cells, which are immunopositive for CD45, CD20, MUM-1, and BCL6, while negative for BCL2, EBV (LMP-1 and CISH), Cyclin D1 and confirmed the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient received chemotherapy in the form of CODOX-M/IVAC (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate/ifosfamide, etoposide, high-dose cytarabine) regimen. Primary spinal intradural extramedullary Burkitt's lymphoma is a rare diagnosis that may often be difficult to differentiate radiologically from other causes of intradural extramedullary lesions. A thorough histological examination is warranted in such cases.

T2  - Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma
AB  - Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are a set of interventions which are carried out in the preoperative and perioperative period. They are aimed to decrease the harmful effects of surgery on the body and help the patient recover better post-surgery. The effectiveness of ERAS has been well established in various other surgical specialities. Earlier spine surgery was thought to be very complex for application of ERAS protocols. However, this has changed over the last decade with (ERAS) protocols gaining widespread popularity in spine surgery. Initial studies involving ERAS in spine surgery were limited to lumbar spine. However, over the years the horizon of ERAS has expanded to include anterior cervical surgeries, spine deformity, spinal tumors and spine surgery in the elderly. ERAS has been shown to reduce the length of hospital stay, overall hospital costs, opioid consumption in perioperative and postoperative period and to lower complication rates in spine surgery. In this narrative review, we discuss various aspects of ERAS in spine surgery including the benefits of ERAS in spine surgery, the various components of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative measures of ERAS protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bile duct injury (BDI) continues to occur despite technological advances and improvements in surgical training over the past 2 decades. This study was conducted to audit our data on laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed over the past 2 decades to determine the role of Critical View of Safety (CVS) and proctored preceptorship in preventing BDI and postoperative complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were analyzed retrospectively. The data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database from January 2004 to December 2019. Proctored preceptorship was used in all cases. Intraoperative details included the number of patients where CVS was defined, number of BDI and conversions. Postoperative outcomes, including hospital stay, morbidity, and bile duct stricture, were noted.
RESULTS: Three thousand seven hundred twenty-six patients were included in the final analysis. Trainee surgeons performed 31.6% of surgeries and 9.5% of these surgeries were taken over by the senior surgeon. A CVS could be delineated in 96.6% of patients. The major BDI rate was only 0.05%.
CONCLUSION: This study reiterates the fact that following the basic tenets of safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, defining and confirming CVS, and following proctored preceptorship are critical in preventing major BDI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: To evaluate the effect of L-PRF on the rate of maxillary canine retraction.
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To validate the rate of maxillary canine retraction by identifying the levels of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumour Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) in the Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF).
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Fifteen females (age range, 18-25 years) with Class I bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion malocclusions were included. After levelling and alignment of maxillary arches, 1st premolars were extracted from both sides. Canines were retracted immediately after the extraction of 1st premolars in control sides and placement of L-PRF plugs in the experimental sides. The amount of canine retraction was evaluated from study models recorded before the extraction of 1st premolars (T0) and at 1-week (T1), 2-weeks (T2), 4-weeks (T3), and 8-weeks (T4) after the beginning of canine retraction by using digital model superimpositions. The concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α were evaluated from the GCF collected at T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4 by using commercially available human IL-1β and TNF-α ELISA kits.
RESULTS: The amount of canine retraction in the experimental sides was statistically greater during T0-T1 (P=0.038),T1-T2 (P=0.002), and T2-T3 (P=0.011) periods. Total canine retraction during T0-T4 was statistically greater in experimental sides (2.43±0.46mm) than control sides (2.08±0.28mm) (P=0.001). The concentration of IL-1β increased significantly in the experimental sides at T1 (P=0.000),T2 (P=0.000), and T3 (P=0.032). The concentration of TNF-α increased both in the control and experimental sides, but it was statistically greater in the experimental sides compared to control sides at T1 (P=0.000) and T2 (P=0.006). A positive but not statistically significant correlation was noted between the rate of canine retraction and the concentrations of cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α in GCF.
CONCLUSION: Over an 8-week period, autologous L-PRF statistically accelerated the rate of maxillary canine retraction, but only by 0.35mm. This small acceleration occurred mainly in the first 4 weeks. During the following 4 weeks, the amount of canine retraction was comparable on the experimental and control sides.

AB  - PURPOSE: Real-life comparison of three intravitreal drug regimens used in cases of endophthalmitis at a tertiary care center in India.
METHODS: In this prospective, comparative study, patients of bacterial endophthalmitis were grouped according to intravitreal antibiotic drug regimens into Group 1 (ceftazidime and vancomycin), Group 2 (piperacillin + tazobactam and vancomycin), and Group 3 (imipenem and vancomycin). Forty-eight hours after injection nonresponding/worsening patients underwent vitrectomy. Vitreous samples were subjected to microbiological and pharmacokinetic tests.
RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included and divided into Group 1: 29, Group 2: 20, and Group 3: 15 cases. Also, 75% of patients were post-surgical endophthalmitis, whereas 25% were post-traumatic. Improvement in vision (V90-0) and vision at 3 months (V90) were comparable between the three groups. Visual recovery was poorer in post-traumatic cases. In post-surgical cases, visual recovery was poorer in those presenting beyond 72 h of onset of symptoms (P = 0.0002). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity (66%) was higher than BACTECTM (33%) and culture (14%). Antibiotic resistance was comparable amongst the three groups. Most patients (62/64) further underwent vitrectomy. Ceftazidime and vancomycin achieved vitreous concentrations more than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 48 h after the first injection.
CONCLUSION: The choice of antibiotics did not affect the rate of vitrectomy and final vision in a real-life scenario. Ceftazidime and vancomycin can still be used as first-line intravitreal antibiotics owing to their comparable microbial sensitivity profile and adequate ocular bioavailability.

T2  - Cancer Research
AB  - Dendritic cell (DC) derived exosomes (Dex) provide many advantages over DC vaccines such as cost effectiveness, stability, sensitivity to the systemic microenvironment. Though, Dex showed better therapeutic outcome in murine models, however, desired outcome was not achieved in clinical trials as it failed to induce robust immunity to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) binds to its receptor (CSF-1R) and recruits tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME which eventually creates the tumor immunosuppressive. Hence, in this study we used PLX-3397, a small molecule inhibitor of CSF-1R to enhance the antitumor efficacy of Dex. In a syngenic B16-F10murine melanoma model, we found that the combination treatment delayed the tumor growth and improved the survival compare to the mono therapy. In TME, the combination treatment significantly depleted the TAMs and MDSCs and increased the infiltration of lymphocytes (TILs). Additionally, Th1 population were found significantly higher in tumor as well as in spleen with mice received both Dex and PLX3397. In conclusion, PLX-3397 enhanced the in vivo antitumor efficacy of Dex by modulating the immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumor.Citation Format: Anjali Barnwal, Jayanta Bhattacharyya, Bushra Ateeq.

TI  - Repurposing Ponatinib as a PD-L1 Inhibitor Revealed by Drug Repurposing Screening and Validation by In Vitro and In Vivo Experiments
AU  - Barnwal, Anjali
AU  - Das, Sanjeev
AU  - Bhattacharyya, Jayanta
T2  - ACS pharmacology & translational science
AB  - Cancer treatment by inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway using monoclonal antibodies has made great advances as it showed long-lasting antitumor responses in a wide range of cancers. However, antibodies exhibit several disadvantages, which include low permeability, immune-related adverse effects, complex synthetic procedures, and high treatment costs. Hence, small-molecule inhibitors can be used as alternatives; however, no small molecule with in vivo activity has been reported. In addition, there are many challenges in developing a new drug, including the timeline and escalating cost. Therefore, repurposing an approved drug offers advantages over the development of an entirely new drug. Herein, we identify an FDA-approved small-molecule drug, Ponatinib, as a PD-L1 inhibitor via virtual drug screening of the ZINC database. Ponatinib showed stable binding with PD-L1, with the highest binding energy among all of the screened FDA-approved drugs. The binding of Ponatinib with PD-L1 was supported by a fluorescence quenching assay and immunofluorescence study. Further, we compared the in vivo antitumor efficacy of Ponatinib with a commercially available anti-PD-L1 antibody in the murine melanoma model. Ponatinib was found to be more efficient in delaying tumor growth than the anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, Ponatinib also reduced the expression of PD-L1 in tumors and increased the T-cell population. Interestingly, splenocytes isolated from Ponatinib-treated mice showed enhanced cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) activity against B16-F10 cells. However, Ponatinib itself did not have any direct toxic effect on cancer cells in vitro. These findings suggest that Ponatinib can be used as a potent small-molecule inhibitor of PD-L1 to overcome the disadvantages associated with antibodies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The term monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) has been described to include patients with renal manifestations associated with circulating monoclonal proteins with or without a clonal lymphoproliferation (B-cell or plasma cell) and not meeting diagnostic criteria for an overt hematological malignancy. A host of MGRS-associated lesions have been described that involve various renal compartments. Our study describes the histomorphological spectrum of MGRS cases at our center in the last 5 years and description as per the classification system of the International Kidney and Monoclonal Gammopathy Research Group (IKMG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was carried out of all the renal biopsies with characteristic monoclonal immunoglobulin lesions for histopathological diagnosis between years 2015 and 2020 and reviewed by two independent pathologists.
RESULTS: Most patients in the study belonged to the fifth decade, with a median age of 50 years (mean 50.14 ± 10.43) range (24-68 years) with a male preponderance. Most patients presented with proteinuria as the sole manifestation (66.6%). Many of the patients (48%) had an M spike by serum protein electrophoresis or urinary protein electrophoresis with an abnormal serum free light chain assay (60.8%). AL amyloidosis was the most common diagnosis observed on histopathological evaluation (68.7%), followed by light chain deposition disease (10.4%).
CONCLUSION: MGRS lesions are infrequently encountered in the practice of nephropathology and pose a diagnostic challenge due to the limitation of a congruent clinical or hematological picture. A thorough histological examination with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy often precipitates in the right diagnosis and prompts timely management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fall is the second most common mechanism of trauma worldwide after road traffic injuries. Data on fall predominantly comes from the high-income countries (HICs) and mostly includes injuries in children and elderly. There are very few studies from low- and middle-income countries(LMICs) that describe fall related injuries other than fragility fractures in elderly. This study describes the profile of poly-trauma patients admitted with a history of 'fall' and assesses the variables associated with mortality.
METHOD: We analyzed data from the 'Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcome' (TITCO) database which prospectively collected data of poly-trauma patients admitted to four major tertiary care hospitals of India between 2013 to 2015. Patients across all age groups admitted to hospital with the history of 'fall'; were included in our study. Single bone fractures were excluded.  The Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the survival probability in different age groups.
RESULTS: A total of 3686 patients were included in our study. The median age of the patients was 28 years (IQR: 9, 47) with the majority being males (73.6%). Almost one-third of the patients were within the age group of 0-14 (30.4%). Most of the patients (79.9%) had a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The overall in-hospital mortality was 18% (664), but higher at 39.0% among patients over 65 years of age. Probability of survival decreased with increase of age.
CONCLUSION: Falling from height is a common injury mechanism in India, occurring more in young males and usually associated with TBI. Isolated TBI and TBI associated with other injuries are the main contributors of mortality in fall injuries. Mortality from these injuries increased with age and ISS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is one of the most commonly used trauma scores and is a good predictor of outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. There are other more complex scores with additional physiological parameters. Whether they discriminate better than GCS in predicting mortality in TBI patients is debatable. The aim of this study was to compare the discrimination of GCS with that of MGAP, GAP, RTS and KTS for 24-hour and 30-day in-hospital mortality in adult TBI patients, in a resource limited LMIC setting.
METHOD: We analysed data from the multicentre, observational trauma cohort Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcome (TITCO) in India. We included all patients 18 years or older, admitted from the emergency department with TBI. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to quantify and compare the discrimination of all scores: GCS; Revised Trauma Score (RTS); mechanism, GCS, age, systolic blood pressure (MGAP); GCS, age, systolic blood pressure (GAP) and Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) in the prediction of 24-hour and 30-day in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 3306 TBI patients were included in this study. The majority were within the GCS range 3-8. The commonest mechanism of injury was road traffic injuries [1907(58.0%)]. In-hospital mortality was 27.2% (899). There was no significant difference in discrimination in 24-hour in-hospital mortality when comparing GCS with MGAP and GAP. While GCS performed better than KTS, RTS performed better than GCS. For 30-day in-hospital mortality, GCS discriminated significantly better compared with KTS, but there was no significant difference when compared to MGAP and RTS. GAP discriminated significantly better when compared with GCS.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the discrimination of GCS is comparable to that of more complex trauma scores in predicting 24-hour and 30-day in-hospital mortality in adult TBI patients in a resource limited LMIC setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacopa monnieri, a herb that has been used for many centuries in India, has shown neuroprotective effects in animal and in vitro studies; human studies on patients with Alzheimer disease have been inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review was to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of B. monnieri in persons with mild, moderate, or severe dementia, or mild cognitive impairment, due to Alzheimer disease.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, clinical trial registries (World Health Organization, Australia-New Zealand, United States, and South Africa), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL. We intended to include all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared B. monnieri, its extract or active ingredients (at any dosage), with a placebo or a cholinesterase inhibitor among adults with dementia due to Alzheimer disease and in those with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease.
RESULTS: Our comprehensive search yielded 5 eligible studies. A total of 3 studies used B. monnieri in combination with herbal extracts while the remaining 2 used B. monnieri extracts only. Two studies compared B. monnieri with donepezil while the others used a placebo as the control. There was considerable variation in the B. monnieri dose used (ranging between 125 mg to 500 mg twice daily) and heterogeneity in treatment duration, follow-up, and outcomes. The major outcomes were Mini-Mental State Examination scores reported in 3 trials, Cognitive subscale scores of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale in 1 study, and a battery of cognitive tests in 2 studies. Using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, overall, we judged all 5 studies to be at high risk of bias. While all studies reported a statistically significant difference between B. monnieri and the comparator in at least one outcome, we rated the overall quality of evidence for the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Postgraduate Institute Memory Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Wechsler Memory Scale to be very low due to downgrading by 2 levels for high risk of bias and 1 more level for impreciseness due to small sample sizes and wide CIs.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between B. monnieri and the placebo or donepezil in the treatment of Alzheimer disease based on very low certainty evidence. No major safety issues were reported in the included trials. Future randomized controlled trials should aim to recruit more participants and report clinically meaningful outcomes.

AB  - In this work, herein we report the synthesis, structural characterization and in vitro cytotoxic evaluation of two mixed Co(II)/Ni(II)-nalidixic acid-bipyridyl complexes (1 and 2). The structural analysis of metal complexes 1 and 2 was carried out by analytical and multispectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, UV-vis, EPR, sXRD). The crystallographic details of complexes 1 and 2 revealed a monoclinic crystal system with P21/c space group. DFT studies of complexes were performed to get electronic structure and localization of HOMO and LUMO electron densities. Hirshfeld surface analysis of metal complexes 1 and 2 was employed to understand the various intermolecular interactions (C-H···O, N-H···H and O-H···O) that define the stability of crystal lattice structures. The comparative interaction studies of complex 1 and complex 2 with DNA/BSA were performed by diverse multispectroscopic and analytical techniques to evaluate their chemotherapeutic potential. The magnitude of the DNA binding propensity and binding mode was verified by calculating Kb, K and Ksv values. Higher binding affinity was observed in case of complex 2via intercalative mode. Furthermore, the cytotoxic assessment of complexes 1 and 2 was examined against MDA-MB-231 (triple negative human breast cancer cell line) and HepG2 (liver carcinoma cell line) employing MTT assay which revealed remarkably effecient and specific cytotoxic activity of complex 2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The world witnessed a highly contagious and deadly disease, COVID-19, toward the end of 2019. India is one of the worst affected countries. We aimed to assess anxiety and depression levels among adult tobacco users and people who recently quit tobacco during COVID-19 lockdown in India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted across two Indian cities, Delhi and Chennai (July-August, 2020) among adult tobacco users (n = 801). Telephonic interviews were conducted using validated mental health tools (Patient Health Questionnaire-PHQ-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD-7) to assess the anxiety and depression levels of the participants. Descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to study the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety.
RESULTS: We found that 20.6% of tobacco users had depression symptoms (3.9% moderate to severe); 20.7% had anxiety symptoms (3.8% moderate to severe). Risk factors associated with depression and anxiety included food, housing, and financial insecurity.
CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 lockdown, mental health of tobacco users (primarily women) was associated with food, housing and financial insecurity. The Indian Government rightly initiated several health, social and economic measures to shield the most vulnerable from COVID-19, including a ban on the sale of tobacco products. It is also necessary to prioritize universal health coverage, expanded social security net, tobacco cessation and mental health services to such vulnerable populations during pandemic situations.

AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that manifest lung abnormalities during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of lung autopsies from 31 patients with severe COVID-19 and ten uninfected controls. Using metatranscriptomics, we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant 'classical' signature (n=23) showed upregulation of the unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation, supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) that potentially represents 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS) showed upregulation of cytokines such as IL1 and CCL19, but absence of complement activation. We found that a majority of patients cleared SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus cohnii in 'classical' patients and Pasteurella multocida in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients, which can be identified through complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. These findings can be used to design personalized therapy using in silico identified drug molecules or in mitigating specific secondary infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a significant mortality rate of 3-5%. The principal causes of multiorgan failure and death are cytokine release syndrome and immune dysfunction. Stress, anxiety, and depression has been aggravated by the pandemic and its resultant restrictions in day-to-day life which may contribute to immune dysregulation. Thus, immunity strengthening and the prevention of cytokine release syndrome are important for preventing and minimizing mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, despite a few specific remedies that now exist for the SARS-CoV-2virus, the principal modes of prevention include vaccination, masking, and holistic healing methods, such as yoga. Currently, extensive research is being conducted to better understand the neuroendocrinoimmunological mechanisms by which yoga alleviates stress and inflammation. This review article explores the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating potentials of yoga, along with its role in reducing risk for immune dysfunction and impaired mental health.
METHODS: We conducted this narrative review from published literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE databases. Screening was performed for titles and abstracts by two independent review authors; potentially eligible citations were retrieved for full-text review. References of included articles and articles of major non-indexed peer reviewed journals were searched for relevance by two independent review authors. A third review author checked the excluded records. All disagreements were resolved through discussion amongst review authors or through adjudication by a fourth review author. Abstracts, editorials, conference proceedings and clinical trial registrations were excluded.
OBSERVATIONS: Yoga is a nonpharmacological, cost-effective, and safe intervention associated with several health benefits. Originating in ancient India, this vast discipline consists of postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation (dhyana/dharana), and relaxation. Studies have demonstrated yoga's ability to bolster innate immunity and to inhibit cytokine release syndrome. As an intervention, yoga has been shown to improve mental health, as it alleviates anxiety, depression, and stress and enhances mindfulness, self-control, and self-regulation. Yoga has been correlated with numerous cardioprotective effects, which also may play a role in COVID-19 by preventing lung and cardiac injury.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This review paves the path for further research on yoga as a potential intervention for enhancing innate immunity and mental health and thus its role in prevention and adjunctive treatment in COVID-19.

AB  - Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been described as the operation of the century. Despite significant advancement in the field of technology, hip instability remains second most common cause of revision hip surgery after infection. There is garning interest to identify role of hip-spine relationship in order to identify high-risk patients for instability after THA. Acetabular component position varies according to spinal alignment and mobility in order to decrease risk of impingement and instability. Preoperative work up includes standing pelvis anteroposterior radiograph and lateral spino-pelvic radiograph in standing and sitting position. The focus of this review is to develop an algorithm to address the spino-pelvic pathology and guide the treatment on the basis of sagittal movement of the spine-pelvis-hip complex and to minimise the rate of dislocation following THA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic trauma occurs in 0.2-2% of patients with blunt trauma and 1-12% of patients with penetrating trauma. The mortality and morbidity rates range from 9 to 34% and 30-60% respectively. We aimed to review the management of pancreatic trauma in a multicenter database from India.
METHODS: We analyzed all patients who suffered a pancreatic injury and who were included in the multicenter prospective observational study 'Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes (TITCO)'.
RESULTS: Of the 16047 trauma cases, 1134 (7.1%) patients suffered abdominal trauma. Of all those with abdominal trauma, 55 patients (4.9%) had injury to the pancreas. 28 patients (50.9%) with pancreatic trauma were managed conservatively. 27 patients (49.1%) underwent surgical exploration in the form of laparotomies. 11 procedures were undertaken for pancreas. A total of 45 (82%) patients had associated injuries along with pancreatic injury. Thorax (19) (including injuries to lung, pleura and ribs), liver (17), bowel (14) and spleen (13) were the most common associated injuries.
CONCLUSION: Conservative management was as common as operative management in patients with pancreatic injuries. Most (80%) grade III/IV underwent operative treatment. Many patients (82%) had associated injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to mitigate the challenges in microsurgical skill acquisition and training, especially in the COVID-19 era, we devised a novel microsurgical telementoring protocol for imparting microsurgical skill training in a socially distanced setting. We objectively analyzed its feasibility among neurosurgical trainees.
METHODS: In a controlled experimental design, 8 residents at different stages of their tenure participated in a lazy glass microsurgical simulator-based telementoring exercise. Microsuturing with 4-0 silk, 10-0 nylon on silastic sheets, and eggshell peeling tasks were performed by the residents prior to and after a telementoring session by a panel of 4 neurosurgical experts. Impact of telementoring was assessed in terms of surgical accuracy, efficiency, and dexterity by providing objective (Performance score [PS]), subjective (Neurosurgery Education and Training School [NETS] score), and cumulative scores (CS). Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the impact at different stages of residency.
RESULTS: PS, NETS score, and CS were significantly improved by telementoring sessions for 10-0 nylon micro-suturing (P < 0.001), and egg-hell peeling tasks (P < 0.01). PS and CS improved significantly (P = 0.01) after telementoring sessions for 4-0 silk microsuturing. Both pre- and post-training CS were similar across the 2 subgroups PGY 1-4 and PGY 5-6 (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Telementoring is a viable alternative for neurosurgical resident training in the COVID-19 era, where reduction in elective surgeries and social distancing norms preclude conventional teaching. Lazy glass microsurgical simulator-based structured telementoring protocol is a cost-effective tool to augment surgical proficiency and finesse, irrespective of stage of residency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predicted increases in suicide were not generally observed in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the picture may be changing and patterns might vary across demographic groups. We aimed to provide a timely, granular picture of the pandemic's impact on suicides globally.
METHODS: We identified suicide data from official public-sector sources for countries/areas-within-countries, searching websites and academic literature and contacting data custodians and authors as necessary. We sent our first data request on 22nd June 2021 and stopped collecting data on 31st October 2021. We used interrupted time series (ITS) analyses to model the association between the pandemic's emergence and total suicides and suicides by sex-, age- and sex-by-age in each country/area-within-country. We compared the observed and expected numbers of suicides in the pandemic's first nine and first 10-15 months and used meta-regression to explore sources of variation.
FINDINGS: We sourced data from 33 countries (24 high-income, six upper-middle-income, three lower-middle-income; 25 with whole-country data, 12 with data for area(s)-within-the-country, four with both). There was no evidence of greater-than-expected numbers of suicides in the majority of countries/areas-within-countries in any analysis; more commonly, there was evidence of lower-than-expected numbers. Certain sex, age and sex-by-age groups stood out as potentially concerning, but these were not consistent across countries/areas-within-countries. In the meta-regression, different patterns were not explained by countries' COVID-19 mortality rate, stringency of public health response, economic support level, or presence of a national suicide prevention strategy. Nor were they explained by countries' income level, although the meta-regression only included data from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and there were suggestions from the ITS analyses that lower-middle-income countries fared less well.
INTERPRETATION: Although there are some countries/areas-within-countries where overall suicide numbers and numbers for certain sex- and age-based groups are greater-than-expected, these countries/areas-within-countries are in the minority. Any upward movement in suicide numbers in any place or group is concerning, and we need to remain alert to and respond to changes as the pandemic and its mental health and economic consequences continue.
FUNDING: None.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a preventable but escalating global health crisis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies to date have been limited, and some are underpowered. In this study, we aimed to perform the PsychArray-based GWAS study to identify single nucleotide variations associated with suicide in the Indian population. Methods: We recruited unrelated subjects who died by suicide as cases (N = 313) and the non-suicidal deaths as controls (N = 294). The 607 samples were genotyped, including cases and controls using the Illumina Infinium PsychArray-24 BeadChip v1.3 Results: In our study, four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) crossed the threshold of significance level <1 × 10−5. One of them is intronic at Chromosome2:rs1901851 and three are intergenic at Chromosome12:rs3847911, Chromosome8:rs2941489, Chromosome8:rs1464092. At a significance level of 5 × 10−5, we found a few more SNPs, with the majority of them being intergenic variants. The associated genes were associated with various important functions ranging from cell signaling, GTP binding, GPCR binding, and transcription factor binding. Conclusions: The SNPs identified in our study were not reported earlier. To our best knowledge, this study is one of the first GWAS for suicide in the Indian population. The results indicate few novel SNPs that may be associated with suicide and require further investigation. Their clinical significance is to be studied in the future.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Diversion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been used for decades as a treatment for children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is recommended by evidenced-based guidelines. However, these recommendations are based on limited studies.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether CSF diversion is associated with improved Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended for Pediatrics (GOS-EP) and decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with severe TBI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational comparative effectiveness study was performed at 51 clinical centers that routinely care for children with severe TBI in 8 countries (US, United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India) from February 2014 to September 2017, with follow-up at 6 months after injury (final follow-up, October 22, 2021). Children with severe TBI were included if they had Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 8 or lower, had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placed on-site, and were aged younger than 18 years. Children were excluded if they were pregnant or an ICP monitor was not placed at the study site. Consecutive children were screened and enrolled, data regarding treatments were collected, and at discharge, consent was obtained for outcomes testing. Propensity matching for pretreatment characteristics was performed to develop matched pairs for primary analysis. Data analyses were completed on April 18, 2022.
EXPOSURES: Clinical care followed local standards, including the use of CSF diversion (or not), with patients stratified at the time of ICP monitor placement (CSF group vs no CSF group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was GOS-EP at 6 months, while ICP was considered as a secondary outcome. CSF vs no CSF was treated as an intention-to-treat analysis, and a sensitivity analysis was performed for children who received delayed CSF diversion.
RESULTS: A total of 1000 children with TBI were enrolled, including 314 who received CSF diversion (mean [SD] age, 7.18 [5.45] years; 208 [66.2%] boys) and 686 who did not (mean [SD] age, 7.79 [5.33] years; 437 [63.7%] boys). The propensity-matched analysis included 98 pairs. In propensity score-matched analyses, there was no difference between groups in GOS-EP (median [IQR] difference, 0 [-3 to 1]; P = .08), but there was a decrease in overall ICP in the CSF group (mean [SD] difference, 3.97 [0.12] mm Hg; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness study, CSF diversion was not associated with improved outcome at 6 months after TBI, but a decrease in ICP was observed. Given the higher quality of evidence generated by this study, current evidence-based guidelines related to CSF diversion should be reconsidered.

AB  - Small perforations are often managed with cyanoacrylate glue - bandage contact lens (BCL). An additional layer with substances like sterile drape often enhances the strength of the glue. Herein, we describe a novel method of using anterior lens capsule as biological drape to secure perforation. The anterior capsule was secured from femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and placed over the perforation after folding it twice. The area was dried and a small aliquot of cyanoacrylate glue was applied over it. The BCL was applied over it after the glue was dry. In our series of five patients, none of them needed repeat surgery and all cases healed by three months without vascularization. It is a unique technique to secure small corneal perforations.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the effect of subthreshold micropulse yellow laser treatment on central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and to compare two laser protocols. As per our knowledge, there are no studies comparing the two protocols of subthreshold laser.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with non-resolving CSC of at least three months duration were treated with subthreshold laser (577 nm). Ten patients were treated with 5% duty cycle (group A) and 13 patients with 10% duty cycle (group B). At one month, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), subretinal fluid (SRF), choroidal thickness (CT) and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were evaluated.
RESULTS: In group A, BCVA improved from 0.508 ± 504 to 0.174 ± 0.171 (P = 0.0058), CMT improved from 349.8 ± 168.9 micrometers (μm) to 183.3 ± 70.312 μm (P = 0.0093) and SRF reduced from 202.4 ± 158.024 to 43.8 ± 46.599 μm (P = 0.0069). In group B, BCVA improved from 0.437 ± 0.426 to 0.289 ± 0.470 (P = 0.0026), CMT improved from 280.846 ± 72.668 to 196.769 ± 72.62 μm (P = 0.0002) and SRF reduced from 110.385 ± 57.687 μm to 52.538 ± 52.111 μm (P = 0.0064). No significant difference was found in BCVA and CMT between the groups (P = 0.8716 and P = 0.8523, respectively). CSC completely resolved in 50% of cases in group A and in 69.2% of cases in group B. This difference was not statistically significant (0.423); however, the odds ratio of resolution was 2.25 times more with 10% duty cycle. No change was observed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) following laser.
CONCLUSION: Subthreshold micropulse laser can lead to resolution of SRF in 60.87% of cases (groups A and B combined). Ten per cent duty cycle had higher odds of resolution without causing any RPE damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage occurs during epileptogenesis and several pieces of evidence suggest that this might contribute to the progression of epilepsy. Seizures trigger a pathway involving glutamate signalling through cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This pathway leads to BBB leakage and induces the expression of drug efflux transporters, leading to drug resistance. Therefore, this study aims to determine the mRNA and protein levels of cPLA2, along with its functional activity, in the hippocampus of pilocarpine model of TLE as well as in the surgically resected hippocampal samples of patients with TLE.
METHODS: mRNA levels and protein levels of cPLA2 were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot analysis respectively in animal model of TLE as well as surgically resected hippocampal tissue specimens of TLE. cPLA2 functional activity was measured spectrophotometrically.
RESULTS: Significant up-regulation of cPLA2 mRNA was observed in the hippocampal samples obtained from TLE rats (p < 0.05) and-TLE patients (p < 0.01). Increased protein expression of cPLA2 was also demonstrated in the hippocampal samples of TLE rats (p < 0.01) as well as TLE patients (p < 0.01). Similarly, functional activity of cPLA2 was found to be up-regulated in the hippocampus of pilocarpine model of TLE rats (p < 0.01) as well as in the TLE patients (p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that alterations in cPLA2 expression and activity level in the hippocampus could potentially be a part of dynamic changes associated with TLE.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge of Indian patients with sarcoma about their illness in the sarcoma medical oncology clinic of a tertiary care centre.
METHOD: This prospective cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was done on patients attending the adult sarcoma clinic at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Patients aged between 18 and 60 years who gave consent and could understand Hindi or English were recruited for the study. A questionnaire (bilingual - English/Hindi) was given to the patients in the language they understood. The questionnaire captured the knowledge of patients about their illness (cancer/sarcoma), sub-type of sarcoma, the occurrence of the disease (common or rare), origin (bone or soft tissue), metastatic or non-metastatic and the understanding of the possibility of recurrence/progression.
RESULT: There were 102 patients in the study with a median age of 31.5 years. About 62% of patients had soft tissue sarcomas, and the rest had bone sarcomas. The most common sarcoma in the studied population was Ewing's sarcoma (23.5%). Metastatic disease was present in 48 (47.1%) of the total patients studied. About 87.2% of patients were aware that they had some form of cancer, and only 62 (69.9%) patients said that they had sarcoma. Only 55 of the 102 patients (56%) knew that the illness was rare. About 70.6% of patients knew about their disease's actual stage. More patients with metastatic disease understood the stage correctly (35 of 54 patients) as compared to patients with the non-metastatic disease (37 of 48 patients) (77% versus 64.8%, p = 0.001). About 77% of patients reported the site of origin of cancer correctly. The patients who had a higher level of education and belonged to a higher socioeconomic status had significantly better knowledge regarding the diagnosis, stage, rarity and prognosis of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Our patients have poor knowledge about different types of sarcomas, and very few patients know that sarcoma is a rare malignancy. The most crucial factor that influenced the knowledge was the level of education. Through this study, we could identify the sub-group wherein the knowledge gap was significant. Thus, active patient education programmes can help these patients to identify their illness and henceforth therapeutically manage it more wisely.

AB  - Addiction medicine is a rapidly growing field with many young professionals seeking careers in this field. However, early-career professionals (ECPs) face challenges such as a lack of competency-based training due to a shortage of trainers, limited resources, limited mentorship opportunities, and establishment of suitable research areas. The International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) New Professionals Exploration, Training & Education (NExT) committee, a global platform for early-career addiction medicine professionals (ECAMPs), conducted a two-phase online survey using a modified Delphi-based approach among ECAMPs across 56 countries to assess the need for standardized training, research opportunities, and mentorship. A total of 110 respondents participated in Phase I (online key informant survey), and 28 respondents participated in Phase II (online expert group discussions on three themes identified in Phase I). The survey found that there is a lack of standardized training, structured mentorship programs, research funding, and research opportunities in addiction medicine for ECAMPs. There is a need for standardized training programs, improving research opportunities, and effective mentorship programs to promote the next generation of addiction medicine professionals and further development in the entire field. The efforts of ISAM NExT are well-received and give a template of how this gap can be addressed.

AB  - AIMS: The purpose of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the dental caries status in individuals with hearing difficulties.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Searches were conducted in six databases with no restriction on publication date. The cross-sectional and comparative cross sectional studies assessing the dental caries status of hearing impaired individuals using standardized evaluation criteria were included. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Wiley Online, Lilacs, and Scopus databases were searched to identify the relevant papers published before August 1, 2021. The risk of bias assessment was carried out by New Castle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Three thousand three hundred thirty five potentially relevant references were identified in the systematic literature search. Thirteen relevant publications that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in the systematic review and the meta analysis. The overall analysis of the included studies revealed pooled dental caries prevalence of 58.0% (95% CI 0.41-0.74) among the hearing impaired individuals. The overall dental caries experience of the included studies showed a mean pooled DMFT of 2.68 (95% CI 1.24-4.12).
CONCLUSION: The present systematic review and meta-analysis reported high dental caries prevalence in hearing impaired individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schools have a powerful influence on children's development and well-being, and school teachers are considered role models to transmit life values and instill health-related behaviors. The effectiveness of a training program for school teachers in understanding the role of sugars and their impact on oral and overall health has not been previously reported.
AIM: The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a training program for school teachers on the role of sugars in oral and general health.
METHODS: An interventional study was carried out on 308 Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan school teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a training program in improving school teachers' knowledge of the role of sugars in oral and overall health. The training program was carried out using a training module, and a validated questionnaire was utilized to assess school teachers' knowledge before and after the training program.
RESULTS: The overall evaluation of mean knowledge change scores revealed significantly higher scores after the training program (8.12 ±1.58) when compared with the pre-training scores (6.84±1.66) Conclusion: A training program on the role of sugars in oral and general health effectively improved school teachers' knowledge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMP) are rare; however, secondary forms may be seen in ~10-15% of patients with systemic multiple myeloma (MM). The diagnosis of EMP is based on the demonstration of monoclonal plasma cells in the lesion, which requires tissue sampling.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 38 year old female with MM who underwent diagnostic US at our institute. Multiple focal liver lesions were detected, which were suspicious for EMP. She underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for diagnosis, following which she developed hemoperitoneum secondary to deranged clotting parameters (prothrombin time and platelet count). CT angiography revealed active hepatic capsular bleed. She was taken up for percutaneous embolisation, and the supplying vessel successfully embolised using gel foam particles.
CONCLUSION: Complications may rarely occur in interventional procedures, particularly in patients with comorbidities. However, prompt diagnosis and management help prevent adverse outcomes.

AB  - Hemorrhage is the most frequently encountered post renal biopsy complication; reported in 12% to 14% of patients. Although the vast majority of these are due to renal artery injury, involvement of gonadal arteries is also rarely seen. These may be managed by the endovascular route, which has several limitations in this subset of patients. We report a case of a 69-year-old male with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, who underwent renal biopsy and developed a testicular artery pseudoaneurysm (PA). Successful embolization of this PA was performed under ultrasound guidance using a direct percutaneous approach. This is the first such case reported in the literature.

T2  - Indian Journal of Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine high resolution CT (HRCT) patterns of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in children; and their etiological correlates.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving 149 children with diffuse lung disease (DLD). Patterns of involvement were classified based on dominant lung finding as ground glass opacity (GGO) dominant, nodule dominant, cystic lung disease, or PF. Patterns of PF were classified based on distribution and morphology into airway centric fibrosis (ACF), subpleural fibrosis (SPF), progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and fibrocavitary. A comparison was made between the two dominant groups for apicobasal distribution, associated findings (GGO, nodules, cysts), and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH).
RESULTS: Nineteen patients showed PF on HRCT. ACF was commonest (52.6%), followed by SPF (42.1%). The common etiology was sarcoidosis (30%) in ACF, and connective tissue disorders (CTD) (50%) in SPF. Significant difference was found between ACF and SPF in apicobasal distribution (p = 0.04), presence of nodules (p = 0.03), and cysts (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: PF may present as an end stage of several childhood lung diseases. PF on imaging has discernible morphological patterns that correlate with underlying etiology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the utility of computed tomography angiography (CTA) signs of vascular injury in the differentiation of vessel transection from pure thrombosis with intact vessel wall.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was done on 146 consecutive patients who had undergone CTA and surgical exploration from January 2015 to September 2019. Twelve imaging parameters were assessed. Chi-square was used to test the difference between groups. In addition, a scoring system was devised where one point each was added for the presence of 5 signs and absence of 3 signs. ROC analysis was done for the variables which had shown significant difference between groups and for the composite score.
RESULTS: On surgical exploration, 87 patients had transection of vessel, while 59 had thrombosis. Significant difference was found among the two groups in non-opacification, pseudoaneurysm, extravasation (p = 0.04 each), thrombosed cord (p < 0.001), collaterals (p = 0.001) and hematoma (p = 0.002), while other signs did not show significant difference. The AUC value for each of these variables was < 0.650, while for the score, AUC was .843(.773-.913). A cut-off value of ≥ 1.5 gave 83.1% sensitivity and 70% specificity for diagnosing transection.
CONCLUSION: CTA is a useful tool to classify the nature of vascular injury. It is advisable to use a composite score for maximum diagnostic value.

AB  - Ultrasonography (US) is the workhorse of pediatric imaging; however, lung US is only a recently developed application. US of the lung is based predominantly on the imaging of chest wall-air-fluid interfaces. In this review, we summarize the available literature on applications of lung US in neonatal as well as pediatric care. We describe the imaging appearance of various commonly encountered pathologies including pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome, among others, and provide illustrative images. Finally, we describe the limitations of the technique that are essential knowledge for radiologists, critical care physicians, sonographers and technologists attempting to use lung US effectively for diagnosis and management.

Methods  Retrospective data collection, data for the past 1.5 years (COVID period) March 2020 to August 2021 were compared to surgical output for a similar duration of time before the COVID era (September 2018-February 2020). Results  A total of 1,022 surgeries were done under anesthesia in the COVID period as against 1,710 surgeries done in a similar time frame in the pre-COVID era. Overall, we saw a 40%drop in the total number of cases. Thorax, abdominal, and miscellaneous surgeries (soft tissue sarcomas, urology, and gyneconcology) saw a maximum fall in numbers; however, head and neck cases saw an increase in numbers during the pandemic. Surgical morbidity and mortality were similar in the COVID and pre-COVID era. No cases of severe COVID infection were reported among the healthcare staff working in OT. Discussion  We could successfully continue our anesthesia services with minimal risk to healthcare staff throughout the pandemic by adopting major guidelines in a pragmatic and practical approach with minor changes to suit our setup.

AB  - Pathological low birth weight due to fetal growth restriction (FGR) is an important predictor of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. It is more common amongst native lowlanders when gestating in the hypoxic environment of high altitude, whilst populations who have resided at high altitude for many generations are relatively protected. Genetic study of pregnant populations at high altitude permits exploration of the role of hypoxia in FGR pathogenesis, and perhaps of FGR pathogenesis more broadly. We studied the umbilical cord blood DNA of 316 neonates born to pregnant women managed at the Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital, Ladakh (altitude 3540m) between February 2017 and January 2019. Principal component, admixture and genome wide association studies (GWAS) were applied to dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic data, to explore ancestry and genetic predictors of low birth weight. Our findings support Tibetan ancestry in the Ladakhi population, with subsequent admixture with neighboring Indo-Aryan populations. Fetal growth protection was evident in Ladakhi neonates. Although no variants achieved genome wide significance, we observed nominal association of seven variants across genes (ZBTB38, ZFP36L2, HMGA2, CDKAL1, PLCG1) previously associated with birthweight.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge of Indian patients with sarcoma about their illness in the sarcoma medical oncology clinic of a tertiary care centre.
METHOD: This prospective cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was done on patients attending the adult sarcoma clinic at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Patients aged between 18 and 60 years who gave consent and could understand Hindi or English were recruited for the study. A questionnaire (bilingual - English/Hindi) was given to the patients in the language they understood. The questionnaire captured the knowledge of patients about their illness (cancer/sarcoma), sub-type of sarcoma, the occurrence of the disease (common or rare), origin (bone or soft tissue), metastatic or non-metastatic and the understanding of the possibility of recurrence/progression.
RESULT: There were 102 patients in the study with a median age of 31.5 years. About 62% of patients had soft tissue sarcomas, and the rest had bone sarcomas. The most common sarcoma in the studied population was Ewing's sarcoma (23.5%). Metastatic disease was present in 48 (47.1%) of the total patients studied. About 87.2% of patients were aware that they had some form of cancer, and only 62 (69.9%) patients said that they had sarcoma. Only 55 of the 102 patients (56%) knew that the illness was rare. About 70.6% of patients knew about their disease's actual stage. More patients with metastatic disease understood the stage correctly (35 of 54 patients) as compared to patients with the non-metastatic disease (37 of 48 patients) (77% versus 64.8%, p = 0.001). About 77% of patients reported the site of origin of cancer correctly. The patients who had a higher level of education and belonged to a higher socioeconomic status had significantly better knowledge regarding the diagnosis, stage, rarity and prognosis of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Our patients have poor knowledge about different types of sarcomas, and very few patients know that sarcoma is a rare malignancy. The most crucial factor that influenced the knowledge was the level of education. Through this study, we could identify the sub-group wherein the knowledge gap was significant. Thus, active patient education programmes can help these patients to identify their illness and henceforth therapeutically manage it more wisely.

T2  - Journal of Medical Case Reports
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome that is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 have a higher risk of gastrointestinal stromal tumor. This study reports the case of a patient with gastrointestinal stromal tumor who was later diagnosed to have neurofibromatosis type 1 and, unlike usual features, had some uncommon features such as occurrence at an early age and unusual site of origin.
CASE: We report the case of a 29-year-old Indian female diagnosed to have gastrointestinal stromal tumor originating from the greater curvature of the stomach. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor was wild type, negative for c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and had an aggressive clinical course not responding to oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors. On later evaluation, we found that the patient had germline mutation in NF1. This case has some unusual features compared with gastrointestinal stromal tumor cases reported in neurofibromatosis type 1. Firstly, the age of onset for gastrointestinal stromal tumor in neurofibromatosis type 1 is earlier in our case compared with previous cases reported in literature. Secondly, the site of occurrence is in the stomach, without involving other parts of the intestine. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor in neurofibromatosis type 1 is usually multifocal, and small intestine is the common site of occurrence. When occurring in the stomach, it is usually associated with other lesions in the small intestine. Lastly, the clinical course is aggressive compared with previous case reports and series.
CONCLUSION: Our patient had germline NF1 mutation and cutaneous stigmata of neurofibromatosis. Our patient had unicentric gastrointestinal stromal tumor occurring at younger age and involving greater curvature of the stomach, with spindle cell type histology and high-risk features. If gastrointestinal stromal tumor occurs at young age, we should look into neurocutaneous markers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of various computed tomography (CT) chest findings in diagnosing recurrence among pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) suspects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi. A total of 130 suspects with a past history of treatment for PTB, who presented with any of the symptoms suggestive of recurrence were included. Sputum-positive, HIV-positive patients, pregnant females, and patients aged <18 years were excluded. Patients underwent CT chest followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were there in the final analysis. The median age of the patients with recurrent PTB was 27.5 years. Cough was the universal symptom in all these patients (>90%). Hemoptysis was the predominant symptom among patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (66.6%). Necrotic mediastinal lymph nodes had good diagnostic accuracy of 88.71% with area under the curve of 0.806, P < 0.001 in diagnosing recurrent TB. BAL GeneXpert and mycobacteria growth indicator tube had good sensitivity (83.33% and 84.62%, respectively), specificity (100% for both), and excellent diagnostic accuracy (95.16% and 96.36%, respectively) for diagnosing recurrence in sputum negative and sputum scarce patient, (P < 0.001) when compared with composite reference standard. For culture-positive cases, BAL GeneXpert MTB/RIF had 100% sensitivity and 97.73% specificity in diagnosing recurrent PTB patients.
CONCLUSION: The presence of mediastinal necrotic lymph node is the most accurate CT finding that can differentiate recurrent TB from post-TB sequelae. No other single chest CT scan finding had reliable diagnostic accuracy in comparison to microbiological tools in diagnosing recurrence among sputum negative or scarce previously treated PTB suspects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive DECT based characterization of renal stones using their effective atomic number (Zeff) and the electron density (ρe) in patients.
AIM: This paper aims to develop a method for in-vivo characterization of renal stone. Differentiation of renal stones in-vivo especially sub types of calcium stones have very important advantage for better judgement of treatment modality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 extracted renal stones were scanned ex-vivo using dual energy CT scanner. A method was developed to characterize these renal stones using effective atomic number and electron density obtained from dual energy CT data. The method and formulation developed in ex-vivo experiments was applied in in-vivo study of 50 randomly selected patients of renal stones who underwent dual energy CT scan.
RESULTS: The developed method was able to characterize Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate (COM) and the combination of COM and Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (COD) stones non-invasively in patients with a sensitivity of 81% and 83%respectively. The method was also capable of differentiating Uric, Cystine and mixed stones with the sensitivity of 100, 100 and 85.71% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The developed dual energy CT based method was capable of differentiating sub types of calcium stones which is not differentiable on single energy or dual energy CT images.

AB  - A growing body of scientific evidence supports the notion that gut microbiota plays a key role in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes related to human health. Recent findings have now established that gut microbiota also contributes to the regulation of bone homeostasis. Studies on animal models have unraveled various underlying mechanisms responsible for gut microbiota-mediated bone regulation. Normal gut microbiota is thus required for the maintenance of bone homeostasis. However, dysbiosis of gut microbiota communities is reported to be associated with several bone-related ailments such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and periodontitis. Dietary interventions in the form of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics have been reported in restoring the dysbiotic gut microbiota composition and thus could provide various health benefits to the host including bone health. These dietary interventions prevent bone loss through several mechanisms and thus could act as potential therapies for the treatment of bone pathologies. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge of how gut microbiota and its derived microbial compounds are associated with bone metabolism and their roles in ameliorating bone health. In addition to this, we also highlight the role of various dietary supplements like probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics as promising microbiota targeted interventions with the clinical application for leveraging treatment modalities in various inflammatory bone pathologies.

AB  - Earlier research from our laboratory demonstrated the presence of stimulatory activity of different growth factors in the fetal liver (FL) extracts when collected in a medium known as fetal liver conditioned medium (FLCM) using Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In the present study, we have assessed two other cytokines viz. IL-6 and FMS like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt-3) with the help of bioneutralization assay. FLCM was prepared by incubating fetal liver cells with Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% Phytohemagglutinin and collected after 24hrs, 48hrs, 72 hrs. and on the 7th day of incubation. Clonal cultures were established for 1 X 105 normal bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (NBM MNC) per plate with methylcellulose medium containing cytokines SCF and EPO. Mean Colony forming units-granulocytes, erythrocytes, macrophages, megakaryocytes (CFU-GEMM) were assessed with and without the addition of FLCM. It was found that FLCM enhanced the number of colonies made by NBM MNCs. Further, cytokines IL-6 and Flt-3, present in FLCM, were bioneutralized with respective anti-cytokine antibodies. Neutralized FLCM was evaluated for the colony-forming potential of CFU-GEMM colonies. The maximum reduction of 42% was seen with 20 ng/ml of anti-IL-6 antibody. Maximum suppression up to 20% was observed with 0.7 ng/ml of anti Flt-3 antibody for CFU-GEMM colonies. Presence of cytokines IL-6 and Flt-3 in FL extracts and their colony stimulatory activity suggests that fetal liver infusion (FLI) may be a valuable alternative for managing BM recovery in certain clinical conditions such as AA.

T2  - Journal of The Electrochemical Society
AB  - In this study, we have developed an aptamer-based PDMS/glass microfluidic chip biosensor employing the capacitance based method of detection, which has the tendency to work as an on-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) monitoring tool to detect Lucentis in the fermenters. The limit of detection (LOD) and linear range of detection of the chip was determined to be 8.5 nM and 8.5−100 nM, respectively which was better than HPLC based method of Lucentis estimation. In real sample analysis, a significant correlation was obtained between the reported microchip based biosensor and HPLC-based detection method. Moreover, pre-concentration or pre-processing of media broth was not necessary with our method, which reduced the analysis time to 30 min. The chip was determined to be miniaturized, selective, specific, interference-free, label-free, rapid, and reusable with a long shelf-life. Additionally, the chip demonstrated the requirement of a small direct sample volume of 10 μl and simple automation using a peristaltic pump. The chip biosensor is expected to have on-line PAT monitoring use for checking the production of Lucentis in the fermenter leading to a reduction in the cost of the therapy and better affordability of the treatment to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early aggressive therapy using biologicals is increasingly being used in JIA for early disease remission. Pulse steroids are used in induction regimes for rheumatic disorders such as SLE and systemic JIA; however, no controlled studies have demonstrated their use in non-systemic JIA. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pulse dexamethasone therapy in children with treatment-naïve non-systemic JIA as early aggressive therapy in resource-limited settings.
METHODS: Sixty treatment-naïve children with non-systemic JIA with an active joint count of ≥5 and/or involvement of hip or cervical joints were randomized to receive either pulse dexamethasone (3 mg/kg/day, max 100 mg/day) or placebo (normal saline) for three consecutive days during each visit at 0, 6 (±2) and 12 (±2) weeks; along with standard therapy (MTX and NSAIDs). The use of oral bridge steroids was permissible for persistent severe disease as per predefined criteria. The primary outcome was ACR-Pedi 70 response at 16 (±2) weeks after enrolment in the two groups.
RESULTS: The proportion of children achieving ACR-Pedi 70 in the two groups at last follow-up was 11/30 (36.7%) in pulse dexamethasone arm vs 11/28 (39.3%) in the placebo arm (P-value 0.837, relative risk 0.93, 95% CI 0.48, 1.80). We did not observe any significant difference in the proportion of children requiring bridge steroids. Adverse events were comparable in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The addition of pulse dexamethasone to standard treatment may not add any advantage in improving ACR-Pedi 70 scores at medium-term follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: 
          The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the lives of millions of people around the world. The stress due to the increased risk of morbidity and mortality among the elderly along with the lockdown measures can impact the mental health of older aged adults. Hence, the current study aimed to assess the mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on older adults in India.
          Methods: 
          The current study was part of an online, cross-sectional survey conducted in eight countries. For the current study, participants were included if they were Indians, were at least 55 years of age, had Internet access, were residing in India, and were willing to participate in the study. A semi-structured questionnaire to assess the sociodemographic data and worries related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were applied.
          Results: 
          A total of 181 older adults participated. The most common worries were the impact of COVID on society (65.2%) and on friends and family (50.8%). About 14.9%, 2.8%, and 14.9% of participants were screened positive for depression, probable posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety based on PHQ-9, IES-R, and GAD-7, respectively. There was a significant association of both depression and anxiety with preexisting mental illness, worry about transmitting COVID to others, ability to care for others, impact of COVID-19 on one's own health, finances, and society.
          Conclusions: 
          Higher levels of altruism and “psychological jointedness” in the Indian family could have led to this unique finding that older adults were more worried about the impact of pandemic on others, than self.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acid supplements in relieving dry eye symptoms and signs in symptomatic visual display terminal users (VDT).
METHODS: A randomized controlled study was done; eyes of 470 VDT users were randomized to receive four capsules twice daily for 6 months (O3FAgroup), each containing 180 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid. The O3FA group was compared with another group (n = 480) who received four capsules of a placebo (olive oil) twice daily. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. The primary outcome was improvement in omega-3 index (a measure of EPA and DHA ratio in RBC membrane). Secondary outcomes were improvement dry eye symptoms, Nelson grade on conjunctival impression cytology, Schirmer test values, tear film breakup time (TBUT), and tear film osmolarity. Means of groups (pre-treatment, 1, 3, and 6-months) were compared with repeated measure analysis of variance.
RESULTS: At baseline, 81% patients had low omega-3 index. In the O3FA group, a significant increase in omega-3 index, improvement in symptoms, reduction in tear film osmolarity, and increase in Schirmer, TBUT, and goblet cell density was observed. These changes were not significant in the placebo group. Improvement in test parameters was significantly (P < 0.001) better in patients with low omega3 index (<4%) subgroup.
CONCLUSION: Dietary omega-3 fatty acids are effective for dry eye in VDT users; omega-3 index appears to be the predictor to identify potential dry eye patients who are likely to benefit from oral omega-3 dietary intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma is associated with poor prognosis in its advanced stages. Potential influence of estrogen and its metabolites on melanoma growth has been suggested.
AIMS: The objective of this review was to provide an overview on the evidence related to estrogen in malignant melanoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar and relevant cross-references of the retrieved articles was performed to review relevant published articles related to estrogen and its effects in malignant melanoma.
RESULTS: Effect of estrogen signaling on a tissue largely depends on the relative expression of estrogen receptors (ER) α and β. Gender differences in melanoma may be explained by the difference in expression of these receptors. ERβ is the principal ER in melanoma.
DISCUSSION: Although there is uncertainty about role of estrogen in pathogenensis and progression of melanoma, evidence suggests that its growth and metastasis are influenced by estrogen stimulation. Role ER on the proliferation of melanoma cells is well described.
CONCLUSION: There is a need of safe and effective therapy for melanoma, especially for advanced cases. After the establishment of specific role of estrogen and its receptor, analysis of specific genetic mutation can be performed for proper utilization of targeted therapies.

AB  - The objective of this study is to synthesise the findings of clinical studies in order to derive evidence for use of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxias. In order to find relevant studies for the systematic review, we searched through Medline (1985 to July 2020), PubMed and Clinical trial register. We included both single-arm and comparative studies in which MSCs were given as intervention in neurodegenerative ataxia patients at any time after the diagnosis. We used Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) quality scale to evaluate the methodological qualities of the included studies. Our literature search obtained 81 publications. Three articles comprising a total of 47 patients were included in the meta-analysis. None of them were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Pooled analysis noted that there was a decrease in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)/Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score from pre to post assessment; however, the difference was statistically not significant (standardised mean difference (SMD) - 0.20; 95% CI - 0.78 to 0.38). No significant side effects were reported in any of the studies. We did not observe any statistically significant difference in the pooled mean difference in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score between pre and post assessment in patients with ataxia after receiving the stem cells (SMD 0.36, 95% CI - 0.08 to 0.81). Our systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that MSC cell therapy appeared safe but provided insufficient evidence to support the use of MSCs to treat patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia at present. No l RCTs was available in the literature to test efficacy; therefore, well-designed RCTs are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of MSCs in patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxias.

AB  - Delirious mania has been described as a state of acute excitement, fluctuating sensorium, affective and catatonic symptoms. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) despite being an effective treatment modality in such cases, has been under-utilised during pregnancy, mainly due to safety concerns. Here, we report the effectiveness of ECT in acute management of delirious mania in a 24 weeks pregnant woman who also tested COVID-19 positive during hospitalisation. Patient presented with three weeks history of acute manic excitement with period of altered sensorium and catatonic symptoms with no response to trials of two antipsychotic agents. After organic causes ruled out, patient was planned for ECT while ongoing antipsychotic was continued. After the first ECT session, patient tested positive for COVID-19, though asymptomatic and had to be shifted to COVID-19 isolation facility. Complete resolution of psychiatric symptoms occurred after fifth ECT. All five ECT sessions, including those in COVID-19 isolation facility were carried out under supervision of a multidisciplinary team. None of the ECT sessions had any major adverse event. Symptom remission sustained even following ECT discontinuation. No neonatal or maternal adverse effects observed after an uneventful delivery at 35 weeks. Both mother and child continued to maintain well in follow-up period of one year on oral olanzapine. In this unusual concurrent presentation of mania, delirium and catatonic symptoms during second trimester pregnancy, we highlighted the effectiveness and safety of ECT as a viable treatment modality. Additionally, management challenges posed by patient testing COVID-19 positive and then, administering ECT in COVID-19 isolation facility using personal protective equipment by multidisciplinary team has been highlighted.

AB  - Gene editing has great potential in treating diseases caused by well-characterized molecular alterations. The introduction of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based gene-editing tools has substantially improved the precision and efficiency of gene editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system offers several advantages over the existing gene-editing approaches, such as its ability to target practically any genomic sequence, enabling the rapid development and deployment of novel CRISPR-mediated knock-out/knock-in methods. CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used to develop cancer models, validate essential genes as druggable targets, study drug-resistance mechanisms, explore gene non-coding areas, and develop biomarkers. CRISPR gene editing can create more-effective chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells that are durable, cost-effective, and more readily available. However, further research is needed to define the CRISPR/Cas9 system's pros and cons, establish best practices, and determine social and ethical implications. This review summarizes recent CRISPR/Cas9 developments, particularly in cancer research and immunotherapy, and the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based screening in developing cancer precision medicine and engineering models for targeted cancer therapy, highlighting the existing challenges and future directions. Lastly, we highlight the role of artificial intelligence in refining the CRISPR system's on-target and off-target effects, a critical factor for the broader application in cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a predominant life-threatening cancer, with liver and peritoneal metastases as the primary causes of death. Intestinal inflammation, a known CRC risk factor, nurtures a local inflammatory environment enriched with tumor cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, immunosuppressive cells, and secretory growth factors. The complex interactions of aberrantly expressed cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling enzymes promote CRC pathogenesis and evoke systemic responses that affect disease outcomes. Mounting evidence suggests that these cytokines and chemokines play a role in the progression of CRC through immunosuppression and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, which is partly achieved by the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. These cells impart features such as cancer stem cell-like properties, drug resistance, invasion, and formation of the premetastatic niche in distant organs, promoting metastasis and aggressive CRC growth. A deeper understanding of the cytokine- and chemokine-mediated signaling networks that link tumor progression and metastasis will provide insights into the mechanistic details of disease aggressiveness and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for CRC. Here, we summarized the current knowledge of cytokine- and chemokine-mediated crosstalk in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which drives immunosuppression, resistance to therapeutics, and metastasis during CRC progression. We also outlined the potential of this crosstalk as a novel therapeutic target for CRC. The major cytokine/chemokine pathways involved in cancer immunotherapy are also discussed in this review.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF FAMILY FUNCTIONING AND PARENTING STYLES IN ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE- A CROSS-SECTIONAL COMPARATIVE STUDY
T2  - Indian Journal of Psychiatry
AB  - Introduction: 
          The role of the family in the context of substance use among adolescents has been documented both as a risk and protective factor. However, Indian studies on parenting and family dynamics in adolescent substance use are limited. This is despite the difference between Western and Indian family systems, that emphasise collectivism and interdependence with limited individualism and autonomy. Our study aimed to assess family functioning and parenting practices in adolescents who used substances and to compare them with families of healthy adolescents.
          Methodology: 
          This study employed a cross-sectional, comparative design. Forty adolescent-parent dyads were selected from adolescents registered for substance use treatment and compared with 40 healthy adolescent-parent dyads of matching age and socio-economic status
          Both adolescents and parents were screened for symptoms of psychiatric illnesses and detailed assessment was done by applying the following instruments: Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis (ADAD), Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ), Family Assessment Device (FAD) and Parenting Style 4 factor questionnaire.
          Results: 
          Both groups had mostly nuclear families of upper-lower socio-economic status. Adolescents who used substances perceived a significantly poor functioning in their families in terms of problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, behavioral control and general functioning along with lower parental involvement, lesser positive parenting, poorer monitoring and greater inconsistency in discipline. Significantly greater number of parents of healthy adolescents were authoritative as compared to substance users, who were more permissive and neglectful. Substance use severity had a significant positive correlation with dysfunction in role-setting, affective involvement and general family functioning and negative correlation with positive parenting.
          Conclusion: 
          Our findings indicate that several domains of parenting and family functioning bear significant effect on substance use in adolescents, and further in-depth research is required from similar family systems in order to call for inclusivity and trans-cultural applicability for existing family interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex disparity and its determinants in childhood cancer in India remain unexplored, with scarce information available through summary statistics of cancer registries. This study analysed the degree of sex bias in childhood cancer in India and its clinical and demographical associations.
METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we collected individual data of children (aged 0-19 years) with cancer extracted from the hospital-based records of three cancer centres in India between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2019, and two population-based cancer registries (PBCRs; Delhi [between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2014] and Madras Metropolitan Tumour Registry [between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2017]). We extracted data on age, sex, and confirmed diagnosis of malignancy (according to the International Classification of Diseases-10 coding),and excluded participants if they were without a recorded diagnosis, had a benign diagnosis, had missing sex information, resided outside of India, or were a donor for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary outcome was the male-to-female incidence rate ratio (MF-IRR) in the two PBCRs and the male-to-female ratios (MFR) from the hospital-based and the HSCT data. For PBCR data, MF-IRR was estimated by dividing the MFR by the total population at risk. MFR was analysed for patients seeking treatment at the cancer centres and for those undergoing HSCT. Logistic regression analyses were done to explore the association of clinical and demographical variables with sex of the patients seeking treatment and those undergoing HSCT in hospital-based data and multivariable analyses were done to determine independent sociodemographic predictors of sex bias. Annual time trends of MFR and MF-IRR during the 15-year study period were ascertained by time series regression analyses.
FINDINGS: We included 11 375 children from PBCRs in the study. 26 891 children from hospital-based records were screened, and data from 22 893 (85·1%) were included (including 514 who underwent HSCT). Residence details were missing for 257 (1·1%) of 22 893 patients from hospital-based records. The crude MFR of children at diagnosis was in favour of boys: 2·00 (95% CI 1·92-2·09) in the Delhi PBCR and 1·44 (1·32-1·57) in Madras Metropolitan Tumour Registry. The MF-IRRs for cancer diagnosis were also skewed in favour of boys in both PBCRs (Delhi 1·69 [95% CI 1·61-1·76]; Madras Metropolitan Tumour Registry 1·37 [1·26-1·49]). The MFR for children seeking treatment from hospital-based records was 2·06 (95% CI 2·00-2·12) in favour of boys. In subgroup analyses, the proportion of boys seeking treatment was higher in northern India than southern India (p<0·0001); in private centres than in centres providing subsidised treatment (p<0·0001); in patients with haematological malignancies than those with solid malignancies (p<0·0001); in those residing 100 km or further from the hospital than those within 100 km of a hospital (p<0·0001); and those living in rural areas than those living in urban areas (p=0·0006). The MFR of 514 children who underwent HSCT was 2·81 (95% CI 2·32-3·43) in favour of boys. Time trend analysis showed that MFR did not show any significant annual change in either the overall cohort or in any of the individual centres for hospital-based data; however, the analysis did show a declining MF-IRR in the Delhi PBCR from 2005 to 2014 (p=0·031).
INTERPRETATION: The sex ratio for childhood cancer in India has a bias towards boys at the level of diagnosis, which is more pronounced in northern India and in situations demanding greater financial commitment. Addressing societal sex bias and enhancing affordable health care for girls should be pursued simultaneously in India.
FUNDING: None.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In India, a national program for stroke (national programme for the control of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and stroke) and stroke management guidelines exist. Its successful implementation would need an organized system of stroke care in practice. However, many challenges exist including lack of awareness, prehospital notification systems, stroke ready hospitals, infrastructural weaknesses, and rehabilitation. We present here a protocol to investigate the feasibility and fidelity of implementing a uniform stroke care pathway in medical colleges of India.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentric, prospective, multiphase, mixed-method, quasi-experimental implementation study intended to examine the changes in a select set of stroke care-related indicators over time within the sites exposed to the same implementation strategy. We shall conduct process evaluation of the implementation process as well as evaluate the effect of the implementation strategy using the interrupted time series design. During implementation phase, education and training about standard stroke care pathway will be provided to all stakeholders of implementing sites. Patient-level outcomes in the form of modified Rankin Scale score will be collected for all consecutive patients throughout the study. Process evaluation outcomes will be collected and reported in the form of various stroke care indicators. We will report level and trend changes in various indicators during the three study phases.
DISCUSSION: Acute stroke requires timely detection, management, and secondary prevention. Implementation of the uniform stroke care pathway is a unique opportunity to promote the requirements of homogenous stroke care in medical colleges of India.

AB  - Primary surgical management is successful as the sole therapeutic modality in the majority of women with early-stage cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer, but the presence of certain risk factors in the surgico-pathological specimen indicates a poorer prognosis. Adjuvant treatment can improve overall survival in such cases. Important risk factors in cervical cancer include intermediate-risk factors (large tumor size, deep cervical stromal invasion, lymph-vascular space invasion) and high-risk factors (positive or close margins, lymph nodes, or parametrial involvement). In vulvar cancer, positive margins and lymph nodes are the two most important factors for adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy has been the mainstay of adjuvant therapy in these cancers, supplemented by chemotherapy. Recent advances have witnessed the inclusion of newer therapeutic modalities such as immunotherapy. This review addresses the current status of various adjuvant therapeutic modalities for these gynecological cancers.

AB  - India has a high share in the global burden of chronic terminal illnesses. However, there is a lack of a uniform system in providing better end-of-life care (EOLC) for large patients in their terminal stage of life. Institutional policies can be a good alternative as there is no national level policy for EOLC. This article describes the important aspects of the EOLC policy at one of the tertiary care institutes of India. A 15 member institutional committee including representatives from various departments was formed to develop this institutional policy. This policy document is aimed at helping to recognize the potentially non-beneficial or harmful treatments and provide transparency and accountability of the process of limitation of treatment through proper documentation that closely reflects the Indian legal viewpoint on this matter. Four steps are proposed in this direction: (i) recognition of a potentially non-beneficial or harmful treatment by the physicians, (ii) consensus among all the caregivers on a potentially non-beneficial or harmful treatment and initiation of the best supportive care pathway, (iii) initiation of EOLC pathways, and (iv) symptom management and ongoing supportive care till death. The article also focuses on the step-by-step process of formulation of this institutional policy, so that it can work as a blueprint for other institutions of our country to identify the infrastructural needs and resources and to formulate their own policies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: India introduced BBV152/Covaxin and AZD1222/Covishield vaccines in January 2021. We estimated the effectiveness of these vaccines against severe COVID-19 among individuals aged ≥45 years.
METHODS: We did a multi-centric, hospital-based, case-control study between May and July 2021. Cases were severe COVID-19 patients, and controls were COVID-19 negative individuals from 11 hospitals. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated for complete (2 doses ≥ 14 days) and partial (1 dose ≥ 21 days) vaccination; interval between two vaccine doses and vaccination against the Delta variant. We used the random effects logistic regression model to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) after adjusting for relevant known confounders.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1143 cases and 2541 control patients. The VE of complete vaccination was 85% (95% CI: 79-89%) with AZD1222/Covishield and 71% (95% CI: 57-81%) with BBV152/Covaxin. The VE was highest for 6-8 weeks between two doses of AZD1222/Covishield (94%, 95% CI: 86-97%) and BBV152/Covaxin (93%, 95% CI: 34-99%). The VE estimates were similar against the Delta strain and sub-lineages.
CONCLUSION: BBV152/Covaxin and AZD1222/Covishield were effective against severe COVID-19 among the Indian population during the period of dominance of the highly transmissible Delta variant in the second wave of the pandemic. An escalation of two-dose coverage with COVID-19 vaccines is critical to reduce severe COVID-19 and further mitigate the pandemic in the country.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with prominent fibrosis. This retrospective analysis was undertaken to study the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with extra-pancreatic IgG4-RD and their response to treatment at a tertiary care centre located in northern India.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patient data from our centre between January 2017 and January 2021 were reviewed. Probable/definite IgG4-RD cases were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 14 cases were identified with a median age of 39 years (range 19-56 years). There were 10 males and 4 females. All patients presented with slowly progressive soft tissue swellings with pain/discomfort related to local mass effect. The median delay in diagnosis was 9.5 months (range 2-72 months). Cross-sectional imaging showed soft tissue masses in all cases. All contrast-enhanced studies (n = 7) showed enhancement on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-avidity was observed in 8 of 9 (88.9%) cases. Biopsies performed in 12 of these were classified as definite in 8 and possible IgG4-RD in 4 cases. Patients were treated with a median dose of 1 mg/kg/day (range 0.5-1 mg/kg/day) prednisolone. Steroids were successfully tapered in all 12 cases with 41.6% (5 of 12) being off corticosteroids at a median follow-up of 10 months (range 0-18 months). Two patients were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: IgG4-related disease is a chronic illness with a wide spectrum of manifestations, in which the diagnosis is often delayed, but it shows an excellent response to treatment. Efforts must be made to increase awareness among physicians about this disease to institute appropriate treatment as early as possible.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leucocyte telomere length (LTL) is linked to accelerate aging and premature mortality. In this research, we aimed to explore the relations between biochemical and anthropometry markers and LTL in Asian Indian women with abnormal fasting glycemia (impaired fasting glucose).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 797 pre-diabetic women (obese, 492; non-obese, 305) were recruited. Demographic and clinical profiles, anthropometry, and fasting blood glucose were evaluated. LTL was quantified by a quantitative PCR. LTL was expressed as the relative telomere length or telomere repeat:single copy gene (T:S) ratio. The subjects were separated into quartiles according to the LTL.
RESULTS: The average LTL was significantly decreased with increasing age. The average LTL was significantly shorter in obese women with abnormal fasting glycemia (p<0.05). R-squared (R2) statistic for multivariable linear model after adjusted for age, family income, education and hypertension showed that LTL was inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, waist-hip and waist-to-height ratio, truncal skinfolds (subscapular, and subscapular/triceps ratio, central and total skinfolds), fat mass (kg) and % body fat. The relationship between obesity measures and LTL (using the LTL quartile 1 as reference) identified central skinfolds (R2=0.92, p<0.0001), Σ4SF (R2=0.90, p<0.0001), BMI (R2=0.93, p<0.0001) and % body fat (R2=0.91, p<0.0001) as independent predictors of LTL.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides age, obesity and subcutaneous adiposity (predominantly truncal) are major contributors to telomere shortening in Asian Indian women with abnormal fasting glycemia (impaired fasting glucose).

AB  - Introduction: Three-dimensional (3D), high-definition (HD), and ultra-high-definition (4K HD) are recent additions over regular HD technology for laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning pattern of these systems on standardized phantom tasks. Methodology: Forty-five stereo-enabled resident doctors were randomly assigned into three groups. They performed three validated tasks, precision touch on flat surface, precision touch on uneven surface, surgical knot on rubber tube using either two-dimensional (2D) HD, 3D HD, or 4K HD Endovision systems. Each task was repeated 20 times. Data from four consecutive repetitions were pooled to make five blocks. Split group analysis by comparing the consecutive blocks in execution time and errors were made to see the learning pattern. A significant difference was accepted as continuous learning while no significant difference was accepted as learning stabilization. Result: Operating time was stabilized in two tasks after third block in 2D HD, one task after fourth block in 4K HD. There was continuous learning in all tasks with 3D HD. The 3D HD group was significantly faster than 2D HD and 4K HD in most of the tasks on fifth block. The error scores were similar between the consecutive blocks in 4K HD. It was stabilized after second block in 2D HD group and third block on 3D HD. Conclusion: The 3D HD Endovision system has more potential of faster execution of a task, but need more practice to reach similar safety profile. The 4K HD reached the safety plateau with minimal repetitions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Age adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (a-CCI) is an established scoring system to predict long-term mortality. However, its role in predicting 30-day post-operative outcome in general surgery patients is not well elucidated.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. Consecutive patients operated under general anaesthesia between January 2019 and December 2020 were enrolled. Their a-CCI was calculated and stratified as Grade 0 comorbidities (a-CCI score = 0), Grade A comorbidities (a-CCI score = 1 and 2) and Grade B comorbidities (a-CCI score ≥ 3). Post-operative complications were graded according to Clavien Dindo (CD) grading system and classified as minor complications (CD Grades I and II), major complications (CD Grades III-IV) and mortality (CD Grade V). Binary logistic regression and multi-nominal logistic regression analysis were done and relative risk ratios were calculated.
RESULT: A total of 925 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 42.75 (14-85 ± 10) years. 31% of our patients had complications within 30 days of surgery which included mortality in 2.7%. Compared with patients with Grade 0 comorbidities, the odds of getting complications is 1.2 times more in patients with Grade A comorbidities and 1.84 times more in patients with Grade B comorbidities (P = 0.205, 0.001 respectively). In comparison to patients with Grade 0 co-morbidities, risk of mortality is 3 and 17.86 times more in patients with Grade A and Grade B comorbidities (P = 0.121 and < 0.001 respectively).
CONCLUSION: a-CCI has clinical relevance in general surgical patients and can predict early post-operative outcome. It should be a part of our armamentarium for pre-operative assessment of surgical patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Primary objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the potential of a range of qualitative and quantitative multiparametric features assessed on T2, post-contrast T1, DWI, DCE-MRI, and susceptibility-weighted-imaging (SWI) in differentiating evenly sampled cohort of primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma (PCNSL) vs glioblastoma (GB) with pathological validation.
METHODS: The study included MRI-data of histopathologically confirmed ninety-five GB and PCNSL patients scanned at 3.0 T MRI. A total of six qualitative features (three from T2 and post-contrast T1, three from SWI: thin-linear-uninterrupted-intra-tumoral-vasculature, broken-intra-tumoral-microvasculature, hemorrhage) were analyzed by three independent radiologists. Ten quantitative features from DWI and DCE-MRI were computed using in-house-developed algorithms. For qualitative features, Cohen's Kappa-interrater-variability-analysis was performed. Z-test and independent t-tests were performed to find significant qualitative and quantitative features respectively. Logistic-regression (LR) classifiers were implemented for evaluating performance of individual and various combinations of features in differentiating PCNSL vs GB. Performance evaluation was done via ROC-analysis. Pathological validation was performed to verify disintegration of vessel walls in GB and rim of viable neoplastic lymphoid cells with angiocentric-pattern in PCNSL.
RESULTS: Three qualitative SWI features and four quantitative DCE-MRI features (rCBVcorr, Kep, Ve, and necrosis-volume-percentage) were significantly different (p < 0.05) between PCNSL and GB. Best diagnostic performance was observed with LR classifier using SWI features (AUC-0.99). The inclusion of quantitative features with SWI feature did not improve the differentiation accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of three qualitative SWI features using LR provided the highest accuracy in differentiating PCNSL and GB. Thin-linear-uninterrupted-intra-tumoral-vasculature in PCNSL and broken-intra-tumoral-microvasculature with hemorrhage in GB are the major contributors to the differentiation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the study is to evaluate 99mTc-labeled ethambutol (99mTc-EMB) as a potential diagnostic agent in lymph node tuberculosis (LNTB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective pilot study was done at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. We included adult consenting patients who were diagnosed with LNTB and were either treatment naïve or had just started treatment. Patients were injected with 10-15 mCi of 99mTc-EMB. Whole-body anteroposterior planar imaging was done from 15 min after injection at serial intervals till 4-6 h along with one single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) imaging with the help of a dual-head SPECT-CT gamma camera. The uptake of 99mTc-EMB was analyzed and corroborated with clinicoradiological findings.
RESULTS: Between January 2019 and November 2020, we recruited 23 patients who underwent 99mTc-EMB, and 19 scans were interpretable and considered for analysis. Cervical lymphadenopathy was the most common presentation (13, 68.42%), followed by mediastinal (9, 47.36%) and abdominal (4, 21.05%) nodes. Other involvement included pulmonary (8, 42.1%), gastrointestinal (3, 15.78%), and chest wall abscess and bone marrow deposits in 1 patient each. A positive scan was noted in 7 (53.84%) patients with cervical lymphadenopathy, whereas uptake in abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes was seen in 1 (25%) and 2 (22.22%) cases, respectively. Uptake in pulmonary lesions was noted in 3 (37.5%), but uptake in hepatic and splenic lesions was not seen.
CONCLUSION: 99mTc-EMB scan can demonstrate drug penetrance in vivo in some patients with LNTB and should be explored further with a larger sample size.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this article is to explain the detailed methodology to record Motor evoked potential (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) in adult albino Wistar rat, male (200–250 g) which has not been defined previously. Materials and Methods: We have standardised recording of both MEP and SSEP in these rats under anaesthesia on ADI digital polyrite system. Results: Evoked potentials have been widely studied in spinal cord injured patients to estimate the degree of injury and to establish a predictive measure of functional recovery. MEPs and SSEPs, arising from the motor cortex or peripheral nerve and generated either by direct electrical stimulation or by transcranial magnetic stimulation, have been advocated as a reliable indicator of descending and ascending pathway integrity. In the rat brain, there is a physical overlap between the motor and somatosensory cortex. Hence, our objective was to identify the exact area for stimulation in the cortex where we could record maximum response with the application of minimum electrical stimulation. Conclusion: The recording of MEP and SSEP together provides a powerful neurological technique to monitor the tracts of the spinal cord.

AB  - Timely recognition of autism in children is integral to improve developmental outcomes. This study used mixed-methods (84 case-registers and 20 in-depth interviews with caregivers of children with a diagnosis of autism) to explore the extent to which the nature of parental concerns and prior knowledge of developmental disorders impact the time between symptom recognition and autism diagnosis, and the contextual family, societal and health-system related factors that impede the autism help-seeking pathway. Lack of awareness of age-appropriate child developmental milestones, apparent amongst the community and health professionals, contributed to a 1.5-year delay between parental concerns and autism diagnosis. Recommendations to shorten this help-seeking pathway include harnessing the potential of non-specialist workers to increase awareness and enable developmental monitoring of young children through scalable tools.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serratus anterior plane (SAP) blocks can be given either superficial or deep to the serratus anterior muscle to block the branches of intercostal nerves providing analgesia to the anterolateral chest wall. This prospective randomised comparative study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of superficial and deep SAP block in breast surgeries.
METHODS: Forty female patients scheduled to undergo elective modified radical mastectomy under general anaesthesia (GA) were randomly assigned to receive ultrasound guided SAP block with 30 ml 0.375% ropivacaine either superficial (group S, n = 20) or deep (group D, n = 20) to the serratus anterior muscle, before the induction of GA. The primary outcome was post operative fentanyl requirement over 24 hours and secondary outcomes were comparison of numerical rating scale (NRS) scores for pain, sensory block mapping, time to perform the block, number of needle attempts, etc.
RESULTS: The post operative 24-hour fentanyl requirement was comparable between group S and D (318.75 ± 80.65 versus 272.5 ± 80.25 μg, P = 0.07). NRS pain scores were comparable between the groups. Sensory block mapping done at various levels showed T3-T7 block in most of the patients with no difference between the groups. Block performance time (6.05 ± 3.27 versus 8.35 ± 3.26 minutes, P = 0.034) and number of needle attempts was significantly lesser in group D.
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in analgesic efficacy when SAP block was given superficial or deep to serratus anterior muscle for modified radical mastectomies. However, deep SAP block required less time and number of attempts to perform than superficial technique.

TI  - Ultrasound-Guided Multiple Injection Costotransverse Block in a Patient with Postradiation Therapy Recurrent Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans: A Technical Glitch
AU  - Bhoi, Debesh
AU  - Parida, Raunak
T2  - Indian Journal of Pain
AB  - Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a locally aggressive soft-tissue tumor with a high recurrence rate, often requiring multiple surgeries with multiple sessions of radiotherapy that alters the anatomy and makes regional anesthesia challenging in these patients. The multiple injection costotransverse block (MICB) is a type of “paravertebral by proxy” block in which the drug is injected within the thoracic intertransverse tissue complex with spread to the paravertebral space without any epidural spread. Unlike the traditional approach to paravertebral block, which involves piercing the superior costotransverse ligament, the MICB has a shallower needle trajectory making needle visualization easier and the more superficial needle tip location reduces the chances of a pleural puncture and subcostal vessel injury. We present the case of a 51-year-old male with recurrent DFSP in the anterior axillary fold who was posted for tumor debulking. As the sonoanatomy was altered due to multiple previous surgeries and radiotherapy, we chose to perform an ultrasound-guided MICB.

AB  - Background A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to determine the preanesthetic evaluation (PAE) practices among the members of the Indian Society of Neuroanesthesiology and Critical Care (ISNACC). The survey aimed to assess the current clinical practice of PAE and optimization of neurosurgical patients in India.

  Methods An online questionnaire was designed by the working group of ISNACC and circulated among its active members. Response to individual questions was considered significant if 50% or more respondents concurred. The survey questions to which less than 50% of respondents concurred were identified as inconclusive results.

  Results Out of 438 active ISNACC members, 218 responded. Responses were obtained from various parts of the country. The majority of participants were practicing neuroanesthesiology. Questions asked were regarding clinical assessment, preoperative optimization, prognostication, and airway management in neurosurgery. More than 50% of practitioners acceded to most of the questions; however, the percentage of responses varied across different questions (50–100%). The questions related to preoperative duplex scanning in chronically immobilized patients, preoperative cognitive testing, and risk stratification during neurosurgical procedures received an inconclusive response ( Conclusion The survey highlights the variable PAE practices perused by ISNACC members across the country. A guideline for uniform PAE practices may help to enhance research and improve perioperative care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increasing occurrence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria resulted in colistin being the last agent for treatment. Apart from plasmid-mediated mcr genes, mutations involving several genes like mgrB, phoP/phoQ, pmrA, pmrB, pmrC, and crrABC genes, are leading causes of colistin resistance. Four colistin susceptibility testing methods were compared against broth microdilution (BMD) and determined the presence of the mcr1-5 gene.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 100 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales isolates were tested for colistin susceptibility by commercial broth microdilution (cBMD), E-test, VITEK-2, and rapid polymyxin NP assay (RPNP) and compared with BMD. The presence of the mcr1-5 gene was determined by modified RPNP and PCR. Two non-mcr colistin-resistant XDR isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform.
RESULTS: Among 100 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales isolates, 15% were resistant to colistin. Essential agreement, categorical agreement, major error, and very major error for cBMD/E-test/VITEK-2/RPNP were 96%/73%/82%/NA; 99%/86%/88%/91%, 1.2%/9.4%/11.8%/8.2% and 0%/40%/13.3%/13.3%, respectively. Only one Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate harbored the mcr-1 gene, observed by both methods. Whole-genome sequencing of two non-mcr XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae showed multiple mutations in 10 genes responsible for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of cBMD was excellent, whereas the E-test was unacceptable. VITEK-2 and RPNP performed better but remained unreliable due to high error rates. Multiple mutations in the target proteins involving lipopolysaccharide formation, modification, and regulation were seen, resulting in colistin resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial infections causing high morbidity and mortality. The alarming rise of multidrug-resistant uropathogens worldwide forced the clinician to rethink the old drugs like Fosfomycin for its therapeutic management. Our objective was to compare agar dilution, disc diffusion and E-test method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Fosfomycin against different drug-resistant uropathogens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive 181 uropathogens were tested for Fosfomycin susceptibility using agar dilution, disc diffusion and E-test. Results were interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. Whole genome sequencing analysis was done on the 4 XDR/PDR Fosfomycin resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates.
RESULTS: Escherichia coli was found as the most common (62.4%) uropathogen followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21%). Considering agar dilution as the gold standard, 6.1% of isolates were resistant to Fosfomycin. Following CLSI breakpoints, the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, other Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 92.9%, 92.1%, 100%, 100%; whereas using EUCAST breakpoints the susceptibility rates were 85.7%, 86.9%, 92.9%, and 100%, respectively. The essential agreement, categorical agreement, major error, and very major error for E-test/disc diffusion for all the organisms were 91.2%/Not Applicable, 95%/93.9%, 1.8%/4.7%, 9.1%/9.1%, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing showed mutation UhpT gene as well as the presence of plasmid-mediated fosA5 or fosA6 genes conferring Fosfomycin resistance.
CONCLUSION: This result supports very low resistance of Enterobacterales against Fosfomycin; hence should be considered a valuable option to treat multidrug-resistant uropathogens. Disc diffusion was observed to be a convenient method for Fosfomycin susceptibility testing compared to agar dilution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chiari 1 malformation has crowding at craniovertebral junction (CVJ), treated by Foramen magnum decompression (FMD) but is associated with high failure rates, which is explained by recently introduced concept of central instability. So, we propose a new concept of relieving this crowding without affecting stability.
OBJECTIVE: To derive a threshold for coring out of internal surface of C1 posterior arch instead of complete laminectomy accompanying FMD.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: We prospectively included nine patients with a mean age of 25.33 ± 7.97 years, diagnosed with ACM-1 without AAD, who were operated with FMD and lax duraplasty and C1 laminectomy. The preoperative dural diameter and area covered under the dura at the level of C1 were measured and compared with the postoperative state. Results were analyzed to derive a cut-off threshold which could be drilled from the inner aspect of C1 arch.
RESULTS: The postoperative AP diameter of the dura increased statistically significantly from pre-op; however, the AP extension was less than the preoperative diameter with posterior arch included. Likewise, the area spanned by the dura increased statistically significantly from pre-op but was less than the cumulative area of dura with C1 arch included in pre-op. Analyzing all, a mean cut-off of 50.58% was achieved.
CONCLUSION: The authors suggest FMD with partial coring (~50%) of the inner part of arch of C1, instead of full-thickness laminectomy with a wider length of coring as the target, and this will serve the purpose intended, without increasing mobility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma (RB) is initiated by mutation in both alleles of RB1 gene. However, few cases may occur even in the absence of RB1 mutation suggesting the role of genes other than RB1.
METHODOLOGY: The current study was planned to utilize targeted exome sequencing in Indian RB patients affected with unilateral non-familial RB. 75 unilateral RB patients below 5 years of age were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and tumor tissue. From peripheral blood DNA, all coding and exon/intron regions were amplified using PCR and direct sequencing. Cases which did not harbor pathogenic variants in peripheral blood DNA were further screened for mutations in their tumor tissue DNA using targeted exome sequencing. Three pathogenicity prediction tools (Mutation Taster, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2) were used to determine the pathogenicity of non-synonymous variations. An in-house bioinformatics pipeline was devised for the mutation screening by targeted exome sequencing. Protein modeling studies were also done to predict the effect of the mutations on the protein structure and function.
RESULTS: Using the mentioned approach, we found two novel variants (g.69673_69674insT and g.48373314C>A) in RB1 gene in peripheral blood DNA. We also found novel variants in eight genes (RB1, ACAD11, GPR151, KCNA1, OTOR, SOX30, ARL11, and MYCT1) that may be associated with RB pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: The present study expands our current knowledge regarding the genomic landscape of RB and also highlights the importance of NGS technologies to detect genes and novel variants that may play an important role in cancer initiation, progression, and prognosis.

AB  - Plasmodium vivax, one of the major species associated with human malaria, continues to be a major public health problem in many parts of the world. Numerous studies related to vivax malaria have described quantitative haematological findings (level of haemoglobin, thrombocytopaenia, haematocrit values), but diverse morphological changes of parasite forms within infected red blood cells (iRBCs) have been mentioned only in few studies. Here we report a case of a 13-year-old boy who presented with fever, significant low platelet counts and hypovolaemia that created a diagnostic dilemma. Detection of microgametocytes by microscopic examinations, further confirmed by multiplex nested PCR assays and response to anti-malarials, helped to make the diagnosis. We present an atypical case of vivax malaria with a review of morpho-variations of iRBCs and have summarized the characteristics that aid in creating increased awareness among laboratory health professionals and public health workers.

AB  - PURPOSE: Bile duct injuries (BDIs) are the potential grievous complications of cholecystectomy that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of BDI management depend on multiple factors such as the type and extent of injury, timing of repair, and surgical expertise. The present retrospective study was conducted to analyse the risk factors associated with the BDI repair outcomes.
METHODS: The data of patients having primary or recurrent bile duct stricture following BDI from 1985 to 2018 were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 268 patients underwent hepaticojejunostomy (HJ). Of the total, 218 patients had primary bile duct stricture, and 50 patients had HJ stricture. The most commonly performed procedure for primary BDI was Roux-en-Y HJ (RYHJ), followed by right hepatectomy, right posterior sectionectomy, and left hepatectomy. All patients with strictured HJ underwent RYHJ, except one who underwent a right hepatectomy. Outcome assessment using the McDonald grading system showed that 62%, 27%, 5%, and 6% of patients with primary bile duct stricture had grade A, grade B, grade C, and grade D complications, respectively, with a mortality rate of 3.21%, whereas 46%, 34%, and 18% patients with strictured HJ had grade A, grade B, and grade C complications, respectively, with a mortality rate of 2%. High-up biliary strictures, early repair, and blood loss > 350 mL are the surrogate markers for failure of repair.
CONCLUSION: Management of BDI needs a multidisciplinary approach. The outcomes of both primary biliary stricture and strictured HJ can be improved with management of patients in a tertiary care centre. However, attempts to repair within 2 weeks of injury, Strasberg E4 and E5, and blood loss of > 350 mL may have an adverse effect on the outcome of HJ.

T2  - Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Viral infections are among the major causes of acute liver failure (ALF) worldwide. While the role of agents such as hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses in precipitating ALF are well known, improvements in serological assays have led to the detection of viral agents such as Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus etc. as atypical causes of ALF. Despite the plethora of literature available on viral hepatitis and ALF, there is very limited large-scale epidemiologic data on the prevalence, risk factors of progression and outcomes in ALF of viral causes. This is important as viral infections remain the leading cause of ALF in the East and in developing countries, while the impact of viral ALF in the West has largely been ameliorated by effective vaccination and sanitization programs. This review focuses specifically on the available prognostic scores that aid in the management of ALF of viral etiologies while also briefly reviewing the current literature on newer viral agents known to cause ALF, risk factors of progression, outcomes and how management algorithms can be developed by incorporation of prognostic scoring systems for referral and transplant listing.

AB  - Touraine-Solente-Gole syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant multisystem disorder arising from dysregulated prostaglandin synthesis due to underlying genetic defects. Early symptoms are related to skin and soft tissue involvement (coarse facial features, widening of wrists, etc) and may thus be overlooked unless a careful physical examination is carried out. Secondary causes of pachydermoperiosteitis must always be looked for in such patients. During evaluation, a systemic review of all organ systems should be carried out to identify asymptomatic or subclinical involvement of organ systems and identify means to avoid disease progression. Treatment options are limited to steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the absence of definitive guidelines, clinical decisions are largely case based, with no definite duration of drug therapy or screening of potential malignancies outlined in current literature. Mental health and social rehabilitation of these patients due to their disfiguring deformities are an unmet need.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is associated with infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes in affected females. Scant literature is available on the effect of an endovascular intervention on fertility and the outcome of future pregnancies in these patients.
AIMS: To assess the infertility rates, maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnancy and effect of endovascular intervention in women with BCS.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, 121 female patients with BCS attending our liver clinic from 2017 to 2020 were included. Demographic details, intervention details, pregnancies - pre- and post-intervention - and fetal outcomes were noted.
RESULTS: BCS was diagnosed pre-conception in 58 women (group 1; median age: 22 years), during/after pregnancy, but before completion of family in 39 (group 2; median age: 27 years), and after completion of family in 24 (group 3; median age: 34 years). Median Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores were 7 and 12, respectively. The primary infertility rate was 19.8% (24/121). In group 1, 15 women with primary infertility underwent endovascular intervention with 5/15 (33%) women conceiving subsequently, resulting in four live births and seven abortions. In group 2, five women developed BCS during pregnancy and 11 postpartum; 11/39 had a history of one or more abortions. Overall, 8/34 (23.5%) who underwent endovascular intervention had 4/8 (50%) successful pregnancies. In group 3, no patient had any major complications during past pregnancies. The mode of delivery was vaginal in 88% of cases. No congenital anomaly/major bleeding episodes/decompensation/maternal mortality occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Infertility is common in patients with BCS. Pregnancy is well-tolerated in those with compensated liver disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet transfusion in acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is recommended by few guidelines and is common in routine clinical practice, even though the effect of thrombocytopenia and platelet transfusion on the outcomes of AVB is unclear.
AIM: To determine how platelet counts, platelets transfusions, and fresh frozen plasma transfusions affect the outcomes of AVB in cirrhosis patients in terms of bleeding control, rebleeding, and mortality.
METHODS: Prospectively maintained database was used to analyze the outcomes of cirrhosis patients who presented with AVB. The outcomes were assessed as the risk of rebleeding at days 5 and 42, and risk of death at day 42, considering the platelet counts and platelet transfusion. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare the outcomes in those who received platelet transfusion. Statistical comparisons were done using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests and Cox-proportional hazard model for rebleeding and for 42-d mortality.
RESULTS: The study included 913 patients, with 83.5% men, median age 45 years, and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score 14.7. Platelet count < 20 × 109/L, 20-50 × 109/L, and > 50 × 109/L were found in 23 (2.5%), 168 (18.4%), and 722 (79.1%) patients, respectively. Rebleeding rates were similar between the three platelet groups on days 5 and 42 (13%, 6.5%, and 4.7%, respectively, on days 5, P = 0.150; and 21.7%, 17.3%, and 14.4%, respectively, on days 42, P = 0.433). At day 42, the mortality rates for the three platelet groups were also similar (13.0%, 23.2%, and 17.2%, respectively, P = 0.153). On PSM analysis patients receiving platelets transfusions (n = 89) had significantly higher rebleeding rates on day 5 (14.6% vs 4.5%; P = 0.039) and day 42 (32.6% vs 15.7%; P = 0.014), compared to those who didn't. The mortality rates were also higher among patients receiving platelets (25.8% vs 23.6%; P = 0.862), although the difference was not significant. On multivariate analysis, platelet transfusion and not platelet count, was independently associated with 42-d rebleeding. Hepatic encephalopathy was independently associated with 42-d mortality.
CONCLUSION: Thrombocytopenia had no effect on rebleeding rates or mortality in cirrhosis patients with AVB; however, platelet transfusion increased rebleeding on days 5 and 42, with a higher but non-significant effect on mortality.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected different countries in a differential manner. The host susceptibility and host factors are important parameters for this variability. This study aimed to assess the effect of tuberculosis (TB) endemicity and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) coverage on COVID-19. Available data regarding TB incidence, BCG coverage (as per the World Health Organization), and COVID-19 incidence of 168 countries as of 19th September 2021was collected. Countries were divided into four cohorts based upon annual TB incidence and BCG coverage and COVID-19 incidence and case fatality rates were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Countries with low TB incidence and low BCG coverage had the highest COVID-19 incidence per lac population. However, no significant difference was seen in COVID-19 cases fatality rate. Higher TB incidence and BCG coverage were associated with lesser incidence of COVID-19. This result paves the way for research into pathogenesis and host immune response in COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypospadias is among the common congenital anomalies in boys. Snodgrass urethroplasty is one of the most popular techniques for correcting distal and mid hypospadias. Although there is consensus among pediatric surgeons on using absorbable sutures for urethroplasty, there are no established guidelines about the suturing techniques (interrupted suturing [IS] or continuous suturing [CS]) for neourethra creation in Snodgrass urethroplasty. This analysis aims to compare the reported outcomes of both the urethroplasty suturing techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted as per the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses guidelines. A systematic, detailed search was carried out by the authors in the electronic databases - MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Clinical Trial Registry. Studies were selected and compared based on primary outcomes - development of urethrocutaneous fistula (UCF), meatal stenosis, and secondary outcomes - wound infection, urethral stricture, and operative time. Statistical analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model, pooled risk ratio, and I2 heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Five randomized studies with a total of 521 patients met our inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis for total complications, UCF, meatal stenosis, and wound infection showed no significant difference between the CS and IS groups. Subgroup analysis of patients with the use of polyglactin sutures showed a decrease in total complications and UCF in the IS group.
CONCLUSION: There is no difference in total complication rates among the CS and the IS group with the use of absorbable sutures in Snodgrass urethroplasty; however, there is a decrease in the incidence of total complications and UCF in the IS group when polyglactin was preferred over polydioxanone suture for urethroplasty.

TI  - Recurrent lumbar disk herniation – Fusion is the answer
AU  - Borkar, Sachin A.
AU  - Bansal, Tungish
T2  - Journal of Spinal Surgery
AB  - Recurrent lumbar disk herniations (rLDHs) are becoming a common occurrence in present times. However, the optimal surgical strategy for their management is a not clear with discectomy alone and discectomy followed by fusion emerging as the main surgical options. In this editorial debate, we discuss why discectomy and fusion is better option for the management of such cases. The complication rates, treatment satisfaction rates, visual analog scale (VAS) leg pain scores, and rates of adjacent segment disease (ASD) requiring surgery are similar in both the groups. However, the back pain score and reoperation rates are better in fusion surgeries. Moreover, the problems needing reoperations (hardware problems and ASD) in fusion group are easier to treat. Fusion surgery is already indicated in rLDH cases with deformity, instability, and significant axial low back pain. We believe it should be considered in all cases due to negligible risk of recurrence, addressing the iatrogenic spinal instability caused due to extensive bony work, ease of surgery due to more working space, and better restoration of disk height and sagittal balance.

TI  - Yoga: A Natural Solution to Decrease Disease Burden in Children of MTHFR Deficient Parents
AU  - Borthakur, D.

T2  - La Clinica Terapeutica
AB  - INTRODUCTION: MTHFR being a key regulatory enzyme of 1-carbon metabolism pathway serves critical function of generation of SAM, replenishment of glutathione and nucleotide synthesis and finally methylation of the bio molecules. MTHFR gene mutation is a rare au-tosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism and presents with severe hyperhomocysteinemia. MTHFR polymorphisms on the other hand are commonly encountered of which two 677 C>T and 1298 A>C have been most widely studied and reported to increase the vulnerability to neural tube defects, congenital heart disease, various neuropsychiatric disorders like autism spectrum diseases and attention deficit hyperactiv-ity disease, cleft lip/ palate, acute leukaemia, cardiovascular diseases, occlusive vascular disease in children.
METHODS: We conducted this prospective clinical trial to examine whether yoga practice can up regulate MTHFR gene expression. Considering the prevalence of MTHFR polymorphism, varied spectrum of its implications in disease causation including male infertility, we conducted the trial involving 30 infertile men who underwent 3 weeks of supervised YBLI. Pre and post intervention assessment of the blood and semen sample was done to see the effects.
RESULTS: We have found more than fivefold up-regulation in the expression of MTHFR gene with significant reduction of seminal free radical levels after 3 weeks of yoga practice. Interestingly we noticed significantly higher MTHFR polymorphic variants in infertile male patients compared to healthy fertile controls.
CONCLUSION: MTHFR polymorphisms are also independently associated with many paediatric diseases. Diagnosing MTHFR deficiency in children is a challenging job and requires high index of suspicion and continuous vigilance. Yoga based lifestyle may be adopted both by parents planning conception and also by adolescent children who are sufferers of this condition to halt the consequences of mild to moderate MTHFR deficiency.

AB  - This report highlights a coronary artery anomaly (CAA) involving three right coronary arteries (RCAs) arising from the anterior aortic sinus and a single left coronary artery (LCA) from the left posterior aortic sinus. Furthermore, each of the three RCAs originated with separate ostia. The 1st RCA was the right conus artery which originated through the anterior ostium. The 2nd RCA from the middle ostium mimicked a typical RCA. The 3rd RCA that originated from the posterior ostium had an initial retro-aortic course and then ran between the ascending aorta and atria. It eventually terminated as the circumflex artery after reaching the left end of the posterior coronary sulcus. The LCA was normal anatomically except that it did not give the circumflex branch. The knowledge of this type of unusual branching pattern of the coronary artery may be useful to clinicians.

TI  - Novel Osteo Refurbishment Method and Choice of Colouring Materials for Anatomy Specimens
AU  - Borthakur, Dibakar

T2  - Medeniyet Medical Journal
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The introduction of competency-based medical education curriculum and a shifted focus towards self-directed learning (SDL) in medical schools across the world has necessitated a reduction of didactic teaching hours. Museum specimens are an indispensable tool in anatomy teaching and can play a pivotal role in fostering and reinforcing SDL. Coloring of specimens makes it attractive and facilitates understanding anatomy. The aims of this study were: (1) weigh up the two commonly used coloring materials in anatomy viz. acrylic paint and nail polish; and (2) to assess the perception of anatomy students towards a Novel Osteo Refurbishment Method (NORM) for restoration of partially damaged osteology specimens.
METHODS: Undergraduate and postgraduate students of anatomy were recruited in the study. Participants responded to a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. Obtained data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel version 2019. For a comparison of the two coloring agents Mann-Whitney U test was applied to the responses toward the Likert scale-based questionnaire. P-value <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Out of 318 study participants, 63.7% and 36.3% of the respondents were male and female, respectively. 90.5 % were new entrants to university and the remainder 9.5% had a prior university degree. Students found the acrylic paint to be a better coloring agent and they also opined that NORM generated refurbished osteology specimens could serve as a useful self-learning tool. Acrylic paint was found to be more suitable as compared to nail polish with significant p-value in most of the parameters tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Acrylic colour holds a good place in coloring both specimens and models in anatomy. Nail polish can be an alternative but with some noted disadvantages. The initial experience with NORM yielded encouraging results with potential practical utility.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunoexpression status determines the response to immunotherapy in many cancers. Limited data exist on PD-L1 status in aggressive thyroid tumors. We investigated PD-L1 expression across thyroid cancers and correlated it with their molecular profile.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-five cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) were assessed for PD-L1 expression (clone SP263, VENTANA). The differentiated cases encompassed the aggressive hobnail and tall cell subtypes of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) besides classical PTC and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Ten nodular goiters (NG) were also evaluated. Tumor proportion score (TPS) and H-score were calculated. BRAFV600E and H-/K-/N-RAS were assessed using allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to investigate the associations between the categorical variables and compare PD-L1 scores with the mutation status.
RESULTS: Most PTC (87%) and ATC (73%) cases were PD-L1 positive (TPS ≥1%), with significantly higher positivity rates than NG (20%). TPS >50% was seen in 60% ATC and 7% PTC cases. The median TPS and H-score of ATC were 56 (0-96.6) and 168 (0-275), respectively, and of PTC were 9.6 (4-16.8) and 17.8 (6.6-38.6), respectively. The scores were similar across the PTC subtypes. Only one case each of FTC and PDTC was PD-L1 positive. PD-L1 expression correlated significantly with BRAFV600E, but not with RAS mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: ATC showed intense and diffuse PD-L1 staining. Although most PTCs were PD-L1 positive, the expression was weaker and patchy, irrespective of the histological subtype. Results of this pilot study indicate that ATC is most likely to respond to immunotherapy. PTC, FTC, and PDTC may be less amenable to immunotherapy. PD-L1 expression correlated significantly with BRAFV600E, allowing for combined targeted therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the aged population. Transcranial magnetic field (MF) stimulation has shown to provide temporary motor recovery in neurological disorders.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to understand the cellular and molecular mechanism of low-intensity MF stimulation (17.96 µT; 50Hz; 2 h/day, four weeks) in a rat model of severe PD.
METHODS: A clinically relevant, bilateral striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model of severe PD was employed to test the efficacy of low-intensity MF stimulation in the management of motor symptoms. The mechanism of action of MF was dissected by assessing the microglial activation, tissue ultrastructure, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolomics using microdialysis.
RESULTS: We observed a significant improvement in the postural balance and gait after MF exposure with a significant reduction in the number of activated microglia. There was an improvement in striatal dopaminergic innervation and glutamate levels but it did not reach a level of statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: MF stimulation helped ameliorate the motor deficits and reduced inflammation but was unable to provide a significant change in terms of dopaminergic innervation and metabolic profile in the severe 6-OHDA PD rat model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2021, WHO Member States endorsed a global target of a 40-percentage-point increase in effective refractive error coverage (eREC; with a 6/12 visual acuity threshold) by 2030. This study models global and regional estimates of eREC as a baseline for the WHO initiative.
METHODS: The Vision Loss Expert Group analysed data from 565 448 participants of 169 population-based eye surveys conducted since 2000 to calculate eREC (met need/[met need + undermet need + unmet need]). A binary logistic regression model was used to estimate eREC by Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study super region among adults aged 50 years and older.
FINDINGS: In 2021, distance eREC was 79·1% (95% CI 72·4-85·0) in the high-income super region; 62·1% (54·7-68·8) in north Africa and Middle East; 49·5% (45·0-54·0) in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; 40·0% (31·7-48·2) in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania; 34·5% (29·4-40·0) in Latin America and the Caribbean; 9·0% (6·5-12·0) in south Asia; and 5·7% (3·1-9·0) in sub-Saharan Africa. eREC was higher in men and reduced with increasing age. Global distance eREC increased from 2000 to 2021 by 19·0%. Global near vision eREC for 2021 was 20·5% (95% CI 17·8-24·4).
INTERPRETATION: Over the past 20 years, distance eREC has increased in each super region yet the WHO target will require substantial improvements in quantity and quality of refractive services in particular for near vision impairment.

AB  - The study aimed to assess and compare the serum brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in patients with alcohol dependence, depression and alcohol dependence with comorbid depression. Three groups each of 30 alcohol-dependent, depressive and alcohol-dependent with comorbid depressive patients seeking treatment were included. BDNF levels were estimated, and scales were administered to assess severity of alcohol dependence (using severity of alcohol dependence questionnaire, SADQ) and depressive symptoms (using Hamilton depression rating scale, HDRS). The mean BDNF value in ADS, depression and ADS with comorbid depression group was 16.4 ng/mL, 14.4 ng/mL and 12.29 ng/mL respectively, and the differences were statistically significant. In ADS group and ADS with comorbid depression groups significant negative association existed between BDNF and SADQ scores (r = -0.371, p = .043 and r = -0.0474, p = .008 respectively). There were significant negative association between BDNF and HDRS scores in depression and comorbid ADS and depression group (r = -0.400, p = .029 and r = -0.408, p = .025 respectively). The BDNF level was significantly lower in the ADS with comorbid depression group and was associated with severity of dependence and depression across the groups.

TI  - Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2020
AU  - GBD 2020 Alcohol Collaborators
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: The health risks associated with moderate alcohol consumption continue to be debated. Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, sex, and year.
METHODS: For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose-response relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15-95 years and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol.
FINDINGS: The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by region and age. Among individuals aged 15-39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0-0) and 0·603 (0·400-1·00) standard drinks per day, and the NDE varied between 0·002 (0-0) and 1·75 (0·698-4·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged from 0·114 (0-0·403) to 1·87 (0·500-3·30) standard drinks per day and an NDE that ranged between 0·193 (0-0·900) and 6·94 (3·40-8·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59·1% (54·3-65·4) were aged 15-39 years and 76·9% (73·0-81·3) were male.
INTERPRETATION: There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial global health loss attributable to alcohol.

Using metatranscriptomics, we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant 'classical' signature (n=23) showed upregulation of the unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation, supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) that potentially represents 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS) showed upregulation of cytokines such as IL1 and CCL19, but absence of complement activation. We found that a majority of patients cleared SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus cohnii in 'classical' patients and Pasteurella multocida in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients, which can be identified through complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. These findings can be used to design personalized therapy using in silico identified drug molecules or in mitigating specific secondary infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The middle fossa approach is an effective option for the treatment of small (Koos grade I and II) vestibular schwannomas (VSs) when the goal is hearing preservation. The authors evaluated the rates of hearing preservation and examined the factors associated with improved hearing outcomes after the middle fossa approach for VSs.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study evaluating the clinical outcomes after resection of small VSs using the middle fossa approach, consecutive adult patients (> 18 years) who underwent surgery between January 2000 and December 2021 were included. Clinical and imaging characteristics were analyzed, including baseline hearing status, duration of surgery, anesthetic parameters, and imaging characteristics of the surgically treated tumors.
RESULTS: Among the 131 included patients, 102 had valid and discoverable pre- and postoperative audiology assessments. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 1-180 months). There were 85 patients with serviceable hearing preoperatively, defined as American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) class A or B, of whom 78% retained class A or B hearing at the last follow-up. Binary logistic regression demonstrated that preoperative hearing AAO-HNS class (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.77; p = 0.02), overlap between fundus and cochlea (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.96; p = 0.04), and duration of anesthesia (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of hearing outcomes. Additionally, 75% of patients with high diffusion-weighted imaging signal in the tumor (p = 0.009) and 67% of patients with the tumor originating at the modiolus of the cochlea (p = 0.004) had poor hearing outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The hearing preservation rates after microsurgical resection of small VSs using the middle fossa approach are high, with 78% of patients maintaining AAO-HNS class A or B hearing. Poor hearing status at baseline, longer duration of anesthesia, and large overlap between the fundus of the internal auditory canal and the cochlea were independently associated with unfavorable hearing outcomes. Imaging characteristics can be used to stratify patients' risk of hearing loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The evolving epidemiologic patterns of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the world, in conjunction with advances in therapeutic treatments, may influence hospitalization rates of IBD. We performed a systematic review with temporal analysis of hospitalization rates for IBD across the world in the 21st century.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed Medline and Embase for population-based studies reporting hospitalization rates for IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) in the 21st century. Log-linear models were used to calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) with associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Random-effects meta-analysis pooled country-level AAPCs. Data were stratified by the epidemiologic stage of a region: compounding prevalence (stage 3) in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania vs acceleration of incidence (stage 2) in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America vs emergence (stage 1) in developing countries.
RESULTS: Hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis of IBD were stable in countries in stage 3 (AAPC, -0.13%; 95% CI, -0.72 to 0.97), CD (AAPC, 0.20%; 95% CI, -1.78 to 2.17), and UC (AAPC, 0.02%; 95% CI, -0.91 to 0.94). In contrast, hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis were increasing in countries in stage 2 for IBD (AAPC, 4.44%; 95% CI, 2.75 to 6.14), CD (AAPC, 8.34%; 95% CI, 4.38 to 12.29), and UC (AAPC, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.29 to 6.52). No population-based studies were available for developing regions in stage 1 (emergence).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization rates for IBD are stabilizing in countries in stage 3, whereas newly industrialized countries in stage 2 have rapidly increasing hospitalization rates, contributing to an increasing burden on global health care systems.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the potential therapeutic value of early passive polyclonal immunotherapy using high-titer convalescent plasma (CCP). Human polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin (HIG) has several advantages over CCP. Unlike CCP, HIG can provide standardized and controlled antibody content. It is also subjected to robust pathogen reduction rendering it virally safe and is purified by technologies demonstrated to preserve immunoglobulin neutralization capacity and Fc fragment integrity. This document provides an overview of current practices and guidance for the collection and testing of plasma rich in antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its industrial fractionation for the manufacture of quality-assured and safe HIG. Considerations are also given to the production of HIG preparations in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in young children disproportionately occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The PROUD (Preventing RespiratOry syncytial virUs in unDerdeveloped countries) Taskforce of 24 RSV worldwide experts assessed key needs for RSV prevention in LMICs, including vaccine and newer preventive measures.
METHODS: A global, survey-based study was undertaken in 2021. An online questionnaire was developed following three meetings of the Taskforce panellists wherein factors related to RSV infection, its prevention and management were identified using iterative questioning. Each factor was scored, by non-panellists interested in RSV, on a scale of zero (very-low-relevance) to 100 (very-high-relevance) within two scenarios: (1) Current and (2) Future expectations for RSV management.
RESULTS: Ninety questionnaires were completed: 70 by respondents (71.4% physicians; 27.1% researchers/scientists) from 16 LMICs and 20 from nine high-income (HI) countries (90.0% physicians; 5.0% researchers/scientists), as a reference group. Within LMICs, RSV awareness was perceived to be low, and management was not prioritised. Of the 100 factors scored, those related to improved diagnosis particularly access to affordable point-of-care diagnostics, disease burden data generation, clinical and general education, prompt access to new interventions, and engagement with policymakers/payers were identified of paramount importance. There was a strong need for clinical education and local data generation in the lowest economies, whereas upper-middle income countries were more closely aligned with HI countries in terms of current RSV service provision.
CONCLUSION: Seven key actions for improving RSV prevention and management in LMICs are proposed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clinical trials evaluating biologics and small molecules in patients with ulcerative colitis are predominantly excluding ulcerative proctitis. The objective of the Definition and endpoints for ulcerative PROCtitis in clinical TRIALs initiative was to develop consensus statements for definitions, inclusion criteria, and endpoints for the evaluation of ulcerative proctitis in adults.
METHODS: Thirty-five international experts held a consensus meeting to define ulcerative proctitis, and the endpoints to use in clinical trials. Based on a systematic review of the literature, statements were generated, discussed, and approved by the working group participants using a modified Delphi method. Consensus was defined as at least 75% agreement among voters.
RESULTS: The group agreed that the diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis should be made by ileocolonoscopy and confirmed by histopathology, with the exclusion of infections, drug-induced causes, radiation, trauma, and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative proctitis was defined as macroscopic extent of lesions limited to 15 cm distance from the anal verge in adults. Primary and secondary endpoints were identified to capture response of ulcerative proctitis to therapy. A combined clinical and endoscopic primary endpoint for the evaluation of ulcerative proctitis disease activity was proposed. Secondary endpoints that should be evaluated include endoscopic remission, histologic remission, mucosal healing, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, disability, fecal incontinence, urgency, constipation, and health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: In response to the need for guidance on the design of clinical trials in patients with ulcerative proctitis, the Definition and end points for ulcerative PROCtitis in clinical TRIALs consensus provides recommendations on the definition and endpoints for ulcerative proctitis clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is one of the strongest outcome predictors, the current classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe' based on this fails to capture enormous heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment response. We hypothesized that data-driven characterization of TBI could identify distinct endotypes and give mechanistic insights.
METHODS: We developed an unsupervised statistical clustering model based on a mixture of probabilistic graphs for presentation (< 24 h) demographic, clinical, physiological, laboratory and imaging data to identify subgroups of TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit in the CENTER-TBI dataset (N = 1,728). A cluster similarity index was used for robust determination of optimal cluster number. Mutual information was used to quantify feature importance and for cluster interpretation.
RESULTS: Six stable endotypes were identified with distinct GCS and composite systemic metabolic stress profiles, distinguished by GCS, blood lactate, oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, glucose, base excess, pH, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and body temperature. Notably, a cluster with 'moderate' TBI (by traditional classification) and deranged metabolic profile, had a worse outcome than a cluster with 'severe' GCS and a normal metabolic profile. Addition of cluster labels significantly improved the prognostic precision of the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical trials in TBI) extended model, for prediction of both unfavourable outcome and mortality (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Six stable and clinically distinct TBI endotypes were identified by probabilistic unsupervised clustering. In addition to presenting neurology, a profile of biochemical derangement was found to be an important distinguishing feature that was both biologically plausible and associated with outcome. Our work motivates refining current TBI classifications with factors describing metabolic stress. Such data-driven clusters suggest TBI endotypes that merit investigation to identify bespoke treatment strategies to improve care. Trial registration The core study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02210221 , registered on August 06, 2014, with Resource Identification Portal (RRID: SCR_015582).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trace elements have been implicated in pathogenesis of epilepsy. Studies till date have shown altered levels of serum trace elements in children with epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current was to estimate serum levels of trace elements in children with well-controlled and drug refractory epilepsy and compare it with controls.
METHODOLOGY: In a tertiary care teaching hospital of North India, serum selenium, copper, zinc, and iron were estimated in well-controlled and drug refractory epileptic children aged 2-12 years and compared with age and gender matched controls.
RESULTS: A total of 106 children with epilepsy (55 drug refractory and 51 well controlled) and 52 age and gender matched controls were included in the study. Serum selenium and copper were significantly decreased in cases compared to controls. After classifying epilepsy into well-controlled and drug refractory cases, only in the latter the significant difference for serum selenium and copper levels remained compared to controls. Additionally, in the drug refractory cases, serum iron levels were significantly reduced compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum trace elements are altered in children with epilepsy (more so in the drug refractory group) compared to controls. Monitoring of serum trace elements in children with epilepsy should be considered. Up to one-third of epilepsy is drug refractory of which only another third are amenable to surgery. It is worth investigating the therapeutic potential of altered micronutrient status in these patients.

AB  - Benzodiazepines (BDZ) such as diazepam and lorazepam are popular as first-line treatment for acute seizures due to their rapid action and high efficacy. However, long-term usage of BDZ leads to benzodiazepine resistance, a phenomenon whose underlying mechanisms are still being investigated. One of the hypothesised mechanisms contributing to BDZ resistance is the presence of mutations in benzodiazepine-sensitive receptors. While a few genetic variants have been reported previously, knowledge of relevant pathogenic variants is still scarce. We used Sanger Sequencing to detect variants in the ligand-binding domain of BDZ-sensitive GABAA receptor subunits α1-3 and 5 expressed in resected brain tissues of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients with a history of BDZ resistance and found two previously unreported predicted pathogenic frameshifting variants - NM_000807.4(GABRA2):c.367_368insG and NM_000810.4(GABRA5):c.410del - significantly enriched in these patients. The findings were further explored in resected DRE brain tissues through cellular electrophysiological experiments.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating injuries which causes either complete or partial loss of movement, balance, muscular coordination and endurance. Electromagnetic field (EMF) stimulation has been shown to reduce muscle atrophy and fiber-type switching and improves muscle function in a hindlimb suspension model. The present study aims to elucidate the therapeutic potential of EMF stimulation on motor neuron excitability, soleus muscle morphology and function in complete SCI rats. Thirty-six adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into Sham, SCI and SCI+EMF groups. Complete transection was done at the T13 spinal level, followed by whole-body EMF exposure for 7 or 14 days. Hyper-reflexia, muscle atrophy, reduction in twitch and tetanic force with earlier onset of fatigue was evident in the SCI group. EMF stimulation showed significant improvement in H and M wave parameters, H/M ratio, muscle twitch and tetanic force, fusion frequency and fatigability. A significant increase in regenerating myofibers and reduction in muscle degeneration following EMF was evident on histopathological examination. Further, EMF significantly increased myogenic protein levels responsible for muscle regeneration. Our study demonstrates for the first time the potential of EMF to modulate motor neuron excitability and muscle contractile function in SCI rats through activity-dependent mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-cultured epidermal cell suspension (ECS) and hair follicle cell suspension (HFCS) are well-established methods of surgical treatment of stable vitiligo.
AIMS: The aim of the present study was to compare the laboratory indicators and clinical efficacy of ECS and HFCS in the treatment of stable vitiligo.
METHODS: This was a single centre, open-labeled randomized trial. Vitiligo patches from 74 patients were randomized to receive either ECS or HFCS. Both cell suspensions were analyzed for total cell count, cell viability and melanocyte count. Percentage re-pigmentation was assessed at regular intervals for 36 weeks.
RESULTS: The percentage re-pigmentation with ECS was significantly higher than HFCS at week 4 (p = .01) and week 16 (p = .03) however, no difference was observed at weeks 24 (p = .38) and 36 (p = .05). Forty-seven patients completed the study follow-up duration and excellent re-pigmentation (>90%) was achieved in 61.7% and 53.2% and complete re-pigmentation (100%) was observed in 6.4% and 12.8% of participants using ECS and HFCS, respectively. Significantly higher cell yield (p < .01) and percentage of HMB45+ melanocytes (p = .01) were obtained using ECS. No difference was noted in the percentage of viable cells or S100 + melanocytes.
CONCLUSION: The median cell yield was eight times higher in ECS than in HFCS with a significantly higher percentage of HMB45+ melanocytes in the former group. The median percentage of re-pigmentation in both groups was 90% at the end of 36 weeks. ECS provides faster re-pigmentation; however, both ECS and HFCS have comparable safety and efficacy over a longer duration of follow-up.

AB  - Background: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent cause of abnormal vaginal discharge among pre-menopausal women and associated with adversities of sexual and reproductive health. The present study aimed to identify potential epidemiological and behavioural risk factors and clinical predictors of BV among women in Delhi, India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess 283 non-pregnant women aged 18-45 years for BV using Nugent's scoring criteria. Information on demographics, sexual behaviours, hygiene practices and clinical symptoms was obtained and evaluated for their association with Nugent-BV status. Results: A positive diagnosis for Nugent-BV was made in 69 (24.4%) participants, 55 (19.4%) were intermediate and 159 (65.2%) were negative for Nugent-BV. Infertility (p = .02) and recent unprotected sexual exposure (p = .02) were strongly associated with Nugent-BV. On the other hand, women who reported regular use of condoms during intercourse were more likely to test negative (p = .03). None of the patient complaints, however, had any significant correlation with Nugent-BV diagnosis. Conclusion: Women in their reproductive years share the highest burden of adversities associated with bacterial vaginosis. History of infertility, recent unprotected sexual exposure and frequent use of condoms were correlates having significant associations with Nugent-BV.

AB  - Treatment guidelines for management of uncomplicated gonorrhoeae have been recently modified owing to alarming upsurge in azithromycin resistance. This study investigated the prevalence and genetic determinants of gonococcal azithromycin resistance in India. Four (5.7%) of 70 gonococcal isolates were resistant to azithromycin. Of 16 isolates investigated for molecular mechanisms of resistance, 13 (81.3%) and 6 (37.5%) isolates exhibited mutations in coding and promoter regions of mtrR gene, respectively. However, ermA, ermB and ermC genes or mutations in rrl gene were absent in all isolates. Azithromycin resistance is low in India posing no immediate threat to use of dual-therapy for syndromic management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Performing ultrasound during the current pandemic time is quite challenging. To reduce the chances of cross-infection and keep healthcare workers safe, a robotic ultrasound system was developed, which can be controlled remotely. It will also pave way for broadening the reach of ultrasound in remote distant rural areas as well.
AIM: To assess the feasibility of a robotic system in performing abdominal ultrasound and compare it with the conventional ultrasound system.
METHODS: A total of 21 healthy volunteers were recruited. Ultrasound was performed in two settings, using the robotic arm and conventional hand-held procedure. Images acquired were analyzed by separate radiologists.
RESULTS: Our study showed that the robotic arm model was feasible, and the results varied based on the organ imaged. The liver images showed no significant difference. For other organs, the need for repeat imaging was higher in the robotic arm, which could be attributed to the radiologist's learning curve and ability to control the haptic device. The doctor and volunteer surveys also showed significant comfort with acceptance of the technology and they expressed their desire to use it in the future.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that robotic ultrasound is feasible and is the need of the hour during the pandemic.

AB  - Pulmonary intimal sarcoma (PAS) is a highly aggressive malignant mesenchymal tumor affecting the central pulmonary arteries. Similar clinical presentation and indeterminate laboratory parameters often result in misdiagnosis of this condition as pulmonary thromboembolism, which is a relatively common disease. Certain imaging features can however allow differentiation between these two diagnoses. We present one such case of PAS that was initially treated as pulmonary embolism; and briefly review the relevant imaging characteristics to avoid overlooking PAS especially in patients with an atypical clinical history for thromboembolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to estimate the need for palliative care in an urban resettlement colony of Dakshinpuri Extension, New Delhi.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted in New Delhi. We trained four multipurpose workers to screen the households during their routine household-to-household visits. The screening for the need for palliative care was done using three questions - that is, (1) presence of a bedridden patient or (2) person in need for help in activities of daily living or (3) not able to go for work due to any physical chronic illness. If the answer to any of the three screening questions was yes for any member in a household, then these households were visited by a community physician trained in palliative care and a medical social service officer to confirm the need for palliative care. Patients were administered a semi-structured questionnaire containing the sociodemographic details and an assessment of disease status and review of health records was done. The patient and his/her caregiver were also assessed for awareness regarding palliative care.
RESULTS: A total of 2028 households were screened and the need for palliative care was found to be 1.5/1000 population (95% CI: 0.9-2.1). The mean age (SD) of patients who need palliative care was 60 years (SD-12.9). The common diseases which required palliative care were stroke with a focal neurological deficit (45.8%), osteoarthritis with marked dependence (20.8%) and cancer (12.5%). None of the patients was receiving palliative care as patients and their caregivers were not aware of the term palliative care/end of life care/home care for bedridden people/community-based care.
CONCLUSION: The need for palliative care in an urban resettlement colony of North India was found to be 1.1/1000 population. Further studies are required to estimate the need for palliative care in North India.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic 'displaced' displaced type II fractures, though uncommon, are difficult to manage. They usually require a transoral procedure followed by a posterior instrumented fusion. We describe here, a new method to reduce the fractured displaced odontoid using a posterior cervical approach only.
METHODS: Prospective and observational, n = 14 had a 'displaced and irreducible' old fracture dens causing cord compression (type I, 1; type II, 13). They underwent a novel technique to reduce the fracture. The C1 arch was first drilled and removed. The C1 lateral masses on both sides were then drilled completely and a spacer was placed between the occiput and C2 facet. Following this, an intraoperative reducing maneuver was performed, utilizing the spacer as a fulcrum, and then achieving complete reduction and realignment.
RESULTS: All patients improved clinically (mean Nurick preoperative score: 4.07 ± 0.8; the postoperative score was 1.3 ± 0.4). The mean correction in effective canal diameter was 74.3% ± 9.5% and the mean correction in actual canal diameter was 77% ± 8.7%. Solid bone fusion was demonstrated in 12 patients with at least 1-year follow-up (follow-up range, 12-35 months; mean, 21.8 ± 9.8 months).
CONCLUSION: The new described modification of distraction, compression extension, and reduction seems to be effective for 'displaced' chronic fracture dens with cord compression. It avoids additional transoral surgery in these patients.

AB  - Aim: 
          The present study is intended to analyze the preliminary interim data to understand the burden of associated comorbidities in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDS) in the Indian population from the Indian Rheumatology Association database.
          Materials and Methods: 
          The independent prospective, multicenter, observational study evaluated the preliminary data obtained from 5 centers across India. The data pertaining to comorbidities were collected, as per the definition of the new International Classification Diseases-10 version of the Charlson Comorbidity Index. The details such as socioeconomic status, impairment in the working capability, and their capacity to cope with their job after developing the disease were gathered for selected patients. The patients were broadly classified into five based on diagnosed AIRDS namely rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA), psoriasis arthritis (PsA), and scleroderma. The prevalence of different comorbidities was compared between the groups using Chi-square or Fischer-exact test for nonparametric data and analysis of variance for continuous variables.
          Results: 
          The study considered the data of 1885 for the analysis and 129 patients were excluded due to missing variables and data inconsistency. The socioeconomic distribution of AIRDS indicated that SLE was more prevalent among upper-middle-class followed by SpA (60.3% and 50.94%, respectively). RA and systemic sclerosis (SSc) were more common among the lower-income group, and PsA was common among the upper socioeconomic group. The most common comorbidity found in patients with RA and PsA was hypertension (20.97%, 17.14%), SLE and SSc was thyroid disease (21.49%, 17.78%), and SpA was diabetes (2.96%).
          Conclusion: 
          AIRDs are associated with the significant burden of comorbidities. Further studies are needed to understand the pattern of prevalence of comorbidities across different age groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is predominantly considered to be a disease frequently occurring after the fifth decade of life, its occurrence among adolescents has not received much public health attention. Pathophysiological and epidemiological evidence suggests that essential hypertension initiate in childhood and often goes unnoticed unless explicitly observed for this age group.
AIM: The current study estimates the prevalence of hypertension, its predictors, and pregnancy outcome among late adolescent girls (15-19 years).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study used secondary data from the NFHS 4 from January 2015 to December 2016. The sample of 1,24,878 adolescent girls out of 6,99,686, national women's data was obtained through a stratified two-stage sample using a population proportionate to size sampling methodology. Descriptive statistical tests and inferential statistics were performed to find the relation of hypertension with the independent variables and Chi-square analysis to study association of hypertension during pregnancy and its adverse pregnancy outcomes.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension among the late adolescents was 16.4% [CI: 16.2-16.6] (n=20,532). On multivariable logistic regression (after adjusting for all the variables) only age [AOR: 1.09 (1.08-1.11)]; education [AOR: 1.09 (1.006 - 1.2)], and wealth index [AOR: 1.17 (1.11 - 1.24)] retained the significance with hypertension. A significant association was seen between hypertension status of the adolescents and adverse pregnancy outcomes (χ2 = 4.550, P = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Nearly 1/6th of late adolescents found to be hypertensive, significantly contribution to disease burden. Also, a significant association is seen between hypertension status of adolescents and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Hence, it is imperative to make the National Programme inclusive for adolescents and have a focused approach to health promotion, prevention, and management of non-communicable diseases.

AB  - Objective  Nonspecific aorto-arteritis (NSAA) may involve the myocardium in the form of edema and fibrosis. We conducted this study to investigate role of cardiac MRI including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1 and T2 mapping in the assessment of cardiac involvement in NSAA. Methods and Materials  Over the period between 2016 and 2019, 36 patients with NSAA presenting with uncontrolled hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, congestive cardiac failure, or tachyarrhythmia were included in the study. We also had 16 voluntary control patients for providing normal T1 and T2 mapping values. Results  The average age of patients was 27.1 years and the majority were females. MRI is more sensitive than echocardiography in the detection of LV dysfunction and RWMA. Out of 36 patients, 10 (27.8%) had LGE. The most common pattern of midmyocardial enhancement was present in 5 out of 10 patients. Five (13.8%) patients show mid-myocardial enhancement, followed by epicardial enhancement, which was seen in four (11.11%) patients. The values of post-gad T1 mapping values were significantly lower than pre-gad T1 mapping values. At a cut-off global native T1 mapping value of 1019 milliseconds had the sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 81.2% in detecting an abnormal T1 map. No significant association of MRI contrast enhancement with elevated ESR and CRP levels. There was no significant relation of myocardial T2 mapping values between NSAA and control groups. Conclusion  Quantitative tissue characterization in the myocardium with native T1 mapping values help in the detection of cardiac involvement in patients with NSAA. T1 mapping may provide incremental value in the assessment of myocardial involvement in NSAA in addition to LGE imaging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Performing ultrasound during the current pandemic time is quite challenging. To reduce the chances of cross-infection and keep healthcare workers safe, a robotic ultrasound system was developed, which can be controlled remotely. It will also pave way for broadening the reach of ultrasound in remote distant rural areas as well.
AIM: To assess the feasibility of a robotic system in performing abdominal ultrasound and compare it with the conventional ultrasound system.
METHODS: A total of 21 healthy volunteers were recruited. Ultrasound was performed in two settings, using the robotic arm and conventional hand-held procedure. Images acquired were analyzed by separate radiologists.
RESULTS: Our study showed that the robotic arm model was feasible, and the results varied based on the organ imaged. The liver images showed no significant difference. For other organs, the need for repeat imaging was higher in the robotic arm, which could be attributed to the radiologist's learning curve and ability to control the haptic device. The doctor and volunteer surveys also showed significant comfort with acceptance of the technology and they expressed their desire to use it in the future.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that robotic ultrasound is feasible and is the need of the hour during the pandemic.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the role of retrograde signaling (mitochondria to nucleus) in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Therefore, in the present study, MCF7-H and MCF7-J cybrids were produced using the mitochondria from the same H and J individuals that were already used in our non-diseased retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE19) cybrids. MCF7 cybrids were treated with cisplatin and analyzed for cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, and expression levels of genes associated with the cGAS-STING and cancer-related pathways. Results showed that unlike the ARPE19-H and ARPE19-J cybrids, the untreated MCF7-H and MCF7-J cybrids had similar levels of ATP, lactate, and OCR: ECAR ratios. After cisplatin treatment, MCF7-H and MCF7-J cybrids showed similar (a) decreases in cell viability and ROS levels; (b) upregulation of ABCC1, BRCA1 and CDKN1A/P21; and (c) downregulation of EGFR. Cisplatin-treated ARPE19-H and ARPE19-J cybrids showed increased expression of six cGAS-STING pathway genes, while two were increased for MCF7-J cybrids. In summary, the ARPE19-H and ARPE19-J cybrids behave differentially from each other with or without cisplatin. In contrast, the MCF7-H and MCF7-J cybrids had identical metabolic/bioenergetic profiles and cisplatin responses. Our findings suggest that cancer cell nuclei might have a diminished ability to respond to the modulating signaling of the mtDNA that occurs via the cGAS-STING pathway.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was aimed to investigate the effect of multimodal intervention on the cognitive functions of older adults with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either computer based cognitive therapy (CBCT) or CBCT+Mediterranean equivalent diet (MED) or CBCT+MED+ Exercise regime and the control group. The intervention group received supervised CBCT twice a week to have 40 sessions, each of 40 minutes duration, and/ or supervised aerobic and resistive exercise twice a week for 24 weeks and or MED at home under the supervision of a dietician. The control group was provided with health awareness instructions for brain stimulating activities such as sudoku, mental maths, and learning music and new skills.
RESULTS: Cognitive functions which was the primary outcome measure were assessed using the Post Graduate Institute Memory Scale (PGI-MS), and Stroop Colour and Word Test at baseline and after 6 months intervention period. As assessed by the PGI-MS, there was significant improvement in domains such as mental balance, attention and concentration, delayed recall, immediate recall, verbal retention of dissimilar pairs, Visual retention, and total score both in the unimodal and multimodal intervention groups. However, the improvement was observed to be the highest in the multimodal intervention group as compared to unimodal group. All the participants completed the trial.
CONCLUSION: This pilot randomized control trial indicated that multimodal intervention could be an effective non-pharmacological intervention in individuals with SCI for improving their cognitive functions.

TI  - Development of a Tribofidelic Human Heel Surrogate for Barefoot Slip Testing
AU  - Chatterjee, Subhodip

T2  - Journal of Bionic Engineering
AB  - Barefoot slips contribute to over 37% of recurrent fall-related injuries across all age groups. To study slip risk across a wide range of flooring conditions, slip meters with barefoot surrogates (i.e., sensors, as per ASTM standard nomenclature) such as animal skins and rubbers have been used to date, which exhibit biomechanical and frictional properties widely different from the barefoot human skin. Development of a surrogate which can accurately simulate the human heel skin properties would be immensely beneficial for realistic assessment of barefoot slipping risk. A novel surrogate was developed using 3D scanning and printing, and biomimetics, which precisely simulates the biomechanical and frictional properties of the barefoot human heel skin. Mechanical slip testing was conducted with this surrogate on three common bathroom floorings and with six different contaminants. Coefficient of Friction (COF) results similar to human slipping experiments, high repeatability and reproducibility across wet and oily flooring conditions, were confirmed through experiments with the developed heel skin surrogate. The heel skin surrogate would be an indispensable model for accurate estimation of barefoot risk against slips and falls in bathrooms, bathtubs, and swimming pools.

T2  - Tribology Transactions
AB  - Barefoot slips and falls are commonly reported in bathrooms in Indian households and apartments. Due to lack of awareness on how to prevent such incidents, they are often neglected, and may lead to recurrent and severe traumatic injuries. To date, there is no way to assess the barefoot slip risk of the bathroom flooring tiles under realistic contaminated conditions such as with water and shampoo. In this work, a novel human heel surrogate was developed for barefoot slip testing, to address this gap. This surrogate was tuned to precisely mimic the frictional and biomechanical properties of the human heel, through three-dimensional (3D) scanning and printing. A mechanical slip testing device was employed with the heel surrogate to test 15 different bathroom floorings in residential apartments in dry and slippery conditions (i.e., wet and with shampoo spill). The barefoot available coefficient of friction (ACOF) was determined for the different floor conditions and tested for repeatability with two modeled heel surrogate samples. Also, the correlation of ACOF with surface roughness and between floorings was studied, across contaminant conditions. High repeatability (r2 > 0.92) was confirmed in the dry condition, and the ACOF values decreased significantly when going from dry to wet and wet to shampoo spill conditions. The correlation of ACOF with surface roughness was found to be high (r2 = 0.72), medium (r2 = 0.62), and low (r2 = 0.38) for the dry, wet, and shampoo spill conditions, respectively. Across contaminant conditions, several tiles exhibited high correlations in ACOF due to shampoo spills, indicating generalizability of barefoot slip risk. The findings of low barefoot frictional resistance on Indian bathroom floorings in wet and shampoo spill conditions, lack of correlations with surface roughness, and high generalizability of slip risk across floorings in the shampoo spill condition have not been reported to date, and shed light on the significant barefoot slip risks.

T2  - Indian Journal of Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To elicit antibiotic prescribing patterns across Indian Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) and assess attributes of the antibiotic stewardship programs.
METHODS: A link to a web-based questionnaire was sent by email to pediatric intensivists across India.
RESULTS: Responses were received from 62 PICUs. Majority of respondents were from private hospitals [49/62 (79.5%)]. The most commonly reported infection requiring PICU admission was community-acquired pneumonia [by 39 (62.9%) PICUs] followed by gastroenteritis [26 (41.9%)], and meningitis [15 (24.1%)]. The blood culture positivity rates varied among participating PICUs with 37 centers (59.6%) reporting low blood culture positivity yield (< 40%). Majority of the respondents acknowledged using a 7-d course of antibiotics even in culture-negative sepsis. Most common empiric antibiotics prescribed for community-acquired infections were beta-lactam monotherapy. The typical beta-lactam prescribed was ceftriaxone. However, for hospital-acquired infections (HAI), such as suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a higher number of respondents-39/62 (61.9%) and 33/62 (53.2%), respectively, prescribed combination antibiotics (β-lactam + vancomycin). Forty-two units (67.7%) reported having an antibiotic stewardship program in their PICUs, while twenty-nine (45.1%) centers stated having formulary restrictions. Ten (16.1%) centers had pre-authorization policy for certain antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: A rather diverse pattern of prescribing and administration practices exists across different Indian PICUs. While antibiotic stewardship programmes are established in most centers, formulary restriction and pre-authorisation of antibiotic prescribing were reported by few units. Regular surveillance studies are needed to bring uniformity in antibiotic policy and select appropriate empiric therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic condition with significant health and socioeconomic consequences. In Nepal, T2DM is a common disease for which people consult ayurvedic (traditional medical system) practitioners and use ayurvedic medicines. Strong concerns remain about the suboptimal T2DM management of many patients by ayurvedic practitioners, and therefore, based on the best available scientific evidence, we have developed a clinical guideline for managing T2DM by ayurvedic practitioners. The research question to be addressed by a definitive cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is whether the introduction of a clinical guideline can improve the management of T2DM by ayurvedic practitioners in Nepal as compared to usual ayurvedic management (i.e., without any clinical guideline). In preparation for this future work, this current study aims to determine the feasibility of undertaking the definitive cluster RCT.
METHODS: This is a 2-arm, feasibility cluster RCT with a blinded outcome assessment and a qualitative evaluation. The study is conducted in 12 public and private ayurveda centers in and outside the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal (1:1 intervention:control). Eligible participants should be new T2DM adult patients (i.e., treatment naïve) - the glycated hemoglobin level should be 6.5% or above but less than 9%. At least 120 participants (60/group) will be recruited and followed up for 6 months. Important parameters, needed to design the definitive trial, will be estimated, such as the standard deviation of the outcome measure (i.e., glycated hemoglobin level at 6-month follow-up), intraclass correlation coefficient, cluster size, recruitment, the time needed to recruit participants, follow-up, and adherence to the recommended ayurvedic medicine. Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with around 20 to 30 participants and all the participating ayurvedic practitioners to explore their experiences and perspectives of taking part in the study and of the intervention and a sample of eligible people declining to participate in the study to explore the reasons behind nonparticipation.
DISCUSSION: We are now conducting a feasibility cluster RCT in Nepal to determine the feasibility of undertaking the definitive cluster trial. The first participant was recruited on 17 July 2022. If the feasibility is promising (such as recruitment, follow-up, and adherence to the recommended ayurvedic medicine), then the parameters estimated will be used to design the definitive cluster trial. Decisions over whether to modify the protocol will mainly be informed by the qualitative data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a common chronic health condition, has major health and socioeconomic consequences. In the Indian subcontinent, it is a health condition for which individuals commonly consult Ayurvedic (traditional medical system) practitioners and use their medicines. However, to date, a good quality T2DM clinical guideline for Ayurvedic practitioners, grounded on the best available scientific evidence, is not available. Therefore, the study aimed to systematically develop a clinical guideline for Ayurvedic practitioners to manage T2DM in adults.
METHODS: The development work was guided by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) manual for developing guidelines, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. First, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted which evaluated Ayurvedic medicines' effectiveness and safety in managing T2DM. In addition, the GRADE approach was used for assessing the certainty of the findings. Next, using the GRADE approach, the Evidence-to-Decision framework was developed, and we focused on glycemic control and adverse events. Subsequently, based on the Evidence-to-Decision framework, a Guideline Development Group of 17 international members made recommendations on Ayurvedic medicines' effectiveness and safety in T2DM. These recommendations formed the basis of the clinical guideline, and additional generic content and recommendations were adapted from the T2DM Clinical Knowledge Summaries of the Clarity Informatics (UK). The feedback given by the Guideline Development Group on the draft version was used to amend and finalize the clinical guideline.
RESULTS: A clinical guideline for managing T2DM in adults by Ayurvedic practitioners was developed, which focuses on how practitioners can provide appropriate care, education, and support for people with T2DM (and their carers and family). The clinical guideline provides information on T2DM, such as its definition, risk factors, prevalence, prognosis, and complications; how it should be diagnosed and managed through lifestyle changes like diet and physical activity and Ayurvedic medicines; how the acute and chronic complications of T2DM should be detected and managed (including referral to specialists); and advice on topics like driving, work, and fasting including during religious/socio-cultural festivals.
CONCLUSION: We systematically developed a clinical guideline for Ayurvedic practitioners to manage T2DM in adults.

AB  - Introduction: Many Ayurvedic medicines have the potential for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with previous systematic reviews demonstrating effectiveness and safety for specific Ayurvedic medicines. However, many of the reviews need updating and none provide a comprehensive summary of all the Ayurvedic medicines evaluated for managing T2DM. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Ayurvedic medicines for managing T2DM. Inclusion criteria: Published and unpublished RCTs assessing the effectiveness and safety of Ayurvedic medicines for managing T2DM in adults. Methods: The JBI systematic review methodology was followed. A comprehensive search of sources (including 18 electronic databases) from inception to 16 January 2021 was made. No language restrictions were applied. Data synthesis was conducted using narrative synthesis and random effects meta-analyses, where appropriate. Pooled results are reported as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Out of 32,519 records identified from the searches, 219 articles were included in the systematic review representing 199 RCTs (21,191 participants) of 98 Ayurvedic medicines. Overall, in the studies reviewed the methodology was not adequately reported, resulting in poorer methodological quality scoring. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was reduced using Aegle marmelos (L.) Corrêa (MD -1.6%; 95% CI -3 to -0.3), Boswellia serrata Roxb. (-0.5; -0.7 to -0.4), Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino (-1; -1.5 to -0.6), Momordica charantia L. (-0.3; -0.4 to -0.1), Nigella sativa L. (-0.4; -0.6 to -0.1), Plantago ovata Forssk. (-0.9; -1.4 to -0.3), Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Hook.f. and Thomson (-0.5; -0.6 to -0.5), Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (-0.6; -0.9 to -0.4), and Urtica dioica L. (-1.3; -2.4 to -0.2) compared to control. Similarly, fasting blood glucose (FBG) was reduced by 4-56 mg/dl for a range of Ayurvedic medicines. Very few studies assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Adverse events were not reported in many studies, and if reported, these were mostly none to mild and predominately related to the gastrointestinal tract. Conclusion: The current evidence suggests the benefit of a range of Ayurvedic medicines in improving glycemic control in T2DM patients. Given the limitations of the available evidence and to strengthen the evidence base, high-quality RCTs should be conducted and reported.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review will compare the efficacy of nasoalveolar molding plates fabricated using a digital workflow to conventional fabrication methods or no intervention in infants with cleft lip or palate.
INTRODUCTION: Nasoalveolar molding reduces the severity of orofacial defects in infants with cleft lip or palate using a series of adaptable plates for the maxillary arch. The conventional method needs multiple patient visits at short intervals for treatment. A digital workflow can be used to fabricate multiple plates in one appointment, which eliminates human error, reduces the number of appointments, and allocates more time for patient care for the orthodontic team than appliance fabrication.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will consider clinical studies that report the results of digital nasoalveolar molding in infants with cleft lip or palate and compare it to the conventional method or to no treatment. Outcomes of interest will be objective measures of craniofacial form, nasolabial measurements, or palatal form.
METHODS: This review will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Oral Health Group Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov will be searched using appropriate keywords. Publications in English will be considered. Screening based on titles and abstracts will be done after de-duplication, followed by full-text reading for selection based on the inclusion criteria. Data extracted from the studies will be tabulated and assessed for risk of bias. If applicable, a meta-analysis of the pooled data will be conducted.

AB  - Objective: This study compares and contrasts traditional autopsy with postmortem computed tomography in a homicide case of penetrating neck injury.Method: Autopsy and postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) findings were compared.Results: PMCT demonstrates the presence of air embolism, surgical emphysema, the direction of the wound, entry, and weapon trajectory. Autopsy proved helpful in terms of external examination.Conclusion: PMCT was superior to the internal inspection at autopsy in the presented case and has added value for detecting additional findings regarding the cause of death. However, a combination of both techniques increases the quality of postmortem evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The economic burden of autism is substantial and includes a range of costs, including healthcare, education, productivity losses, informal care and respite care, among others. In India, approximately, 2 million children aged 2-9 years have autism. Given the likely substantial burden of illness and the need to identify effective and cost-effective interventions, this research aimed to produce a comprehensive cost of illness inventory (COII) suitable for children with autism in South Asia (India) to support future research.
METHODS: A structured and iterative design process was followed to create the COII, including literature reviews, interviews with caregivers, pilot testing and translation. Across the development of the COII, thirty-two families were involved in the design and piloting of the tool. The COII was forward translated (from English to Hindi) and back translated. Each stage of the process of development of the COII resulted in the further refinement of the tool.
RESULTS: Domains covered in the final COII include education, childcare, relocation, healthcare contacts (outpatient, inpatient, medical emergencies, investigations and medication), religious retreats and rituals, specialist equipment, workshops and training, special diet, support and care, certification, occupational adjustments and government rebates/schemes. Administration and completion of the COII determined it to be feasible to complete in 35 minutes by qualified and trained researchers. The final COII is hosted by REDCap Cloud and is a bilingual instrument (Hindi and English).
CONCLUSIONS: The COII was developed using experiences gathered from an iterative process in a metropolitan area within the context of one low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting, India. Compared to COII tools used for children with autism in high-income country settings, additional domains were required, such as complimentary medication (e.g. religious retreats and homeopathy). The COII will allow future research to quantify the cost of illness of autism in India from a broad perspective and will support relevant economic evaluations. Understanding the process of developing the questionnaire will help researchers working in LMICs needing to adapt the current COII or developing similar questionnaires.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to compare the single matrix approach and slice-by-slice approach for computing singular value decomposition (SVD) to achieve near-lossless compression of PET/CT images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The parameters used for comparison were SVD computation time, percentage compression and percentage difference between ROI counts on compressed and original images. SVD of 49 F-18-FDG PET/CT studies (33 370 PET/CT images) was computed using both approaches. The smaller singular values contributing insignificant information to the image were truncated, and then, the compressed image was reconstructed. A mask (101 × 101pixels) was used to extract the ROI counts from compressed and original images. Two nuclear medicine physicians compared compressed images with their corresponding original images for loss of clinical details and the presence of generated artifacts. Structural Similarity Index Measure, blur, brightness, contrast per pixel and global contrast factor were used for objective assessment of image quality. Wilcoxon test was applied to find a statistically significant difference between the parameters used for comparison at alpha = 0.05.
RESULTS: Nuclear medicine physicians found compressed image identical to the corresponding original image. The values of comparation parameters were significantly larger for the single matrix approach in comparison with the slice-by-slice approach. The maximum percentage error between the compressed image and original image was less than 5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Up to 64 % and 44% near-lossless compression of PET and CT images were achieved, respectively using the slice-by-slice approach, and up to 58 and 53% near-lossless compression of PET and CT images were achieved respectively using the single matrix approach.

T2  - Nuclear Medicine Communications
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The SVDsketch [MATLAB function which implements a randomized singular value decomposition (rSVD) algorithm] uses tolerance (tol) to adaptively determine the rank of the matrix sketch approximation. As the tol gets larger, fewer features of input image matrix are used in the matrix sketch. The objective of this study was to optimize the value of tol for compressing technetium-99m (Tc-99m) L,L, ethylenedicysteine (LLEC) renal dynamic (RD) study in minimum time preserving clinical information.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At different values of tol [0.00012(default), 0.1, 0.01, and 0.05] 50 Tc-99m LLEC RD studies were compressed. Two nuclear medicine (NM) physicians compared compressed images at tol = 0.1 with its input images. The SVD computation time and compression factor were calculated for each study. The image quality metrics: Error, structural similarity index for measuring image quality, brightness, global contrast factor (GCF), contrast per pixel (CPP), and blur were used for objective assessment of image quality. Percentage error in split function estimated from compressed and original images was calculated. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to find statistically significant difference between renal split function, blur, GCF, CPP, and brightness of the compressed image and the original image at .
RESULTS: As per NM physicians, compressed images estimated with tol = 0.1 were identical to the original images. Based on image quality metrics, compressed images were significantly less noisy, brighter, and have better contrast compared with its input images. There was insignificant difference in split renal function estimated from compressed RD study at tol = 0.1 and its original study. The SVD computation and percentage compression per study were found to be 0.04725 s and up to 74.53%.
CONCLUSION: The optimized value of tol for compressing Tc-99m LLEC RD study preserving clinical information was found to be 0.1, and SVD computation time: 0.04725 s.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the compression of renal dynamic (RD) study images using singular value decomposition (SVD) technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 4600 images of fifty RD study were compressed by using SVD technique. Two Nuclear Medicine (NM) Physicians compared compressed images with their corresponding input images and labeled these as acceptable or unacceptable. The SVD computation time and compression ratio were calculated for each image. The quality of compressed image was also assessed objectively using the following image quality metrics: Error, structural similarity (SSIM), Brightness, global contrast factor, contrast per pixel (CPP), and blur. The error in split function (i.e., the error between split function calculated from compressed image and split function calculated from original image) was computed for every RD study. Wilcoxon signed-rank test with continuity correction was applied to find a statistically significant difference in ROI counts on compressed and original image at.
RESULTS: As per NM physicians compressed image frames look identical to the original image frames. Objectively the compressed images were brighter, less noisy, and also have better CPP. Based on the visual assessment, time activity curve generated from original and compressed image frames was identical. There was insignificant difference of ROI counts between the input and compressed image frames of 99m-Tc LLEC RD Study. There was no significant difference between the split renal function estimated from original and its compressed RD study. The average SSIM value, average compression ratio, and SVD computation time were found to be 0.7521, 1.475, and 0.1200.
CONCLUSIONS: Visually, compressed image was identical to the original image. The percentage compression achieved was found to be up to 58% (compression factor achieved = 1.57). The SVD computation time was approximately 0.12 s for 64 × 64 matrix size image frame.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gene expression profile of mitochondrial-related genes is not well deciphered in pediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We aimed to identify mitochondria-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pediatric AML with their prognostic significance.
METHODS: Children with de novo AML were included prospectively between July 2016-December 2019. Transcriptomic profiling was done for a subset of samples, stratified by mtDNA copy number. Top mitochondria-related DEGs were identified and validated by real-time PCR. A prognostic gene signature risk score was formulated using DEGs independently predictive of overall survival (OS) in multivariable analysis. Predictive ability of the risk score was estimated along with external validation in The Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML dataset.
RESULTS: In 143 children with AML, twenty mitochondria-related DEGs were selected for validation, of which 16 were found to be significantly dysregulated. Upregulation of SDHC (p<0.001), CLIC1 (p=0.013) and downregulation of SLC25A29 (p<0.001) were independently predictive of inferior OS, and included for developing prognostic risk score. The risk score model was independently predictive of survival over and above ELN risk categorization (Harrell's c-index: 0.675). High-risk patients (risk score above median) had significantly inferior OS (p<0.001) and event free survival (p<0.001); they were associated with poor-risk cytogenetics (p=0.021), ELN intermediate/poor risk group (p=0.016), absence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (p=0.027), and not attaining remission (p=0.016). On external validation, the risk score also predicted OS (p=0.019) in TCGA dataset.
DISCUSSION: We identified and validated mitochondria-related DEGs with prognostic impact in pediatric AML and also developed a novel 3-gene based externally validated gene signature predictive of survival.

AB  - Biomaterial properties, such as surface roughness, morphology, stiffness, conductivity, and chemistry, significantly influence a cell's ability to sense and adhere to its surface and regulate cell functioning. Understanding how biomaterial properties govern changes in cellular function is one of the fundamental goals of tissue engineering. Still, no generalized rule is established to predict cellular processes (adhesion, spreading, growth and differentiation) on biomaterial surfaces. A few studies have highlighted that cells sense biomaterial properties at multiple length scales and regulate various intracellular biochemical processes like cytoskeleton organization, gene regulation, and receptor expression to influence cell function. However, recent studies have found cellular metabolism as another critical aspect of cellular processes that regulate cell behavior, co-relating metabolism to cellular functions like adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Now researchers have started to uncover previously overlooked factors on how biomaterial properties govern changes in cellular functions mediated through metabolism. This review highlights how different physiochemical properties of scaffolds designed from different biomaterials influence cell metabolism. The review also discusses the role of metabolism change in cellular functions and cell behavior in the context of bone tissue engineering. It also emphasizes the importance of cell metabolism as a missing link between the cellular behavior and physicochemical properties of scaffolds and serves as a guiding principle for designing scaffolds for tissue engineering.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a heterogenous, neurodegenerative disease with distinct pathophysiological progression. Symptom specific biomarkers may help in early diagnosis, differentiating PD subgroups and in identifying early changes associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and common non-motor symptoms. The in-vitro and in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques allow comprehensive, non-invasive characterization of bio-fluids (urine and saliva) and metabolic alterations and provide information on disease pathophysiology. This review summarizes the cerebral metabolic alterations and signature changes in bio-fluids in PD in comparison to controls, assessed by magnetic resonance techniques. The alterations in brain metabolites attributed to non-motor symptoms in PD with emphasis on cognitive impairment are also presented.

AB  - In this study, we examined the cellular infectivity and ultrastructural changes due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the various cells of bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) from intubated patients of different age groups (≥60 years and <60 years) and with common comorbidities such as diabetes, liver and kidney diseases, and malignancies. BALF of 79 patients (38 cases >60 and 41 cases <60 years) were studied by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate the ultrastructural changes in the ciliated epithelium, type II pneumocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and anucleated granulocytes. This study demonstrated relatively a greater infection and better preservation of subcellular structures in these cells from BALF of younger patients (<60 years compared with the older patients (≥60 years). The different cells of BALF from the patients without comorbidities showed higher viral load compared with the patients with comorbidities. Diabetic patients showed maximum ultrastructural damage in BALF cells in the comorbid group. This study highlights the comparative effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the different airway and inflammatory cells of BALF at the subcellular levels among older and younger patients and in patients with comorbid conditions.

AB  - IKKγ prototypically promotes NFκBp65 activity by regulating the assembly of the IKK holocomplex. In hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, the p65-p300 complex-induced regenerative efforts are neutralized by the p53-p300 complex-mediated apoptotic load resulting in compromised cardiac function. The present study reports that nitrosative stress leads to S-Nitrosylation of IKKγ in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes in a pre-clinical model. Using a cardiomyocyte-targeted nanoconjugate, IKKγ S-Nitrosylation-resistant mutant plasmids were delivered to the pathologically hypertrophied heart that resulted in improved cardiac function by amelioration of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and simultaneous induction of their cell cycle re-entry machinery. Mechanistically, in IKKγ S-Nitrosyl mutant-transfected hypertrophied cells, increased IKKγ-p300 binding downregulated the binding of p53 and p65 with p300. This shifted the binding preference of p65 from p300 to HDAC1 resulting in upregulated expression of cyclin D1 and CDK2 via the p27/pRb pathway. This approach has therapeutic advantage over mainstream anti-hypertrophic remedies which concomitantly reduce the regenerative prowess of resident cardiomyocytes during hypertrophy upon downregulation of myocyte apoptosis. Therefore, cardiomyocyte-targeted delivery of IKKγ S-Nitrosyl mutants during hypertrophy can be exploited as a novel strategy to re-muscularize the diseased heart.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While celiac disease (CeD) is considered to affect primarily the small intestine, pathological changes in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are also known to occur. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 antibody (anti-TG2 Ab) deposits at the site of involvement is one of the methods to establish CeD-related tissue pathology.
AIMS: To explore the utility of IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits in pan-gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies as evidence of CeD-related pathologies.
METHODS: Forty-two treatment-naive patients with CeD and 45 patients with irritable bowel syndrome were included as cases and controls, respectively. Mucosal biopsies were collected from the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and rectosigmoid regions at baseline from cases and controls, and additionally after 6-months of gluten-free diet in cases. All biopsies were evaluated for histological changes and subjected to dual-color immunohistochemical staining for identifying IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits.
RESULTS: Significantly higher number of patients with CeD had lymphocytic esophagitis (9.7% vs. 0%, P = 0.05), lymphocytic gastritis (35% vs. 8.8%, P < 0.01) and lymphocytic colitis (17.4% vs. 0%, P < 0.05) than that in controls. IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits were observed in significantly more numbers in esophagus (30.9% vs. 6%, P < 0.001), stomach (62.2% vs. 9.3%, P < 0.01), duodenum (88.5% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) and rectum (17.4% vs. 0%, P < 0.05) than that in controls. There was a decline, but not statistically significant, in severity of lymphocytosis and intensity of IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits in follow-up biopsies.
CONCLUSION: Significantly higher number of patients with CeD had evidence of lymphocytic infiltration and IgA anti-TG2 deposits along GIT suggesting that CeD affects other parts of GIT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 antibody (anti-TG2Ab) deposits in intestinal and extraintestinal organs have been used to link the respective pathological changes in these organs with celiac disease (CeD).
AIMS: To know if parts of intestine other than the duodenum, such as esophagus, stomach, and colon, have any pathology related to potential CeD or have mucosal IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective case-control study conducted from April 2018 to December 2019.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with potential CeD and 27 age- and gender-matched patients with irritable bowel syndrome were recruited as cases and controls, respectively. Mucosal biopsies were collected from esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and rectosigmoid regions, histological changes were evaluated, and IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits were analyzed in these regions by two-color immunohistochemical staining.
STATISTICS: Data were analyzed using statistical software Stata 14.0.
RESULTS: No distinct difference in mucosal lymphocytosis were identified between biopsies of patients with potential CeD and controls at the following sites: esophagus (11.1% vs 0%, P = 0.079), stomach (14.3% vs 7.7%, P = 0.590), and rectum (20% vs 0%, P = 0.067). Co-localized IgA anti-TG2Ab deposits were observed more in potential CeD than in controls at esophagus 22.2% (2/9) vs 0%, P = 0.012; stomach 66.7% (6/9) vs 11.5% (3/26), P < 0.001; and duodenum 66.7% (6/9) vs 0%, P < 0.001 but not at rectum 0% (0/4) vs 0% (0/25).
CONCLUSION: Although histological changes are not distinct, a subset of subjects with potential CeD has pan-intestinal involvement other than in the duodenum.

AB  - New variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to evolve. The novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.529 (Omicron) was particularly menacing due to the presence of numerous consequential mutations. In this study, we reviewed about 12 million SARS-CoV-2 genomic and associated metadata using extensive bioinformatic approaches to understand how evolutionary and mutational changes affect Omicron variant properties. Subsampled global data based analysis of molecular clock in the phylogenetic tree showed 29.56 substitutions per year as the evolutionary rate of five VOCs. We observed extensive mutational changes in the spike structural protein of the Omicron variant. A total of 20% of 7230 amino acid and structural changes exclusive to Omicron's spike protein were detected in the receptor binding domain (RBD), suggesting differential selection pressures exerted during evolution. Analyzing key drug targets revealed mutation-derived differential binding affinities between Delta and Omicron variants. Nine single-RBD substitutions were detected within the binding site of approved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. T-cell epitope prediction revealed eight immunologically important functional hotspots in three conserved non-structural proteins. A universal vaccine based on these regions may likely protect against all these SARS-CoV-2 variants. We observed key structural changes in the spike protein, which decreased binding affinities, indicating that these changes may help the virus escape host cellular immunity. These findings emphasize the need for continuous genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to better understand how novel mutations may impact viral spread and disease outcome.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has emerged as one of the most promising platforms for various biosensing applications. These sensing systems encompass the advantages of specificity, ultra-high sensitivity, stability, low cost, repeatability, and easy-to-use methods. Moreover, their ability to offer a molecular fingerprint and identify the target analyte at low levels make SERS a promising technique for detecting circulating cancer biomarkers with greater sensitivity and reliability. Among the various circulating biomolecules, oncomiRs are emerging as prominent biomarkers for the early screening of breast cancers (BCs). In this review, we provide a comprehensive understanding of different SERS-based biosensors and their application to identify BC-specific oncomiRs. We also discuss different SERS-based sensing strategies, nano-analytical frameworks, and challenges to be addressed for effective clinical translation.

AB  - Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) can recur, metastasize, and even cause death. Cyclins regulate the cell cycle progression at different phases and its dysregulation is associated with uncontrollable cell growth and malignant transformation of the cell. Overexpression of cyclin has been reported in various malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of cyclins in OSSN remains unexplored. This study has been designed to assess the prognostic significance of cyclin (cyclin B1, E1, and D1) immunoexpression in 100 OSSN patients. The targeted proteins demonstrated overexpression of cyclin B1, cyclin E1, and cyclin D1 in 55%, 37%, and 56% OSSN cases prospectively. A gradual and significant increase in the cyclin B1 (P=0.01) and cyclin D1 (P=0.005) expression was seen from Tis to the T4 category. Overexpression of cyclin B1 was associated with poor disease-free survival and worst prognosis in both early (P=0.03) as well as advanced T staged (P=0.038) OSSN patients. Overexpression of cyclin E1 was associated with worst disease-free survival (P=0.01) and poor prognosis in advanced stage OSSN patients. Our findings suggest that cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 have prognostic relevance in OSSN patients, and therefore are recommended for detecting high-risk category cases. A significant increase in the expression of cyclins from early to advanced stage indicates that cyclins play an important role in the pathogenesis of OSSN patients.

While the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the risks, side effects continue to be reported in the literature. We report a 65-year-old man who developed cognitive deficits and memory impairments following his first dose of Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield). The onset of acute cognitive deficits and memory impairments could be another complication to COVID-19 vaccination that physicians and neurologists need to be warned to. Monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and describing side effects associated with them is essential to improve safety profiles and enhance public trust.

As it involves reserving of the blood units (usually up to 72 hours) prior to issue or un-reserving, it can lead to excessive blood cross matching, inventory management problems, undue workload, blood outdating and reagent wastage. Type and screen (TS) policy is an alternative approach without the need to cross match and reserve blood units prior to issue. The aim of the current study was to retrospectively assess the impact of the implementation of TS policy for pre-transfusion compatibility testing on blood transfusion services at an urban level Ι trauma center.
Methods: The study was done in two phases in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center AIIMS, New Delhi, India. Transfusion data was collected and compared during two phases: initial phase (Oct 2016-Mar 2017) of TC policy and second phase (Apr 2017-Sept 2017) of TS policy.
Results: TS policy resulted in the reduction of C:T ratio from 5.3 to 1.9. Transfusion probability increased to 29.5% during TS policy from 23.6% during TC policy. Issuable stock index (ISI) also showed reduction from 12.5 to 11.4 after TS policy. Wastage as percentage of issue (WAPI) was reduced from 2.3% (TC) to 1.3% (TS). TS policy also led to reduction in expenses incurred on pre-transfusion compatibility testing by 35%. No hemolytic transfusion reaction was reported during the study.
Conclusion: TS policy was found to be a safe and an efficient alternative approach to TC policy for pre-transfusion compatibility at our center. We recommend the implementation of TS policy, but each center should first assess its feasibility based on patient population, blood bank resources and staff knowledge.

AB  - Objective We aim to implement the practice of birth companions (BC) (from 0% to 90%) during labor to provide respectful maternity care (RMC) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods This was a prospective quality improvement (QI) study conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh, India. The methodology given by the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Point of Care Continuous Quality Improvement (POCQI) manual was followed, and standard tools of quality improvement were used to attain the objective. Results The QI team conducted a cause and effect analysis to understand the reasons why birth companions were not allowed during childbirth. The Pareto principle derived at three most important causes of the problem: absence of a defined policy, ignorance of guidelines promoting BC even during the pandemic, and relatives could enter wards only after a negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) report, which could take up to 48 hours. Multiple change ideas were tested by means of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles that were successful in bringing about desired change and improvement in the delivery of quality healthcare. Conclusion QI methodology was effective in promoting and achieving more than 90% birth companionship in labor and thus helpful in providing respectful maternity care even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Relatively limited literature is available on lethality assessment for suicide attempts in affective disorders from the Indian subcontinent.
AIMS: To assess the lethality and its clinical correlates in lifetime suicide attempters with mood disorders.
METHODS: A total of 100 lifetime suicide attempters, aged ≥18 years, with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder-recurrent (MDD-R) were recruited. Current euthymia was ascertained (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) ≤7; Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) ≤4). Assessments were conducted using clinical pro forma, Risk-Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and Barratt's Impulsiveness Scale (BIS).
RESULTS: Average age of the sample was 36.32 ± 11.76 years (48% males, 52% females). The mean duration of affective illness was 10.59 ± 8.32 years. Risk-rescue scores for lethality were significantly higher in males (vs females), bipolar disorder (vs unipolar), multiple attempters (vs single) and planned (vs unplanned) attempters. Risk-rescue score also showed a significant positive correlation with lifetime total and depressive episodes, and intensity of ideations, and a significant negative correlation with BIS-attention impulsiveness. Regression analysis [F (3,96) = 12.196, P < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.253] found that lifetime lithium prescription, intensity of suicidal ideations and attention impulsiveness explained 25.3% variance in lethality.
CONCLUSION: Absence of lifetime lithium, higher intensity of suicidal ideations and lower attentional impulsiveness predicted higher lethality of suicide attempts. Lethality of suicide attempts was found to be associated with a multitude of clinical factors, notably male gender, bipolarity, multiple attempts, planned attempts and number of total and depressive episodes. Assessment of lethality and its correlates can help to plan strategies towards risk prevention in mood disorders.

T2  - The Indian Journal of Medical Research
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cingulum bundle (CB) is frequently implicated in schizophrenia; however, its role in specific symptoms of schizophrenia such as auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) is less explored. Few studies have reported association between reduced integrity of CB and severity of AVH. Using a symptom-based approach, this diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractographic study was aimed to assess and compare the integrity of CB in schizophrenia with AVH, schizophrenia without AVH and healthy controls.
METHODS: A total of 92 right-handed adult individuals (aged 18-50 yr) were recruited across three study groups. Those with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophrenia with AVH (group I; n=30) were compared to those with DSM-5 schizophrenia without lifetime AVH (group II; n=32) and healthy controls (group III; n=30; screened using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview version-7.0.0. and negative family history). Clinical assessments (groups I and II) included scale for assessment of positive symptoms, scale for assessment of negative symptoms, clinical global impression-schizophrenia and psychotic symptom rating scale. All participants underwent DTI, and quantitative tract-based measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) were obtained for images using DTI studio version-3.0.
RESULTS: All groups were comparable for age, gender, education and severity of illness. Group I had significantly lower FA values in the cingulate gyrus (CG) part of the left CB compared to groups II and III. No significant difference was found between groups II and III.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the disruption in the left CB appears to be specific for AVH-positive schizophrenia. The finding is, however, preliminary subject to replication in future studies. Further investigations are needed to understand its relevance in the context of AVH-positive schizophrenia.

AB  - The standard of care for posterior segment disorders such as wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular oedema and retinal vascular occlusions is pharmacotherapy by intravitreal drug delivery. Since the therapeutic effect of these drugs lasts only around 4 to 8 weeks, repeated intravitreal injections are required. Pain is experienced by the patients during injection as the needle courses through the sclera and choroid. The current work describes the design and development of a novel anodized titanium alloy implant that allows for intravitreal injections through the implant so that the needle transverses only the conjunctiva, thus minimizing discomfort to the patient. Both ex-vivo testing of the implant in enucleated goat's eye as well as in-vivo validation in rabbit eyes was carried out. The implant was placed through pars plana via a minor surgical procedure and was sutured to the sclera and covered with conjunctiva. Subsequent intravitreal injections were administered under topical anaesthesia with a 30-gauge needle through the implant thus delivering the drug into the vitreous cavity. Repeated intravitreal injections were administered every 2 weeks via the implant for 3 months in 4 rabbits. Apart from cataract in 1 rabbit, no complications were observed. There was no evidence of intra-ocular inflammation or infection at final follow-up. Histopathological analysis did not reveal any inflammation or necrosis around the area of implant. The implants were subsequently removed at 5 months and scleral wound was closed with a single suture. The sclera and overlying conjunctiva healed well and no intraocular complications were observed after removal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The definitive diagnosing of ocular tuberculosis (TB) is difficult; therefore, there is a need of better understanding of investigating TB DNA in presumed ocular TB patients.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to correlate tubercular DNA PCR of aqueous/vitreous and blood in cases of presumed ocular TB.
DESIGN: A prospective study.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from aqueous of cases of choroidal tuberculoma (group 1) and serpiginous choroiditis (group 2) and from vitreous of cases of vasculitis (group 3) and macular hole/retinal detachment (group 4). Gel-based PCR and real-time PCR amplification were performed using IS6110 primer on ocular fluids. The same was also performed on the blood samples of cases in which tubercular DNA was detected in the ocular fluids.
RESULTS: Overall, 31 cases were analysed in our study. Tubercular DNA was detected in ocular fluids of seven cases: group 1, two cases (67%); group 2, one case (17%); group 3, four cases (27%); and no case of group 4. Blood samples of six of these seven patients were positive for tubercular DNA. Of these six patients, four had evidence of systemic TB and were on ATT. Two cases had no evidence of active systemic TB, yet PCR was positive from blood and ocular fluids.
CONCLUSION: Tubercular DNA detected from ocular fluids may possibly be due to bystander DNA and may not indicate primary ocular tubercular infection. Thus, caution must be exercised prior to labelling a case of uveitis as being tubercular based on the results of molecular assays on ocular fluids alone. The results of PCR on ocular fluids should be correlated with PCR on blood and systemic findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a rising pandemic in childhood. There is scarcity of evidence on the efficacy of yoga in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese children. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of family-based comprehensive yoga intervention in the reduction of body mass index (BMI) in overweight/obese children, in comparison to standard dietary and lifestyle counselling and control group.
METHODS: This was an open-label randomized controlled study. Children aged 8-15 yr who were overweight or had obesity were randomized to one of the three arms for 18 wk; standard weight management (group 1), yoga with dietary modification (group 2) and control (no intervention; group 3). Reduction in BMI and improvement in physiological, biochemical and psychological parameters from baseline to 18 wk was compared between the three arms. Late follow up was also done at 6-12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 165 children with mean±standard deviation (SD) age of 11.6±1.8 yr and mean BMI 26.3±4.2 kg/m2 were enrolled. Outcome analysis at 18 wk was performed for 109 children. Improved diet quality and reduced intake were observed in both intervention arms. The median (IQR) reduction in BMI in standard and yoga arms was similar [-1.4 (-3.1, -0.5) kg/m2 and -1.2 (-2.3, -0.6) kg/m2, respectively], while it increased by +0.3 (-0.3, 0.1) in the control arm. In the yoga arm, mean systolic BP reduced from 118 (10) to 114 (8) mmHg, (P=0.019). In the standard arm, significant improvement in psychological scores was noted. In group 3, the mean fasting glucose increased from 93±10 to 102±12 mg/dl (P<0.001).
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that yoga in conjunction with dietary modification is equally effective as the standard weight management for BMI reduction in the paediatric age group.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Intra-arterial injections (IA) though rare, cause acute limb ischaemia with often catastrophic outcomes. Symptoms could progress rapidly and early identification and intervention could help in preventing the limb gangrene.
METHODOLOGY: The work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria:Agha RA, Franchi T, Sohrabi C, Mathew G, for the SCARE Group. The SCARE 2020 Guideline: Updating Consensus Surgical CAse REport (SCARE) Guidelines, International Journal of Surgery 2020; 84:226-230. Operative procedure was performed by consultant of general surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: 38-year-old male presented to surgery casualty with history of sudden onset of pain and paraesthesia in the left forearm and palm followed by progressive weakness and discolouration, 15 hours following injection of Diclofenac in the mid cubital region.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: On examination, limb temperature was lower, finger movements were minimal. However, distal pulses were palpable, and duplex ultrasound showed normal triphasic flow. In view of the equivocal clinico-radiological findings, the patient underwent CT-Angiography of upper limb, which showed non-opacification of radial and ulnar arteries. Fasciotomy of forearm, brachial artery exploration and removal of embolus was attempted in a doubtful viable left upper limb. No thrombus was noted. Subsequently, he was managed conservatively, and cervical sympathectomy was done. As there was progressive deterioration in the viability of the limb, the patient underwent an above elbow amputation.
CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial injections can lead to limb threatening gangrene, the course of which can be rapid A multidisciplinary team approach was necessary to arrive at a diagnosis and provide optimum care.

AB  - PURPOSE The aim of the study was to radiolabel, characterize, and perform in vitro and in vivo assessment of Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) tamoxifen for screening ER expressing lesions in breast cancer patients. METHODS In this study, tamoxifen has been radiolabeled with Tc-99m via Tc-99m-tricarbonyl core. The characterization and quality control tests of Tc-99m-tamoxifen were performed. In vitro recep- tor binding and blocking studies were performed in both positive control (MCF-7) and negative control cell lines (MDA-MB-231). Normal biodistribution studies were performed in female Wistar albino rats. The pilot clinical studies were performed in 4 ER-expressing breast cancer patients. Of the 4 patients, 1 was on tamoxifen therapy. All 4 patients had also undergone Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography. RESULTS Tamoxifen was radiolabeled with Tc-99m via Tc-99m-tricarbonyl core with more than 95% radio- chemical yield. Mass spectra showed a peak corresponding to the molecular weight of Tc-99m- tricarbonyl and Tc-99m-tamoxifen. The site of binding of Tc-99m-tricarbonyl with tamoxifen was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The Tc-99m-tamoxifen showed 30% binding with MCF-7 and only 1%-2% receptor binding with MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Also, the percentage of receptor binding was drastically reduced (up to 72%) when ER was saturated with 50 times the excess molar ratio of unlabeled tamoxifen. In a pilot patient study, Tc-99m-tamoxifen uptake was observed in primary and metastatic lesions. However, no uptake was observed in a patient who was on tamoxifen therapy. The uptake of F-18-FDG was noted in all the patients. CONCLUSION Tamoxifen was radiolabeled with an in-house-synthesized Tc-99m-tricarbonyl core. The radio- labeled complex has been characterized and evaluated for receptor specificity in in vitro and in vivo studies. Also, this is the first clinical study using Tc-99m-tamoxifen for imaging ER. More patients need to be evaluated to further explore the role of Tc-99m-tamoxifen in ER-expressing lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sedation improves patient satisfaction, comfort and acceptance of regional anaesthesia. Propofol using bispectral index (BIS)/target-controlled infusion (TCI) system can be an optimal method of sedation, as it combines objective measurement of sedation using BIS along with maintenance of a steady plasma concentration of propofol with the TCI device. The aim of this study was to ascertain the dose and safety of propofol using BIS/TCI system for sedation in patients undergoing surgeries under neuraxial anaesthesia.
METHODS: One hundred and seven adult patients, undergoing elective surgical procedures under spinal or combined spinal epidural anaesthesia, were recruited. Propofol infusion was started with TCI at an initial target plasma concentration (Cpt) of 1.2 μg/mL, and after equilibration between Cpt and effect site concentration (Ce), propofol was then adjusted in increments and/or decrements of 0.2 μg/mL in order to maintain a BIS value between 60 and 80. The average time to reach BIS = 80 after starting infusion was 7.32 ± 3.13 minutes. The objective was to calculate mean Cpt value maintaining BIS between 60 and 80 and to observe recovery time and complications.
RESULTS: Mean Cpt value was 1.13 ± 0.17 mg/mL with 95% confidence interval (1.10-1.16 μg/mL). In 85% of patients, a BIS value of 60-80 was maintained at Cpt ≤ 1.2 μg/mL. No patient had severe complications requiring stoppage of infusion.
CONCLUSION: Propofol sedation using BIS/TCI system can provide safe and convenient sedation during neuraxial anaesthesia at very low plasma concentration, Cpt ≤ 1.2 μg/mL in majority of patients. There were no periprocedural complications, and recovery was rapid.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of conventional (modifiable and non-modifiable) risk factors for hypertension has already been established in the literature. However, there are other putative risk factors specific to women (early menarche, age at first childbirth, women empowerment, number of children born, hysterectomy, etc.) in the development of hypertension. This study is the first study to highlight the potential association of gender-specific factors along with other conventional risk factors and hypertension, using a nationwide sample.
METHODS: The study is a secondary analysis of the data collected from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4), a nationally representative sample of 699,686 women of reproductive age in India. The interview schedule included data on general background characteristics, marriage, reproductive history, hysterectomy, knowledge, and utilization of family planning services, maternal and child care, women empowerment, non-communicable diseases, and domestic violence. The blood pressure was measured by direct observation by the study investigators using a digital blood pressure monitor. To account for disproportionate sampling and non-response, a weighted statistical analysis was performed. Logistic regression analysis was done to study the strength of the association between the risk factors and hypertension (computation of unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio).
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was 11.8% among women. Among the conventional factors, older age, higher body mass index (BMI), tobacco use, and alcohol use had higher odds for hypertension, while higher education, higher socio-economic position, and living in urban areas had lower odds. Among the gender-specific factors, younger age at first childbirth, early menarche, oral contraceptive pill use [adjusted OR: 1.23; (1.18-1.28)], and hysterectomy [adjusted OR: 1.10; (1.05-1.69)] were found to be risk factors for hypertension. Domestic violence was significantly associated with hypertension [unadjusted OR: 1.11; (1.02-1.20)]. Empowered women had lower odds of hypertension [adjusted OR: 0.93; (0.95-1.03)].
CONCLUSION: Significant association of these gender-specific factors among women necessitates the need for taking into account these factors while screening for hypertension among women and thus, designing a tailored model better suited to them for risk assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cellular and molecular mechanisms of the events that help spermatozoa acquire their fertilizing capability during capacitation and acrosome reaction are not completely understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study was performed with a postulation that the identification of sperm proteins and their changes during in vitro capacitation and acrosome reaction will unravel unknown molecular aspects of fertilization that impact male fertility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spermatozoa collected from sequential conditions, that is, separation of ejaculated spermatozoa by Percoll gradient centrifugation, in vitro capacitation, and acrosome reaction were processed for tandem mass spectrometric analysis, followed by protein identification, label-free quantitation, and statistical analysis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Collectively, a total of 1088 sperm proteins were identified. In comparison to ejaculated spermatozoa, 44 and 141 proteins were differentially expressed in capacitated and acrosome reacted spermatozoa, respectively. A large number of proteins were found downregulated, including clusterin, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component, semenogelin-1 and 2, heat shock protein 90, beta-microseminoprotein, and keratin. It was expected as sperm-membrane-associated proteins are removed during capacitation. There were significant proteomic alterations in asthenozoospermia compared to normozoospermia; however, variation was more noticeable among proteins of acrosome reacted spermatozoa and those released during the acrosome reaction. The processes enriched among downregulated proteins in asthenozoospermia included acrosome assembly, binding of spermatozoa to zona pellucida, nucleosome assembly, flagellated sperm motility, protein folding, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, chromatin silencing, gluconeogenesis, glycolytic process, and glycolysis.
CONCLUSION: The dynamic information generated about proteomic alterations in spermatozoa during capacitation and acrosome reaction and their variability in asthenozoospermia will contribute not only to enhancing our understanding of processes that prepare spermatozoa to acquire fertilization capability but also help in deciphering novel factors of male infertility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media use in neurosurgery remains an understudied phenomenon. Our study aims to examine the global membership and engagement of the prominent Neurosurgery Cocktail Facebook group with over 25,000 neurosurgeons and trainees worldwide, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Neurosurgery Cocktail's numbers of members, posts, comments, and reactions were collected from December 2019 to November 2020. Anonymized aggregate data of members' characteristics, including age, sex, and country of origin in November 2020, were also obtained. The most engaging posts in November 2020 were categorized into topics by a majority consensus of 3 reviewers.
RESULTS: The average number of members steadily increased from 21,266 in December 2019 to 25,218 in November 2020. In November 2020, 18.8% of members were women, and 71.3% were between 25-44 years old. With members from 100 countries, 77.9% are from low- and middle-income countries, with the highest representation from India, Egypt, and Brazil. After the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, daily engagement peaked in April 2020 with a daily average of 41.63 posts, 336.4 comments, and 1914.6 reactions before returning to pre-pandemic levels. Among the 99 top posts in November 2020, the majority (56.5%) were classified as "interesting cases," with "education-related" as the second-most common topic (16.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery Cocktail has shown steady growth since its creation. The COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with a spike in activity without lasting impact. The group demonstrates social media's potential for knowledge exchange and promoting organic international collaborations.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ultrasound-guided transversalis fascia plane block (USG-guided TFPB) has recently been evaluated for post-caesarean acute pain management. We compared it with standard wound infiltration for both acute and chronic post-caesarean pain management.
METHODS: All patients undergoing caesarean section (CS) under subarachnoid block were included and randomised. Patients in group C received standard wound infiltration (20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine) and group-T received bilateral USG-guided TFPB (20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine) at the end of the surgery. Acute pain assessed using numeric rating scale (NRS), time to first request of analgesia and total rescue analgesic consumption in 24 hours. The incidence of chronic persistent post-surgical pain (CPSP), neuropathic pain component and quality of life (QoL) were assessed. Fisher's exact test, Chi-square test, unpaired Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were included with 30 in each group. NRS score on rest at 6th and 24th hour and on active movement at 1st hour was significantly decreased in group T. The "time to first request of analgesia" was statistically higher in group T, that is, 10.77 ± 1.39 h versus 6.30 ± 1.60 h. Five (16.6%) and two (6.6%) patients in groups C and T, respectively, required rescue analgesia in first 24 hours. 30% (n = 6) and 10% (n = 2) patients in groups C and T, respectively, developed CPSP. The neuropathic pain component was significantly reduced and QoL was significantly improved in group T.
CONCLUSION: TFPB is efficacious for management of both acute and chronic post-caesarean pain management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are relevant therapeutic targets in the treatment of lung cancer. Germline susceptibility variants that influence these RTKs may provide new insights into their regulation.  rs9387478 is located in the genomic interval between two RTK-genes ROS1/DCBLD1, of which ROS1 alterations are implicated in lung carcinogenesis and treatment response while the latter remains poorly understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Venous blood was drawn from 100 control and 231 case subjects. Genotype was scored by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), PCR amplification followed by HindIII digestion. Logistic regression was applied to compare the association between variables. Survival curve was plotted to draw a correlation between the genotype and overall survival. Also, eQTL and chromatin state changes were analyzed and correlated with the survival of patients using available datasets.
RESULTS: In our population smoking correlated significantly with lung cancer [OR= 2.607] with the presence of the minor allele 'A' enhancing the nicotine dependence [CA (OR=3.23)]. Individuals with homozygous risk allele 'A' had a higher chance of developing lung cancer [OR=2.65] than individuals with CA/CC implying a recessive model of association. Patients with CC/CA genotype had better overall survival than patients with AA genotype [161 days/142 days vs 54 days, p=0.005]. The homozygous risk allele was significantly associated with increased DCBLD1 and ROS1 expression in lung cancer, with enriched active histone marks due to the polymorphism. Interestingly, increased DCBLD1 expression was associated with poor outcomes in lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our study provides strong evidence that rs9387478 is significantly associated with both nicotine dependence and lung cancer in our North Indian cohort. The association of the SNP with prognostic genes, DCBLD1 and ROS1 make rs9387478 a promising prognostic marker in the North Indian population. The results obtained are significant, however, the study needs to be performed in a larger sample size.

AB  - Radiation therapy, either used alone or in combination with surgery and or chemotherapy, is the most commonly utilized modality for treating head and neck cancers. Patients undergoing radiation therapy usually experience significant early and late-onset toxicities/adverse effects. Radiation-related caries (RRC) is a common complication that detrimentally affects patients' quality of life (QoL). A clearer understanding and more uniform approach to scoring systems help provide a more accurate diagnosis, form treatment protocols, plan, and evaluate outcomes of preventive initiatives and create scientific databases. Many indices have been used to assess and quantify the dental caries experience after radiotherapy. Considering the need for uniform standards for measuring radiation caries, indices specific to radiation caries have been proposed in the literature to capture postradiation damage to the dentition accurately. This narrative review aims to consolidate the evolution of different indices used for scoring RRC to improve the understanding of radiation caries assessment.

AB  - Iron deficiency (ID) with or without anemia is frequently observed in patients with heart failure (HF). Uncorrected ID is associated with higher hospitalization and mortality in patients with acute HF (AHF) and chronic HF (CHF). Hence, in addition to chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, and diabetes, ID appears as a novel comorbidity and a treatment target of CHF. Intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) reduces the hospitalization risk due to HF worsening and improves functional capacity and quality of life (QOL) in HF patients. The current consensus document provides criteria, an expert opinion on the diagnosis of ID in HF, patient profiles for IV FCM, and correct administration and monitoring of such patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Midlife women undergoing menopausal transition are predisposed to weight gain. Weight gain in midlife is driven by two modifiable risk factors: menopausal symptom's severity and lifestyle practices. The independent and interactive nature of menopausal symptoms and lifestyle practices as risk factors of weight gain has not been investigated yet. This study was undertaken to study menopausal symptoms and lifestyle practices as risk factors for weight gain in midlife women and identify midlife -related barriers in managing corrective lifestyle practices.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, menopausal symptom severity and lifestyle practices such as diet, exercise, and sleep were assessed using a pre-validated and reliable questionnaire on a convenience sample of midlife women (43-55 years) via an interview schedule. The association of lifestyle practices and its barriers with socio-demographics and menopausal symptoms were analysed.
RESULT: A total of 504 women (mean age: 47.3 ± 4.1 years) were recruited. More than half of them followed corrective dietary practices, but only one-fourth engaged in moderate-intensity exercises. Total menopausal symptom severity was associated with increased food intake (P < 0.001), joint pain with limited physical activity and hot flashes and emotional volatility with sleep disturbances (P < 0.01). Demographic variables such as education, economic and employment status were associated with unhealthy lifestyle practices.
CONCLUSION: Assessment of menopausal symptoms and lifestyle practices as risk factors and associated barriers must be the pivotal component to devise comprehensive women-centric weight management modules. Similar studies should be carried out in future when there is no clear effect of COVID19 on lifestyle factors.

AB  - A 6-year-old girl presented with a difficult to control epilepsy syndrome. On evaluation, additional presyncope episodes associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were also noted. A diagnosis of early repolarization syndrome (ERS) was made with an early repolarization pattern on electrocardiogram, documented VT episodes, and clinical presyncope (proposed Shanghai score 7). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was also noted on 24-h Holter recordings. The child was stabilized with isoprenaline infusion and was later discharged with arrhythmia control on quinidine and cilostazol. The genetic evaluation revealed a potassium channel KCND3 gene missense mutation. The case highlights the association of epilepsy syndrome and AF with ERS; the possible association of KCND3 gene mutation with a malignant phenotype; and management issues in a small child.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary arterial compliance, the dynamic component of pulmonary vasculature, remains inadequately studied in patients with left to right shunts. We sought to study the pulmonary arterial compliance in patients with left to right shunt lesions and its utility in clinical decision-making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-centre retrospective study, we reviewed cardiac catheterisation data of consecutive patients of left to right shunt lesions catheterised over one year. In addition to the various other parameters, pulmonary arterial compliance was calculated, as indexed pulmonary flow (Qpi) / (Heart rate × pulse pressure in the pulmonary artery). RC time was also calculated, as the product of pulmonary arterial compliance and pulmonary vascular resistance index. Patients were divided into "operable," "borderline," and "inoperable" based on the decision of the treating team, and the pulmonary arterial compliance values were evaluated in these groups to study if it can be utilised to refine the operability decision.
RESULTS: 298 patients (Median age 16 years, 56% <18 years) with various acyanotic shunt lesions were included. Overall, the pulmonary arterial compliance varied with Qpi, pulmonary artery mean pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance index, but did not vary with age, type of lesion, or transpulmonary gradients. The median pulmonary arterial compliance in patients with normal pulmonary artery pressure (Mean pulmonary artery pressure less than 20 mmHg) was 4.1 ml/mmHg/m2 (IQR 3.2). The median pulmonary arterial compliance for operable patients was 2.67 ml/mmHg/m2 (IQR 2.2). Median pulmonary arterial compliance was significantly lower in both inoperable (0.52 ml/mmHg/m2, IQR 0.34) and borderline (0.80 ml/mmHg/m2, IQR 0.36) groups when compared to operable patients (p < 0.001). A pulmonary arterial compliance value lower than 1.18 ml/mmHg/m2 identified inoperable patients with high sensitivity and specificity (95%, AUC 0.99). However, in borderline cases, assessment by this value did not agree with empirical clinical assessment.The median RC time for the entire study population was 0.47 S (IQR 0.30). RC time in operable patients was significantly lower than that in the inoperable patients (Median 0.40 IQR 0.23 in operable, 0.73 0.25 in inoperable patients (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of pulmonary arterial compliance to the routine haemodynamic assessment of patients with shunt lesions may improve our understanding of the pulmonary circulation and may have clinical utility.

TI  - Fire Safety Related Challenges Faced by Existing Hospitals: A Review
AU  - Mohammad, Kausar
T2  - Medico-Legal Update
AB  - Background: Hospital fires are real dangers and have historically caused life and property damages. A review of major research databases like Scopus, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, IET site, PubMed, Cochrane library and ASCE Library was conducted to explore fire safety challenges faced by existing hospitals and possible recommendations made thereof to overcome such challenges. Methods: The review was conducted for key words- “Fire safety”, “Hospital Fire”, “Fire risk” and “Fire safety challenges”. The search found 684 articles in total which were screened for relevance to research area and 27 articles were reviewed in detail. Findings: There is poor enforcement of law by agencies. Retrofitting for conformance to fire safety regulations is difficult. Issue like faulty equipment, improperly kept inflammable material, evacuation difficulties due to higher acuity of patients, operational issues like maintenance of all fire safety equipment and installations, and training of staff, etc. are highlighted. Conclusion: Focussed interventions and an all-encompassing fire safety risk management plan is the need of the hour. Significant insights into critical issue of fire safety is of immense benefit to healthcare professionals as a basis to make hospitals safe places.

AU  - Choudhary, Mamta
AU  - Lakshmanan, Gopichandran
AU  - Kp, Jyotishana
AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing professionals along with other health-care workers worked as the pillars of the health-care system. There have been difficult times when nursing professionals have overworked despite shortage of resources, continuously wearing PPE over hours, and overfilled intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, while confronting the numerous COVID-19-related challenges, nursing professionals might have experienced anxiety and utilized various coping strategies to reduce their anxiety. Methods: The cross-sectional survey was conducted using a web-based questionnaire. Information was collected from 200 nursing personnel's working in the COVID ICU of a selected tertiary care hospital. The questionnaire used for data collection comprised three sections: the first section focused on sociodemographic profile of subjects, the second section included the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and the third included Brief COPE. Results: The result revealed that majority, 61%, of the subjects had no COVID-19-related anxiety, whereas 33.5% of subjects had mild-to-moderate COVID-19-related anxiety. However, only 5.5% of the subject reported marked-to-severe form of COVID-19-related anxiety. The highest anxiety scores were identified for items: (1) I get feelings of numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes, (2) I feel weak and get tired easily, and (3) I have nightmares. To cope up with anxiety, majority of nursing professionals' approach "praying or meditating" coping style mechanism followed by positive reframing and planning. Conclusions: COVID-19 is causing mild-to-moderate anxiety in a significant number of nursing professionals. Thus, the hospital administration and nurse managers should focus on early screening for anxiety, providing psychological support to nurses, and training ineffective coping strategies.

T2  - Journal of Cardiac Critical Care TSS
AB  - Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a powerful physiological vasoconstrictor release in response to endothelial injury. Increased synthesis of endothelin is associated with myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. The normal level varies between 0.2 and 18.5 pg/mL that maintains normal vascular homeostasis. We hypothesized that there exists a correlation between ET-1 and clinical outcome in patient undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass.
Fifty-eight patients undergoing elective on-pump CABG were enrolled in the study. Blood sample for plasma ET-1 was taken before anesthesia induction. The median ET-1 level was 5 pg/mL (range: 0.6–30.33 pg/mL). The inotropic and intraaortic balloon pump requirement was significantly higher among patients having baseline ET-1 level more than 14.24pg/mL ( p = 0.001in each case). A similar finding was observed in the duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and duration of hospital stay ( r = 0.68, p = 0.000; r = 0.58, p = 0.000; and r = 0.61, p = 0.000 respectively). The occurrence of complications was also more in individuals with higher baseline ET-1 level. The p -value was significant for occurrence infection, arrhythmia, renal and respiratory problems as observed in postoperative period by using Mann–Whitney U test.
This study concludes that higher level of preoperative ET-1 levels correlates well to adverse clinical outcome in patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery, so herein it can be used as a single independent parameter to predict postoperative outcome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gene expression profile of mitochondrial-related genes is not well deciphered in pediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We aimed to identify mitochondria-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pediatric AML with their prognostic significance.
METHODS: Children with de novo AML were included prospectively between July 2016-December 2019. Transcriptomic profiling was done for a subset of samples, stratified by mtDNA copy number. Top mitochondria-related DEGs were identified and validated by real-time PCR. A prognostic gene signature risk score was formulated using DEGs independently predictive of overall survival (OS) in multivariable analysis. Predictive ability of the risk score was estimated along with external validation in The Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML dataset.
RESULTS: In 143 children with AML, twenty mitochondria-related DEGs were selected for validation, of which 16 were found to be significantly dysregulated. Upregulation of SDHC (p<0.001), CLIC1 (p=0.013) and downregulation of SLC25A29 (p<0.001) were independently predictive of inferior OS, and included for developing prognostic risk score. The risk score model was independently predictive of survival over and above ELN risk categorization (Harrell's c-index: 0.675). High-risk patients (risk score above median) had significantly inferior OS (p<0.001) and event free survival (p<0.001); they were associated with poor-risk cytogenetics (p=0.021), ELN intermediate/poor risk group (p=0.016), absence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (p=0.027), and not attaining remission (p=0.016). On external validation, the risk score also predicted OS (p=0.019) in TCGA dataset.
DISCUSSION: We identified and validated mitochondria-related DEGs with prognostic impact in pediatric AML and also developed a novel 3-gene based externally validated gene signature predictive of survival.

T2  - Molecular Human Reproduction
AB  - Epigenetic changes alter the expression of genes at both pre- and post-transcriptional levels without changing their DNA sequence. Accumulating evidence suggests that such changes can modify cellular behavior and characteristics required during development and in response to various extracellular stimuli. Trophoblast cells develop from the outermost trophectoderm layer of the blastocyst and undergo many phenotypic changes as the placenta develops. One such phenotypic change is differentiation of the epithelial natured cytotrophoblasts into the mesenchymal natured extravillous trophoblasts. The extravillous trophoblasts are primarily responsible for invading into the maternal decidua and thus establishing connection with the maternal spiral arteries. Any dysregulation of this process can have adverse effects on the pregnancy outcome. Hence, tight regulation of this epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for successful pregnancy. This review summarizes the recent research on the epigenetic regulation of the EMT occurring in the trophoblast cells during placental development. The functional significance of chemical modifications of DNA and histone, which regulate transcription, as well as non-coding RNAs, which control gene expression post-transcriptionally, is discussed in relation to trophoblast biology.

AB  - Background: 
          Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that progressively leads to joint destruction and functional disability which eventually affects the quality of life of the people suffering from it. Deleted in malignant brain tumor 1 (DMBT1) role has been explored in progression of Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) and other autoimmune diseases, whereas it has yet to be reported in RA. In this study, we have analyzed and evaluated the expression of DMBT1 protein and the dmbt1 genes’ methylation status in healthy volunteers, RA, and SS patients.
          Methods: 
          In the present investigation, the case–control study of 25 healthy volunteers and 17 RA- and 10 SS-confirmed patients was performed.
          Results: 
          It was observed that the concentration of DMBT1 protein in saliva decreases in both the disease conditions compared to healthy volunteers, while methylation status of dmbt1 gene was low in both patient cohorts in comparison to the healthy controls.
          Conclusion: 
          Results obtained from this study indicate that DMBT1 protein has the potential to qualify as a specific salivary biomarker as identified in RA and SS patients. DMBT1 protein can therefore be explored further as a noninvasive tool for diagnosis and prognosis.

AB  - Most of the patients with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) also known as sleep disordered breathing are not diagnosed before undergoing any cardiac interventional procedure. Many of them can safely undergo outpatient procedure under sedation or anesthesia. Few of them with moderate to severe grade of SAS, who are not optimized medically, may create problem and need special consideration. We managed three such cases in cardiac catheterization laboratory; two of them were not diagnosed before. The periprocedural problems we faced in these patients are narrated in this article along with review of literature. Some suggestions for management of such patients undergoing therapeutic cardiac catheterization are also highlighted.

The PubMed, PUBMED Central, PMC databases & Scopus followed by Google (Scholar & search engine) were systematically interrogated with the keywords TWIST score, testis and testicular torsion. Fourteen sets of data (n = 1940) from 13 studies were included; data from 7 studies (giving a detailed score-wise break-up) (n = 1285) were dis-integrated and re-integrated to tweak the cut-offs for low and high risk.
RESULTS: For every 4 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute scrotum, one patient will eventually be diagnosed with TT. The mean TWIST score was higher in patients with testicular torsion (5.13 ± 1.53 vs 1.50 ± 1.40 for those without TT). TWIST score can be used to predict testicular torsion at cut-off of 5 with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 0.71 (0.66, 0.75; 95%CI), 0.97 (0.97, 0.98; 95%CI), 90.2%, 91.0%, and 90.9% respectively. While the slider for cut-off was shifted from 4 to 7, there was a rise in specificity and PPV of the test with a corresponding decline in sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy. The sensitivity witnessed a sharp decline from 0.86 (0.81-0.90; 95%CI) @ cut-off 4 to 0.18 (0.14-0.23; 95%CI) @ cut-off 7. The area under the SROC curve for cut-off 5 was more than that for cut-offs 4, 6 & 7. TWIST cut-off of 2 may be used to predict the absence of testicular torsion with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 0.76 (0.74, 0.78; 95%CI), 0.95 (0.93, 0.97; 95%CI), 97.9%, 56.5%, and 80.7%, respectively. While the cut-off is lowered from 3 to 0, there is a corresponding rise in the specificity and PPV, while the sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy are compromised. The sensitivity witnesses a sharp decline from 91 to 35%. The area under the SROC curve for cut-off 2 was more than that for cut-off @ 0, 1 or 3. The sum of sensitivity and specificity of TWIST scoring system to ascertain the diagnosis of TT is more than 1.5 for cut-off values 4 & 5 only. The sum of sensitivity and specificity of TWIST scoring system to confirm the absence of TT is more than 1.5 for cut-off values 3 & 2 only.
CONCLUSION: TWIST is a relatively simple, flexible, and objective tool which may be swiftly administered even by the para-medical personnel in the ED. The overlapping clinical presentation of diseases originating from the same organ may prevent TWIST from absolutely establishing or refuting the diagnosis of TT in all the patients with acute scrotum. The proposed cut-offs are a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Yet, the TWIST scoring system is immensely helpful in the clinical decision-making process and saves time-lag associated with investigations in a significant majority of patients.

AB  - Glioblastoma is a highly infiltrative neoplasm with a high propensity of recurrence. The location of recurrence usually cannot be anticipated and depends on various factors, including the surgical resection margins. Currently, radiation planning utilizes the hyperintense signal from T2-FLAIR MRI and is delivered to a limited area defined by standardized guidelines. To this end, noninvasive early prediction and delineation of recurrence can aid in tailored targeted therapy, which may potentially delay the relapse, consequently improving overall survival. In this work, we hypothesize that radiomics-based phenotypic quantifiers may support the detection of recurrence before it is visualized on multimodal MRI. We employ retrospective longitudinal data from 29 subjects with a varying number of time points (three to 13) that includes glioblastoma recurrence. Voxelwise textural and intensity features are computed from multimodal MRI (T1-contrast enhanced [T1CE], FLAIR, and apparent diffusion coefficient), primarily to gain insights into longitudinal radiomic changes from preoperative MRI to recurrence and subsequently to predict the region of relapse from 143 ± 42 days before recurrence using machine learning. T1CE MRI first-order and gray-level co-occurrence matrix features are crucial in detecting local recurrence, while multimodal gray-level difference matrix and first-order features are highly predictive of the distant relapse, with a voxelwise test accuracy of 80.1% for distant recurrence and 71.4% for local recurrence. In summary, our work exemplifies a step forward in predicting glioblastoma recurrence using radiomics-based phenotypic changes that may potentially serve as MR-based biomarkers for customized therapeutic intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of combination treatment of topiramate and greater occipital nerve block to topiramate monotherapy in adult chronic migraine patients.
BACKGROUND: Options for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine are limited and costly. Combination treatments do not have an evidence base yet.
METHODS: This was a parallel group, 3 arms with 1:1:1 allocation ratio randomized controlled study in consecutive adult chronic migraine patients attending Headache Clinic in a tertiary care hospital. Patients received either topiramate monotherapy 100 mg/day (group A), or topiramate plus greater occipital nerve block with 40 mg lidocaine (2%) and 80mg (2 ml) methylprednisolone as the first injection followed by monthly injections of lidocaine for the next 2 months (group B) or topiramate plus greater occipital nerve block with 40 mg lidocaine (2%) injections monthly for 3 months (group C). The primary endpoint was the mean change in monthly migraine days at Month 3. Multiple secondary endpoints were assessed that included among others, achievement of ≥50% reduction in mean monthly headache days compared to baseline at Month 3 and assessment for any adverse events.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five patients were randomized; 41 to group A, 44 to group B, and 40 to group C. Efficacy assessments were done for 121 patients. Patients receiving combination treatment of topiramate and greater occipital nerve block with steroids and lidocaine and greater occipital nerve block with only lidocaine compared to topiramate monotherapy showed greater reductions in monthly migraine days at Month 3 (-9.6 vs -7.3 days; p = 0.003) and (-10.1 vs -7.3 days; p < 0.001) respectively. Greater proportion of patients in both the combination treatment groups (added greater occipital nerve block with and without steroid) achieved ≥50% reduction in mean monthly headache days [71.4% vs 39%; OR (95% CI) 3.9(1.6-9.8); p = 0.004] and [62.4% vs 39%; OR (95% CI) 2.7(1.1-6.7); p = 0.034] respectively, compared to those receiving topiramate monotherapy. Adverse effects between the groups were comparable although patients receiving combination treatment with added greater occipital nerve block reported transient adverse effects like post-injection dizziness, local site swelling, and pain. No serious adverse event was reported.
CONCLUSION: Combination treatments of topiramate with monthly injections of greater occipital nerve block were more effective in reducing monthly migraine days in chronic migraine than topiramate monotherapy at Month 3. Combination treatments were well tolerated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Greater occipital nerve blockade for the prevention of chronic migraine has a limited evidence base. A robust randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is needed.
METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, following a baseline period of four weeks, randomly assigned patients of chronic migraine 1:1 to receive four-weekly bilateral greater occipital nerve blockade with either 2 ml of 2% (40 mg) lidocaine (active group) or 2 ml of 0.9% saline (placebo) injections for 12 weeks. The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were a change from the baseline in the mean number of headache and migraine days and the achievement of ≥50% reduction in headache days from baseline across the weeks 9-12 respectively. Safety evaluations included the documentation and reporting of serious and other adverse events.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients each were randomly allocated to the active and placebo group. Baseline demography and clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. Mean headache and migraine days at baseline (±SD) were 23.4 ± 4.4 and 15.6 ± 5.7 days in the active group and 22.6 ± 5.0 and 14.6 ± 4.6 days in the placebo group respectively. The active group compared to the placebo had a significantly greater least-squares mean reduction in the number of headache and migraine days (-4.2 days [95% CI: -7.5 to -0.8; p  =  0.018] and -4.7 days [95%CI: -7.7 to -1.7; p = 0.003] respectively). 40.9% of patients in the active group achieved ≥50% reduction in headache days as compared with 9.1% of patients receiving a placebo (p = 0.024). Overall, 64 mild and transient adverse events were reported by 16 patients in the active group and 15 in the placebo. No death or serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: Four-weekly greater occipital nerve blockade with 2% lidocaine for 12 weeks was superior to placebo in decreasing the average number of headache and migraine days in patients with chronic migraine with a good tolerability profile.Clinical trial.gov no. CTRI 2020/07/026709.
